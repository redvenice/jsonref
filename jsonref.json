A green traffic light with a portrait of German composer Ludwig van Beethoven is pictured in his native city of Bonn,Beethoven, Germany\u0027s most famous musical figure, is so loved in his homeland that a duty to prepare for the anniversary was written into the governing coalition\u0027s agreement in 2013.The year of celebrations begins on December 16 - believed to be his 249th birthday - with the opening of his home in Bonn as a museum after extensive renovation.Beethoven began working on the Tenth Symphony alongside his Ninth, which includes the world-famous \u0027Ode To Joy\u0027.But he quickly gave up on the Tenth, leaving only a few notes and drafts by the time he died aged 57.In the project, machine-learning software has been fed all of Beethoven\u0027s work and is now composing possible continuations of the symphony in the composer\u0027s style.Deutsche Telekom, which is sponsoring the project, hopes to use the findings to develop technology such as voice recognition.The team said the first results a few months ago were seen as too mechanical and repetitive but the latest AI compositions have been more promising.Barry Cooper, a British composer and musicologist who himself wrote a hypothetical first movement for the Tenth Symphony in 1988, was more doubtful.\u0027I listened to a short excerpt that has been created. It did not sound remotely like a convincing reconstruction of what Beethoven intended,\u0027 said Cooper, a professor at the University of Manchester and the author of several works on Beethoven.\u0027There is, however, scope for improvement with further work.\u0027Cooper warned that \u0027in any performance of Beethoven\u0027s music, there is a risk of distorting his intentions\u0027 but this was particularly the case for the Tenth Symphony as the German composer had left only fragmentary material.Similar AI experiments based on works by Bach, Mahler and Schubert have been less than impressive.A project earlier this year to complete Schubert\u0027s Eighth Symphony was seen by some reviewers as being closer to an American film soundtrack than the Austrian composer\u0027s work. "},{"url":null,"title":"Emmanuel Macrons friendship Finlands new PM Sanna Marin continues blossom EU summit","story":"Share this article          Marin, the world\u0027s youngest Prime Minister was also seen mingling with Germany\u0027s Angela Merkel, Denmark\u0027s Mette Frederiksen (pictured with Marin and Macron) and Belgium\u0027s Sophie Wilmes today She was also seen mingling with the likes of Germany\u0027s Angela Merkel, Romania\u0027s Klaus Iohannis, Denmark\u0027s Mette Frederiksen and Belgium\u0027s Sophie Wilmes in the lobby of the Europa building. The two-day summit will see leaders discuss climate change, the EU budget, Brexit, Russian sanctions and the euro zone.Marin said: \u0027The ambitious climate goals that we have to take - the new generations are expecting us to act and we have to fulfil the expectations of the people.

However, its crown jewel is the Mail titles, including the Mail on Sunday, Daily Mail and Mail Online, which have been intensely critical of Soros because of his donations to liberal causes.Soros has become a hate figure among some sections of the political right wing in Europe and the US. His vilification has included outright conspiracy theories from figures including the Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, and the Hungarian leader, Viktor Orbán. Orbán has sought to portray Soros as an enemy of the country in which he was born and shut down a university partly funded by the investor.In February 2018 the Daily Mail published a front-page story headlined “Fury over billionaire’s plot to sabotage Brexit” featuring a picture of Soros, 89. The story was based on Soros’s donations to the Best for Britain group, which is campaigning for the UK to remain in the EU, and followed a front-page Daily  story that led to accusations of the use of antisemitic tropes.In June 2017 a Mail story ran an article reporting criticism of Soros as a “puppetmaster” who “successfully manufactured Europe’s migration crisis”. The same article said Soros was “public enemy number one of nationalists around the globe”.Paul Dacre, the editor under whom many anti-Soros articles were run, remains as the chairman and editor-in-chief of Associated Newspapers, the DMGT subsidiary that controls the Mail titles, although the title is not widely regarded as an active editorial role.It is the first time that Soros’s fund has bet against DMGT or any other consumer publisher in the EU since investors were first forced to report short positions in 2012, according to Breakout Point, a short-tracking data service, which first reported the bet. However, the majority of the short positions that it must report are in the UK, Breakout Point said.Short sellers borrow shares from their owners and then sell them on, in the expectation that the price will fall. They then make a profit, having pocketed the proceeds from that sale, if they are able to buy the shares back at a cheaper price when they return them to their original owner.DMGT declined to comment.

She did not comment on whether the two sides had reached an agreement or the terms of any deal.US media reported on Thursday that an agreement “in principle” had been reached that would see the US roll back some of the tariffs on $360bn of Chinese goods in exchange for Chinese commitments to buy US agricultural products and other concessions.But Beijing’s muted response raised questions about whether an agreement had been reached. Speaking at a symposium in Beijing, China’s minister of foreign affairs, Wang Yi, did not mention the negotiations.Instead, he took the occasion to criticise the US for having “seriously damaged the hard-won mutual trust” between the two countries. Wang said the US had “slandered” China by criticising it over its policies in Hong Kong and Xinjiang.“We will never accept the so-called unilateral sanctions and any acts of bullying,” he said.Donald Trump was expected to release a statement on Friday. Reuters previously reported that the two sides were still formulating a written agreement.For the last year-and-a-half, Beijing and Washington have been locked in a tit-for-tat trade war that has inflicted pain in both economies, caused market uncertainty, and slowed global growth.In October, the White House said a “phase one” deal had been reached and the two sides have been negotiating over the details since then.Trade experts say that not suspending Sunday’s tariffs on consumer goods, from videogames to shoes and computer monitors, would result in more retaliatory tariffs from the Chinese side. Further trade talks are likely to be suspended until after the US presidential election in November.In September, China imposed tariffs US goods including soybeans, pork and beef, and chemicals, with another tranche to begin on 15 December, totalling $75bn. China was also planning on reinstating tariffs on US vehicles and auto parts that it had previously suspended.Critics say striking a deal now negates the last year and a half of pressure on China to reform practices that give its businesses an unfair advantage.The US senator Marco Rubio wrote on Twitter that the deal would “give away the tariff leverage needed for a broader agreement on the issues that matter the most such as sub­sidies to do­mes­tic firms, forced tech transfers \u0026amp blocking US firms access to key sectors”.The trade war has been a key part of worsening relations between Beijing and Washington, at their lowest point in decades. Some observers believe a trade deal would help prevent ties from deteriorating further.The US recently signed into law a bill that would sanction Chinese and Hong Kong officials deemed responsible for the suppression of freedoms in Hong Kong.

Workers rigged computer systems to add an extra 60p of costs on to every £1,000 sent abroad through bank transfers, the  reported.While they did not personally pocket the cash, a group of fewer than 10 employees involved in the rigging were able to claim bonuses linked to inflated earnings by their department. All of those employees have since left the bank.It is believed to be the first case of foreign exchange rigging of this kind among UK banks.RBS reportedly made the discovery while investigating a separate foreign exchange manipulation scandal. It launched the compensation scheme of its own accord rather than being told to do so by the City watchdog, although the regulators have been informed.It is the first scandal to emerge after the appointment of RBS boss, Alison Rose, who took over from Ross McEwan at the start of November.Rose was expected to oversee an institution with fewer legal problems after the bank reached a $4.9bn (£3.8bn) settlement with US authorities and the City watchdog confirmed it would not punish it for mistreating business customers following the financial crash.An RBS spokeswoman said: “We are proactively refunding the difference, with interest, for incorrect foreign exchange rates that were applied to some international payments for certain customers between 2010 and 2014.“We identified and addressed the source of the incorrect exchange rates in 2014, and put in place additional checks and controls to prevent this happening again. We apologise to those customers impacted.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af5a6a87dd49546a8dfc890301afb90410272577/0_746_3264_1958/master/3264.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b5a632c5dd6dee4a416782a07ddee6e1","title":"relief as philip green secures 310m deal for topshop mortgage","story":"US private equity company saves Arcadia Group from refinancing problemsSir Philip Green has secured a last-ditch £310m mortgage deal for his flagship Topshop store on Oxford Street in London with the US private equity company Apollo Management International.The deal will be a relief to Green’s family business, which owns Arcadia Group, the parent company of high street brands including Miss Selfridge, Wallis and Evans, which had said difficulties in refinancing the loan could mean it would have to raise new funds to survive.The loan, provided in 2014 by a syndicate of banks led by Royal Bank of Scotland, had been due to expire in June this year but was extended to December as part of a restructuring deal agreed earlier in 2019.While the agreement with Apollo provides a firmer footing for Green’s retail empire, the specialist lender is likely to have demanded a higher rate of interest than a high street bank.

Photojournalist Anthony Micallef took a whistlestop tour More than 3 million visitors a year flock to the Window of the World theme park in the megacity of Shenzhen to see 130 copies of the world’s largest tourist sites gathered in a single place.For Chinese tourists who may not be able to travel out of the country this is their only chance of seeing the New York skyline, the pyramids of Giza or the Taj Mahal – or smaller replicas of them, at least.The visit typically begins at the metro station, modelled in the shape of the Louvre pyramid in Paris, designed by Chinese-American architect IM Pei. Most tourists then head for the nearby splendours of European architecture: the Acropolis of Athens, the Palace of Versailles, Buckingham Palace and Tower Bridge from London, or Italy’s Leaning Tower of Pisa.Moving to Asia, the Angkor Wat temple is always popular with visitors. The Hindu temple complex in Cambodia is the largest religious monument in the world, although the copy here is somewhat smaller. Mount Fuji and the Iranian city of Persepolis are also packed with visitors. A few hundred metres further on, Sydney Opera House is a step or two from the sacred sandstone rock of Uluru.Next up is the Manhattan skyline, Rio de Janeiro’s Christ the Redeemer statue, and the monumental stone figures of Easter Island – all without ever leaving Shenzhen.Many visitors buy a fake passport which the theme park hostesses will stamp with as many foreign visas as you want.The theme park also offers boat trips down the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon, and a cable car ride across the Amazon rain forest. If you want to cool down there is a climate-controlled indoor ski centre with 4,000 sq m of artificial snow slopes.If you look closely, many of the reproductions appear a little kitsch and the decor outdated. Some visitors complain a few need a new paint job, or even a total rebuild.But putting aside aesthetic disappointments, the park does allow the visitor to learn a lot about the real sites and their histories. I emerge knowing that the Moscow Kremlin was first a residence of the tsars, then of the leaders of the USSR, and is nowadays the official residence of Russia’s President Putin.I learn that the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Assumption of Pisa is located in Piazza dei Miracoli, which is a Unesco world heritage site that includes the famous leaning tower. Finally, we learn that the gate of Ishtar in Iraq was one of the eight gates of Babylon, built in 580BC on the orders of King Nebuchadnezzar II and dedicated to the goddess Ishtar.Many tourists at the Shenzhen park come from modest backgrounds. Some cannot afford international travel and others are forbidden to leave the country because their “citizen score” is too low. Often they are seeing representations of these monuments for the first time.The park is unrealistic to say the least: in truth the presidents on Mount Rushmore, for example, look out on to South Dakota, but at Window of the World they overlook Washington’s Capitol Building, some 1,600km away. The Shenzhen Eiffel Tower rises to a third of its real size (108m instead of 324m), but you can climb it and admire the view of the pyramids of Giza in Egypt.On the other hand, the park allows visitors an opening to a world that would otherwise be inaccessible and unknown to them.The ability to eat Mexican food while walking in the Cambodian temple of Angkor Wat is the novel offer of a park which slashes both distance and time. By the end of the visit, the landmarks are blurred: we toured the planet by jumping over continents and centuries.

But a redevelopment plan for the area means the pub’s future is uncertain To anyone living in a British city today, the sight is familiar: an area is being redeveloped and the ordinary, vernacular buildings which give a place its character are being lost. The Flying Pig, an early Victorian pub, now stands isolated on a site that has been earmarked for development for the last decade.Its neighbour, The Osborne Arms, was demolished in 2012 while the seven-storey Botanic House was built in the same year. At the time of writing, the Flying Pig’s future is uncertain. There is an ongoing public consultation about the developer’s plans while an online petition to save the Pig has attracted over 13,000 signatures.Drawing directly from life with my sticks and ink gives me a chance to document the pub as fully as possible while it is still there: to celebrate its visual richness, chat to some regulars, hear some great music and have some sneaky pints along the way.This is not a story about a dying pub. The blue-painted exterior is fresh and well-maintained, while the blackboards on either side of the door boast an eclectic line-up of live music and real ales. Inside the floorboards are stripped and walls are dark and covered in posters. The décor dates back to the late 80s and then landlord “Mick the Pig” Clelford, who also changed the pub’s name from The Crown to The Flying Pig, apparently after himself. The bent propeller over the front door is from a plane he crash-landed.A couple of years after Justine and Matt Hatfield took over in 1997, Punch Taverns, who owned the building, asked them to revamp the pub. The Hatfields carefully removed the posters, found paint to match the nicotine-stained dark brown walls, repainted through the night and rehung the posters. The posters only get replaced if stolen or worn out. Among the collection providing a backdrop for the lunchtime drinkers are John Holder’s iconic Cambridge Folk Festival posters from the early 90s, while Betty Blue looks down from the ceiling.On weekdays lunch is served from 12–2 and after this Justine and the staff have lunch together, usually trying to tease out the crossword for half an hour. For Justine this is at least as important as the closing time debrief.Early afternoon is a good time to observe, and there are usually some regulars in. Once someone orders a second drink I know they’re in no great hurry and there’ll be time to draw them. I usually ask first, though with my sticks and bottle of ink I’m hardly inconspicuous. Jim had a couple of quiet pints of weissbier standing at the bar – we talk a bit about drawing and how he likes to paint with acrylics. Later I show the drawing to Woody, one of the bar staff: “Ah yeah, the guy who wears the really nice jacket.”Lunch can drag on, particularly on Fridays. Karolina, from Poland, works in nearby Botanic House and is sharing a bottle of wine with some colleagues. Soon the table in front is taken by computer game developers. It appears they’re unhappy that the weekly life drawing session at their workplace might be axed.On one end of the bar stands a statue of a pig in full flying gear. Underneath two friends, both named Eddie are having a few pints. They’re interrupted by a guy asking if either of them knew someone named Eddie he was meant to be meeting, but it wasn’t either of them.One afternoon, I am fortunate to catch two of the pub’s live music stalwarts, George Breakfast and Fabian Bonner playing an acoustic set in the back room. The back room is known to everyone as the pool room although there hasn’t been a pool table there for about a decade. George was originally George Bacon but changed his name to Breakfast on account of his vegetarian wife. The name change cost him 15 guineas at the time.Fabian worked behind the bar from the age of 18, subsequently managing the pub until he persuaded Justine and Matt to take it over. It’s quite something to hear Fabian’s legendary Tom Waits covers bounce off the wood panelling of the back room.Three or four evenings a week there’s live music in the Pig. Django’s Tigers played at my wedding so it’s really nice to hear them again. In front of me, Tyler is with her boyfriend James and his parents. They’re Australian. James works in a bar in Camden and regularly gets train up to Cambridge to enjoy the atmosphere and to listen to the music at The Pig.Another evening Nick Barraclough is playing as part of the band CBT. He recently published A Disorderly House, a history of The Flying Pig. There’s a wonderful extract from an 1857 newspaper: “Supt Jaggard said that he had been informed that the young women who had the management of the house were no better than they ought to be.” Given some of the bawdy goings on in the premises over the years, it seems remarkable that Justine, Matt and their two daughters have made the upstairs a family home.As ever, Justine is watching at the bar ensuring everything goes smoothly. She’s been standing in the same spot for so many years that there are little grooves in the floorboards from her cowboy boots.The Jazz Festival ensures there’s even more live music than normal, and the crowd spills over into the pool room. On the wall is a t-shirt for the Flying Pig Stage at Cambridge’s annual Strawberry Fair.It’s almost impossible to experience live music in Cambridge without seeing the distinctive figure of Michael Guy. Michael worked as a mathematician in Cambridge University on the theory of polyhedra in higher dimensions, but it’s his unruly white hair, beard and tweed jacket that interest me. I’ve had a couple of pints standing at the bar so the drawing itself is becoming unruly in sympathy.Award-winning illustrator and printmaker Jim Butler was born in Dublin and currently lives in Cambridge, where he leads the MA in illustration and book arts at Cambridge School of Art, Anglia Ruskin University.

Just as the 2017 election showed that while a lot of people had an appetite for change and Labour policies, they had not been willing to embrace Ed Miliband as a leader in 2015, the 2019 election sheds a harsh light on how poor a campaigner Theresa May proved to be in 2017. Boris Johnson, avoiding the media and repeating platitudes as banal as the Maybot, unlocked the mandate that she sought last time around. It was an expertly timed election, thanks as much to the blunders of Jo Swinson and Jeremy Corbyn as to the Machiavellian planning of Johnson and Dominic Cummings. Running against chaos worked for Cameron in 2015, and even more so for the Tories in 2019.Jeremy Corbyn has done a favour to Michael Foot’s historical reputation in displacing his 1983 haul of 209 seats as the worst Labour performance in the post-1945 era. But beyond that simple fact, the comparison between 1983 and 2019 tells an interesting tale. Although the total number of seats is similar, it is amazing how little the diminished remnant of Labour Britain in 2019 has in common with its counterpart in 1983. There are 105 seats, give and take for boundary changes, that were Labour in both elections, and therefore nearly the same number that switched in one direction or the other between 1983 and 2019. The seats that Labour has lost since 1983 are rural and town seats in the Midlands and north, and Scottish seats lost in the destruction that the party has endured at the hands of the SNP. The seats that Labour has gained are mostly in London, and various pleasant suburbs and university towns. In 1983 the Economist wrote that to find a Labour seat, one needed to look in impoverished inner cities and crashed-out towns with obsolete economies – in 2019 one needs to find a pro-European, highly educated enclave huddling around a university.And yet, the electorate was unenthusiastic. Contrary to the excited claims on social media on election day, turnout was down on 2017. The vile weather offered an escape route for electors wrestling with uncomfortable choices perhaps had things been a little different the Labour leavers thinking of voting Tory would have opted out. But as it was, it looks as if the unenthusiastic voters of the Midlands and north who might have given a grudging Labour vote did not feel motivated enough to brave the rain. While Corbyn was unpopular, Johnson was not loved.But the political system does not recognise unenthusiastic mandates: a big majority gives a party the power to do more or less what it likes and there are few constraints. It is up to the magnanimity of the Conservative party whether the full, vague promise of Page 48 of the party’s manifesto, and the removal of checks to executive power, comes to pass. It is also up to the honour of Johnson whether anything is done to update Britain’s electoral laws to cope with dark money, blatant lying and obscure online advertising. This, rather than minor tweaks such as voter ID and boundary changes, makes the election due in 2024 potentially even less of a joyous festival of democracy than 2019.• Lewis Baston is a political analyst and writer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78cf0651668325782883f9b5b4accb5156f968e5/0_179_6321_3793/master/6321.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7bb2a7c1e7ea3b6818916287e3683f6e","title":"harvey weinstein consequences settlement deal","story":"If he has any conscience, he would apologize sincerely and inidually to the women who have accused him, and use every last cent he has to make amendsTwo years ago, Harvey Weinstein was very sorry. He came of age in a different time, he said in a rambling statement after more than 80 women came forward to accuse him of sexual harassment and assault. He realized he needed to be a better person. He quoted Jay-Z: “I am not the man I thought I was and I better be that man for my children.” He could not be more remorseful to the people he hurt, he wrote, and he planned “to do right by all of them”.On Wednesday, the New York Times reported that Weinstein is nearing a settlement deal with the more than 30 women who say he harassed, assaulted or raped them. As part of the settlement, he won’t have to admit wrongdoing. He also won’t have to spend any of his own money – his production company’s insurance plans will shoulder the $25m payout. And Weinstein himself will benefit from the deal, securing about $12m to cover legal fees incurred by him, his brother and his company’s board.There’s no shame for the women here taking the settlement – it might be the best deal they can get. But it does speak to just how cheap words can be. Weinstein attempted a major public rehabilitation campaign, of which apology and accountability was front and center. Now that it’s time to put something of value behind his words – the cold, hard cash he made while systematically exploiting and torpedoing the careers of many of the actors who are now suing him – he’s unwilling to show remorse. Even words now seem to be too costly: part of the deal is that he won’t even admit fault.This shouldn’t be surprising, but it is yet another example of how impotent our system is at dealing with the kind of systematic sexual wrongdoing that brought about the #MeToo movement. The acts of harassment and assault that too many women face are often done in private, leaving insufficient evidence for a criminal case. Taking up the matter in civil court through a lawsuit, as Weinstein is facing, gives victims more latitude, but happens within an adversarial system full of bad incentives and inadequate remedies.It would be a truly radical and transformational move for Weinstein to disregard his lawyers and decide it’s time to do the right thing: admit fault, apologize sincerely and inidually, and use every last cent he has to make amends and pay back the women who accuse him of wrongdoing. That would be a move quite outside of our usual chess game of criminal punishment, legal liability and public relations, and one that any lawyer would surely advise against. But it would still be the right one.Human beings naturally crave justice, and around the world, we have cobbled together countless systems to get it (and of widely varying success, morality and humanity). These are necessary, and the ideals underpinning the American criminal and civil systems are beacons the world over – even if, in practice, justice is far less blind than we claim it is. A functional justice system has to work for the masses. But that also means that it’s often going to be found lacking in inidual cases.Every survivor of sexual violence has to decide for themselves how to traverse the impossible landscape in front of them. We talk less, though, about what sexual assailants should do, short of facing down the long arm of the criminal law. This Weinstein deal provides an opportunity.The overwhelming majority of men who physically assault women will never spend a day in jail. Most will not pay out money in a lawsuit. There are a few men – a drop in the bucket of men who have assaulted and harassed women – who have been publicly shamed for their actions. And yet we have spent more time worrying about whether #MeToo has gone too far and about how long those men have to sit on the sidelines before they can return to their previously vaunted careers than we have asking what accountability would look like.I’m not sure what the answer to that is – and in any case, it’s a question for victims, not internet pontificators. But I do know this: any true form of justice and accountability must include the taking of responsibility, both rhetorically and practically. We need men like Weinstein to offer more than tepid “I’m trying to be a better man” statements we need to see that work in action. Sometimes that might mean money. Sometimes it might mean service. Sometimes it might mean fading into irrelevance and obscurity. It means, at the very minimum, an honest accounting for what one has done.That Weinstein cannot even offer that – that after all of this, after his name becoming nearly synonymous with the #MeToo movement, he still uses his legal team to angle for no admission of fault – tells us that he does not take responsibility publicly or privately. It tells us there has been no evolution and that he is not the “better man” he claimed to be molding himself into. That this is the result of perhaps the highest-profile #MeToo case, involving several household-name celebrities, dozens of accusations and a man who is now known the world over as an accused sexual predator, and still the best deal his victims can get is one in which none of them gets so much as a full apology, well – the only lesson here is that #MeToo hasn’t gone far enough."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af4c531e9fcc5b0fa477b792069157286f76584d/0_158_4750_2850/master/4750.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a73b137ceac17514a0e6e79441a4d89","title":"labour why lost jeremy corbyn brexit media","story":"It’s not enough to blame Jeremy Corbyn, Brexit or the media. The picture is far more complex than that• Full election results hereThis changes everything. The fourth national vote in four years has broken the parliamentary logjam with devastating effect. It was a rout. Labour’s vote in its traditional strongholds finally collapsed. The demographic, geographic and social ties that bound its coalition together have unravelled. We have yet to see if they can be put back together again. Britain has elected the most rightwing government for decades, handing the least principled leader in living memory such a massive majority that it could take a decade to get rid of him. Last night was bad. The worst is yet to come.The left must now find the space to grieve and think simultaneously. Because it’s not about us. It’s about the more hopeful society we want to create, the people we want to create it with, and the dystopia that the Tories are in the process of creating. And we won’t be in a position to win again until we work out why we lost. The easiest answers here are also the least adequate. To blame it all on Jeremy Corbyn, Brexit, the media, the manifesto or a failure of tactical voting is to deny a bigger, more complex picture. Of course Brexit played a significant role. Labour had three years to come up with a coherent offer to counter Tory bluster and failed. Given that its biggest losses were in leave areas, the notion that it should have cast itself as an unequivocal party of remain and a second referendum makes no sense. That certainly didn’t do the Liberal Democrats any good.Labour knew Brexit would dominate and aimed to shift the conversation to public services and the environment. It failed there too. The problem was not the manifesto. Labour’s plans for nationalisation, public spending and wealth redistribution were popular, achievable, and would not have left Britain in a radically different place from many other European nations. But if you’re going to promise something that ambitious, you have to first of all prepare people politically for it and then reassure them you can actually do it. Labour did neither effectively, instead promising more things each day, displaying a lack of message discipline that felt like a metaphor for potential lack of fiscal discipline.Corbyn was deeply unpopular. On the doorstep most couldn’t really say why they didn’t like him. They just didn’t. Some either thought he was too leftwing, antisemitic or the friend of terrorists. Obviously the media, which did not come out of this election well at all, have a lot to do with that. How could you like someone when you never hear anything good about them? The rightwing-dominated press too often framed the narratives for television and radio, which fed them back on a loop that could be broken only by events.But they did not invent it all. Corbyn was a poor performer. Time and again he had chances to nail Boris Johnson for his lies and duplicity, but he refused to do so. He’d say it’s not his style. But his style wasn’t working. His refusal to apologise to the Jewish community for antisemitism when interviewed by Andrew Neil was baffling, not least because he had apologised several times before – and did so again afterwards with Phillip Schofield. And the media are not going anywhere soon. They attacked Gordon Brown, Edward Miliband and Neil Kinnock too – though never as ferociously – and whoever runs the party next will have to deal with them.Those who think that Labour’s leftward shift was just about Corbyn frankly never understood it. Corbyn was simply the unlikely, unprepared and in many ways inadequate vessel for a political moment that is not yet over. He emerged in the wake of wars and at a time of austerity when social democratic parties across the western world were failing and flailing. His election did not produce the crisis in the Labour party it was the product of it, and this election result has now exacerbated it. His strong performance in 2017 is why we are not further down the Brexit path already, and why the Tories have promised to increase public spending and effectively end austerity.There are ways of contextualising this result that could provide solace in a moment of despair. Labour, under Corbyn, won a higher vote share than both Miliband and Brown. He lost fewer seats than Brown and has more than the Tories did in 2005, from which they bounced back to form a coalition government in 2010. Such rationalisations should be avoided. We lost, and lost badly. Self–criticism does not come easy from a defensive crouch. In the words of the great African American writer and activist WEB Du Bois: “Our worst side has been so shamelessly emphasised that we are denying we have or ever had a worst side. In all sorts of ways we are hemmed in.”Corbyn is right to announce his departure. His decision to stay and lead a discussion about the future of the party makes no sense. He cannot lead a conversation that is in no small part about him. His presence will be a ersion from the task at hand. The left should not fetishise this position. It matters who runs the Labour party, but it’s not the only thing that matters. For the past four years nearly all of the left’s energy has been poured into defending it. Given Johnson’s majority, many of the key struggles to come will take place outside parliament.Corbyn’s departure creates a problem for centrists. They have been predicting this moment since before he was elected leader. When events failed to comply – when the party reelected him with a greater majority or the country gave him more seats and votes – they waited for the next event. Even a broken clock is right twice a day. The trouble is, with him leaving they will now have to produce an agenda and a candidate of their own, and then offer those up to a party that has grown in size, even if it is momentarily diminished in confidence.They will have to face the fact that the electorate did not abandon Labour for the centre. They went either to the far right, in England and Wales, or to the social democratic nationalist alternative, in Scotland. They did not go to the Liberal Democrats or back Change UK. Chuka Umunna, Dominic Grieve, David Gauke, Anna Soubry, Jo Swinson and Luciana Berger all lost.I did not hear a single voter ask about Owen Smith or pine for Yvette Cooper. Whatever comes next, it won’t be a return to abstaining on the welfare bill or backing the hostile environment policy. They will want Labour to be more effective in opposition, but they will want it to mount an opposition.The centrists will have to face the fact that the thousands of people who travelled the country during these past few weeks to canvass in the cold and rain are not about to abandon their ideals or the party. And those who invested so heavily in this particular iteration of Labour will have to face the fact that their conviction alone was not enough to convince others of their ideals."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4321b70768f172c6e4aa2f803106febaa44722d3/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3da9dd2dc596cae37bcab0f8ba20a67","title":"culture to make you feel less terrible about the uk election","story":"You may be distraught at the result, or just want a break from politics – so find solace in our critics’ pick of 30 films, songs, books and more to hide under a duvet withBlades of Glory Will Ferrell and Jon Heder enjoyed their finest hours in this comedy as egotistical ice-skaters barred from the sport after a disgraceful display of bad temper.

The troubled European state of Freedonia has to accept a new president as a condition for a US loan: the free-thinking genius and visionary Rufus T Firefly, played by Groucho Marx.The Devil Wears Prada Is working in a glossy magazine really like this? Who cares? This 2006 film is comfort food that upgrades comfort to luxury, with an outrageous performance by Meryl Streep as the Anna-Wintour-esque editor of the New York publication Runway who terrorises Anne Hathaway’s saucer-eyed newbie. Great support from Stanley Tucci and a career-maker for Emily Blunt.The Princess Bride This wonderful comedy romance from 1987 features glorious performances from Robin Wright as the princess bride herself and Cary Elwes as the winsome young farmhand who is in love with her. Mandy Patinkin gives a legendary performance as a hot-blooded man of honour. It will restore your faith in a happy ending, somewhere down the road.Beverly Hills Cop Here’s one to put a banana in the tailpipe of disillusion. Eddie Murphy plays street-smart Detroit cop Axel Foley, who shows up in Beverly Hills on a mission to solve a murder. Murphy’s wheezing laugh in the face of LA’s myriad absurdities is something we need right now.Robyn – Dancing On My Own The best pop song of the last 20 years, not least because it’s blessed with a chorus that somehow manages to be despairing and dizzyingly uplifting at the same time, its overall message – everything may seem ruined, but you have to keep on regardless – perfectly suits current events.Chic – Good Times Good Times starts with an eye-roll at the awfulness of everything – “happy days,” it offers ironically, “are here again” – then suggests you get wasted and go dancing: a short-term solution, but if the bassline doesn’t lift your gloom at least a little, you’re probably past the point where music can help you.Nina Simone – O-o-h Child Any version of O-o-h Child will do – it’s the musical equivalent of a comforting arm around your shoulder – but Nina Simone’s just edges it: the hint of weary hard-won experience in her voice makes its message more potent. And as a bonus, it’s on the same album as her cover of Here Comes the Sun, which has the same effect.MIA – Paper Planes It doubtless wasn’t intended as head-under-the-duvet comfort-eating music, but Paper Planes works perfectly in that context: you get the melancholy of the sample from the Clash’s Straight to Hell and the invigorating screw-you defiance of the lyric: “Already going to hell, just pumping on the gas, no one on the corner has swagger like us.”The The – This Is the Day This song is dual-purpose. If you want to be uplifted, then the contrast between the verses and the chorus – “your life will surely change … things fall into place” – will do it. If you want to wallow in your misery, then assume said chorus is intended sarcastically and the song is saying everything is terrible and likely to stay that way.Strictly Come Dancing final (Saturday, 7.05pm, BBC One) Dust off your nattiest sequin number and settle in for the Strictly final, to find out whether Emma, Kelvin or Karim will hold high the Glitterball trophy. And if you need a pick-me-up before then, rewatch Karim and Amy’s quarter-final jive on loop. The mood outside may be frightful, but the dancefloor will surely be delightful.Tiffany Haddish: Black Mitzvah (Netflix) “People think they know everything about me … well, here’s something they probably don’t know!” So begins the first solo Netflix special by the Girls Trip star. Ostensibly about the comic’s discovery that she is part Jewish, it soon morphs into a belated version of the bat mitzvah tradition it takes its title from. Haddish celebrates her own ascent from foster care to hanging out with Beyoncé, and the result is both anarchic and relatable.The Repair Shop (BBC iPlayer) The perfect antidote to use-it-and-chuck-it culture, this heartwarming balm of a show sees a team of craft experts bring people’s treasures back to life, from toys to jewellery, a homemade gramophone to a tippling stick (that is, a walking stick with space for a tot of whisky or three). Deeply moving without being saccharine, it might leave you crying like a baby – but at least they’ll be tears of joy.The Marvellous Mrs Maisel (Amazon Prime Video) To put some pep in your step look no further than Mrs Maisel, the 1960s Jewish housewife turned foul-mouthed standup supremo known for getting dragged off stage by police for her criminally obscene jokes. Now in its third season, Mrs Maisel is out on the road for her first tour, a whirlwind of Las Vegas hot spots and sexual tension with her idol, the even more obscene comic Lenny Bruce. It’s silly, perky and gag-heavy – all in all a fine distraction.Freaks and Geeks (All4) If anything can get you through dark days it’s this cult teen comedy by Judd Apatow about the rebels, mathletes, Dungeons and Dragons lovers and hermaphrodite tuba players of William McKinley High School in 1980. It kickstarted the careers of everyone from Apatow and Paul Feig to Seth Rogen and Linda Cardellini, it’s a work of genius from start to finish and all 18 episodes are available on All4 now.Queenie by Candice Carty-Williams Queenie, a 25-year-old Londoner who is getting over the end of a long relationship while struggling to make an impression as a journalist, is also coming to terms with a traumatic past in this smart, insightful and funny novel. Frequently and reductively described as the “black Bridget Jones”, this debut definitely hits Helen Fielding’s humorous high notes, but runs much deeper on the emotional side as Queenie works her way back to stability.A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens Rereading this tale of the redemption of Ebenezer Scrooge will not only make us all feel as festive as is humanly possible, but will also remind us that even the most villainous person has a good side that can (if threatened by enough ghosts) resurface. Here’s hoping the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Future will pay a visit to the current inhabitant of No 10 soon.Hope in the Dark by Rebecca Solnit Written in despair at George Bush’s invasion of Iraq, Solnit’s meditation on activism celebrates the unremarked achievements of 20th-century progressives. In the preface to the third edition, she declares: “Together we are powerful … yes, we can change the world because we have many times before.”Howl’s Moving Castle by Diana Wynne Jones Any novel by Diana Wynne Jones is a comfort in difficult times. But this one, in which Sophie, turned into an old woman by a wicked witch, is forced to take a job with the eccentric wizard Howl, is particularly witty, warm and wise. Who knows? If there’s hope for even a dreaded wizard to find his missing heart, perhaps not all is lost for Boris Johnson.Reasons to Be Cheerful by Nina Stibbe Any reader who doesn’t snort with laughter at the life and thoughts of Lizzie Vogel is quite possibly dead inside. Stibbe’s teenage narrator, who has landed her first job as the dental assistant of an appalling boss, is sharp as a tack and warm-heartedly eccentric. This book is a genuine joy to read.Mendelssohn: Octet in E-flat major This work was written by the prodigiously talented young composer when he was just 17, and has there ever been a more joyful piece of music? The NHS should prescribe the first movement to those of us suffering from anxiety and depression. Guaranteed to make your heart soar, even today.Nielsen: Inextinguishable Symphony The clue’s in the name. Nielsen’s bold and dramatic Fourth symphony is about the elemental will to live. As he put it: “Life is indomitable and inextinguishable the struggle, the wrestling, the generation and the wasting away go on today as yesterday, tomorrow as today, and everything returns. Once more: music is life, and like it inextinguishable.”Barokksolistene: The Alehouse Sessions Escape to a 17th-century alehouse with Norwegian violinist Bjarte Eike and his group Barokssolistene, who mix period performance with alehouse singalongs, chanting and dancing. Time spent in the company of this virtuosic and exhilarating group of musicians is always a tonic.Beethoven: Seventh Symphony, Fourth Movement You think you have it bad? Beethoven’s Seventh was written while Austria was under Napoloanic occupation and its 1813 premiere was at a charity concert for injured soldiers. Its final movement is a sheer head-rush of energy whose racing semiquavers and whirling anarchic rhythms will leave you breathless and cheering.Verdi: La Traviata’s Brindisi (The Drinking Song), or Falstaff’s Tuttonel mondo e burla One of Verdi’s best-loved tunes from La Traviata is the best way to raise your spirits and get you waltzing around your kitchen. (Or is that just me?) And listen to the composer’s final opera, whose glorious and uplifting conclusion sees wrongs righted, disguises shed and lovers reunited. The entire cast join in the final fugue: Tutto nel mondo e burla, literally, the whole world is a joke. Quite.Luigi’s Mansion 3 (Nintendo Switch) If it’s pure, unadulterated escapism you’re after, the Nintendo Switch is always going to have something comforting on offer. The latest instalment in this ghost-busting adventure series has Mario’s brother clearing spooks from a haunted hotel, with the help of his gelatinous alter ego, Gooigi. It’s funny, it’s silly and it has a co-op mode so you can share it with similarly desperate pals.Untitled Goose Game (Panic Inc PC, PS4, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One) The unexpected hit game of 2019 has you taking on the role of a terrible goose determined to annoy the residents of a village by hiding their gardening tools, chasing them around and being generally antisocial. There are few more satisfying ways to work through your frustrations with the world than stealing a groundskeeper’s vacuum flask – oh, and the developers backed Labour.Sayonara Wild Hearts (Simogo PS4, Nintendo Switch, iOS) This beautiful, neon-drenched interactive pop-music video has you skating, punching and kissing your way through a super-stylised landscape in time with the thumping soundtrack. It is incredibly accessible, and the songs are so dreamy and hypnotic you may we’ll forget everything that’s happened this week – at least for a few blissed-out hours.Baba Is You (Hempuli PC, Nintendo Switch) For a more cerebral escapism, this unique puzzle game by Finnish indie developer Arvi Teikari requires players to solve each level by moving specific blocks around the screen, each representing a different rule – by manipulating the rules, you effectively design your own win state, thereby completing the task. Politics may have left you feeling powerless, but at least you can exert your authority over this pixelated kingdom.Astrologaster (Nyamyam PC) Fancy escaping from the rigours of the 21st century altogether? We’ve got just the bawdy, Shakespearean adventure comedy for you. You’re a quack physician looking to “heal” a series of gullible (probably Tory-voting) aristocrats with your own combination of dangerous medicine and inaccurate astrology. Snuggle up in bed with this on your laptop and it’ll quietly indulge your intellectual revenge fantasies."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1603729a629e4fe3f897182aab7b6e2bca952369/0_0_2400_1496/master/2400.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f76953b9d786a740fe0665303e166b33 720w","title":"what became of the great pacific pumice raft","story":"It captured the world’s imagination when it appeared in the middle of the ocean – but where did it come from, and where is it going?It floated into the collective consciousness in August, twice the size of Manhattan and probably powerful enough to exfoliate the feet of the entire world. The giant Pacific Ocean pumice raft was as mysterious as it was vast.The world only knew of its existence thanks to Michael Hoult and Larissa Brill, two Australians who sailed into it while travelling by catamaran to Fiji. Photographs they took showed a mass of grey stretching as far as the eye could see.At the time it was not clear exactly where the giant pumice raft had come from – and what would become of it.The volcano, known as Volcano F or by the number 243091, erupted between 6 and 8 August, the researchers said. Researchers from the Geomar Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research, in Kiel, Germany, used satellite images to track the raft’s creation and journey across the Pacific.Satellite imagery showed plumes of vapour and ash, indicating an eruption, which matched exactly with maps of the seafloor that showed the underwater volcano. The team then tracked the progress of the raft as it moved west across the ocean until mid-August.The pumice raft is due to reach Australia, and parts of the Great Barrier Reef, in late January or early February.In August, it had been hoped that the raft could help revive the reef, which is suffering from climate change-induced mass bleaching.A Queensland University of Technology geologist, Scott Bryan, said the rocky flotilla could pick up marine organisms and become a “potential mechanism for restocking” the reef, by “bringing new healthy corals”.However, a range of experts say this is unlikely.Professor Terry Hughes, the director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University, says the raft is too small, and coral would have no way to detach from the pumice on to the reef.The coral biologist Dr Rebecca Albright from the California Academy of Sciences agreed. In fact, she told Scientific American that the pumice may even “abrade the reef”.Hughes told Australia’s Science Channel: “Pumice floats, and corals don’t like to attach to something that’s bobbing around on the ocean … It doesn’t want to be attached to something that’s mobile.”He added that the process would take years.“By the time the pumice reaches Australia, there is a erse community of things living on it,” she said. “But will corals be major players? No, absolutely not.”She added that the focus on the raft ignored the main reason for the reef’s decline.“The reason the Great Barrier Reef is in the condition it’s in is because of climate change. We’d be kidding ourselves if we did not acknowledge that elephant in the room. A pumice raft is not going to fix it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fddb5501bc46ff4bc6da16631fbda8182f43467d/0_4_5519_3311/master/5519.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7281ec422cb0a42c5d564b0a8c3fd4bf","title":"brandon thomas i dont get nervous or have nightmares about gerard pique","story":"Forward with an English father on how a pub brought him to Mallorca, being wanted by Everton and facing La Liga’s finestLike all the best stories, this one starts in the pub, and the man telling it has a glint in his eye and a grin on his face, the words flying out at a million miles an hour. “I never stop talking,” Brandon Thomas says, and he’s not wrong. “I consider myself a bloke with personality, an extrovert,” he says, and he’s not wrong there either. The Osasuna forward is talking about pretty much everything really, falling about laughing most of the time. Right now, he’s on the buildup to a big game, excitement, nerves, second-guessing the team, how it will go. “And if things go well, magic,” he says, “if not, keep on and on.” It could be his motto.The manager, Jagoba Arrasate, doesn’t tell them who is playing until the morning of the match, he says, but sometimes the players can “smell” it, though he admits: “You’re guessing really.” Brandon had a feeling he might play against Barcelona, which he did – and within eight minutes he had made the opening goal. He started against Real Madrid too, which he didn’t expect. And he played against his former club Mallorca. He doesn’t know whether he will start against Atlético Madrid on Saturday, but if he does, it will be as close as you can get to two Englishmen facing each other in La Liga: Trippier versus Thomas.Yet while Brandon talks pints, beans and sausages, Chelsea and the “hooligan” in him, about how he “loves” the “directness of the Premier League” and would like to play there one day, he’s a curious kind of Englishman. He doesn’t speak any English, for a start – and in Spanish, “hooligan” doesn’t mean hooligan, just a barmy fan, a bit nuts. He never lived in England and never played for an English club. And when he mentions tea, it’s to say he doesn’t drink it. The name is English but the passport is Spanish.Explaining how it happened, how he got here, means heading to the most English place of all. “My dad’s from London, my mum’s from Granada,” he says. “And they met in Mallorca. My dad’s family had gone years ago to set up an English pub.”After Mallorca, anyway. “On the island there’s a lot of tourism, a lot of English people, but everyone really supports Mallorca, more than Madrid or Barcelona. It’s like here in Pamplona, the way people support Osasuna. In most Spanish towns, there are two teams: the local team and one of the big two. If the local team is going well, they support them, but if not … It’s different here.“I joined Mallorca at 10,” Brandon continues. “I’d just signed for them when we played this international tournament near home and I was named the best player. There were lots of teams there and Everton wanted to sign me. They paid for a flight for me and my dad to go to see the training ground and everything it was all set up. But Mallorca wouldn’t let me go. There’s that little thorn in my side still: I had the chance to go to Everton.”But then he would have had to leave Mallorca. There is that glint in his eye again and Brandon says: “Yeah, and Mallorca is the best place on earth.” The outstanding player in the club’s youth system with his friend Marco Asensio, now at Madrid, he departed when the club needed funds following relegation, heading to Rennes. The following summer he joined Osasuna on loan, making the deal permanent this year after playing a key role in promotion to primera, scoring the day they clinched the second ision title. In the club shop, his shirt was the second-best seller after captain Roberto Torres. “That’ll be everyone in England,” he jokes.Brandon grins. “Football and politics do mix.”And yet Osasuna led Barcelona within 10 minutes, Brandon getting the better of Clément Lenglet to make the first, and secured a 2-2 draw. That was part of a run that saw Osasuna break a club record, unbeaten at home for 31 games, and they travel to Atlético only three points off Europe, two points behind their opponents.Against Barcelona, Brandon was everywhere, chasing everything. He left with an assist, a point and Antoine Griezmann’s shirt. He also left “knackered”, he says. “I’m a guy who fights, gives everything. I reckon I’ve got character and I don’t get nervous I don’t have nightmares about Gerard Piqué. Bloody hell, after that game, it will have been him dreaming of me. That’s the idea, anyway. We pressed hard, and you could see them, uncomfortable, thinking: ‘Shit.’ I was about to apologise afterwards: ‘Look, sorry that it was me chasing you everywhere, not the other way around.’He starts laughing again. “That’s the Englishman in me, the loco inglés.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0793d9fb3b99eca83c102dc88ae2dbb21d07ed2a/204_105_2035_1221/master/2035.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f459bdd2b2369a1c1b11956afc90c4f","title":"premier league team news previews and more football countdown live","story":"More manager press conferences coming up around 1.30pm. They include Pep Guardiola and Jose Mourinho.Apparently, Pep banned his first-teamers from attending this year’s Christmas party. Not because he caught them doing a massive conga outside the Arndale Centre but because after the last one they lost 3-2 at home to Crystal Palace and, four days later, were beaten by Leicester. These marginal gains could make all the difference with City breathing down Liverpool’s necks just 14 points behind.Only four players have reached double digits in the Premier League scoring charts this season.Nope, not Harry Kane. Not Mo Salah. Not Sergio Aguero. It’s this four:Vardy is five clear and here’s some pub ammo ...Facts. What are they anymore? It’s a confusing time.Some leave me empty inside such as being told that the amount of strawberries consumed at Wimbledon each year is enough to fill Wembley ( fruit factcheck team currently trying to confirm this).But how about this from Steve Bruce on just why Allan Saint-Maximim (such an enjoyable name to say) will be out for a month:He pulled his hamstring doing 38.6 kilometres per hour in the 96th minute. I don’t think anyone’s run that fast in the Premier League ever before so what can you do?Not as fast as an ostrich or an emu but that is zippy.So how about a bit on the boss who faces Jurgen Klopp on Saturday. Nigel Pearson was recently installed as Watford’s third manager of the season and Simon Burnton takes a look at the man tasked with keeping the Hornets up.Pearson, of course, became famous for his ‘ostrich outburst’ and that gives us an excuse to further brighten your day after last night’s result by posting a picture of Rod Hull. Or is it Hans van Breukelen?Fun fact: The emu has three toes and can run up to 30mph compared to the ostrich which has two toes and runs up to 40mph (Opta Attenborough). Fenway Sports Group say the new Jurgen Klopp deal represents one of the “big moments” of their stewardship.Principal owner John Henry, chairman Tom Werner and FSG president Mike Gordon made this joint statement, and they really do go full American at the end ...We are absolutely delighted we have been able to reach an agreement with Jürgen – as well as Peter and Pep – on extending their time with the club. As we are sure our supporters would agree, it is truly wonderful news and we are all extremely thrilled, not only professionally, but personally too. We feel this represents one of the big moments of our stewardship of Liverpool Football Club so far as we believe there is no better manager than Jürgen. The decision also keeps with the club’s overall strategy of building from a position of strength. It means Jürgen will oversee the ongoing transition from Melwood to the new Kirkby training base as the club continues to pursue a vision of being elite in all facets of the industry. It also provides us with continuity with the existing football operations management structure, overseen by sporting director Michael Edwards, whose input into the project cannot be overestimated. He has been – and will continue to be – as indispensably important as anyone else to the direction of Liverpool Football Club. In Jürgen and Michael we are blessed with world-class leadership.Here’s our story on Jurgen Klopp and his new two-year contract extension ...Jurgen Klopp on his new deal at Anfield ...For me personally this is a statement of intent, one which is built on my knowledge of what we as a partnership have achieved so far and what is still there for us to achieve. When I see the development of the club and the collaborative work that continues to take place, I feel my contribution can only grow. People see what happens on the pitch as a measure of our progress and although it is the best measure, it’s not the only measure. I have seen the commitment from ownership through to every aspect and function of the club you can think of. When the call came in autumn 2015, I felt we were perfect for each other if anything, now I feel I underestimated that. It is only with a total belief that the collaboration remains totally complementary on both sides that I am able to make this commitment to 2024. If I didn’t I would not be re-signing. This club is in such a good place, I couldn’t contemplate leaving.But much bigger news from Anfield now – Jürgen Klopp has agreed a new deal with Liverpool until 2024.Assistant managers Peter Krawietz and Pepijn Lijnders have also agreed deals to continue working alongside Klopp. Liverpool’s Sadio Mane has been named Premier League Player of the month.Not a bad month for the Reds forward, with three goals (including the injury-time winner against Aston Villa) and an assist (that cross to Andy Robertson for the late equaliser at Villa).And if he fancies celebrating this weekend, this Opta stat suggests Watford will be willing stooges ... “Sadio Mané has been involved in eight goals in five games against them for the Reds (5 goals, 3 assists).”News from Napoli now and it’s what we all wanted to hear - the calendar is out!Initially, Carlo Ancelotti’s sacking looked to have scuppered the 2020 edition ...But, no, it’s back on, with sales set to outperform Cliff Richard’s and, believe me, Cliff really does shift some units.While we’re in the world of speculation, Ben Fisher has worked his way through the latest transfer rumour fluff. Read all about it here ...Talking of Everton, there’s a vacancy in the manager’s office.Some options: “Give it Big Dunc”, “Get Moysie back” or “That Ancelotti’s class”.Duncan Ferguson has temporary charge and certainly got the locals fired up last weekend when power-lifting ball boys and showing that no-one in football does a better, or scarier, clenched fist.He’s only third favourite though according to the bookies:The list goes down to 1001. Those at that price include Gareth Southgate, Lucy Bronze and Diego Maradona. Honestly!Everton will submit their planning application to construct a new 52,000-capacity stadium at Bramley Moore Dock on 23 December, the club has confirmed. Everton hope to start construction on a three-year build in 2020, although that depends on the success of a complex planning application for a world heritage site.It’s a few hours yet before we hear from Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola. So, in the meantime, Ed Aarons, Simon Burnton and Niall McVeigh mark your cards for the upcoming action ...So, do we join the dots and presume that this all fits in with the theory that Stevie G will be Jurgen Klopp’s successor a few years down the line?Some reader feedback from ThisNameisMine: “Klopp’s contract is up in 2022, he might carry on, he might not but regardless Gerrard is not going to be Liverpool’s next manager unless he does something pretty spectacular outside of Scotland. Much more likely to be someone from the Alpine School or Pep Lindars. Meanwhile, announce Minamino!”Yes, the Takumi Minamino move to Merseyside has got Liverpool fans talking. The Japanese star was absolutely outstanding in RB Salzburg’s 4-3 defeat at Anfield and took the eye again when the two sides met on Tuesday night. Word is that the 24-year-old will join the Reds on the first day of the transfer window for an absolute bargain price due to his £7.25m release clause.I’m delighted to be extending my stay at this fantastic football club. When Dave King approached me about the possibility of extending my contract with Rangers, it was a very easy decision to make because I’m very happy and feel that we are building something special together at the club. I’d like to thank the board for the backing they have given me already in my time at the club and also most importantly, the Rangers fans who have given me and the team such tremendous backing both this season and last.Breaking … Manager Steven Gerrard has signed a new contract with Rangers until 2024, the club have announced.Is that when Jürgen Klopp is leaving Liverpool? Just saying. I’ll run you through the best Opta stats later (yes, I know you can’t wait). But yesterday evening before I turned in for the night (in a huff and about five hours earlier than expected), I did this research:The last time Liverpool played the weekend after a General Election was 2015 (2017’s was held in June). On that occasion, there was no overall majority with the Reds of Liverpool drawing 1-1 with the Blues of Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. Notably, both party leaders, John Terry and Steven Gerrard, got the goals. There was also a Johnson on the pitch, Glenn, who had once wanted to remain but then decided to leave Chelsea for Portsmouth. Erm, what else. Courtois sounds like Corbyn. Oh, forget it. I’m not helping my mood here.In the ‘who’s got the biggest injury list’ competition, Newcastle are certainly contenders too.“We’ve got a few out, yeah,” says boss Steve Bruce, who then has to read from his notes to list all the names. “Certainly (Ciaran), Clark, (Matt) Ritchie, (Jamaal) Lascelles, (Allan) Saint-Maximin, Ki (Sung-yeung) are all struggling... well, they’re out. We’ve got a couple of question marks over (Miguel) Almiron and (Jonjo) Shelvey so we’ll see how they are today.”Nathan Ake added to Bournemouth’s injury woes last weekend. The defender limped off during the 3-0 home defeat by Liverpool and looked set for a lengthy absence. Boss Eddie Howe is putting a positive spin on matters though. It was relatively good news on Nathan’s scan. The trouble with hamstring injuries is it’s very difficult to give definitive timelines. I think we’re looking at about six weeks. That’s conservative. Nathan could come back sooner than that but I think six weeks is probably a fair timeline.It’s been a tough time for Eddie Howe of late. Some words from him soon but, first, this piece from Eni Aluko ...Right, let’s pretend last night didn’t happen and lose ourselves in some Premier League football. No, I’m not convincing myself either.Anyway, life looks good for one set of reds, with Liverpool eight points clear at the top and facing a home game with Watford on Saturday lunchtime.Here’s your weekend fixture list (all times GMT):"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08254eed97961281c7573bac19e5fe14ef03a3fa/159_95_1646_988/master/1646.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=27b5dfb47f84d926d17a6f9d1afb882b","title":"microsoft names its new games console xbox series x","story":"The machine previously known as Project Scarlett will be four times as powerful as Xbox One X with a range of next-gen features Microsoft has revealed the name for its new games console – Xbox Series X.

At the event, a promotional trailer was shown for Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II, a sequel to the critically acclaimed adventure title from UK developer Ninja Theory, which is being designed to leverage the capabilities of the new technology.In a blog post, Xbox chief Phil Spencer introduced the Xbox Series X as “our fastest, most powerful console ever”, claiming it will set a new bar for performance and speed. “Its industrial design enables us to deliver four times the processing power of Xbox One X in the most quiet and efficient way, something that is critically important in delivering truly immersive gameplay.”The specifications of the machine were revealed earlier this year, including its custom AMD Zen 2 processor, capable of delivering visuals at 4K resolution and at 60 frames per second, with the possibility of 120fps rates and supporting 8K displays. The machine features a solid-state drive to allow for faster loading times. According to Microsoft, it can be stood vertically or horizontally. The Xbox Series X is also set to offer backwards compatibility with Xbox One and previous Xbox machines.No official release date has been given beyond the Holiday 2020 announcement, the same period that Sony is set to launch its competing PlayStation 5 machine."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0a39e7fa87752ae7714d3542df94e6b6c6d1c02/6_0_1012_607/master/1012.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de9a607abe11a1226773561f2aa1681a","title":"sierra leone ordered to revoke ban on pregnant schoolgirls","story":"Regional court ruling hailed as ‘landmark moment for thousands of girls’ who will no longer be forced to miss lessons and examsPregnant schoolgirls in Sierra Leone will no longer be banned from attending class or sitting exams, after a regional court ordered the immediate overturn of a “discriminatory” policy that has denied tens of thousands the right to finish their education.In a ruling handed down in Nigeria on Thursday, a top regional court found that a 2015 directive barring pregnant girls from attending school amounted to discrimination and a violation of human rights.The Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) court ordered Sierra Leone to establish nationwide programmes to help pregnant girls return to school.“This victory belongs to the girls in Sierra Leone who have been degraded and dehumanised because of their status since 2014,” said Hannah Yambasu, executive director of Women Against Violence and Exploitation in Society (Waves), one of a number of organisations that filed the case against Sierra Leone in May 2018.“Now our government in Sierra Leone has no option but to comply with their obligations as declared by the court.”When schools reopened after the virus was contained, the government banned girls who had fallen pregnant from attending class, in order to protect “innocent girls”.Although parallel schools for pregnant girls had been established by the government, Ecowas ruled that they amounted to another form of discrimination as attendees were only taught four subjects for three days a week. The court ordered their immediate abolition.Former pupil Patience, who was 17 when she fell pregnant and found herself banned from attending school, welcomed the court’s decision.“I am very happy because I did not have the opportunity to stay in school myself,” she told the .“If I had been able to stay in education, I would be in my last year at uni now, or maybe I would have graduated already. I would have liked to have studied nursing. Instead, my name was taken off the school register and I was offered vocational training. Yet my daughter’s father was never banned from school, and he was able to continue to do everything he wanted to do.”Sexual violence is highly prevalent in Sierra Leone, where 8,505 rape cases – among them 2,579 involving minors – were reported to police in 2018. Yet activists believe this number is likely to be far higher, as stigma and shame prevent many survivors from coming forward.In its ruling, Ecowas ordered the government to integrate sexual education classes into the nationwide curriculum to combat teen pregnancies and promote awareness around contraceptives.Human rights lawyer Sabrina Mahtani, who wrote the 2015 Amnesty International report on the ban, said the ruling presented an opportunity for Sierra Leone’s government to prove itself.Activist Chernor Bah, who co-founded the feminist movement-building hub Purposeful, said the ruling proved that Sierra Leone was “moving in the right direction”, but warned that groundwork was still necessary to establish girls as “equals” in the nation’s male-dominated culture.“Girls now have a right to go to school and they cannot be turned away, that’s the most exciting news for us,” said Bah.“But this does not address the underlying issue that we still live in a highly patriarchal society where girls’ bodies are demanded, trampled upon and violated in exchange for basically everything they need in life: food, water, transport and education. We must change the underlying reality of the overall powerlessness of girls in Sierra Leone, and we will continue to fight for that.”Marta Colomer, Amnesty International’s west and central Africa acting deputy director of campaigns, said the ruling provided a “glimmer of hope” for girls in Sierra Leone and beyond.“Today’s ruling is a landmark moment for the thousands of girls who have been excluded from school, and whose right to access education without discrimination has been violated for the past four years because of this inherently discriminatory ban,” said Colomer.“This delivers a clear message to other African governments who have similar bans, such as Tanzania and Equatorial Guinea, or may be contemplating them, that they should follow this groundbreaking ruling and take steps to allow pregnant girls access to education in line with their own human rights obligations.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/edf17f1982a6d16e21a8e118194270a1951ce9c7/0_99_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a5e4a89a92898b6c00723e005bbfa56","title":"did marie kondo fans keep their houses tidy all year weve got rid of 20 of our stuff","story":"Not since Mary Poppins wielded a supersized handbag and parrot-topped umbrella has anyone done as much to celebrate tidying up as Marie Kondo. With her perky attitude and impeccable bob, the Japanese decluttering superstar inspired millions across the world to embrace the delight of a spring clean. On New Year’s Day, Netflix released the show Tidying Up With Marie Kondo, a televised version of her series of books, which have sold more than 10m copies in 42 countries.Naturally, it was an instant hit. Sales of drawer iders and storage systems soared, as people confronted the mounds of clutter in their homes and asked themselves the question Kondo suggests you put to every object in your home: “Does it spark joy?” If it does, keep it. If it doesn’t, well, the big black sack is waiting. (After the Netflix show aired, charity shops reported receiving increased donations.) But could the declutterers keep up the regime long-term? Or are their houses as chaotic as they were before? We caught up with five people who tried to Marie Kondo their lives this year.When I fired up Netflix, I thought: “Maybe if I watch someone else tidy up, I’ll feel calmer.” I was expecting it to be happy-clappy American TV, but I watched a few episodes and enjoyed it.My husband and I are in the middle of renovating our house. It’s full of stuff and we’re constantly having to move things around as we do up different rooms. There’s no sense of permanent calm. The only room that isn’t affected is the bedroom, so I thought I’d Marie Kondo it to see if that helped.I went to Ikea and bought some expandable boxes to ide up clothes drawers: one for socks, one for underwear, one for ties. I stacked all my T-shirts vertically, the way she recommends, so you can see everything you own. It feels like you’re filing your clothes! That was a game-changer: in the morning you can pick out what you need really quickly. There was a noticeable feeling of order and calm – for a while. But it was just too difficult to keep up with the renovation work. Looking around my bedroom at the moment, it’s a complete disaster!When the renovation is finished, I probably will Marie Kondo the rest of the house. I’m not attached to crap – I throw it away. My husband is more sentimental, so it will be a struggle to get him on board. He’s obsessed with collecting dinner services at the moment he keeps buying them on eBay. We have three complete sets of plates and crockery, and nowhere for them to go.I had read Kondo’s book about a year previously, and been converted to the KonMari technique for folding socks – I kept taking photos of how cute my socks looked. When the show came out, it totally reignited my love for her.I moved in with my boyfriend last October, and we live in a one-bed flat that doesn’t have a lot of storage space. I also recently started volunteering in a charity shop and it changed my perspective about material possessions. Working there, you see how much stuff we accumulate, and waste.My “spark-joy” instinct is Ninja-level now. It’s so well honed. I can look at any of my possessions and think: “That’s gone.” There’s always a bag by the door full of things to donate. Every two weeks, we’ll take something down to the charity shop. I do wonder how we have any possessions left. But our flat is so cute now. I have less stuff than I’ve ever had before and I’m so happy.The only thing I haven’t been able to part with is my collection of old Smash Hits magazines. It took a few goes for me to let go of my CD collection, but I eventually managed it. But the magazines I can’t bear to touch. Magazines were my thing when I was a kid. If there was a music archive I could donate them to, that would be perfect. I would hate to see them go in the bin.I watched six episodes of the TV show in one go. My husband and I were downsizing and moving to Devon and I figured if I could get him to watch the show with me, he’d get the message that we need to get streamlined. He did pay attention.When we were getting ready to move, I picked up everything I owned and asked myself if it sparked joy. If not, I’d give it to charity, or recycle it. It was stunning to realise how much I was holding on to: 20-year-old Microsoft training manuals from my old job, old university notes, that sort of thing.When I was younger, I used to buy things all the time – clothes or fancy lunches out or makeup. Now I realise I don’t need physical things to make me happy. A walk along the beach, coffee with friends – these things bring me joy.That said, I did recently buy a new vacuum cleaner, which is seriously sparking joy. It arrived today. I can’t wait to try it out.I heard about Marie Kondo towards the end of last year and got the book just before Christmas. And then the show came out. I really liked how she approached things from a perspective of wanting to help people work through their attachments to material things and end up in a better place overall.Growing up, we lived in a fairly big house with plenty of room for stuff, so there was never a need to declutter. My parents tend to hang on to things – they kept a train set from when I was a child, for instance, so that they could gift it to my children when they were born. When I got older and lived in a smaller house, I realised that attitude only works if you have the space for it.The way Kondo teaches you to roll up T-shirts was a revelation. The idea that you can fold things in such a way that they take up so much less space was brilliant.I did declutter my home, but I wasn’t able to get rid of everything. I have this Patti Smith T-shirt I bought in Rome that I’ve never worn – it’s too small. But I haven’t been able to throw it out. I associate the T-shirt with that holiday, and letting go of it would feel like deleting that memory. It’s not rational, but that’s how I feel.When we got back after the Christmas break, all the mums at school were asking each other: “Did you Marie Kondo?” You felt you had missed out if you hadn’t done it. It was a trend, like clean eating or yoga.I spent a week going from room to room, tidying. God’s honest truth, it was the best declutter I’ve ever done. My house was the tidiest it had ever been – for a while.I’ve maintained it to a point, but it’s not been achievable for me to keep up long-term. I live in a two-bedroom house with my husband and two children, and it’s too small for our needs. We have a room in our house that my husband and I jokingly refer to as the “room of doom”. It’s full of winter coats, books, bags for the charity shop. We throw everything in there, so the rest of the house looks OK.Tidying up after yourself straight away is fine when you’re not a working mother with two kids. I don’t want another thing I have to feel guilty about. Besides, with my kids, I’m trying to get them to be more independent in terms of putting things away. I can’t make a five-year-old fold a jumper the Marie Kondo way. Do I encourage them to tidy up on their own, or do I do things for them? I opt for the former.I’ve made peace with the amount of clutter I have in my house. Clutter is real life. That said, my husband has promised to declutter the room of doom. I’m going to hold him to that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f0a76f6bc8b4891193da2310a999d50157ddc28/0_1504_3542_2125/master/3542.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b6f168104c0bf9ca935c7c1d8f5ea76","title":"experience a burglar made me think i was losing my mind","story":"Things were going missing, but everybody told me it was probably nothingLast year, I moved into a new flat in London. It was the first time I’d lived by myself. In the past, I shared a student house with five others, then later with friends. I’d always been fairly messy and if something went missing it was likely it had been borrowed or misplaced. More often than not, it would turn up.But in my new home, living alone, I was exceptionally tidy everything had a place. I’d been there for about six months when I couldn’t find a pair of gold hoop earrings I wear almost every day. I’d been to the park the day before, and felt sad that they must have slipped out without me noticing. A day or two later, I noticed a couple of my rings weren’t there. I told my boyfriend that jewellery had gone missing, and he dismissed it, saying perhaps I’d lost them. I figured he was right. Next it was my work phone – I assumed I’d left it at the office, but it never turned up. I spoke to my parents and explained that things had disappeared, but the flat was immaculately tidy and the TV was still in the living room. They were concerned I was stressed. They said not to worry or I’d drive myself mad.Within a week or two, I started to feel really unsettled. I became emotional, crying a lot, which is unlike me, and feeling inexplicably angry. I’d told colleagues about the missing items and, once again, was told it was probably nothing. I knew something wasn’t right, but other people’s dismissive reactions made me doubt myself.Still, I wanted answers. I started to wonder if there was someone in the basement or if it was a poltergeist. I was feeling desperate by this point and scaring myself. I was starting to worry it was all in my head. I have anxiety and had been off medication for more than a year. I knew I couldn’t keep feeling like this – on edge and out of character.I called the doctor and explained. I was crying down the phone. She was worried about me and suggested I went back on my medication, and take a stronger dose. Very quickly, an appointment was made for me to have an assessment.That night, as I was watching TV, I noticed something was amiss. I have a nebuliser for a lung condition – I don’t use it often, but it’s on the shelf in the living room if I need it. I noticed that the zip was partially open I hadn’t touched it for over a year. That’s when I knew someone had been in my home. The next day, the girls in my office helped me to come up with a plan to leave a cash trap. Then I remembered there was cash in my desk. I called my boyfriend, who had stayed overnight, to check if it was still there. It had gone, as had our designer sunglasses. We realised a lot of things were gone, including an unopened Apple TV that had been in the back of a cupboard.I called the police and explained to forensics that there was no sign of forced entry the locks hadn’t been picked, there was no broken glass. The things that had gone were small – no family heirlooms. The police were as sure as they could be that a thief had come through the window. It’s a Victorian house and the wooden window frames are easy to prise open. They said stealth burglaries – where there isn’t visible damage – are fairly common, as there’s less evidence and people don’t raise the alarm for a few days. I still don’t know if it was someone coming in and out, or if it happened only once. Emotionally, it was confusing, as if I had been gaslit by a burglar. The thought I could be ill was frightening – I did wonder at the start if I was losing it.Since then, my boyfriend has moved in. We’ve had the windows replaced and the locks changed. We have CCTV as well. But, only six weeks later, we were burgled again – this time, not in a tidy, stealthy way. I came home and the door had been kicked in and the place was ransacked. The police don’t think it was linked, but they said it is common for burglars to return.I never picked up my prescription. In the time between me calling the doctor and discovering it was a burglary, I’d realised I wasn’t losing my mind. I feel a lot better knowing that, but it still knocked me for six. It was almost better when the door was kicked in.• As told to Sophie HaydockDo you have an experience to share?

I’m sitting at a table with my hands clasped at my chin. I probably look like I’m meditating, praying, or just deep in thought. But I’m gripping and releasing, gripping and releasing my hands in rhythm with clenching my jaw as I think about the lists I need to make and the events I must control to get through holidays.I remind myself to try to enjoy the season, let happier thoughts diffuse the seriousness and the desperate gripping. But this is life with obsessive compulsive disorder. Every person with OCD has a unique experience, but for me it boils down to obsession with order and correctness, intrusive thoughts about catastrophe, and rituals to maintain an illusion of control.The holidays are a soup of stress that stirs up and intensifies the components of my OCD because of travel anxiety, being away from home, more socializing, pressure to make holidays special and obsession with holiday catastrophes. Holiday catastrophes make for headlines that become legendarily tragic because of their proximity to the “most wonderful time of the year”.These are actual headlines from last Christmas:Plane makes emergency landing on Alabama highway.Fire kills woman and three holiday houseguests.Community mourns loss of family members in tragic Christmas Day crash.While I was thinking about tragic holiday headlines to include in this piece, a friend I was texting back and forth with suddenly wrote that there was an emergency and he had to run. So now my OCD will make me think I have created whatever emergency he suddenly had to go handle by just thinking about those headlines.To spend Christmas with extended family, my husband, two kids and I will drive about 1,500 miles round-trip. During those trips, I won’t be able to escape hours and hours of intrusive thoughts that we will be the next headline: “Family of four killed in fiery interstate crash on Christmas Eve.” (I just knocked three times on the floor to un-jinx writing that. Then I deleted it and restarted my computer to really clean it out. And I rewrote the sentence. Because I can’t tell this story without stirring up the fear. Now I’m gripping my hands again, hoping we will be safe this year.)Intrusive thoughts are a bully determined to ruin our fun. I call my bully Zephyrus, Greek god of the west wind. He blows chaos and stirs up fear. He smirks over a festive family scene of torn wrapping paper and scattered boxes. He whispers in my ear so I can only see the disorder, not the joy. I fight Zephyrus, fight being childish, irritable and difficult like he is.Planning, counting, listing and reassurance seeking are the tools (compulsions) I use to create the illusion of control. To prepare for our trip, I will make packing lists and task lists to complete before packing can even start. First all of the laundry has to be washed, folded and put away. Only when everything is in its place and in order can I start to pack our bags with the “correct” items. Packing prep drags on for days. The lists give birth to sublists that are never really completed because time comes to hit the road.I’ll try to impose order inside the car to counteract malicious fates that could be traveling with us. I’ll keep a strict schedule of stopping every two hours to stretch and refuel while pretending it’s all spontaneous and I haven’t been counting the minutes. My husband knows I have a secret schedule and that I will get more anxious if we veer from it. The kids just look forward to each stop as a new adventure and a chance to get a treat. For me, it is a chance to unclench my teeth. Focusing on “the plan” helps to blur the near constant violent images of our mangled car flying off a bridge.I won’t mention the imagined car crashes out loud because naming them could tempt the fates too far (and infect my family with the same disturbing images). Instead, I’ll seek reassurance in smaller ways, asking the kids: “Do you feel OK? How are you? Do you need something? Are you having fun? Are you warm enough?”I’ll ask my husband: “How are you doing? Do you need to stop? Do you think we remembered everything? Are you sure you saw both of our cats before we left? And there’s plenty of water for them? Did you hold the mail? Do you think there will be a hailstorm that causes enough roof damage to flood the house while we are gone?”“Anna, we have insurance,” he says, sounding a little exhausted. He is used to this routine.I was a preteen when compulsions snuck into my life. I liked to play solitaire, but first I had to be sure the cards were perfectly random so I would shuffle seven times for a perfectly mixed deck. A magic number, a concrete ritual. (I do love cards and how they contain both order and chaos.)I probably just looked like a kid who liked fidgeting with cards. But this was a compulsion. I had to check the cards by flipping each one and counting “ace, two, three, four …”, looking for cards to match my counting. The longer I had to search for the card as I counted, the more bad luck accumulated.Counting rituals carried over into adulthood. I count while I wash dishes, I count while I fold laundry. Load 10 dishes on the bottom rack, load 10 dishes in the top rack, repeat. Fold 10 pieces of laundry, put the stack away, repeat. Doing things the “right” number of times – usually 10 – is a balm on my constant fear that things are disintegrating around me.I was 30 before I learned these things fell under the clinical umbrella of OCD. At the end of a session, my therapist Ellen said, casually: “I’m concerned about your obsessions and compulsions. Let’s talk more about it next time.” Obsessions? Compulsions? No, I thought, these are just the things I have to do to keep everything fair and safe and right. Oh.I have practiced exposure and response prevention, lying on my “dirty” kitchen floor, forcing myself to stare into the grimiest corners and measuring my anxiety until it peaked and then subsided. I have used meditation for travel anxiety to counteract the car crash images in my head. Cognitive behavioral therapy and antidepressants help too. With all of these tools and treatments, my OCD is now merely annoying and not debilitating.The illusion of control is an attractive deception, a slick conman. No amount of organization, planning or counting will prevent my house from burning down, or the cats dying, or a burglary while we are away. No ritual (except maybe extra handwashing) will prevent a family member from being seriously ill during the holidays. That magical time of fun, family, peace and joy is the worst magical time to be injured or ill. The worst-case scenario intrudes again.The worst-case scenario already kind of happened anyway, when my husband was admitted to the hospital with pneumonia right after Christmas three years ago. I watched my invincible bear of a husband collapse in a parking lot, coughing up blood. Our return home was delayed by a week while he recovered, and it was all totally out of my control. With nothing to control, I just sat with him in the hospital and actually relaxed. It was a case of unintended exposure therapy, and it actually worked. I’ll try to remember that going into this year’s trip. But right now, I have to go. There’s laundry to do and traveling routes to go over. There are lists to be made. There are lists to re-check, as I try to remember not to grip my hands too tightly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5c914ef1d269ab9726a01209e88ce2702c285d9/0_148_4446_2668/master/4446.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23d123a9f3cd36a3498b54bf10a018e2","title":"what would you like us to cover in 2020 share your thoughts","story":"We want to know what you hope to make space for next year and what you would like to see us coverAs 2019 comes to a close, we want to reflect on our journalism and look ahead to next year’s stories.

Thankfully, as many health experts – and a 2017 “Love Potatoes” campaign from the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board – have pointed out, this staple of British cuisine is low in fat, high in fibre and a great source of energy. Bonus points if you eat the vitamin-packed skin.But making an effort not to bin the peel isn’t going to solve the problem of food waste alone. The potato has long been a contributor to the more than £1bn of produce thrown away every year before it even reaches a supermarket.“Potato growing is not precision agriculture. You’re much more at the whim of Mother Nature than with some other vegetables. From year to year, exactly what’s coming at us has quite a lot of variation to it,” explains James Truscott, managing director of Branston.Branston is nearing its 30th anniversary with Tesco, for whom it processes over a third of a million tonnes of potatoes annually. That’s a lot of spuds.To ensure supermarket success, the produce must meet the expectations of customers – some of whom are swayed by appearance. While food-waste-reducing efforts such as “wonky veg bags”, including Tesco’s Perfectly Imperfect range, have emerged in recent years, Truscott points out that we need to be realistic about what sells.“There is an increasing number of consumers who have food waste much higher up their priority list than they might have done a few years ago, which is great. And things like “wonky veg” have real resonance for some customers. But the reality is, great-looking produce sells better.”However, oversized or undersized potatoes are attractive to ready meal manufacturers, something Tesco recognised five years ago when it was trying to find ways to reduce food waste across its business – part of its commitment that no food fit to eat should go to waste across its entire UK operations.Branston, in turn, was able to invest in state-of-the-art peelers that can cope with the wonky veg.“We now take a really big proportion of those secondary potatoes, peel them and then send them off to Samworths to become the mash on the top of a cottage pie,” says Truscott. “Finding other routes to market for the crop is key. We can offer a product customers want and still find a really good added-value home for the rest of it.”Branston sends 350 tonnes of product a week to Samworths from its potato-peeling unit, which means that ready meal we grab when we’re too tired to cook may be more sustainable than we think.But that’s not all. Keen to further stamp out food waste, Branston and Tesco are embracing state-of-the-art technology, an investment that has been helped by a five-year contract to supply Tesco with most of its fresh potatoes. Introducing the “digital potato”, which predicts how likely the crop is to get damaged during harvesting, washing and sorting.“It looks like a potato, but it’s bright orange and blue,” says Truscott. “It’s basically got a load of sensors in it. You plant it in the field, and then harvest it and see how much damage happens on the harvester. You can put it through washes and graders on the production lines too to see if there are particular points of impact, so that we can address those with a smarter design.”And just when you thought the potato couldn’t get more high-tech, Truscott reveals that the company has launched a new system that started life as a 3D camera from an Xbox.“We will mount it on harvesters and it will count and size all of the potatoes on the harvest bed, so we know exactly what’s coming at us,” he explains.“Right now, growers go into a potato field with a fork, dig up a few potato plants and measure them. It’s a method that’s been used for centuries, but it’s a tiny snapshot and statistically not a very good view as to what’s coming.”The camera will enable growers to see the size profile and expected yield of crop for every field. This information will hopefully generate fewer potatoes that would have otherwise gone to waste.“We’re really excited about technology, because it’ll help growers get better at what they do in the field, and therefore be more sustainable,” says Truscott. “But it’ll also allow us to plan really, really well.”Tesco’s long-term partnerships with its suppliers means they can then invest in new technology, such as Branston’s major investment in handling and packing tech, and work together to cut food waste.Giving potatoes a new lease of life is not the only way that Tesco is working with its suppliers to reduce the impact producing food has on the environment. Tesco and WWF are working together to halve the environmental impact of the average UK shopping basket, partnering with suppliers to drive innovation and tackle sustainability challenges across their supply chains, starting with some of the most popular products in the modern basket, like potatoes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ac848d224c9fb92853df841e80551ad4d7156e4/0_55_1731_1039/master/1731.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6bd665bce9a0c3e342df6a089a1e181f","title":"we feed 2000 children turning surplus food into free school meals in kenya","story":"One international grower has found an ingenious way to use up surplus produce – while also benefiting its local communitySome pupils at Maua school in Naivasha, Kenya, were so hungry that they’d skip school to search the bushes for wild fruit. Others who didn’t cut class would steal from nearby shops so they’d have something to eat for lunch.Headteacher Rosalin Wafula was growing concerned with the high levels of truancy and signs of poor concentration in the 850 students she looks after.“Some children had food some did not. In a school, we should have equality. But many would feel out of place because they didn’t have anything to eat,” she says.But thanks to a new scheme that turns surplus food from local packhouses into free meals for children, Wafula has seen a big improvement in attendance and classroom participation.Stevenage-based Flamingo Produce has been supplying vegetables such as green beans, baby corn and broccoli from Kenya to Tesco in the UK since 1994, and was looking for ways to reduce food waste and benefit the community at the same time.“In Kenya, we end up with a lot of green beans that are too curly. In the UK, you may have the opportunity to sell them as part of Tesco’s ‘perfectly imperfect’ veg range. But we’re 6,000 miles away and flying such a product is not environmentally, or economically, very wise,” managing director Ian Michell explains.Flamingo had already taken small steps to tackle food waste, such as no longer trimming green beans before they are transported and sold. But Michell knew more could be done.Working with Tesco, he came up with the idea of setting up kitchens in the Kenya packhouse to make soup from the leftover vegetables to give to children at lunchtime. The scheme is based on the supermarket’s Community Food Connection programme in the UK, where leftover food from stores is donated to local charities. To date, Tesco has donated more than 150m meals from surplus food to local charities worldwide.“We’re now feeding 2,000 children a day,” Michell says.It wasn’t as simple as it sounds, though, recalls HR manager Tabitha Ngaywa. Soup isn’t a particularly common meal in Kenya. She was worried the kids wouldn’t actually want to eat it. Luckily, Flamingo Produce’s canteen manager was able to work with pupils and their parents to create a hot meal that the community could enjoy.“We don’t really appreciate soup in Kenya. So when the idea came to us it was a little bit difficult for us to imagine how it would be done,” Ngaywa reveals.Parents, pupils and teachers were brought on board to test the dish. Once feedback was positive, Flamingo Produce went ahead with the pilot in March, recruiting extra staff to help prepare and transport the meals.According to Wafula, Ngaywa needn’t have worried – children often ask for second helpings. She’s seen a great improvement in the quality of their work and attitude in the classroom, too.“Some of these children might not have had dinner the night before, or a proper breakfast in the morning. Their concentration was very low. But now they are very eager to learn. They are able to stay in class and participate. So they love it.”The scheme is in place across two schools in Naivasha now, and Flamingo Produce plans to roll it out to the company’s packhouses in Peru, Guatemala and Morocco soon.“Tesco’s help and funding will allow us to scale this into different regions all over the world. My target is 2m school meals in the year 2020,” says Michell. “We also hope to take a lot more of our products and make them into nutritious meals with long shelf lives. This will help us transport the product anywhere in the world to low-income families.”As Wafula points out, the promise of a free, nutritious meal each day can have a positive impact on mental wellbeing.“Every child should have that sense of belonging. And now, everyone feels equal because they all have something to eat.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ec2ee33ef3603bfb98e711aa208c5042cff1093/0_447_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e325271ee079f57bf5ff9a86617f1839","title":"fank zappa hot rats album music anniversary","story":"The 50th anniversary of the experimental musician’s album Hot Rats carries with it resurfaced material and a re-examination of its finer pointsThe first songs most people hear as children are nursery rhymes and lullabies. The first songs Ahmet Zappa heard as a child were the shock-treatment tracks on Hot Rats, a groundbreaking 1969 set by his father Frank. “This is the stuff I was drinking my milk bottles to,” Zappa said with a giggle. “It’s magical.”He isn’t the only one who thinks so. Though Frank Zappa released no fewer than 62 albums in his too-short life – and though nearly as many sets have appeared since his death from prostate cancer at age 53 in 1993 – none sound quite like Hot Rats. It’s a work of such imagination, humor and freedom, it could appeal to a child as easily as it could a stoner, a rocker, or a fan of the avant garde. Zappa’s first true solo album, Hot Rats introduced new recording techniques, melded previously segregated styles, and even presaged a new musical genre. It also broke with the structure of previous Zappa releases. It resonated with progressive rock fans in a way no other Zappa album has, earning generous FM radio play while sending it into the UK top 10, boosted by one of the most recognizable instrumental tracks of the psychedelic era, Peaches En Regalia.To celebrate, and document, all these innovations, the Zappa Trust are releasing a six CD box set compiled of Rats-related material, timed with the album’s 50th anniversary. There’s also a related tome titled The Hot Rats Book, which concentrates on photos taken from the album’s historic sessions by Bill Gubbins. And Dweezil Zappa is currently on the road with a tour titled Hot Rats \u0026amp Other Hot Stuff, which features material from the album. “With this box set, for the first time in 50 years you get to hear the whole composition of each song as it was recorded, and as it developed,” said Joe Travers, who has served as “vaultmeister” of Zappa’s music for the last 27 years and who helped curate the set.While many box projects that intend to chronicle, and illuminate, classic albums waste space with mild variations on the official versions of a song, most of the tracks on the Rats box differ greatly from those listeners have previously heard. The dense and raucous jams that inspired the final cuts have been fully restored, and assembled in an order that makes the development of the official versions clear. “It provides context for the final product,” said Ian Underwood, who played a plethora of instruments on Rats and who is the only musician, besides Zappa, who appeared on every track. “Like ‘process art’, you can hear all the things leading up to a track, so you get a feel for how it arrived at the end. It’s also interesting to see what didn’t work out along the way.”The explorative quality that informed the project reflected an especially fraught, and productive, period in Zappa’s career. He had just broken up the original Mothers of Invention, due to the cost of maintaining them and the toil in rallying them. And four months before he entered the studio for the Rats sessions, he wrapped production on another milestone album, Trout Mask Replica by Captain Beefheart. Technically, Hot Rats was Zappa’s second solo album, though his first, Lumpy Gravy, was an orchestral work which he conducted rather than played on. “Frank always considered Hot Rats his real solo debut,” Travers said.The music itself was nearly all instrumental. For Rats, Zappa ditched the satirical lyrical pieces that helped define the Mothers. There’s only one vocal segment, from Captain Beefheart at the start of Willie the Pimp, a low-down blues rock track which he delivered like a surreal Howlin’ Wolf. The lyrics in the song contain the album’s title which, Frank reveals in a spoken word section of the box set, was inspired by an Archie Shepp recording of The Shadow of Your Smile. “He played this solo that sounded to me like an army of pre-heated rats screaming out of his saxophone,” Zappa says on the set.To suit the wildness, most songs on Rats last far longer than those on the Mothers albums to that date, elaborated by roiling jams, especially in the nearly 13-minute The Gumbo Variations. The only Mother member retained for the final album was Underwood, though several others from the band, including Roy Estrada and Jimmy Carl Black, performed on sessions which are revealed for the first time on the box set. Underwood considered the elaborately composed music Zappa gave him to play for the album challenging. “You can’t play those parts by just looking at them and fobbing them off,” he said. “You have to really pay attention.”For the rhythm section on Rats, Zappa hired experienced session guys, including drummer John Guerin and bassist Max Bennett who, collectively, worked with everyone from Ella Fitzgerald to the Partridge Family. But the standout hires were Don “Sugarcane” Harris and Jean-Luc Ponty, who each played dynamic electric violin. It’s one of the first, and certainly the most influential, uses of that instrument in a popular setting, presaging a whole trend in rock bands employing electric violins, from Papa John Creach in Hot Tuna, to David Cross in King Crimson to Jerry Goodman in Mahavishnu Orchestra. In fact, Mahavishnu leader John McLaughlin first wanted to hire Ponty as his violinist, based, in part, on Hot Rats, but immigration problems forced him to look elsewhere. The jazz-rock fusion style that Mahavishnu advanced in 1971 can be traced directly to Rats. In fact, Rats rates as one of the first-ever fusion albums, along with works recorded in the same year by Miles Davis and the Tony Williams Lifetime. More, Rats was the first Zappa album that made full use of 16-track equipment, allowing the star to easily overdub every crazy sound in his head. “He could greatly expand his sound palate,” Travers said.The album also saw Zappa greatly advancing techniques he had earlier attempted in tape speed manipulation. “Frank would take one instrument, like the bass guitar, and do tape adjustments that, once sped up, would sound like a clarinet,” said Travers. “Or he would speed it up even further to stand in for a flute.”The result gave some of the music a highly animated, and decidedly comedic, sound, especially in Peaches En Regalia. In sections of that song, Underwood’s array of woodwinds and horns had the character and color of cartoons, to the listeners’ delight. “Frank said Peaches is a song that nobody disliked,” Travers said.Similarly, the whole album had an infectious energy, giving it a connection to the great psychedelic rock albums of the day, despite all its avant-garde, jazz and classical influences. Though Ahmet Zappa pointed out that “Frank was never motivated by commercial success,” he did write humorous radio commercials to lure people into the music. One, included on the box set, features an authoritative voice announcing, “the music was written by Frank Zappa. In spite of that fact, we think you should obtain it.”“Frank was aware of the image he had,” Travers said. “He knew that Hot Rats was a departure and he wanted people to give the album a chance.”Those that did so found a work cohesive enough to live up to Zappa’s description of Rats as “a movie for the mind”. “If you listen to the whole album, it’s a progression,” Underwood said. “It’s not just a series of cuts and then you’re done. There’s forward motion.”Given that, it’s no surprise that Ahmet Zappa – who wasn’t born until five years after the album appeared – has found Hot Rats entrancing since childhood. “My father was a musical warlock,” he said. “The music he wrote then was just unreal.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e013c2f5df42227bb0a8d643282473879b38fe31/163_1367_1739_1043/master/1739.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bbfa80cc1ad2b98b0bf82861d194c66e","title":"stormzy heavy is the head album review merky","story":"(#MerkyAtlantic UK)He’s become so famous that even the Archbishop of Canterbury loves him – but this brilliant second album shows how difficult Stormzy finds stardom“When Banksy put the vest on me,” says Stormzy, a matter of minutes in to his second album, “it felt like God was testing me.” It’s the second time he’s mentioned his headlining appearance at this year’s Glastonbury in as many tracks, but who can blame him? A risky but ultimately triumphant, even epochal performance, it served to underline Stormzy’s unique position among his UK rap peers.Britain is currently teeming with fantastic MCs, but Stormzy is the only one your dad knows the name of. In the two years since the release of his debut album, Gang Signs \u0026amp Prayer, he has become a boundary-crossing figure in British cultural life. Not only is he able to take a single as uncommercial as the dark, minimal Vossi Bop to No 1, but he has translated his commercial success into roles as a philanthropist, publisher and activist with enough clout to have his opinions raised by those interviewing the prime minister. He has attracted praise not just from the usual sources but from the vice-chancellor of Cambridge University and the Archbishop of Canterbury, who has said he prepares for officiating major events by listening to Stormzy’s 2017 single Blinded By Your Grace: neither are figures noted for their in-depth knowledge of freestyles, diss tracks and Lord of the Mics clashes.Of course, an MC’s success isn’t dependent on establishment approval. Nevertheless, no other figure in UK rap history has achieved anything like this. Understandably, Heavy Is the Head begins in triumphal style: the brassy fanfare of Big Michael heralds lyrics that enumerate Stormzy’s achievements and tell his rivals where to get off in characteristic style (“Suck your mum”). But the celebratory mood lasts only two tracks, before the album’s emotional temperature plummets.It’s perhaps a stretch to describe Heavy Is the Head as grime’s answer to In Utero – Kurt Cobain never took time out from howling his distress at Nirvana’s newfound celebrity to inform his audience that, on the upside, he just bought an £140,000 Richard Mille watch. But the picture Stormzy paints of stardom is a pretty bleak one an unremitting parade of jealous friends, unwarranted criticism, ever-increasing numbers of enemies and damage to his mental and physical health, in which the only consolation, luxury Swiss watches aside, comes from a combination of regularly skinning up and religious faith. “Holy blood of Christ,” he says on the wracked Do Better, “you never let me down.”You do sometimes wonder if he wouldn’t be better off leaving Twitter and ignoring the comments sections rather than scanning them for slights. The kind of when’s-International-Men’s-Day? dimwit who takes to social media to decry as racist Stormzy’s bursary to help underprivileged black kids study at Cambridge is probably best ignored rather than responded to in song. And there is a distinct and affecting tang of realism to his stories of visiting a therapist, and feeling disquiet about his role as a political figure: “I don’t want no bloody stripes for it,” he protests on One Second. The same goes for the self-lacerating depiction of a failed romantic relationship on Lessons.What Heavy Is the Head doesn’t do is the one thing you might have expected it to: train its sights on success in the US. One Second features a vocal from Grammy-winning American singer-songwriter HER, but elsewhere the guests are resolutely British, as are the lyrical reference points. “I still keep some dragons with me like I’m Peter Jones,” Stormzy offers at one juncture, while Headie One’s appearance on Audacity contains the memorable car-related boast “I just done 100 through Canterbury”, and Aitch contributes a scene-stealing Manc-accented rap to Pop Baby. The music, too, speaks loudly about growing up in early- to mid-00s Britain. Rainfall interpolates the chorus from Shackles (Praise You) by Mary Mary, one of the few straight-ahead gospel tracks to overcome traditional British squeamishness about musical God-bothering and make the UK Top 10. Rachael’s Little Brother samples its hook from Baby Boy, a 2003 hit by dimly-remembered UK pop-rap collective Big Brovaz. The black empowerment message of Superheroes, meanwhile, is underscored by oddly melancholy music, which turns out to be based on British R\u0026ampB singer Keisha White’s theme tune to tween-friendly CBBC series The Story of Tracy Beaker.Perhaps more important than its references to the era when Stormzy was a tweenager himself is how perfectly balanced the music on Heavy Is the Head is. It shifts from the soft-rock-ish electric piano of Lessons to the flatly brilliant assemblage of lo-fi samples and warped vocal effects of Handsome, but it consistently hits a sweet spot. It is packed with memorable hooks – singles Vossi Bop and Wiley Freestyle are by some distance the least obviously commercial things here – but never sounds obvious or craven in its desire for chart success. Along the way, you get a lot of Stormzy the crooner, his charmingly untutored style contrasting with the melismatic fireworks of vocalist Yebba on Don’t Forget to Breathe. Not even the standard criticism that it’s a couple of tracks too long can detract from the feeling that it’s going to replicate its predecessor’s success. If its author is an uncomfortable with his fame as Heavy Is the Head regularly suggests, his discomfort looks set to last a lot longer.Plan B: First Past the PostIt may be irrelevant by the time you read this, but Ben Drew’s guide to tactical voting is smart, funny and informative: the ability of the internet to deliver reactive topical protest music used to great effect."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7679c932ee4d1c93b3633b4b97422fff893d117/0_232_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45cb25ef66ab724e8a25b203c1e1430f","title":"election 2019 john crace on the lowlights and the gaffes","story":"’s political sketch writer, John Crace, runs through the highs and the many, many lows of the 2019 general election campaign.

But it is the manner of the defeat that is so telling, where outside London and the big cities of England and Wales, the party lost a string of long-held seats.The 2019 election turned out exactly as billed – the Brexit election – and Labour’s counter, post-austerity narrative failed to resonate: the question will be whether this amounts to a permanent alignment in British politics, with echoes of Trump-era US, or a one-off attempt by the public to get Brexit over the line."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ba53f81de562a80d74af0db29bbdac78df1c482/0_0_3679_2208/master/3679.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f0d7b27eaa21ebc4991b2ce5cbdef35","title":"election winners and losers few bright notes on a grim night for labour","story":"Jo Swinson and Jeremy Corbyn’s hopes took a battering as under-fire Tories held onAs election night wore on, the fates of politicians from across the political spectrum hung in the balance. Here are the winners, the losers and the survivors.Lib Dem, East DunbartonshireOnly elected Lib Dem leader this summer when the party was still high on the success of its EU election campaign, Swinson played a key role in triggering this general election when she decided to back Boris Johnson’s calls for a vote. She decided to run a presidential campaign on an explicit platform of revoking Brexit – saying she was aiming to be prime minister – but the message failed to land with the public and her popularity plummeted. On a personal level, she paid the price for spending too long on the campaign trail and not long enough in her Scottish constituency, ultimately losing to the SNP by 149 votes. Her defeat means the Lib Dems are staring at another leadership election.Labour, BolsoverThe Beast of Bolsover is no more. Dennis Skinner served 49 years as Labour MP for the Derbyshire seat but the former miner was voted out by his constituents in favour of the Conservative candidate, despite regularly voting with the government on Brexit legislation. Skinner would have became Father of the House – the longest serving member of the Commons – if he had been re-elected. Instead he has been replaced with Conservative Mark Fletcher, who paid tribute to a “wonderful constituency MP” and told Skinner that “the love and affection of the people of Bolsover are still with you”.Conservatives, Richmond ParkThe former mayor of London candidate was undone by his longstanding pro-Brexit views, losing out to the Liberal Democrats in one of the few positive results of the night for Swinson’s party. Goldsmith was replaced by Sarah Olney, who took a large 7,766-vote majority.Conservatives, Chingford and Woodford GreenLabour chucked everything it could at taking out the former Conservative party leader, a longtime Brexiter, in his outer London constituency. Hundreds of activists pounded the streets but could not do enough to get over the line, with Duncan Smith winning by 23,481 votes to Labour’s 22,419.Conservatives, Esher and WaltonThe Liberal Democrats were quietly confident of taking the Surrey constituency from the pro-Brexit foreign secretary by appealing to remain voters to lend their votes to the party. Although the Lib Dems tripled their vote compared with 2017, this was still not enough to get them over the line.Labour, WorkingtonThe Cumbrian coastal constituency was flooded with journalists after the Tory thinktank Onward suggested that “Workington man” represented the older, working-class male voters who the Conservatives would need to win over. Although mocked at the time, the prediction appears to have been vindicated. Sue Hayman, who had served in Jeremy Corbyn’s shadow cabinet for the last two years, had been hoping to go into government as environment secretary. Instead, she has found herself out of a job after the Conservatives won the constituency for the first time at a general election, breaking more than a century of Labour dominance.Labour, WansbeckThe Labour party co-chair and former president of the National Union of Mineworkers has been an enthusiastic supporter of Corbyn and played a key role in shaping the campaign, regularly appearing on the airwaves to push the party’s policies. But Lavery only just held on to his Northumberland seat after a recount and saw his majority cut from 10,435 to 814. The once-solid Labour constituency, which did not register as a potential battleground in this general election, will be a key Tory target in the next contest.Lib Dem, Cities of London and WestminsterUntil February Chuka Umunna was the Labour MP for Streatham. Following a botched attempt to start a new political party under the banner of Change UK, he defected to the Liberal Democrats and decided to target the remain-voting Tory-held central London constituency of Cities of London and Westminster. But the remain vote was split between the Lib Dems and Labour, enabling the Conservatives to emerge victorious – potentially ending Umunna’s political career. A similar fate hit his former Change UK colleagues who defected to the Lib Dems. Sarah Wollaston, who stood for the party in Totnes was defeated, while Luciana Berger narrowly missed out in Finchley and Golders Green. All of the MPs who defected from major parties this year failed to get re-elected under their new party banners, including Anna Soubry.Labour, Stoke-on-Trent CentralThe Labour MP lost his seat as the party faced a wipeout in the Potteries. He told the BBC he blamed Labour’s vague Brexit policy for the defeat, saying the leadership did not appreciate the damage caused in traditional Labour seats outside London by the party’s shift towards a remain position. He told the BBC:  “Some of the siren voices in the shadow cabinet who have big Liberal Democrat votes in their London seats decided that stopping Brexit – and therefore lining themselves up for future leadership bids – was much more important than respecting the vote in marginal constituencies. They’ve sacrificed us for whatever political ambitions they want to do next.”DUP, Belfast NorthThe leader of the DUP in Westminster, Dodds played a key role in pushing the party to a pro-Brexit position and led it during its negotiations with the Conservatives as it propped up the minority government. But Boris Johnson abandoned the unionist party when he struck his Brexit deal and Dodds has now paid the price, losing to Sinn Féin’s John Finucane, who fought on a pro-remain platform.Labour, PutneyA rare Labour gain on an otherwise grim night for Corbyn’s party. Anderson took the inner London constituency from the Conservatives, after Justine Greening, a former Tory cabinet minister, decided to stand down. Putney received extra attention when the Momentum founder, Jon Lansman, a key Corbyn ally, told ITV that the constituency showed how some parts of the country were attracted to the Labour manifesto: “It’s all very well saying the policies have been rejected … The voters in Putney aren’t horrified by the policies.”Alliance, North DownThe Northern Irish constituency had been represented by the independent unionist Sylvia Hermon since 2001, with the DUP pushing hard to take the seat. But in a sign of trouble for Arlene Foster’s party, it instead lost to the candidate from the cross-community Alliance party by 2,968 votes.Labour, PeterboroughForbes became one of the shortest-serving MPs, having only been elected six months ago in a closely fought byelection for the key swing seat. The loss of Peterborough, which has swung between the Tories and Labour, was another indication that Corbyn’s party was suffering across the board. The new MP for the seat will be the Conservative Paul Bristow.Labour, SedgefieldTony Blair’s former aide Phil Wilson was yet another Labour MP ousted by the Conservative wave that swept across the north of England. Although the pattern reflects other Labour defeats across the country, the loss of the former prime minister’s County Durham constituency is a symbolic blow to the party.Labour, North West DurhamThe 32-year-old Labour rising star had been tipped a potential candidate to stand for party leader in the event of a Labour defeat, having already gained the backing of leading figures on the left of the party. But in the event the defeat was so substantial that the shadow cabinet minister’s own seat was lost.

PostconventionalThat Corbyn chooses to go at his own timing is so laughable. The man has just eviscerated the Labour party (am I allowed to say fu*ked on here?). Just more evidence why no one should be voting Labour ever again. mstromaineI’m not sure why the result is surprising, as it falls well within the margins consistently predicted by opinion polls throughout the campaign. I guess people are cynical about their validity, due to getting predictions wrong in the past. Labour will need to start accepting the fact that people are voting with a national identity as the main driving force, currently. While people do have concerns about health, education and public services, as well as the climate crisis, Labour needs to sell itself as a patriotic party again and make people feel proud of it. RoryWell done UK. You have just voted for another five years of the same crap as the last nine. Never mind eh? Boris Johnson will still act in that cuddly toy mode and you will smile while he screws the country, your life, and your family to the brink of destruction. Well done again from the homeless, the disabled, the young and the old who will suffer with you without the smile. GaryrobJeremy Corbyn needs to resign today - this waffle about a “period of reflection” sounds like it was written before the actual result was known. The full, toxic horror of this result is on him and I don’t want to see him on my TV anymore. embolaliaThe whole world is laughing at Britain. JSpicoliTBH I wasn’t expecting Labour to do well anyone outside Momentum could see Corbyn was an extremely hard sell. What is amazing is how poorly the Lib Dems did I don’t think it was their Brexit strategy, it was choosing Jo Swinson who turned out to be a very poor choice and made absolutely no impact, people were talking 100 seat upside, dear oh dear oh dear. Despite everything I cannot believe that the British people elected Bojo, this was an actual joke scenario a year ago. It should be informative to Labour though the British public are a lot more to the right then you think they are and currently foisting the likes of Miliband and Corbyn on them just ensures you defeat. MRTeeI feel very sad for Jeremy Corbyn. A good man who was ripped to pieces every day since in power by many a nasty folk. At least he kept his place as an MP. His constituency know he is a decent fellow, unlike the other nasties, still putting the boot in.

This election should have been an open goal for Labour and would have been with any remotely competent leader. Anybody who could lose so spectacularly to that buffoon Johnson is clearly unequipped to lead anything more demanding than an allotment cooperative. Get out, Jeremy, and take your coterie of pie in the sky, incompetent dreamers with you. Can we please have somebody with a grain of intelligence and feet firmly on the ground to lead the opposition? billkitI am 55 and this is the first time I have ever cried about an election result. Why did Labour lose? Corbyn. He is far too radical for 21st century Britain. People fear change, especially if their lives are comfortable – or even a tad uncomfortable, they prefer to keep the status quo rather than take a chance on the unknown. Brexit. Like it or not, the nation voted to leave the EU and Labour were perceived as attempting to thwart Brexit and reverse the referendum result. Labour will need to reform and rebuild the party. It will take a decade to do that. Meanwhile we have another five years of the Tories to look forward to.

For a Botvinnik parallel, look at his famous 1968 win against Lajos Portisch where the f1 rook makes five moves out of 21 before its capture allows a forced win.Long ago chess was banned by Beijing for the first eight years of the Cultural Revolution. Then in 1975 the Malaysian patron Dato Tan, in partnership with Chinese officials, conceived and financed the “Big Dragon” project to make China a global chess power. Its model was the USSR’s state-run strategy in the 1930s and 40s which led to victory over the US in 1945 and a hegemony which, Bobby Fischer apart, ended only with the breakup of the Soviet Union.First China captured the women’s world title from the previously dominant Georgians then they advanced in the biennial team Olympiad until winning it in 2014 and finally, after many years when Chinese grandmasters stalled in the top 20 or 30, they found Ding, who in the second half of 2019 has won both the Sinquefield Cup and the Grand Tour ahead of Carlsen.Carlsen himself has not lost a classical game in the whole of 2019, and his current unbeaten streak now stretches to 107 games. Four more are needed at Tata Steel Wijk aan Zee in January to break Sergei Tiviakov’s record of 110 against weaker opposition in 2004-05. No 107, Carlsen’s second classical game against Levon Aronian at Olympia, took the Norwegian close to the brink before a miraculous escape saved half a point. Afterwards Carlsen called it “an awful game, quality wise”.Carlsen, who dropped from third to fourth in a field of over seven million at Fantasy Premier League last weekend, explained his cryptic response: “In fantasy football I’m both an optimist and an Optamist,” by adding that he relies on a mix of statistical data and his own intuition.Though the Grand Prix final won by Ding Liren and the British Knockout championship, where Michael Adams beat David Howell in the final, were the major events at Olympia, the Fide-rated Open produced a result for the future. Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa, already one of the youngest ever grandmasters at 12 and the youngest ever major tournament winner at 13, reached another milestone, a 2600 rating, when at 14 years and three months he bettered Wei Yi’s mark of 14 years and four months. The official holder of this record is John Burke at 14 years and two months, but that was a statistical oddity aided by new coefficient rules.Next up for Praggnanandhaa is the age record for a 2700 rating, also held by Wei Yi at 15 years and eight months followed by Alireza Firouzja of Iran at 16 years and one month and Carlsen at 16 years and seven months. It is no guarantee for a future world champion, though. Wei Yi’s results have now been stuck in the low 2700s for more than three years.A year ago Shreyas Royal and his family were fighting extradition after his father’s work visa ran out. A campaign led by chessplaying MP Rachel Reeves and the personal intervention of the then home secretary, Sajid Javid, saved the day.At the Fide Open the 10-year-old from Woolwich scored 58 against mostly higher rated opponents, reached a 2400 rating at one point, and became the youngest qualifier for the British championship since David Howell 20 years ago.

The tall quick was immediately sent for scans and Australia were still awaiting the result at stumps, leaving them with just two frontline quicks.It was the subplot to a dramatic final session, which saw Starc take 4-31 and Ross Taylor offer New Zealand’s main resistance on 66 not out. Australia remain in a dominant position given their 307-run lead, but must pick up the required 15 wickets to win in the final three days with Matthew Wade as their third quick.New Zealand also have a pace problem, with Lockie Ferguson ruled out for the match with a calf strain and the mercury tipped to edge 40 degrees Celsius on Saturday and Sunday. The pink ball is also far trickier to face under lights than it is during the day, as New Zealand learned the hard way on Friday evening.Starc got Tom Latham in the first over of the night, when extra bounce had him popping a leading edge back to the bowler. Jeet Raval departed in the next over, after Hazlewood swung one back between bat and pad to take out his middle stump.From there Kane Williamson and Taylor provided a fighting 76-run partnership, before Smith’s catch of the summer. Standing at second slip, he ed full-length to his right and clutching the ball one-handed after Starc drew Williamson’s edge on 34. The catch will live long in the highlights reels, but Smith would have had Williamson removed on 13 if he had his way. The Black Caps superstar edged one behind off Pat Cummins, with Smith the only man to hear it as no other Aussies appealed.Starc then finished the night in style, when Henry Nicholls edged one down the leg-side on seven before yorking nightwatchman Neil Wagner first ball.Marnus Labuschagne’s third straight century had earlier set up Australia’s Test, as he went from 110 to 144 before he lost his leg stump to Wagner. The 25-year-old barely offered a chance in his previous 239 balls, before he stepped inside one that swung and moved past his legs and into the stumps. He was one of Wagner’s four scalps as the left-armer finished 4-92, while Tim Southee also had 4-93.Meanwhile, Travis Head again failed to turn a half-century into a big score when he hit Southee straight to cover on 56, marking his sixth score between 50 and 100 for just one century. Tim Paine also hit 39 off 105 balls, ensuring Australia would have the new ball under lights."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8965dd9786567a1688a8d5931072914232b05cee/0_323_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=884afd77b9bb5dc5fbb8f08922c96a7e","title":"tom brady drew brees eli manning philip rivers retirement nfl","story":"A golden generation of quarterbacks are now in their late 30s and early 40s. Who should press on for glory and who should call it a day?The NFL’s old guard is nearing the end. Advances in training, sleep science and nutrition – not to mention the expansion of the league’s passing rules – allow veteran quarterbacks to play into their late 30s and beyond, but time always wins, eventually. Peyton Manning was the first to go. Tom Brady, Drew Brees, Philip Rivers and Peyton’s younger brother, Eli, will soon follow him. Below, we look at what the future holds for the four veterans.Age at start of 2020 season: 39Admit it: you were excited when Eli started firing against the Eagles on Monday night. There’s nothing we enjoy more in sports than the last ride of an old gunslinger. Monday allowed us to dream of a final Manning season in 2020: he went 1530 on the night, throwing for just over 200 yards and two touchdowns. And he did so with his signature panache: ducking and weaving in the pocket, delivering a no-no-no-yes pass with defenders draped all over him.Then the second-half kicked off and we saw the same fossilized Manning we’ve become familiar with in recent years, the one who moves like a long-neglected combine harvester. Manning can still reach his old level in short spurts, but he is unable to do so over the course of a full season.Manning’s career record now sits at exactly .500. Based on the eye test and his inidual numbers, he shouldn’t make the Hall of Fame. But two Super Bowl rings (yep, we still seem to be doing evaluations that way) plus his surname mean he’s a virtual lock to get into the Hall, given the makeup of the current voting body.The only thing that would put that in jeopardy is a protracted retirement that would see his overall record dip. Walking away with his legacy intact seems like the wisest choiceShould he retire? YesWill he retire? YesAge at start of 2020 season: 38Rivers may be the most fascinating player in the NFL. Whether or not you believe Rivers is a Hall of Famer has become more than a question, it’s become an identity. It boils down to this: are you part of the new age, analytical movement? Or do you believe in the Michael Jordan-era evaluation point: how much did he win?The truth should, as usual, fall somewhere along that spectrum. It’s fair to say Rivers has had a fabulous career: he is, on the whole, objectively a better player than Eli Manning. And yet it’s also fair to say Manning has had a better career. Winning a Super Bowl is the whole point of this thing and winning two matters. Rivers would trade all the think pieces about his brilliance and the passing records for another shot at a championship.Time is running out with the Chargers, and they haven’t been able to cobble together a competent offensive line for much of this decade. When they have, the defense has stunk. The whole puzzle has never come together. Now, Rivers’ play has started to dip, a perfectly natural state of affairs for a 38-year old now in his 16th season. A change of scenery would be good for both Rivers and the Chargers.Rivers is still good. He ranks 12th among qualified quarterbacks in DVOA this season, which is typically the cut-off point for quarterbacks who reach the Super Bowl. He remains in full, obnoxious voice:Can’t you just picture Rivers having one final run with a new franchise, similar to Brett Favre’s oh-so-close run with the Vikings? That possibility feels like it will soon become a reality. But where? How about this: a year with the Patriots.Should he retire? No, aim for a year with a contenderWill he retire? NoAge at start of 2020 season: 43In the Tom v Time battle, time is finally nearing victory. Brady hasn’t been good this year, even if he’s been held back by a below-par receiving corps and banged-up offensive line. The lack of help around him has been overstated compared to contemporaries because he is Tom Bleeping Brady.Brady is still above average, which is good enough to win when surrounded by a bunch of strong ancillary pieces. But he’s no longer able to overcome shoddy offensive lines or ill-equipped receivers like he has in the past. How badly does he want to keep playing if that’s the equation moving forward?Who knows? This is a homicidally competitive inidual, but at the start of next season he will be closer to 60 than 25. I have reached the age where hangovers last two days, and I moan and creak getting up off the sofa. Can you imagine how a 42-year old feels the day after playing a professional football game? There’s no amount of muscle pliability that helps deal with a 6ft 4in, 260lbs pass-rusher caving in your chest.Rumors of Brady leaving the Patriots at the end of this season have circulated since the preseason, and the star put his Brookline home on the market in August. That’s either a rich couple selling their home because they’re a rich couple and that’s what they do, or it’s evidence that Brady is ready to call it a day.Brady’s legacy is set. If not unanimously considered the greatest to ever play quarterback, he is as near as makes no difference. There’s not much he could add in the next 24 months that would move the needle positively.Should he retire? YesWill he retire? NoAge at start of 2020 season: 41Brees, more than any player in the league, is playing with house money. His legacy is set. He’s one of the greatest to ever play the finest Saint in franchise history the guy who helped a city heal the scars of Katrina the overlooked draft pick who flourished into a star in one city, was discarded, then became an all-timer for his new team. And he has done all of that without the whiff of a scandal – the Bountygate nonsense never touched Brees’ reputation.Brees is in a perfect position this year. He’s still playing at a really, really high level. He could keep playing this pitch-and-catch game, with one of the best receivers in the league, a great backfield, and overpowering offensive line for three or so seasons. He works with one of the most creative offensive minds in football, Sean Payton, who’s going nowhere any time soon. Brees can set the most fun timeline: a Super Bowl then out. If the Saints win it this year, jog off into the sunset, preserving your body. If not, run it back and operate under the same timetable next year and the year after and the year after that.Should he retire? No, aim for one more Super BowlWill he retire? No"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3476032463aad8176b9a6d7396a8cf17d07ba055/0_0_3307_1985/master/3307.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dfc6b024d7fce9aa3aea4f08ebea5f31","title":"the cure best tv this week","story":"Henry Cavill stars in a new swords-and-sorcery fantasy, while the worst hospital scandal of recent years gets a moving dramatisationHenry Cavill swaps his Superman cape for a sword for this action-packed supernatural drama based on Polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski’s novels about monster-hunter Geralt of Rivia.

It did not look like a woman,” she said.The man was carrying a handbag, and wore a long skirt, a floral top, earrings and a stuffed bra. He had even painted his nails. “I couldn’t believe it,” Mendonça said. “It was surreal.”Mendonça, a driving test examiner for 12 years, kept her cool. She told a colleague to tell the police, asked “Dona Maria” for her ID, and let the impostor start the parking test.When police arrived, “Dona Maria” got out of the car and walked away but police soon caught up. Under the makeup was Maria’s son, Heitor Márcio Schiave, 43, a mechanic.He was arrested for fraudulent misrepresentation, said the officer who arrested him. “He said he was doing the driving test for his mother – and his mother did not know,” the officer said.The G1 news site, which first reported the story, said Schiave has since been released. Police said he will probably face a fine.“We got a lot of criticism – ‘Oh the son did it for the love of the mother.’ But what if there was an accident or someone died?” Mendonça said. “You have to earn your pass – the driving test is serious.”Judging by his performance in the parking test, it was unlikely Heitor Márcio would have secured a licence for his mother, she said.Even if the fake “Dona Maria” had managed to take the test undetected, “she would have failed just the same”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5d6cd707850575f08668db227d0e462970e9013/0_85_1280_768/master/1280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f08e1fdc5c7df137660499df4fd20479","title":"jamal khashoggi congress dni mohammed bin salman","story":"US intelligence agencies will be given a month to make a formal declaration on whether the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, was responsible for the murder of the Saudi dissident and Washington Post columnist, Jamal Khashoggi.The annual military spending bill, known as the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), was passed by a large majority in the House of Representatives on Wednesday and is expected to be approved by the Senate next week before being signed into law by Donald Trump.In negotiations before the NDAA’s passage, sections stipulating that Khashoggi’s murderers be subject to punitive measures were stripped from the bill, on the insistence of the White House – as were clauses that would have cut US support for the Saudi war in Yemen.According to the New York Times, the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, took a leading role in negotiations on behalf of the White House, and was insistent that the punitive clauses on Saudi Arabia should be removed.But the final version of the bill retained language requiring the director of national intelligence (DNI) to present a formal determination within 30 days on who was responsible for the murder and dismemberment of Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October last year.In April, the US barred entry to 16 Saudis for their role in the murder plot, including one of the crown prince’s closest aides, Saud al-Qahtani. This week, the state department added the former Saudi consul general in Istanbul, Mohammed al-Otaibi.In a closed-door briefing in December 2018, the CIA director, Gina Haspel, told senators that the agency was convinced the murder had been ordered by the crown prince (colloquially known by his initials MBS).“We know that the intelligence community has assessed with high confidence that MBS bears at least some responsibility for Khashoggi’s murder and the cover-up that has followed,” Tom Malinowski, the Democratic congressman from New Jersey who drafted the Saudi human rights accountability legislation, told the . “So if they answer the question, honestly, MBS will be on the list.”The congressional demand for a formal declaration, will be a test of the independence of the office of the DNI, since the ousting of Dan Coats from the post in the summer. His former deputy, Joseph Maguire, has been acting in the position since August.“I wouldn’t be surprised if the White House put some pressure on the director of national intelligence to come to a different conclusion,” Malinowski said. “So we’ll be watching this with great interest. We do have the advantage of knowing in advance what the intelligence community thinks because they’ve already told us in a classified setting. So it will be quite striking if they tell us something that is different in response to this.”Bruce Riedel, a former senior CIA officer and Saudi expert, said that Haspel is likely to have given the agency’s assessment of Prince Mohammed’s role in the Khashoggi murder in verbal form to the Senate, leaving the intelligence community enough wiggle room to hand over a list of the names of suspects the US has already named, excluding the crown prince.He said that the White House would have found it more “problematic” to convince Coats to issue a determination to Trump’s liking.“The acting DNI is a fine person, but he’s not going to fall on his sword, nor is the director of central intelligence,” Riedel said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21467cd213137d09abdb5086981339a5ed17b579/0_109_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5810e8c529e4cd865c9d25fd6d2b0e1a","title":"brexit eu leaders call for swift ratification after tory victory","story":"Bloc calls for swift ratification of withdrawal agreement following UK election resultEU leaders have expressed cautious confidence that Boris Johnson will pivot to back a close economic relationship with the bloc and called for swift ratification of the withdrawal agreement after the prime minister’s election triumph.The size of Johnson’s majority was welcomed in Brussels, where the 27 heads of state and government have gathered for a two-day summit.Charles Michel, the European council president, said he expected the withdrawal agreement to be passed through parliament within weeks to allow the UK to leave with a deal in 49 days’ time.“We expect as soon as possible a vote by the British parliament on the withdrawal agreement,” Michel said. “It is important to have the clarity as soon as possible. We are ready. The EU will negotiate to ensure to have a close cooperation in the future with the UK.”Earlier, the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said she would “immediately listen to the prime minister, the new prime minister, to be reassured what the pathway is”.EU leaders believe the Conservative majority will give Johnson free rein to decide his negotiating objectives and compromise in the talks where necessary.Once the UK parliament has ratified the withdrawal agreement, the European parliament will give its consent in January before the UK’s departure at the end of the month.EU leaders are waiting to see what incarnation of the prime minister will emerge now he is secure in Downing Street.The new Brexit deal is essentially the old\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspdeal with a new chapter on the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland and a few key tweaks to the political declaration. Here is a\u0026nbsplink to the full text.The backstop has essentially been replaced by a full stop whereby Northern Ireland remains aligned to the EU from the end of the transition period for at least four years. A change can only happen if it is voted on by the Stormont assembly.Stormont will have a key role in future Brexit arrangements. And if there is cross-community support to remain aligned to the EU rather than the UK the consent will hold for eight years.The arrangements in this deal will automatically kick in for a mandated four years if there is a breakdown in trade talks, so it remains a “backstop” but with a permanent tinge.That four-year period will start at the end of December 2020.Two months before the end of the four-year period, that is October 2024, Stormont will be asked to vote on whether to remain aligned to the EU in ways outlined by this deal or not.Under the deal, the UK and the EU are “underlining their firm commitment to no customs and regulatory checks or controls and related physical infrastructure at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland”.The EU and the UK will aim for a zero-tariff deal with unlimited quotas. The entire UK, including Northern Ireland, will be free to sign trade deals. The line in the political declaration that “the United Kingdom will consider aligning with union rules in relevant areas” in any future trade talks has been ditched.Northern Ireland will remain legally in the UK customs territory but practically in the EU customs unions. There will therefore be no customs checks on the border but tariffs will be payable on certain commercial goods.No customs duties will be payable on “personal property” being transited from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. That protects online shopping and all items bought for personal rather than commercial use.Customs duties will be payable on goods imported from the UK for commercial use unless it can be demonstrated that the goods remain in Northern Ireland or are for personal use, as above.A system of rebates will allow importers to be reimbursed.The commitment to frictionless trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain is restated.EU law on VAT will apply in Northern Ireland.The island of Ireland is considering a single market for electricity so homes in Northern Ireland can get their energy from a supplier in Northern Ireland or the republic. There were fears this could be disrupted by Brexit. Under the Johnson deal, the provisions of union law remain so nothing will change.This guarantees that the UK will remain in line with EU conventions on climate, environment and workers rights in a future trade agreement.Johnson had initially approached the negotiations on the withdrawal agreement with bullish, uncompromising talk, but swiftly broke his red lines to concede to a customs border in the Irish Sea between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.The Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, hinted at private assurances from Johnson that he would sign up to EU standards in order to secure a trade deal.“It’s a case of now getting on with it and I think the prospect is there to develop a new future economic partnership between the EU and UK, and one that’s going to be mighty and good for all of us.”EU leaders are expected to issue a communique later on Friday saying “the future relationship will have to be based on a balance of rights and obligations and ensure a level playing field”.Brussels wants the British government to sign up to EU environment, tax, work and social standards as it seeks “to establish as close as possible a future relationship with the UK”, according to a leaked draft of the document.There is a debate among the EU27 and with the European commission on what might be possible to negotiate between 31 January, when the UK is expected to leave, and the end of the transition period 11 months later.Johnson has said he will not extend the transition period, as would be permissible under the terms of the withdrawal agreement, beyond the end of 2020.The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, who has been confirmed in his post, has said that as a result, there is insufficient time to complete negotiations on a comprehensive deal and trade will need to be prioritised, leaving other issues such as cooperation on services and transport for later.The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, conceded at the summit that it would be “quite a challenge given the short time available” to find agreement even on trade by the end of next year. “We have to discuss the precise approach to these negotiations,” he said.Belgium’s prime minister, Sophie Wilmès, said: “We have to give a clear mandate to Michel Barnier to negotiate what our relationship will be.”The Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said her government would be pushing hard to maintain access to UK waters for Denmark’s fishing industry. “When it comes to Brexit, fishing is particularly important for Denmark, because it is a profession that depends on good cooperation with the countries that share the same fishing area. So there is no doubt that fishing really matters,” she said.Satisfaction that there will now be clarity from the UK over the next steps has, however, been tempered by sadness at the its imminent departure.The Czech prime minister, Andrej Babiš, said: “It is obviously a giant success for Boris Johnson. He is a charismatic leader. He won and now they will leave, unfortunately. That is bad news for Europe.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52a197aeec5ea53fc37f0f879c778fedecdf727f/0_198_1323_794/master/1323.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53f7b557cd0ced8dd9726d25b8fd80da","title":"canada iqaluit amazon prime","story":"Goods can only reach the communities by air or – when the Arctic Ocean thaws – by sea, making the free year-round shipping vitalIguptaq Autut, a comedian from Canada’s Arctic territory of Nunavut, knew he had truly arrived in the territory’s capital the day he walked out of the post office with an Amazon box under his arm.“Walking down the street, I thought: ‘I’m from Iqaluit now,’” joked Autut, 47.Iguptaq had grown up in Igluligaarjuk, a town of just 500 people on the north-western coast of the Hudson Bay, so for him Iqaluit – with a population of almost 8,000 – was the big city.And among its perks was access to Amazon Prime, whose free shipping deal has become crucial to many in Canada’s remotest territorial capital.There are no roads or rail lines into Nunavut, where 40,000 mostly Inuit inhabitants live largely in coastal communities separated by immense stretches of tundra and ocean. The closest urban centres lie thousands of kilometres to the south.Goods – from groceries and household items to construction and mining equipment – can only reach the territory’s 25 communities by air, or – during the four- or five-month window when the Arctic Ocean thaws – by sea.Shipping expenses drive up prices, leaving Nunavut with a cost of living among the highest in the country – even while it struggles with the some of Canada’s highest rates of poverty. All of which helps explain why – if they can afford the C$80 annual fee – Amazon’s free year-round shipping is vital to many in Iqaluit, the only Nunavut community where the service is available.Parents especially rely on it for basics like diapers and formula – which can cost up to twice as much in local shops as in most of southern Canada.So important is the free delivery, that some locals are wary of discussing it in public for fear that Amazon may revoke it.That depth of feeling helps explain the hearty guffaws to Autut’s routine about his first Amazon package at a live event in Iqaluit: “I kept that first box for a long time. Even though it was empty, I’d walk down the street carrying it, just to feel part of the community,” he said.Amazon Canada offered some reassurance: “There are no plans at this time to make any changes,” a representative said.But that also means that Amazon Prime will still be unavailable in Nunavut’s other communities, where shipping costs can be astronomical.Last year, Nunavut airports received 14 times as much air cargo per capita as the national average, according to Statistics Canada.Last month a glitch on Amazon’s website induced a minor panic when Iqaluit customers were told free shipping was unavailable. Some found a workaround by altering their postal code, and soon, Iqaluit’s post office was snowed under by Amazon parcels.“There’s over 20,000 pounds of mail that can’t even be sorted yet at the post office. Please pick up any parcels you can tomorrow!” one city councillor wrote on Facebook.But while items as big as mattresses, fish tanks and wood stoves are delivered by air cargo on Amazon Prime, some things still need to be shipped by sea.Earlier this year, barges ferried 64 self-contained modular units from China for a prefabricated hotel on to the beach of Iqaluit during high tide (the town has no port).Small business owners rely on sea cargo as well.Justin Clarke owns Uasau Soap with his wife, Bernice. Their handmade soaps, shampoos and lotions feature whale blubber and tundra flora. But they also rely on materials sourced in Mississauga, Ontario – more than 2,500km away.“We’re just two little people with a small company, so we have three or four pallets. There’s other people with eight or 16 pallets,” said Clarke, whose grandfather from Newfoundland captained ships to Iqaluit.When the Clarkes’ shipment finally reached Frobisher Bay, it had to wait for days while the modular hotel units were unloaded.Locals hope such delays will soon be a thing of the past, when a new deepwater port on the outskirts of town is completed in 2021.The city currently has no recycling program, so most packaging from its deliveries currently ends up in a landfill.Amid the change, the people of Iqaluit continue to adapt, said Autut.“It would be really hard for a lot of people here to live without it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0d59114f0921fd6061e5fb5e349f32532269be6/78_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8bef4bfd11bd38403bba78a00364f7e0","title":"nigerian student student table tennis players deported croatia had visas","story":"Documents show pair who were forcibly transferred to Bosnia had right to remain Two Nigerian student table tennis players wrongly deported to Bosnia by Croatian police who mistook them for undocumented migrants had regular visas valid until 3 December.Abia Uchenna Alexandro and Eboh Kenneth Chinedu, who arrived in Croatia on 12 November to participate in the fifth World InterUniversities Championships, had the right to remain in the country.But police who stopped them in Zagreb on 17 November did not believe them and, without verifying their status, forcibly sent them to Bosnia. obtained an original copy of the visa issued by the Croatian authorities to Alexandro, who, like Chinedu, is a student at the Federal University of Technology Owerri in Nigeria. The InterUNiversities organisation confirmed Chinedu’s visa was also valid until 3 December, like all the Nigerian participants in the tournament.The pair, both 18, left Pula for the Croatian capital, Zagreb, after the tournament and were supposed to fly to Lagos on 18 November. “The night before our departure, on the 17th, we checked out from the hostel and went for a walk in Zagreb,” Chinedu said in an interview  on Wednesday. “Suddenly … we were stopped by the police who asked us for our identification documents. We tried to explain that our passports were in the hostel and that we had a regular visa, but they paid no attention to what we were saying.”The officers allegedly mistook them for undocumented immigrants, put them in a van and transferred them to the border with Bosnia and Herzegovina where, that day, Croatian authorities had gathered together a group of migrants who were intercepted as they were attempting to cross the country.“I begged them one more time to check our status,” said Chinedu, “but they wouldn’t listen. They kicked me in the back and told me they would shoot me if I didn’t move.”Last weekend they were transferred to an immigration centre in east Sarajevo where they are currently being held.The plight of the two students has made the news around the world and sparked a row between Croatia and Bosnia.“Those people are victims of illegal acts on the Croatian side,” Dragan Mektić, Bosnia and Herzegovina’s minister of security, told Al Jazeera. “It is obvious that Croatian police forcibly displaced them.”Police in Croatia denied any wrongdoing and raised doubts over the table tennis players’ intentions, suggesting they were lying. According to the police, another Nigerian who participated in the championship had attempted to cross the border with Slovenia from Croatia a few days before.“Police officers have already witnessed cases of iniduals who make an attempt, even abusing their participation in sports competitions in Croatia, to remain in the country or continue their journey illegally to other European countries,” Croatian police said.However, even after the mistake was evident, Croatian police claimed the two men intended to stay in Croatia and not leave.The original copy of the visa, issued by Croatian authorities, contradicts the interior ministry in Zagreb’s version of events and confirms the two are the alleged victims of an injustice. If they had wanted, the two Nigerians had every right to remain in Croatia, as their visa was valid until 3 December.The students are now begging authorities in Sarajevo to return them to their home country, but only on one condition: “If they take us back to Croatia, we want to have UN escorts with us. We will not go to Croatia without a UN representative. We are scared of the Croatian police after what they did to us.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa135a022f0ab9fabf762ad43b456dc65448a8a3/0_207_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53016fade7cf748e7c5e88443a1f713d","title":"the best things that happened in 2019","story":"Here are our highlights – tell us yours and we’ll showcase them in next week’s Christmas newsletterHow’s it been for you?

Why does it reproduce at such great velocity? Because nature assigned it a double role: to suction every type of contaminant in its midst and to absorb all the carbon dioxide it possibly can. Essentially, its purpose in this world is to decontaminate waterways and decarbonise the atmosphere. Not bad for such a maligned “pest”!There is an added bonus to the water hyacinth. The plant has high levels of cellulose, oils and lipids and low level of lignin. The cellulose, oils and lipids are the components for biofuels. The low level of lignin makes the other components accessible for production of a perfect substitute for fossil fuels.Cyrus Forouhar wrote in on a recently revived laptop:I have an idea for what should be covered: The short life of smartphones and laptops that invariably end up in a tip because manufacturers make it hard, or very expensive, to change batteries and carry out repairs, in the expectation that consumers will throw them away and upgrade to the latest offering.Case in point: I have a five-year-old MacBook that was reborn when Apple fitted a new (and expensive) battery. I am pretty sure that in a few years when I have to change the battery again, I will not be able to find a replacement anywhere and a perfectly good machine will end up in a council dump, a huge and unnecessary waste of materials and resources.We need to dramatically slow down strip mining the planet to produce new shiny gadgets.And Bev Colgan from the western US got in touch early with her Christmas wish:What I would like from you this year is to free up a few elves to start a project that gives low- or no-cost loans and knowhow to people in working-class neighbourhoods like mine for little solar projects.

There may still be some objections in Conservative ranks – and the DUP will be trying to bolster these – but the odds are now strongly on the withdrawal agreement being passed to allow the UK to leave early next year.In turn this is likely to clear the way for an early general election in Ireland, possibly in February or March.A crash-out Brexit – without a withdrawal agreement being signed – had always been Ireland’s nightmare, leading to the immediate imposition of barriers to trade with the UK and the need for checks and controls at the Irish Border.This is why Taoiseach Leo Varadkar brokered the deal with Johnson to remove the backstop from the withdrawal agreement and replace it with a new permanent arrangement, involving some checks in the Irish Sea.Risks posed to Ireland Varadkar wanted to get the withdrawal agreement done. It probably now will be, and the risks posed to Ireland by a hung parliament and more uncertainty on the agreement are gone.However, the withdrawal agreement only covers some aspects of the UK’s departure, and 2020 will be dominated by talks between it and the EU on the future relationship between the two sides, particularly in relation to trade. If you thought the talks on the withdrawal agreement were complicated, you ain’t seen nothing yet.These talks are due to be completed by the end of 2020, when the UK is due to exit the transition period, a kind of standstill that it enters when it leaves the EU.There is a provision to extend the transition period , but this option must be exercised by the end of June. Johnson has repeatedly said he will not seek an extension. Doing so would leave the UK under the jurisdiction of EU rules and the European Court of Justice for a longer period and would also require further contributions to the EU budget.A strong majority gives Johnson more flexibility here as he will not be completely reliant on the hard Brexit lobby. But we have no idea what he might do here. This has huge significance for the Irish economy and for whether we will head for more uncertainty towards the end of next year.It is possible that a less ambitious trade deal might be done by the end of 2020 – a bare-bones deal in the jargon – covering just goods and not services and meaning no tariffs or quotas on trade. Deal required But this would require a deal on fishing rights and access to EU waters– a vital issue for Ireland – as well as UK commitments to what is called a “level playing field”, meaning they won’t cut environmental and workers’ rights. You could easily see how this could run into difficulty. This creates the risk of another kind of “no-deal” Brexit – one where the UK leaves the transition period without a deal on future trade. This would be a damaging, hard Brexit, and would hit Irish exporters, notably in the food sector, as well as hitting the UK economy hard. However, unlike if the UK left without signing the withdrawal agreement, it would not threaten a return of checks and controls at the Irish Border. The new arrangement designed to avoid this, in which Northern Ireland would remain aligned to many EU single market rules and have a unique customs regime, is part of the withdrawal agreement and would apply. How these arrangements, involving goods being checked as they cross the Irish Sea, will work has still be to be decided and spelled out – and the DUP remains strongly opposed. So there is both technical and political challenges here for the Government. Ireland needs this to work as it is these new rules and procedures that are intended to protect the EU single market and remove the need for checks and controls at the Irish border. In the short term, once it becomes clear the withdrawal agreement will definitely pass, then there could be a bit of a bounce in growth and investment here, for a period anyway.Businesses – and some households – have probably held off some spending decisions, though the latest ESRI quarterly report does point out that despite the Brexit risk, the domestic economy has shown remarkably strong growth. The risk of a short-term sterling collapse would also disappear.ChallengesHowever, after Brexit happens, the challenges ahead will quickly come into focus. As the ESRI pointed out, the kind of trade agreement that Johnson said he wants – and which is referred to in the political declaration outlining the future intentions of both sides – is a free-trade deal similar to what the EU has with Canada. In other words, the UK wants to sever its current links and any future alignment with the EU trading bloc. This would bring “immense challenges” for both the Irish and European economies, the ESRI said, as it is very different to what currently applies. So a lot will hang initially on whether Johnson reverses his decision and decides to extend the transition, which would push this risk – and the one of leaving with no trade agreement – out further. A strong majority reduces his reliance on the hard Brexit lobby and increases his flexibility to extend the transition. What kind of Brexit Johnson actually wants is the big issue now.The talks on the future relationship will get under way probably in March and be at full steam by April. It provides another argument for an early general election here – best to have a new government in place by the time the talks get going in earnest.Can Boris Johnson get a majority and finally deliver Brexit?

Photograph: Charles McQuillanGetty ImagesBig changes after the Westminster election in Northern Ireland. People were annoyed with the DUP over Brexit and probably other issues too such as the cash-for-cash scandal and the crisis in the health service, and they let them know, loudly and cruelly, with no mercy shown. The big face-off was North Belfast, and when the smoke cleared John Finucane was the man standing, Nigel Dodds flattened in the dust.But it was much worse than that for the DUP. Claire Hanna defeated the DUP’s Emma Little-Pengelly in South Belfast, which was expected, but Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry saw off the DUP’s Alex Easton in Lady (Sylvia) Hermon’s former seat of North Down, which was not.Coming into this election the DUP held 10 seats, which it used to exert pressure and influence on the Conservative government Sinn Féin had seven and independent unionist, Lady Hermon, who did not stand, held one. Border down the Irish SeaAfter Sinn Féin’s Michelle Gildernew narrowly took Fermanagh South Tyrone from the UUP’s Tom Elliott following a recount, the standing was the DUP on eight seats (down two) seven for Sinn Féin (as was), two for the SDLP (up two) and one for Alliance (plus one) - that is nine nationalists, eight unionists and one centre-ground MP.Moreover, Boris Johnson can do what he likes and bring in his Brexit deal – which the DUP says will mean an unacceptable border down the Irish Sea.Arlene Foster and Nigel Dodds and other senior DUP figures must now rue not accepting former British prime minister Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement.The ‘Boris Brexit deal’ means there will be free movement of goods and people on the island of Ireland but certainly for goods - according to the DUP’s view of the deal - there will be checks between Stranraer and Larne. All this symbolically is a punch in the solar plexus of unionism, and of the DUP in particular who through its obdurate no-compromises-allowed, pro-Brexit stance will be seen as the author of its own and unionism’s misery.That point was hammered home by Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald who said one of the key messages of the election was that “we are heading towards a Border poll”. She also said that unionism shouldn’t be “alarmed or frightened”, but unionists will be.Sinn Fein vote downNorth Belfast made it a great night for Sinn Féin, but it rather disguises that its overall vote is down considerably in other constituencies. It was absolutely trounced in Foyle where SDLP leader Colum Eastwood regained the seat for the party with a mammoth majority of 17,000, defeating outgoing MP Elisha McCallion.Claire Hanna took South Belfast from the DUP’s Little-Pengelly by a whopping 15,400 votes. Sinn Féin stood aside here, while the SDLP gave John Finucane a free run in North Belfast under the guise of a Remain axis. But even had Sinn Féin competed in South Belfast Hanna would have won by a large margin.The SDLP, as well as losing Foyle and South Belfast, also dropped South Down in 2017 to Sinn Féin’s Chris Hazzard who defeated Margaret Ritchie, now Baroness Ritchie of Downpatrick, by 2,440 votes. The Sinn Féin man was expected to press ahead with that advantage, but his SDLP opponent Michael Savage gave him a bit of a fright, coming within 1,600 votes of Hazzard.Around the rest of the North, apart from North Belfast, Sinn Féin dropped votes although winning seats. In a first-past-the-post election such as Westminster that does not matter, but if it were to translate to an Assembly election then some seats could be threatened.The message here from voters, both to the DUP and Sinn Féin, was that in light of the health pressures, the lengthy waiting lists and many other problems caused by the absence of Stormont, it was time to get powersharing back working again.Alliance surgeThe old order changed quite dramatically when the votes were counted. The DUP and Sinn Féin in that order still were the two main parties with reduced shares of the vote, but instead of the SDLP, the Ulster Unionist Party and Alliance next on the ladder it was Alliance in third place, the SDLP and the UUP next on the lower rungs.Part of the lesson here was that many middle-ground Remain unionists, despairing of the DUP and the UUP, decided to shift allegiance to Alliance. Unlike the four other main parties the fact that Alliance eschewed Brexit pacts and competed in all 18 constituencies served it well. The Alliance surge seen in the local government and European elections of earlier this year continues with pace.While the DUP in particular was humbled it should be acknowledged that Dodds and Little-Pengelly took their defeats gracefully, congratulating their nemeses, Finucane and Hanna - Little Pengelly having the generosity to embrace Hanna after the South Belfast result.Back to StormontIt was quite a long night’s journey into morning. It is just about possible that when politicians dust themselves down after all the convulsions and high political theatre that some good may come of it all. It would seem the DUP and to a lesser extent Sinn Féin have nowhere to go but back into Stormont. Both parties took hits, and both need to demonstrate to the public they are capable of governing. It would also assist Sinn Féin if it could be seen in the Republic ahead of the general election that the party can make politics work north of the Border.On Monday it is once more into the breach the tedious business of talking to reinstate the Northern Executive and Assembly begins again.Can Boris Johnson get a majority and finally deliver Brexit?

Photograph:  PA Northern Ireland has returned more nationalists than unionists for the first time after Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) deputy leader Nigel Dodds lost his seat at Westminster in the UK general election.With Conservative Party leader Boris Johnson having secured a resounding victory, it has been a bad night for the DUP, which lost two seats plus its crucial influencing role supporting the Tory government.The final seat of the 18 in Northern Ireland to declare was Fermanagh and South Tyrone, where Michelle Gildernew of Sinn Féin held the seat by a reported 57 votes from Tom Elliott of the Ulster Unionist Party.As a result, although the DUP remains the largest party, it holds fewer seats than Sinn Féin and the SDLP.The cross-community Alliance Party also took one seat, adding to the majority of anti-Brexit MPs.Mr Dodds had become a power broker during the Brexit talks, when the DUP propped up the minority Conservative Party government after the UK general election of 2017.His defeat completed a humiliation for the party, which said unionists were betrayed by the eventual deal Mr Johnson struck to leave the European Union. Mr Dodds lost his seat to John Finucane, the son of one of the highest-profile victims of 30 years of sectarian bloodshed that was largely ended by the Belfast Agreement peace deal of 1998. Mr Finucane is the first Sinn Féin MP returned in North Belfast. He was aided by a pact between Sinn Féin and the SDLP that saw the parties agree not to compete in some areas to avoid splitting the remain vote. Northern Ireland voted 56 per cent to 44 per cent to remain in the Brexit vote.Mr Dodds’s party colleague Edwin Poots said the deputy leader’s defeat was very damaging for unionism. “Ultimately, if we are going to protect the union, enhance the union and secure the union, then we’re going to have to have people voting unionist,” Mr Poots told BBC Northern Ireland. – Agencies Can Boris Johnson get a majority and finally deliver Brexit?

Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireOn a bruising election night for the DUP, Carla Lockhart brought the party some smiles as she returned a solid victory in Upper Bann.This was the 34-year-old’s first Westminster election an MLA in the area since 2016, she was drafted in as candidate after David Simpson, who had been the Upper Bann MP since 2005, announced he would not stand again following an extramarital affair.In the event, Lockhart slightly increased the DUP’s margin of victory, defeating Sinn Féin’s John O’Dowd by 8,210 votes, just over 200 more than Simpson polled against him in the last UK general election, in 2017.After her victory Ms Lockhart thanked God and her predecessor, whom she said she would lean on for guidance in the times ahead.“I am extremely humbled that 20,501 people put their trust in me as their DUP MP for Upper Bann,” she said. “I ran a positive campaign. While others sought to dig from the sidelines, I campaigned on a record of delivery for Upper Bann. I stand on my record of delivery, and the people of Upper Bann embraced that. To my family, who see me on good and bad days, I want to thank them for their prayers on my political journey.”She also thanked her baby son, Charlie, who at less than a year old was the youngest supporter of any election candidate at the count in Meadowbank Sports Arena, in Magherafelt, Co Derry. “I believe this will make me a better person, and it’s for his future, for all our children and grandchildren going forward. I will represent everyone to the best of my ability.”With turnout in Upper Bann broadly similar to 2017 – it fell by about 0.9 per cent – Eóin Tennyson was yet another Alliance Party candidate to deliver a strong performance. He increased his party’s vote by more than 4,000, taking Alliance to third place in the constituency, with 6,433 votes, more than 200 votes ahead of the UUP’s Doug Beattie, who dropped almost 2,000 votes. The SDLP’s Dolores Kelly broadly held the party’s position, with 4,623.Can Boris Johnson get a majority and finally deliver Brexit?

Mr Dodds, who has served as deputy leader since 2008, secured only 21,100 votes, while his Sinn rival John Finucane secured 23,700.Mr Dodds was unseated by an alliance of pro-Remain parties, with Sinn Fein and the Greens stepping aside for the SDLP. As Great Britain returned a strong majority for Boris Johnson and his pledge to get Brexit done, the DUP has faltered at the ballot box.In South Belfast, the DUP\u0027s Emma Little-Pengelly, lost her seat to pro-Remain SDLP candidate Claire Hanna - who, unlike Sinn Fein\u0027s MPs, will take her seat at Westminster. The DUP suffered another blow as North Down was taken by Stephen Farry, the candidate for the anti-Brexit, non-sectarian Alliance. The DUP had expected to easily win the seat, which was formerly held by independent unionist Lady Hermon.Even in seats that returned DUP victories, some saw their share of the vote slashed. In East Antrim, Sammy Wilson hemorrhaged votes to the Alliance and the Ulster Unionist Party.In Lagan Valley, the DUP\u0027s Jeffrey Donaldson held on to the seat but saw his vote share reduced, as did Jim Shannon in Strangford. The mood in DUP circles was downbeat as the 10pm BBC exit poll showed a huge Tory majority that dashed the party\u0027s hopes of wielding any influence over the next Government.Then, as the results began to flow in, the DUP\u0027s message began to focus less and less on Brexit, looking instead to restoring Northern Ireland\u0027s devolved Assembly. With Mr Johnson\u0027s deal now set to sail through the House of Commons at its next reading, Northern Ireland risks being cut off from the rest of the UK with a customs and regulatory border.Throughout the campaign, the DUP vowed to go back to Westminster and re-negotiate the Northern Ireland component of the deal, pinning their hopes on a hung parliament.Over the last few years, the party had enjoyed substantial influence over Theresa May and subsequently Boris Johnson, withholding their support for the Withdrawal Agreement until the very end. Critics of the DUP were quick to point out that the party had the chance to support Theresa May\u0027s deal, which did not include an Irish sea border. Instead, her version of the Withdrawal Agreement would have kept the whole of the UK tied to EU rules, until alternative arrangements were agreed on.Caroline Flack, Love Island presenter, charged with assault after reports man was attacked General election 2019 live: Boris Johnson cheered into Downing St after Tory landslide - latest newsScotland election results: Nicola Sturgeon celebrates SNP tidal wave - but Tories rule out IndyRef2Jeremy Corbyn will quit as Labour Party leader after election failureThe 24 Labour heartland seats lost to the Tories for the first time in decadesHow the Conservative Party won an election majority, in maps and charts Voter turnout in 2019 general election down on 2017 figureNext Labour Party leader: Keir Starmer and Jess Phillips among the candidatesWhat next for Brexit, now Tories have won the general election?Return of the rhubarb and custard: Sales of old-fashioned sweets have soared by 40 per cent in a year thanks to expats\u0026#39 nostalgia, Waitrose saysComment: Now he\u0026#39s got his majority, Boris is free to be the liberal PM he really wants to be 9 surprising facts from the 2019 General ElectionFriday the 13th 2019: How cyclones, asteroids and a Buckingham Palace bombing have fed the superstitionHong Kong police slip up with tweet linking tear gas use to banana artworkBoris Johnson\u0026#39s victory speech signals shift to middle groundComment: A great victory for Red Toryism – but Boris can\u0026#39t take his new voters for grantedBehind the mask: who is the real Boris Johnson? Boris Johnson\u0026#39s cabinet reshuffle: Who\u0026#39s in, and who\u0026#39s out?Nigel Farage reveals he will campaign for Donald Trump next year as Brexit Party wins no seatsJo Swinson\u0026#39s Portillo Moment as she loses her seat on humiliating night for Liberal DemocratsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"election front pages newspapers saying tory election victory","story":"Boris Johnson was predicted to sweep to victory, and the results have proved the exit poll to be correctThe Conservative Party has swept to a resounding victory in the general election, returning Boris Johnson to Downing Street with a mandate to Get Brexit Done.Last night, the exit poll predicted that the Conservatives would end up with a working majority of almost 50 seats, 368, whereas Labour could sink below 200 seats for the first time since the 1930s.Results through the night since then are making good on that forecast, with a host of Labour strongholds in the north and midlands falling to the Tories - some for the first time ever.Most of the UK newspapers went to print not long after the exit poll was released an they all lead on the forecast of a robust Tory majority.

Amazon to buy a minority stake in online food-delivery business Deliveroo were in doubt on Wednesday as the competition watchdog warned it could launch a full-scale investigation into the deal.The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which has been investigating the deal since it was first announced in May, said it had serious concerns that competition could be stifled.Andrea Gomes da

competition which could otherwise exist between Amazon and Deliveroo would be reduced.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe concerns of the CMA include that the deal could discourage Amazon from re-entering the restaurant food-delivery sector – having previously launched and closed its Amazon Restaurants business a year ago.A CMA report stated: “Although Amazon closed its restaurant delivery business, evidence examined in the CMA’s investigation indicated that Amazon has a strong continued interest in the restaurant delivery sector.”Created with Sketch.UK news in

After crashing back down to $175, it then went on another positive run in 2017 that took it close to $20,000 by the end of that year.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesSince then, bitcoin has tumbled once more, reaching below $4,000 at the start of 2019 before recovering to today’s price of around $7,000. (At the time of his arrest six years ago, the FBI seized 144,000 bitcoins from Silk Road and\u0026nbspUlbricht\u0026nbsp- worth just over $1 billion at current prices.)Ulbricht\u0026nbspclaims he predicted both of these waves from his prison cell and believes another one is already building – a prediction he says he is able to make without being swayed by day-to-day price movements and general market hubris his imprisonment shelters him from.Created with Sketch.Bitcoin\u0027s volatile history in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Satoshi Nakamoto creates the first bitcoin block in 2009On 3 January, 2009, the genesis block of bitcoin appeared.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearIn a six-part blog published from letters he wrote in\u0026nbspprison, Ulbricht\u0026nbspapplied a form of market analysis known as Elliott Wave Theory to predict new all-time highs for bitcoin.The theory forecasts the highs and lows in financial market cycles by identifying extremes in investor psychology, which in the case of bitcoin appear to be far more tempormental compared to traditional markets due to the nacency of the cryptocurrency.The principle posits that price movements in speculative markets are driven by investor expectation, which when combined with mass psychology can force prices artificially higher through a positive feedback loop of buyer optimism.Looking at the previous price waves of bitcoin, Ulbricht puts the next big wave reaching between $93,000 and $109,000 before the 17 February, 2021. He notes that his speculation should be considered with appropriate scepticism.“We have a price target... of ~$100,000 some time in or near 2020,” he wrote. “However, there is no rule that market moves have to be proportional. This is just a patter we see unfolding that may or may not continue.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I said that I identified as non-binary and told people that I was saying it for the first time and everyone applauded, which was heart-warming. Then nothing really happened, apart from a few people, who said ‘well done’. It was all very low-key and remains so.”In the foreword, Mr McKenna-Coles wrote that Lloyd’s has “room for further development” on trans and non-binary inclusion.“One of the secondary threads of our research was confusion and lack of knowledge on behalf of managers and colleagues over how to handle the situation, and, with the best intentions in the world, how to make it all ‘work right’ for all parties,” he wrote.City employers are taking note of the fact that increasing ersity and inclusion is good policy and good for business.Firms in the top quartile for ersity were 21 per cent more likely to have above-average profitability than those in the bottom quartile, a study by\u0026nbspMcKinsey\u0026nbspfound last year.Lloyds of London\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It’s what would happen if an elderly hoarder with a Hummel figurine fetish dropped acid, ran into the street naked and was happy for the very first time, right before getting hit by a bus.”In a new interview with The Times, Hooper explained how he went back and changed the film after the horrified response from fans.“On some level, the reaction to the trailer was insane,” he said. “But I do think that there were lessons to be learnt.”Created with Sketch.10 most-searched for films of 2019 Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Bill Skarsgård in \u0027It Chapter Two\u0027Jason Momoa in \u0027Aquaman\u0027Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali in \u0027Green Book\u0027Olivia Colman in \u0027The Favourite\u0027710 4.

He said his mother “hated it”.212 Gary Oldman in Darkest HourWhile Darkest Hour may have been a run-of-the-mill biopic (with all the requisite fawning scenes of the subject), Gary Oldman’s performance was substantially better than the actual film. The actor spent 200 hours in make-up over the shoot, hoping to emulate the wartime Prime Minister – time well spent, as the Academy awarded the Oldman a best actor Oscar.312 Jared Leto in Dallas Buyer\u0027s ClubThe 30 Seconds to Mars frontman’s casting caused controversy with his role as an HIV-positive transgender woman in Dallas Buyer’s Club, where he starred opposite Matthew McConaughey. He lost about 40lb to play Rayon, “and then I stopped counting”, Leto said, adding that it changed the way he walked, talked, thought and moved. “It changes you inside and out.”412 Tom Hanks in PahiladelphiaBefore Leto, Tom Hanks underwent dramatic weight loss for his starring roles in Philadelphia and Cast Away, which the actor later revealed may have been a factor in his diagnosis with type 2 diabetes. Since then, he has committed to avoiding roles that require significant weight gain or loss, because of the sheer physical toll it put on his body.512 Tilda Swinton in SuspiriaWhile some eagle-eyed film fans (and paparazzi) guessed it relatively early on, it took a while for Suspiria filmmaker Luca Guadagnino and Tilda Swinton to admit that she was the one playing 82-year-old male psychoanalyst Josef Klemperer in the 2018 horror remake. Academy Award-winning makeup artist Mark Coulier gave her a “fake penis and balls” at Swinton’s request: “She had this nice, weighty set of genitalia so that she could feel it dangling between her legs,” he said. Apparently she was so convincing that many of the cast and crew were confused about what this unknown “German” actor was doing on set.  612 Leonardo DiCaprio in J EdgarThe prosthetics he wore may have been widely mocked or criticised, but it’s hard to deny that Leonardo DiCaprio’s role as J Edgar involved one of the most drastic physical changes of his career. It took six to seven hours to apply his makeup each day, including fake teeth, a bald cap, latex body pads, and layers of silicone applied to his face.712 John Travolta in HairsprayIt took John Travolta a long time to say “yes” to the iconic role of Edna Turnblad in the film adaptation of the musical Hairspray. In the end, he was so determined to get it right that he rejected several versions of the padded suit – weighing more than 30lbs – designed for him until he felt the character was suitably voluptuous.812 John Hurt in The Elephant ManJohn Hurt’s portrayal of the deformed John Merrick is one of the most tender and humanistic performances of all time. Of course, you would not know that was John Hurt underneath the layers of make-up and prosthetics if it were not for the credits. So brilliant is the make-up design that the Oscars introduced the Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling the year after. 912 Nicole Kidman in The HoursKidman may be almost unrecognizable in her new film Destroyer, but the transformation that most fans recall is for her role as Virginia Woolf in The Hours. The Australian star sat in the makeup chair for three hours every day while artists added a large prosthetic nose to Kidman’s face. She won the Oscar for Best Actress the following year.1012 Cate Blanchett in I\u0027m Not thereBlanchett was one of six actors to play characters inspired by facets of Bob Dylan’s persona. She received critical acclaim for her turn as Jude Quinn, an embodiment of Dylan when he controversially played electric guitar on a rock version of “Maggie’s Farm” to outraged fans at the Newport Folk Festival. “Blanchett’s translucent skin, delicate fingers, slight build, and pleading eyes all suggest the previously invisible vulnerability and fear that fueled Dylan’s lacerating anger,” one review said. “It’s hard to imagine that any male actor… could have lent such rich texture to the role.”1112 Christian Bale in Vice1212 Russell Crowe in The Loudest VoiceThe actor has transformed himself into the late Fox News founder Roger Ailes for Showtime\u0027s upcoming series The Loudest Voice. The show takes its basis from Gabriel Sherman’s bestselling book The Loudest Voice in the Room, alongside his extensive work for New York magazine on the allegations of sexual harassment that led to Ailes’s 2016 departure from Fox News. 112 Matthew Fox in Alex CrossLost star Matthew Fox underwent a staggering transition for the little-seen thriller Alex Cross, shedding 40 pounds for the role while also adding muscle mass.

It predicts that this proportion could rise to between 12 and 20 per cent over the next decade as younger people join the workforce.The 29-page guide advises staff to cut out unnecessary gendered language and provides advice on how to ask someone which pronouns they prefer when describing\u0026nbspthemselves.It suggests providing all-gender facilities, promoting visible trans and non-binary role models and ensuring forms do not only include options for two genders.“It is much simpler to refer to someone as Hilary, than ‘she’ or ‘he’, and this can avoid worries over mis-gendering,” the guide states.Managers are advised to demonstrate their commitment to inclusion by personally taking action such as adding their pronouns to their email signatures.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I said that I identified as non-binary and told people that I was saying it for the first time and everyone applauded, which was heart-warming. Then nothing really happened, apart from a few people, who said ‘well done’. It was all very low-key and remains so.”In the foreword, Mr McKenna-Coles wrote that Lloyd’s has “room for further development” on trans and non-binary inclusion.“One of the secondary threads of our research was confusion and lack of knowledge on behalf of managers and colleagues over how to handle the situation, and, with the best intentions in the world, how to make it all ‘work right’ for all parties,” he wrote.City employers are taking note of the fact that increasing ersity and inclusion is good policy and good for business.Firms in the top quartile for ersity were 21 per cent more likely to have above-average profitability than those in the bottom quartile, a study by\u0026nbspMcKinsey\u0026nbspfound last year.Lloyds of London\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Nothing in my research suggested she did so, and it was never my intention to suggest she had. That would be an appalling and misogynistic dismissal of the difficult work she did.”Created with Sketch.30 times things went wrong on film and TV sets Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 Margot Robbie – The Wolf of Wall StreetThe actor says that acting in the scene where she has sex with Leonardo DiCaprio on a bed of money was really painful in The Wolf of Wall Street. “I got a million paper cuts on my back from all that money! It\u0027s not as glamorous as it sounds,” she said. “If anyone is ever planning on having sex on top of a pile of cash: don\u0027t. Or maybe real money is a bit softer, but the fake money is like paper, and when I got up off the bed, I turned around to get my robe and everyone gasped. I said, \u0027What is it?\u0027 And they said, \u0027You look like you\u0027ve been whipped a million times. Your back is covered in a thousand red scratches.”During the filming of the sequel to Steven Spielberg’s Jaws, cast members were terrified when real hammerhead sharks started circling them in the sea. The trouble was that their screams went unheard. The crew didn’t think they were in real danger to start with because it was written into the script that they yelled for help at that point.330 Sylvester Stallone and Dolph Lundgren – Rocky IVThe fourth in the Rocky film franchise to focus on the boxing career of the fictional Rocky Balboa, played by Sylvester Stallone, has some gripping and authentic-looking fight scenes. It’s no wonder then that during filming, Stallone actually asked Dolph Lundgren, who plays his opponent, Ivan Drago, to try to knock him out for real. But Lundgren hit him with such force that he was sent to the hospital and was in intensive care for over a week.Brando was infamous for his bad on-set behaviour. That is one reason why Paramount was nervous about getting him involved in Francis Ford Coppola’s mafia film. It didn’t start well, when on the first day of shooting, the actor who played the patriarch in the family, Vito Corleone, missed his overnight flight from LA to New York. His scene was rescheduled for the next day, but it cost producers $40,000.In his autobiography, rapper Gucci Mane said he was so tired on set of Harmony Korine’s crime film Spring Breakers, that he fell asleep during his big sex scene. The rapper, who plays Big Arch, a rival drug dealer of James Franco’s Alien character in the film, is seen having sex with one woman, while another sucks his toes. “I couldn’t keep my eyes open. I was knocked out, snoring . . . Harmony kept having to wake me up for takes.” In another interview, he explained why he was so exhausted. “I had a concert down there in St Petersburg, Florida, one of the days I had to shoot a scene. Same night. We started shooting at 10 o\u0027clock in the evening until 1 or 2 o\u0027clock.”The action star broke his ankle while doing his own stunt on set of the sixth Mission Impossible. The scene sees Cruise completing a fast rooftop jump from one building to another, when his foot slams into the side of the wall. But instead of collapsing in a heap, he keeps going as if nothing has happened, until the end of the scene when he can be seen hobbling away. He said: “I knew instantly my ankle was broken and I really didn’t want to do it again so just got up and carried on with the take. I said, ‘It’s broken. That’s a wrap. Take me to hospital’ and then everyone got on the phone and made their vacation arrangement.”730 Lizzy Caplan and Michael Sheen – Masters of SexCaplan was nervous when she had to take her clothes off in front of co-star Sheen in the TV series. It made her feel better that they were both shaky. But then disaster struck. “And we complete the scene, I place the hand on my breast and they yell “Cut” and he immediately walks over to a garbage can and throws up.“ Turns out Sheen had eaten something that upset his stomach, but Caplan didn\u0027t know that. She said: ”My whole self-confidence plummeted to the ground and I realised that I\u0027m a monster and anybody who touches me will immediately start vomiting and that’s just the way it\u0027s going to be.”830 Nina Dobrev and Paul Wesley – The Vampire DiariesNina Dobrev accidentally broke Paul Wesley\u0027s finger while shooting a sex scene in The Vampire Diaries.930 Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan - 50 Shades of GreyObviously this could be a load of hype to promote the first erotic film in the franchise, but there were certainly a lot of terrible sex scenes in which things could go wrong. Johnson, who plays Anastasia Steele, becomes romantically linked to Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) and they act out their BDSM desires. Johnson, who wore a modesty thong glued to her body while Dornan wore a “wee bag” to protect his modesty, said: “I got whiplash once from him throwing me on the bed. So f***ing painful. I wish we had a gag reel from the shoot.”Michael Imperioli is best known for his role as Tony Soprano’s protégé, Christopher Moltisanti in The Sopranos. During the filming of his death scene in Martin Scorsese’s Goodfellas, Imperioli cut his hand on a glass and was taken to hospital, where the doctors sped in to treat his fake bullet wounds.During the filming of Groundhog Day, Murray was more irritable than usual as he was going through a orce and was prone to disappearing from set. He had been asked to get an assistant to ease communication between him, the director Harold Raims and the studio. He was against the idea, so he hired somebody who was deaf and spoke only in sign language, which nobody on set, including Murray, could understand. Ramis said: “Bill said, ‘Don’t worry, I\u0027m going to learn sign language.’ And I think it was so inconvenient that in a couple of weeks, he gave that up. That’s anti-communication, you know? Let’s not talk.”It was a small mishap for Dunham when her nude patch kept falling off in scenes that required nudity. Dunham, who plays aspiring writer Hannah in her comedy-drama TV series Girls, said: “I stopped wearing the nude patch after the first season of Girls. There’s not one guy who works on that show who hasn’t seen the inside of my vagina. You glue it over your vagina. It gets sweaty and always falls off. My male co-stars, at the end of the day, don’t care.”In one scene of Quentin Tarantino’s 2015 Western thriller, Jennifer Jason Leigh as Daisy Domergue plays a guitar. It is a vintage Martin guitar from the 19th century, worth roughly $40,000, which had been loaned out from the Martin Museum in Pennsylvania. But a misunderstanding on Russell’s part led to an expensive mistake. The valuable guitar was meant to be swapped over with a replica prop when he snatched it from her. Russell had not read the memo, though, and smashed the antique guitar against a wall, while shouting “Music time is over”. As a result, the Martin Museum – which called the guitar a priceless, irreplaceable artefact – vowed never to loan guitars out to movies again.1430  Robert Pattinson and Julianne Moore – Maps to the StarsThe Twilight and Lost City of Z actor played Jerome, a limousine driver and struggling actor, in David Cronenberg’s acerbic Hollywood satire. It was while he got intimate in the back of a car with Moore’s character, a washed-up actress, that he ran into problems and started sweating profusely. “I sweat like a f***ing crazy person,” he said. “I was trying to literally catch drops of sweat to stop them hitting her back. Afterwards she was like, \u0027Are you having a panic attack?\u0027 It was so embarrassing.”1530 Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal - Love and other DrugsHathaway accidentally stripped off too soon when she thought cameras were rolling during the filming of Love and other Drugs. She stars alongside Jake Gyllenhaal in the erotic film based on the non-fiction book Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman by Jamie Reidy. “I have to remove my trench coat and be nude underneath, and I thought we were filming,” she said. “But it turned out we were just rehearsing and I got unnecessarily naked in front of a lot of people!”In a 2007 episode of the reboot of Battlestar Galactica TV series, Olmos’s character William Adama, the commanding officer of BS Galactica, is playing around with a model ship when he gets carried away by improvising and smashes it to smithereens. The model ship was, however, museum quality and according to Olmos, who had no idea at the time, it was worth roughly $200,000.1730 Allison Janney and Michael Lerner in Life During WartimeDuring a sex scene against a wall for the 2009 comedy-drama, Allison Jamey\u0027s co-star Michael Lerner went crashing to the ground. “We had to have sex up against a wall and they started spraying us with glistening stuff to make us look sweaty, but no one seemed to realise that we were standing on a marble floor,” she said. “They said ‘Action’ and he pulled me up against the wall and his feet slipped out from under him and he went crashing down on the floor. It was terrible, but it was one of those moments I\u0027ll never forget.”1830 Ryan Reynolds and Olivia Wilde in The Change-UpThe Deadpool star was taken aback when his co-star Olivia Wilde painted smiley faces on her underwear during a sex scene, that he completely forgot what he was doing. “In the scene, she’s sitting there and I take her top off and the bra off, and she has those panties on, but she’s drawn these adorable little smiley faces on them,” he said. “And I forget every line. Not just from this movie, but from every other movie I’ve done.”1930 Sean Connery and Lana Turner – Another Time, Another PlaceSean Connery and the American actress Lana Turner were filming a love scene when Turner’s gangster boyfriend Johnny Stompanato showed up uninvited. Turner was playing an American journalist who has a love affair with a BBC war correspondent (played by Connery). But her boyfriend was so jealous that he showed up with a gun in his hand, and threatened to kill Connery. Bravely, Connery grabbed the gun from his hand and twisted the boyfriend’s wrist until he fled off the set. Turner’s turbulent life continued when her daughter Cheryl killed Stompanato with a kitchen knife fearing that he was going to kill her mother after he showed up at their house in the US – but in the trial it was deemed as justifiable homicide.2030 Christian Serratos and Michael Cudlitz - The Walking DeadThe long-running TV show focuses more on blood and violence than sex. But during one scene between Rosita (Christian Serratos) and Abraham (Michael Cudlitz) things nearly went pear-shaped when they had to get intimate in front of 30 crew members, who  were drinking coffee and eating ramen noodles. Cudlitz, who was on top of Serratos, said they were nearly naked but covered – but then as they were “humping”, the cover got knocked off, leaving Serratos practically naked. The actor said: “Then we just started laughing, because it\u0027s ridiculous. It\u0027s two people, we barely know each other, lying on top of each other naked.”During the filming of Blazing Saddles, a man wandered into a scene of the film. He wasn’t part of the crew or cast but when the director Mel Brooks got the man moved on, he returned again, seemingly not understanding the request. Brooks then sent over a waiver for him to sign and left him in the movie for a laugh. He can be spotted at the end of the film wearing a jumper and standing on a sidewalk watching the action as people run out of the Warner Brothers studio front gates.Not really a mishap, but it was certainly an awkward moment behind the camera for the then 17-year-old actor, who legally had to have his mother on set for his first-ever sex scene, in which he says, “It’s in. Oh, my God, it’s in.” “She got there, and I had fake sexual intercourse in front of her,” Mintz-Plasse said. “Afterwards we didn\u0027t talk about it we still don\u0027t speak about that moment.”2330 Sylvester Stallone and Sharon Stone – The SpecialistStallone and Stone had absolutely no chemistry in the 1994 American spy thriller, but when the Basic Instinct star refused to get naked for the shower scene, it was potentially a huge problem. Stallone admitted they had to get drunk on vodka for filming to even start. “Ok. Let it be known, I didn’t want this scene because Sharon was not cooperating. We get to the set and she decided not to take off her robe off. The director asks only a few of the crew to remain, and she still won’t take it off. I promised her I wouldn’t take any liberties, so what’s the problem? She said, ‘I’m just sick of nudity.’ I asked her if she could get sick of it on somebody else’s film. She was having none of it, so I went down to my trailer, bought back a bottle of Black Death vodka that was given to me by Michael Douglas and after half-a-dozen shots we were wet and wild.”2430 Margot Robbie and Alexander Skarsgard – The Legend of TarzanApparently Robbie – who plays Jane - punched her Tarzan co-star Skarsgard after getting carried away during the filming of their climatic sex scene. The director David Yates asked them to be a little more violently passionate. “I didn’t injure Alexander,” she said. “And I didn’t punch him in the face, at least not hard. But he’s a pretty strong guy. He can take it. We just got carried away a bit.”Cavill says he had to “apologise profusely” after he got aroused on set, adding that “It had only happened to him once”. “A girl had to be on top of me, she had spectacular breasts and I hadn\u0027t rearranged my stuff into a harmless position. She\u0027s basically rubbing herself all over me and, um, it got a bit hard.” He claimed there was nothing sexy about onscreen sex scenes. “All you’re doing is smacking your nuts against someone and nothing is going in.” But he added: “It’s not great when you’re in a professional acting environment and somebody gets a boner, is it?” It’s not just Henry Cavill who got aroused during filming a sex scene. Metcalfe, who played John Rowland, experienced the same issue during his first onscreen sex scene with Eva Longoria’s Gabrielle Solis. He said: “We were rehearsing and then the director was like, \u0027OK, get out of bed, we have to reset the set\u0027, and I was like, \u0027I need a minute.\u0027“ He added: “It doesn\u0027t happen that frequently” because ”there are a lot of people on set, and it can be very technical, but it happens from time to time.2730 Christopher Guest and Cary Elwes – The Princess BrideWhen you see the dashing Westley (Cary Elwes) fall to the ground unconscious during a fight scene in Rob Reiner’s The Princess Bride, it really happened. Christopher Guest, who was playing Count Tyrone Rugen, knocked Elwes out by accident, when he hit him on the head with the butt of his sword. Elwes also broke his toe during the first week of filming when he was “messing around” between scenes on co-star Andre the Giant’s all-terrain vehicle. But the actor, who was in his first major role, hid the injury for the rest of the film as best he could. “I was limping a bit, you can see it in some of the scenes – you can see that I was limping into the fire swamp (during a scene with Robin Wright).”The star was filming the scene in which he storms off after he discovers Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) has been renting out his brain to strangers. According to the director, Spike Jonze, a drunk extra then threw a beer can from a moving car at his head while shouting “Hey Malkovich, think fast!” Jonze liked the scene so much that he left it in the film. The extra had his day rate bumped up to $700 a day because he had a speaking role.2930 Viggo Mortensen – The Lord of the RingsWhen Aragon (Mortensen) thinks that two of the hobbits are dead in a scene in The Two Towers, he lets out a gigantic primeval cry as he kicks his helmet in anger and falls to the floor. This behaviour would seem like an appropriate response to the grief his character feels but in reality, the actor had actually broken two toes while kicking his helmet.3030 The entire cast of RoarBut whatever the mishap, nothing can surely be as bad as it was on set for director Noel Marshall’s family, who were cast in his 1981 adventure comedy film Roar? During filming, his then wife Tippi Hendren and her daughter Melanie Griffith, as well as his two sons, John and Jerry, were mauled by lions. Heddren suffered multiple scalp wounds while Marshall was bitten so many times, he ended up hospitalised with gangrene.130 Margot Robbie – The Wolf of Wall StreetThe actor says that acting in the scene where she has sex with Leonardo DiCaprio on a bed of money was really painful in The Wolf of Wall Street. “I got a million paper cuts on my back from all that money! It\u0027s not as glamorous as it sounds,” she said. “If anyone is ever planning on having sex on top of a pile of cash: don\u0027t. Or maybe real money is a bit softer, but the fake money is like paper, and when I got up off the bed, I turned around to get my robe and everyone gasped. I said, \u0027What is it?\u0027 And they said, \u0027You look like you\u0027ve been whipped a million times. Your back is covered in a thousand red scratches.”During the filming of the sequel to Steven Spielberg’s Jaws, cast members were terrified when real hammerhead sharks started circling them in the sea. The trouble was that their screams went unheard. The crew didn’t think they were in real danger to start with because it was written into the script that they yelled for help at that point.330 Sylvester Stallone and Dolph Lundgren – Rocky IVThe fourth in the Rocky film franchise to focus on the boxing career of the fictional Rocky Balboa, played by Sylvester Stallone, has some gripping and authentic-looking fight scenes. It’s no wonder then that during filming, Stallone actually asked Dolph Lundgren, who plays his opponent, Ivan Drago, to try to knock him out for real. But Lundgren hit him with such force that he was sent to the hospital and was in intensive care for over a week.Brando was infamous for his bad on-set behaviour. That is one reason why Paramount was nervous about getting him involved in Francis Ford Coppola’s mafia film. It didn’t start well, when on the first day of shooting, the actor who played the patriarch in the family, Vito Corleone, missed his overnight flight from LA to New York. His scene was rescheduled for the next day, but it cost producers $40,000.In his autobiography, rapper Gucci Mane said he was so tired on set of Harmony Korine’s crime film Spring Breakers, that he fell asleep during his big sex scene. The rapper, who plays Big Arch, a rival drug dealer of James Franco’s Alien character in the film, is seen having sex with one woman, while another sucks his toes. “I couldn’t keep my eyes open. I was knocked out, snoring . . . Harmony kept having to wake me up for takes.” In another interview, he explained why he was so exhausted. “I had a concert down there in St Petersburg, Florida, one of the days I had to shoot a scene. Same night. We started shooting at 10 o\u0027clock in the evening until 1 or 2 o\u0027clock.”The action star broke his ankle while doing his own stunt on set of the sixth Mission Impossible. The scene sees Cruise completing a fast rooftop jump from one building to another, when his foot slams into the side of the wall. But instead of collapsing in a heap, he keeps going as if nothing has happened, until the end of the scene when he can be seen hobbling away. He said: “I knew instantly my ankle was broken and I really didn’t want to do it again so just got up and carried on with the take. I said, ‘It’s broken. That’s a wrap. Take me to hospital’ and then everyone got on the phone and made their vacation arrangement.”730 Lizzy Caplan and Michael Sheen – Masters of SexCaplan was nervous when she had to take her clothes off in front of co-star Sheen in the TV series. It made her feel better that they were both shaky. But then disaster struck. “And we complete the scene, I place the hand on my breast and they yell “Cut” and he immediately walks over to a garbage can and throws up.“ Turns out Sheen had eaten something that upset his stomach, but Caplan didn\u0027t know that. She said: ”My whole self-confidence plummeted to the ground and I realised that I\u0027m a monster and anybody who touches me will immediately start vomiting and that’s just the way it\u0027s going to be.”830 Nina Dobrev and Paul Wesley – The Vampire DiariesNina Dobrev accidentally broke Paul Wesley\u0027s finger while shooting a sex scene in The Vampire Diaries.930 Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan - 50 Shades of GreyObviously this could be a load of hype to promote the first erotic film in the franchise, but there were certainly a lot of terrible sex scenes in which things could go wrong. Johnson, who plays Anastasia Steele, becomes romantically linked to Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) and they act out their BDSM desires. Johnson, who wore a modesty thong glued to her body while Dornan wore a “wee bag” to protect his modesty, said: “I got whiplash once from him throwing me on the bed. So f***ing painful. I wish we had a gag reel from the shoot.”Michael Imperioli is best known for his role as Tony Soprano’s protégé, Christopher Moltisanti in The Sopranos. During the filming of his death scene in Martin Scorsese’s Goodfellas, Imperioli cut his hand on a glass and was taken to hospital, where the doctors sped in to treat his fake bullet wounds.During the filming of Groundhog Day, Murray was more irritable than usual as he was going through a orce and was prone to disappearing from set. He had been asked to get an assistant to ease communication between him, the director Harold Raims and the studio. He was against the idea, so he hired somebody who was deaf and spoke only in sign language, which nobody on set, including Murray, could understand. Ramis said: “Bill said, ‘Don’t worry, I\u0027m going to learn sign language.’ And I think it was so inconvenient that in a couple of weeks, he gave that up. That’s anti-communication, you know? Let’s not talk.”It was a small mishap for Dunham when her nude patch kept falling off in scenes that required nudity. Dunham, who plays aspiring writer Hannah in her comedy-drama TV series Girls, said: “I stopped wearing the nude patch after the first season of Girls. There’s not one guy who works on that show who hasn’t seen the inside of my vagina. You glue it over your vagina. It gets sweaty and always falls off. My male co-stars, at the end of the day, don’t care.”In one scene of Quentin Tarantino’s 2015 Western thriller, Jennifer Jason Leigh as Daisy Domergue plays a guitar. It is a vintage Martin guitar from the 19th century, worth roughly $40,000, which had been loaned out from the Martin Museum in Pennsylvania. But a misunderstanding on Russell’s part led to an expensive mistake. The valuable guitar was meant to be swapped over with a replica prop when he snatched it from her. Russell had not read the memo, though, and smashed the antique guitar against a wall, while shouting “Music time is over”. As a result, the Martin Museum – which called the guitar a priceless, irreplaceable artefact – vowed never to loan guitars out to movies again.1430  Robert Pattinson and Julianne Moore – Maps to the StarsThe Twilight and Lost City of Z actor played Jerome, a limousine driver and struggling actor, in David Cronenberg’s acerbic Hollywood satire. It was while he got intimate in the back of a car with Moore’s character, a washed-up actress, that he ran into problems and started sweating profusely. “I sweat like a f***ing crazy person,” he said. “I was trying to literally catch drops of sweat to stop them hitting her back. Afterwards she was like, \u0027Are you having a panic attack?\u0027 It was so embarrassing.”1530 Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal - Love and other DrugsHathaway accidentally stripped off too soon when she thought cameras were rolling during the filming of Love and other Drugs. She stars alongside Jake Gyllenhaal in the erotic film based on the non-fiction book Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman by Jamie Reidy. “I have to remove my trench coat and be nude underneath, and I thought we were filming,” she said. “But it turned out we were just rehearsing and I got unnecessarily naked in front of a lot of people!”In a 2007 episode of the reboot of Battlestar Galactica TV series, Olmos’s character William Adama, the commanding officer of BS Galactica, is playing around with a model ship when he gets carried away by improvising and smashes it to smithereens. The model ship was, however, museum quality and according to Olmos, who had no idea at the time, it was worth roughly $200,000.1730 Allison Janney and Michael Lerner in Life During WartimeDuring a sex scene against a wall for the 2009 comedy-drama, Allison Jamey\u0027s co-star Michael Lerner went crashing to the ground. “We had to have sex up against a wall and they started spraying us with glistening stuff to make us look sweaty, but no one seemed to realise that we were standing on a marble floor,” she said. “They said ‘Action’ and he pulled me up against the wall and his feet slipped out from under him and he went crashing down on the floor. It was terrible, but it was one of those moments I\u0027ll never forget.”1830 Ryan Reynolds and Olivia Wilde in The Change-UpThe Deadpool star was taken aback when his co-star Olivia Wilde painted smiley faces on her underwear during a sex scene, that he completely forgot what he was doing. “In the scene, she’s sitting there and I take her top off and the bra off, and she has those panties on, but she’s drawn these adorable little smiley faces on them,” he said. “And I forget every line. Not just from this movie, but from every other movie I’ve done.”1930 Sean Connery and Lana Turner – Another Time, Another PlaceSean Connery and the American actress Lana Turner were filming a love scene when Turner’s gangster boyfriend Johnny Stompanato showed up uninvited. Turner was playing an American journalist who has a love affair with a BBC war correspondent (played by Connery). But her boyfriend was so jealous that he showed up with a gun in his hand, and threatened to kill Connery. Bravely, Connery grabbed the gun from his hand and twisted the boyfriend’s wrist until he fled off the set. Turner’s turbulent life continued when her daughter Cheryl killed Stompanato with a kitchen knife fearing that he was going to kill her mother after he showed up at their house in the US – but in the trial it was deemed as justifiable homicide.2030 Christian Serratos and Michael Cudlitz - The Walking DeadThe long-running TV show focuses more on blood and violence than sex. But during one scene between Rosita (Christian Serratos) and Abraham (Michael Cudlitz) things nearly went pear-shaped when they had to get intimate in front of 30 crew members, who  were drinking coffee and eating ramen noodles. Cudlitz, who was on top of Serratos, said they were nearly naked but covered – but then as they were “humping”, the cover got knocked off, leaving Serratos practically naked. The actor said: “Then we just started laughing, because it\u0027s ridiculous. It\u0027s two people, we barely know each other, lying on top of each other naked.”During the filming of Blazing Saddles, a man wandered into a scene of the film. He wasn’t part of the crew or cast but when the director Mel Brooks got the man moved on, he returned again, seemingly not understanding the request. Brooks then sent over a waiver for him to sign and left him in the movie for a laugh. He can be spotted at the end of the film wearing a jumper and standing on a sidewalk watching the action as people run out of the Warner Brothers studio front gates.Not really a mishap, but it was certainly an awkward moment behind the camera for the then 17-year-old actor, who legally had to have his mother on set for his first-ever sex scene, in which he says, “It’s in.

If we clear a path to the creation of compelling electric vehicles, but then lay intellectual property landmines behind us to inhibit others, we are acting in a manner contrary to that goal.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

With one constituency left to declare, the Tories stand poised to secure a majority of 78.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIn contrast, it was a night of humiliation and defeat for Labour, losing a series of stronghold seats across the country. After the party’s share of MPs dropped from 243 to an estimated 203, leader Jeremy Corbyn announced that he would lead Labour through a “process of reflection” before standing down\u0026nbspahead of the next election.With Labour lurching left and the Tories seemingly\u0026nbspwooing the Eurosceptic right, the map below highlights the changing voting habits\u0026nbspamong the\u0026nbspelectorate while showing the results of every single UK constituency.The fall of the ‘red wall’When contrasted with the 2017 election, this year’s vote demonstrates a clear swing among traditional Labour seats across the north and central regions of the UK – the so-called ‘red wall’ – to the Conservatives.The results means Mr Corbyn’s party, which had 243 MPs when Parliament was dissolved last month, is headed for its worst result since 1935.Among the long-held Labour seats to be taken by the Tories were:Even veteran left-winger Dennis Skinner, who had been set to become the Father of the House, lost his seat of Bolsover, a former mining stronghold which had been Labour since its creation in 1950.Labour has gained just one seat across the UK (Putney).The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Independent’s political columnist Andrew Grice takes a closer look at the factors behind the party’s success, as well as Labour’s shortcomings – read his analysis here.​There was success for the Scottish National Party\u0026nbsptoo, making strong gains across Scotland. Their increased parliamentary presence could prove troublesome for Mr Johnson in the coming weeks and months, with a strong opposition to Brexit among the country’s voters.And not all the biggest scalps of the night were Labour’s. DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds – whose party propped up Theresa May’s administration – lost his Belfast North seat to Sinn Fein.Tory former minister Zac Goldsmith fell to the Lib Dems in Richmond Park while Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson also lost her seat to the SNP and quit as party leader. Sir Ed Davey and Baroness Sal Brinton will become joint acting leaders ahead of a leadership contest next year.But Labour’s drubbing by the Tories was no doubt the story of the night and leaves the party questioning what comes next.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

There are no GPs or other services on the estate anymore.#Im not worried about the house value going down because its on Corbyn Road but it might bother my son.#When asked about his timetable to leave as leader, Jeremy Corbyn said: #The National Executive will have to meet, of course, in the very near future and it is up to them. It will be in the early part of next year.# Discussing the disastrous election he said: #It was ultimately taken over by Brexit and we as a party represent people who voted both Remain and Leave.#My whole strategy was to reach out beyond the Brexit ide to try and bring people together, because ultimately the country has to come together.#When asked what went wrong, Mr Corbyn said: #Those in Leave areas in some numbers voted for Brexit or Conservative candidates, which means we lost a number of seats and we didnt make the gains I hoped we could have done, particularly in the Midlands and Yorkshire and the north.# Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said he is #very sad# at the partys worst general election result in more than  years.He added that he has #pride in our manesto and all of the policies that we put forward#. Lisa Nandy, Labour MP for Wigan, said Labour was out of touch with people in many of its traditional heartlands.She told the BBC that when people in constituencies like hers voted for Brexit they were dismissed as “stupid”, “racist” or not understanding the question.She said: #What we have been told in towns like this is we are not listening.#Prime Minister Boris Johnson is greeted by staff as he arrives back at  Downing Streetafter meeting the Queen.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

By not supporting Jeremy Corbyn and his Communist buddies, I am - I am told - an “age traitor”. Boris is for boomers, the thinking goes, and Corbyn is for us.But scratch the surface and you’ll find that the Prime Minister - a man who made his name as mayor of London - has rather a lot to offer us young folk. And Jeremy Corbyn - a Marxist straight from the s- might just make  our lives a hell of a lot worse.Take, for example, the issue the vast majority of young people say matters to them most: housing.If you’re a young private renter, Corbyn’s radical plan to crackdown on “dodgy” landlords sounds really rather good.But there’s a serious catch. If landlords could be forced by the government to sell their homes to tenants at a price dictated by the Government, the buy-to-let market would collapse. And fast.In a few pockets of the country, where housing supply is plentul, that would be great. With landlords out of the picture, those desperate to get on the property ladder might stand a chance.In most of Britain, though, the picture wouldn’t be so rosy. Where available housing is precious and most people can’t afford to get on the housing ladderprivate renting is a blessing. And a collapse in the buy-to-let market would hike the price of it.So under Corbyn’s “fairer Britain”, those right at the start of their careers would soon be priced out of metropolitan areas.Then take university fees. Again, the idea of “free uni” sounds very tempting indeed. But under Corbyn’s regime, university tuition wouldn’t suddenly become free. It would just be paid for by the tax-payer instead of the student.What does that mean in practice  Well, it means that the  per cent of young people who opt to get a job end up at  would end up massively subsidising the  per cent who choose to enjoy three years of student le. I loved my time at uni, but I don’t see why my  year old cousin - who’s been working his socks off in the navy for three years - should be forced to pay for it.And evenyou are a student or planning to go to university, Corbyn won’t help you in any real sense. If students don’t contribute to their own education, universities suddenly have a lot less money. Which means they can’t admit as many teenagers.In Scotland, for example, where tuition has been “free” for years, fewer and fewer young people are going to university. And because the middle classes know how to game the system, it tends to be disadvantaged kids who get let down.Andyou work for yourself, which around % of Generation Z would like to do, Labour’s radical tax plan certainly isn’t for you.Even though Jeremy Corbyn has promised that only the richest five per cent of workers will face higher bills, new analysis shows that self-employed workers earning much less could be £, a year worse off under the new rules. And sole traders - ie. young, ambitious entrepreneurs who pay themselves lower salaries in order to invest in their businesses - would suffer the most.Boris Johnson might not be a hit at Glastonbury. But like a true One Nation Conservative, he believes in opportunity. And his pragmatic schemes, like % deposit mortgages, would give hard working young people a proper leg up in le.I don’t hunt, I don’t shoot, and I wouldn’t be seen dead in tweed. But I believe that a country can only succeed when ambitious young people are encouraged by the state to spread their wings and fly. Not given countless handouts by a bankrupt Government.So tomorrow, I’ll be voting Conservative with pride.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But it has NEVER been more important. The stakes have never been this high.You can back Boris Johnson — who makes a direct plea to Sun readers — to secure Brexit by January  and steer us into a bright new decade as a prosperous and independent nation outside the EU.If you don’t, oryou stay at home, you risk handing power to Jeremy Corbyn’s extremists, who will reverse Brexit andus to the industrial carnage of the bleak s which his union paymasters consider a golden age.Back in  The Sun’s famous “lightbulb” front pagewarned of the nightmare of a Neil Kinnock Labour Government.That would have been a picnic compared with a Corbyn regime which threatens to drag our great country into a terrying and dark new era.Imagine you wake tomorrow to find Jeremy Corbyn, even in defeat, somehow cobbling together a Government in which the Scottish Nationalists and Lib Dems call the shots.Imagine this appalling Remainer pact drafting a new, rigged Brexit referendum and another hideously isive Scottish independence vote.Imagine them radically altering the voting rules to ensure hard-Left power for a generation.Imagine that the Pound has already crashed, hundreds of billions are being pulled out of the country and our global allies are making contingency plans to freeze out our new Marxist Prime Minister, considered a national security risk not just by them but by his own health secretary.This is not some scare story The Sun has invented. It is inevitableBoris Johnson has agonisingly too few seats for a working majority.As the economy begins its rapid descent into ruin, with the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs — maybe including yours — imagine how you will feelyou didn’t go out and vote to prevent it.The Sun has warned for years how dangerous Corbyn, his creepy shadow chancellor John McDonnell and their Communist aides are.We highlighted how they backed the IRA while it was executing our soldiers and civilians. How Corbyn considers Arab terrorists “friends” while loathing the West and our No ally America in particular.We told how his anti-Semitism had drawn Jew-hating bigots to his party like flies to a cesspit and led to Labour becoming only the second party after the fascist BNP to be probed for racism by the Equality and Human Rights Commission.We described how he and McDonnell revel in left-wing thuggery and foster a vicious hatred of opponents, exemplied by their repulsive social media trolls and the flashmobs that publicly vily and intimidate Tories.They have created a party of hypocrites and liars for whom no fabrication is too bigit damages the Tories they detest. A party which built an election campaign around a monstrous hood about the Tories “selling the NHS” to Trump.Corbyn was a joke once. Now, with this election as tight as it is, he is on the brink of power. It should terry every sane person in Britain. It is shocking that it does not. It is profoundly depressing to see people supposedly opposed to racism give Labour’s anti-Semitism a free pass asit is a “lesser” prejudice, even a socially acceptable one. Tell that to terried British Jews, resigned to emigrating to escape Corbyn. Or to the  former Labour MPs who yesterday begged the public not to vote for their old boss for precisely this reason.What has our country become that such a toxic, dangerous party could be within a mile of power  A party which derives its energy from grievance and hate  What has happened to our education system that the insane high-tax, business-destroying economics of Corbyn and McDonnell, which have brought ruin everywhere they have been applied, are discussed as a serious possibility  That despite mass starvation in Venezuela, which Corbyn held up as his model, his young fans still believe the same system is worth a go The answer is austerity and its successful weaponisation by a Labour Party relying on voters forgetting why it was necessary. Well, here’s a reminder: In  the global financial crisis and Labour’s scandalous over-spending left us heading for bankruptcy. Labour was borrowing nearly £billion a WEEK and left incoming Tories a snarky note: “Dear Chief Secretary. I’m afraid there is no money.”They thought it was FUNNY. The cost was nine long years of cuts, vital to get our finances back in order. These are now presented as a cruel Tory “choice”. That is nonsense. They had no alternative.But, yes, public services have struggled. The NHS is short-staffed and cannot keep pace with an older, sicker and rapidly expanding population. Police cuts have hurt the fight against crime.Homes are far too expensive for young people, particularly in the South. Many of those don’t recall Labour’s financial disaster. They just want change and an economic stake in society. But they and too many others who will vote Labour because they are sick of “Tory cuts” forget why they happened:Labour wrecked the economy. The Tories had to fix it.Boris is a dferent Tory, unafraid to spend big to pump le back into “left-behind” communities.His economic programme is far more lavish than that of Theresa May or David Cameron. He will plough billions more into the NHS, police, schools and new infrastructure projects. He has a zeal to regenerate regions that fell behind as London flourished. Mrs May talked about it. Boris will do it.And, yes, a Tory majority WILL deliver Brexit on January . But you are going to have to vote for it.Too many think they voted for Brexit once, it didn’t happen and they can’t be bothered voting any more. That all politicians are liars, so why trust any  Or that Nigel Farage has promised to deliver Brexit too, so you’ll vote for him.These would be disastrous errors.Farage’s party will not win seats. A vote for his Brexit Party is one lost to the Tories, as several Farage candidates have now admitted.Andyou’re a Remainer Tory who dislikes Boris, a vote for the Lib-Dems is not a “free hit”. It’s a vote for chaos, from which Corbyn is almost certain to emerge as PM.The stark reality is Britain cannot afford for Boris to fall short.Soyou are inclined to vote Tory you MUST go out today and do it.Boris has been in power only four months, hamstrung all along by a Remainer Parliament. He could be a great PM and deserves a chance.Go out and vote Tory today. Save Brexit, and save Britain from Corbyn.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It says “Friday th”. Then I hear a horrible cackling — and, OMG, it’s Diane Abbott standing by my bed, her face split open with mirth.“We’re in charge now!” she shrieks: “Ha ha ha ha ha.” And then the rest of the ghouls appear.Magic Grandpa Jeremy Corbyn, smirking through his beard, wearing his Lenin hat. Jo Swinson of the Lib Dems like a Girl Guide Leader from Hades. And then — grinning like Janette Krankie on acid — Nicola Sturgeon of the SNP.I try to hide under the covers but Diane pulls them back. “We’re in charge now,” she repeats. “And first we’re going to wreck Brexit. And then we’re going to wreck the country. Ha ha ha ha.”Friday, December  is the day we find out who will be ruling us for the next five years. And my nightmare could quite possibly come true.I’ve been saying for ages that the idiotic Corbyn could win this election — without actually winning any more seats.It is an incredibly precarious position for Boris Johnson and the Conservatives — and thus for Brexit.The polls seem to be tightening. The Conservatives haven’t run a terribly good campaign, it’s true.All it needs is another drop in the Tory lead of one per cent and we would be heading for a hung Parliament.That almost certainly means a government led by Corbyn, with support from the Lib Dems and the SNP. It would definitely mean an end for Brexit.The democratic decision we took three years ago would be forgotten. At best there would be ANOTHER referendum.Almost certainly rigged by Labour and the Lib Dems to ensure that, this time, the right side won, ie, their side.They have no respect whatsoever for that democratic mandate. They are very clear about that. But there will be even worse to come.Labour will usher in a ruinous economic programme which the country cannot possibly afford.Our entrepreneurs will flee the country. We’ll be back in huge debt once again. Spending on stuff we cannot afford.Labour plans to spend TWENTY EIGHT times as much money as the ConservativesWorst of all, we will be led by a halfwit who supports every enemy known to this country.You name a terrorist cell or a vile, authoritarian country and mad old Jezza will at some point have offered it support.From the IRA to the genocidal Islamists Hamas, from Cuba to Iran.The brilliant website Guido Fawkes has detailed all the times Corbyn has stuck up for terrorists or horrible totalitarian governments. Gawd help us, the list is almost endless.This is a bloke who has said he wishes Nato didn’t exist. That’s the military alliance which has kept peace for  years!But don’t take my word for it. Just this week yet another Labour MP was caught moaning about how truly bloody awful Corbyn was.Jonathan Ashworth said voters were turned off by the man and that the prospects for Labour were “dire”.He added: “I’m helping colleagues, banging on about the NHS for them, but it’s awful for them, and it’s the combination of Corbyn and Brexit . . . outside of the city seats . . . it’s abysmal out there . . . they can’t stand Corbyn and they think Labour’s blocked Brexit.”That’s not “Tory lies”, as the lefties always say when someone takes a pop at the old scrote.That’s a member of his own front-bench team. But then a good two thirds of Labour MPs can’t stand Corbyn and think he would be awful for this country.As Boris Johnson said, Ashworth was only saying what hundreds of Labour candidates and millions of voters were thinking.You wonder why some of those candidates don’t have the courage of their convictions and stand down.In fact, plenty have already done so. Ivan Lewis, for example, who has urged everybody to vote Conservative.Then there was John Woodcock and Ian Austin. Both former Labour MPs, moderates. They even made placards telling people to vote Tory.More MPs left Labour long ago — such as Chuka Umunna, who is now standing as a Liberal Democrat, and Brexiteer Kate Hoey can’t bring herself to support the party she served for  years.The man and his retinue of Trots — John McDonnell, Rebecca Long-Bailey , the ghastly Diane Abbott — are a laughing stock. Except I don’t find very much to laugh about, to tell you the truth.And along with Labour and the Lib Dems will come more stupid, socially isive identity politics. The whole country ided up into competing victimhoods.Gay, transgender, black, Asian. Asthese were the things which define us as human beings.But then that’s the infantile and damaging way the Left sees the world.Given all this, you might think it incredible that Corbyn could ever get the keys to No Downing Street. So many people despise the bloke.And that’s before we factor in his repellent anti-Semitism .And you might look at the polls and think — well, the Tories still have a decent lead. Nothing much to worry about.It won’t be Friday th or Nightmare On Abbott Street. It might well be Groundhog Day, but that’s preferable. But this is the big problem for BoJo and his Conservative team. Complacency. The suspicion on the part of the electorate that Corbyn could never actually win. When he could win all too easily — and don’t forget, the opinion polls are very often wrong.The other problem for the Tories is, of course, the Brexit Party. They are still fielding candidates in seats up and down the country — seats which the Tories need to win in order to form a government.Some senior figures in the Brexit Party have already said they would be far better off backing the Tories in order to get Brexit done.But Brexit Party boss Nigel Farage will not listen to them.So we have the terrible situation where people might vote for the Brexit Party in order to make sure we leave the European Union — but in doing so actually STOP Brexit from occurring.Becausethe Brexit Party takes lots of votes from the Tories, that lets in Labour and the Lib Dems through the back door. And the result  No Brexit.It’s in those seats in the North and Midlands where the Conservatives are most vulnerable to a high Brexit Party vote.This is a crucial election. Not just for Brexit, but for Britain’s future.That means a vote for the Conservatives, no matter how much that sticks in the craw.I’ve mentioned before that the only time I voted Tory I felt pretty glum afterwards.But this time there really is no alternative except in a tiny handful of seats where the Tories cannot possibly win.Once this election is out of the way, we need a new party to provide opposition to the Tories.A party that will replace Labour. For me, that’s the Social Democrats. But we’re not at that stage yet.For now it’s a case of walking to the polling booth, holding your nose and voting Blue.You decide our government. You may have your doubts about our democracy — I don’t blame you! You may feel uneasy voting Tory — don’t blame you for that, either.But you hold the destiny of our country in your hands.Indeed, when you put that cross in a box, you ARE the government. The person who decides what is best for our country.So make your vote count, please — and banish those nightmares for ever. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

dropped off the radar screens of flight monitors in Malaysia just five seconds after it crossed into Vietnamese airspace.But the controller monitoring its progress in Kuala Lumpur was dealing with other traffic on his screen and didn’t notice it had vanished.Its been reported by the Atlantic that when he finally did, he assumed that it was now in the hands of his counterparts in Ho Chi Minh.However, Vietnamese controllers saw the Boeing  - which vanished with  on board - cross into their airspace and then also disappear.They then apparently misunderstood rules which meant they were supposed to inform Malaysia immediatelya plane did not show up.They tried repeatedly to contact the flight crww of the aircraft - which is believed to have crashed into the ocean - but to no avail.By the time they finally picked up the phone to inform Kuala Lumpur,  minutes had passed since its sudden disappearance.What ensued was an exercise in confusion and incompetence full of blunders, say those close to the long-running investigationKuala Lumpur’s Aeronautical Rescue Coordination Centre should have been notied within an hour of the disappearance, they say.Malaysia Airlines Flight MH took off from Kuala Lumpur and was heading to Beijing with  people on board.Passengers included Chinese calligraphers, a couple on their way home to their young sons after a long-delayed honeymoon and a construction worker who hadnt been home in a year.But at .am on March , , Malaysia Airlines lost contact with MH close to Phuket island in the Strait of Malacca.Before that, Malaysian authorities believe the last words heard from the plane, from either the pilot or co-pilot, was Good night Malaysian three seven zero.Satellite pings from the aircraft suggest it continued flying for around seven hours when the fuel would have run out.Experts have calculated the most likely crash site around , miles west of Perth, Australia.But a huge search of the seabed failed to find any wreckage - and there are a number of alternative theories as to its fate.However, it eventually took more than four hours to alert rescuers - which means it is virtually impossible to pinpoint where and when it went down.Five pieces, thought to be from the Malaysia Airlines plane, later washed up in Madagascar - more than , miles from Vietnam.Aviation expert Victor Iannello believes one fragment, which appears to be from the interior floorboard, is consistent with a “high-speed impact.More than  bits of aircraft debris have so far been collected from ious places around the world over the past five years.However, only three wing fragments that washed up along the Indian Ocean have been confirmed to be from the missing flight.Its been reported earlier this year that the pilot was in control until the very end but made abnormal turns before crashing.French investigators have been given access to a considerable amount of flight data sent during the flight prior to the crash.Official documents lend weight to fears pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah, , crashed into the sea in a murder-suicide, they were cited as saying.Some feared Russian president Vladimir Putin was involved in the hijacking of MH.US Science writer Jeff Wise claimed Putin spoofed the planes navigation data so it could fly unnoticed into Baikonur Cosmodrome so he could hurt the West.French ex-airline director Marc Dugain accused the US military of shooting down the plane because they feared it had been hijacked.Malaysia police chief Tan Sri Khalid Abu Bakar suggested the disappearance could have been the result of a suicide.He claimed someone on board could have taken out a large le insurance package before getting on the plane, so they could treat their family or pay back the money they owed.Historian and writer Norman Davies suggested MH could have been remotely hacked and flown to a secret location as a result of sensitive material being carried aboard the jet.Malaysia Airlines found a -inch crack in the fuselage of one of its planes, days before MH disappeared.The Federal Aviation Administration insists it issued a final warning two days before the disappearance.But the Daily Mirror claimed the missing jet did not have the same antenna as the rest of the Boeing s so it did not receive the warning.Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull unexpectedly said it was “very likely that the captain planned this shocking event”.He claimed the pilot wanted to create the worlds greatest mystery.Another theory claimed that he hijacked his own plane in protest of the jailing of then-Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, and as a way to destabilise the corrupt government of Najib Razak.Another seemingly far-fetched idea said the pilot had deliberately crashed the plane to cover his track as he had parachuted out of the plane so he could spend the rest of his le with his girlfriend who was waiting in a boat in the sea.In the wake of the incident, South Korea noted that North Korea nearly took out a Chinese plane which had  passengers on board, on March , .Some fear Pyongyang shot the plane down, but others believe it was hijacked and erted into the communist nation.One theory claims that because many relatives were able to hear a ringing tone for up to four days after the crash so the doomed jet could not have smashed into the Indian Ocean.Nineteen families have all claimed the devices of their loved ones rang for up to four days after the jet went missing.However, wireless analysts claim that phone firms sometimes use a phantom ringing sound when the device is not active, the Daily Star reports.In September , British video producer Ian Wilson claimed to have found the missing aircraft using Google Maps.Despite millions being spent on the search to located the wreckage, the Brit sleuth believes he has found the jet in a mountainous area of the Cambodian jungle.In response, the Chinese government used observation company Space View to focus in on the high-altitude area on the outskirts of Phnom Penh.However, the firm claim there was no sign of any plane, least of all the Malaysian Airlines aircraft which has been missing since March .An MH sleuth has claimed that locals in Cambodia told him they saw a plane believed to be the doomed Malaysia Airlines flight crashing in the jungle.If the jet was flying north then possible locations could stretch as fast as the border between Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan to Thailand.The Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak originally asked the Kazakhstan leader Nursultan Nazarbayev to set up a search operation in the country but this quickly got sidelined as the rescue efforts focused on the Indian Ocean.The doomed flight is said to have mysteriously “flew round in circles” and veered of course shortly before disappearing.Data from British satellites could indicate the plane was oddly circling above the Pacic Ocean in South East Asia in the moments before it vanished.Aviation expert Jeff Wise, author of the Plane That Wasnt There, said data from Inmarsat, may suggest MH was flying bizarrely during its last minutes.Usually a jet will circle at a fixed altitude after being instructed to do so by air traffic control before being allowed to land at an airport.A satellite called F had made contact with the plane in the hours after it went missing via a series of what is technically known as electronic “handshakes”.Mr Wise explained: Just as the motion of a speeding train makes the tone of its whistle go up or down, the relative motion of the satellite and the aeroplane shts the frequency of the radio signals transmitted between them.MH’s disappearance has also given rise to a slew of conspiracy theories - some far more bizarre than others.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A famously moderate country would never dream of electing a Prime Minister who saw Venezuela as a good example to Britain. Let alone an IRA supporter.Labour under Corbyn would be doomed for a generation — and the Conservatives would be laughing all the way to the polling station.  But Corbyn turned out to be no laughing matter.Exit polls last night suggested the Tories were set to win a clear majority — and Britain had not elected a Marxist to be its next Prime Minister.Even so, a chunk of the population yesterday were prepared to disregard Corbyn’s horric litany of failures and betrayals to vote for the lethal communist who has swallowed the Labour Party.Why  Because millions of young Brits were unable to grasp what a Corbyn government would really mean.When you told them Jeremy Corbyn thinks Britain should be modelled on Venezuela and the regime there has left citizens literally eating their pets, they rolled their eyes in tired disbelief.When you told them John McDonnell praised the “bravery” and “bombs and bullets” of the murderous IRA, they made vague noises about history being history.When you told them Corbyn would sever Britain’s ties with natural allies such as the US and align us instead with Putin’s Russia, they reminded you they don’t like Donald Trump anyway.Like the anti-vaccination parents who don’t remember the horrors of polio, the millennials who skipped to the polling station in bright-red hats and scarves weren’t born when hard-left union domination was ripping Britain to shreds.And their schools — which quite rightly drilled them in Nazi genocide — never taught them about the mass-murders and starvation caused by th-Century communism.They grew up when politics meant centrist Tony Blair and centrist David Cameron politely bickering over who had stolen whose manesto pledges.So they naively believed all British politicians — including their hero, Comrade Corbyn — must be moderate and reasonable too.Andyou are blind to the dangers of the most extreme man ever to run for high office in Britain then yes, his “radical” plans sound really rather good.Mired in student debt and with no hope in hell of getting on the property ladder, young people have it rough.  Corbyn’s pledges to address their grievances might be economic fantasy but what millennials hear is that he listened to their problems and he “gets it”.Their love for him was contagious. Group-think has always been a big phenomenon among the young but social media makes it  times worse.  Once Corbyn became a “thing” on Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter, it was easier for young people to go with the flow.If you spent the past three years chanting “Oh, Jeremy Corbyn!” you were part of the gang. If you didn’t, you were at risk of being branded “Tory scum”.Any misgivings friends had about letting a Marxist into Downing Street were quickly dismissed, as they clambered atop their moral high horse.As for the parents of these young people — men and women who experienced the Winter of Discontent in - and who remember the misery and fear of living under the IRA — their Corbynista sympathies are harder to fathom.Some are genuinely suffering after years of austerity, which Tories failed to explain was a necessary consequence of Labour bringing the country to its knees.Others — the arch-Remoaners among us — are suffering from pure pigheadedness. They know perfectly well Corbyn would have been far more damaging for Britain than Brexit but dug in their heels and voted for him anyway.Their cosy middle-class fantasies about Britain were blasted apart by the referendum and they can’t forgive the politicians who let the silly old racists have a say. This time, we have been spared a Marxist Prime Minister who planned to decimate Britain in months.But a line has been crossed.  Horric accounts of Corbynista anti-Semitism have been successfully dismissed as smears, the voices raised against them discounted as political agitation.Facts detailing their racist insurrection recast as “fake news”. And the man in charge of them seriously eyeing Downing Street.It is time for us Brits to stop resting on our laurels.

It was vital the Tories won and it appears they have, convincingly.Corbyn and his poisonous, anti-Semitic cult have been crushed, hopefully terminally.The country must NEVER again be placed at risk from their extremism.

Too many regions have been left behind as London has prospered.But all our economic prospects will be vastly greater under the Tories than Magic Grandpa and his cult of halfwits.We are delighted to see the back of this utterly vile election campaign.It was far too long and almost unimaginably toxic, overwhelmingly due to Corbyn fans vilying their opponents in the street, on TV and on social media.Even so, Boris campaigned well, a couple of own-goals aside. Get Brexit Done looks to have proved as powerful a slogan as he hoped.And, while the Tories’ manesto played it too safe it was a stark contrast to Labour’s tsunami of unaffordable freebies.What should profoundly disturb us as a nation is that so many dismissed Corbyn’s anti-Semitism, his support for terrorists, his lies and his insane spending plans and voted for him anyway.Some claimed, in the same breath, that Labour might be racist but it is “progressive”. That is simply a contradiction in terms.Our great hope for Britain now is not just that Boris can reunite us and steer us wisely into a new era.It is that millions take a hard look at themselves and the Labour extremists they backed and feel some measure of shame.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The media intrusion on peoples lives is very high indeed.And the attacks that take place against family and loved ones of politicians continue and they are disgraceful and frankly they are disgusting.Sir Keir Starmer is now the favourite to take over as Labour boss - but Jess Phillips threw her hat in and Emily Thornberry gave a speech hinting shell go for it tooAnd a number of Labour MPs have publicly slammed their leader amid the disaster at the polls.Ruth Smeeth declared that she lost because Labour is now the racist party and blamed Corbyn, adding they should have ditched him months ago.Her furious tirade came as she announced she had “definitely lost” her seat on a crushing general election night for Labour.Smeeth’s Stoke-on-Trent South constituency was one of Labour’s “Red Wall” seats that fell to the Conservatives to re-draw the political map of England.She blasted: “Jeremy Corbyn’s actions on antisemitism have made us the nasty party. We are the racist party.“He should have gone many many, many months ago. I am, well I was, the Parliamentary chair of the Jewish Labour Movement.We passed a motion of no confidence in him in April.There is absolutely no justication for why he is still there and his personal actions have delivered this result for my constituents and for swathes of the country overnight.And Edinburgh South MP Ian Murray, although retaining his seat, also last night brutalised Corbyn - amid claims the partys safest seat in Scotland was under threat.Murray - now Scotlands only Labour MP - said: Every door I knocked on, and my team and I spoke to , people, mentioned Corbyn.Not Brexit but Corbyn. I’ve been saying this for years.The outcome is that we’ve let the country down and we must change course and fast.Corbyn thanked his sons before thanking his we for all that she puts up with because of the way in which the media behaved towards me, towards her and indeed towards my party during this election campaign.But clinging on to his Islington seat, Corbyn said it had been a very disappointing night as support for his party crumbled in Labours former heartlands.The MP ran as an outside candidate for the party leadership in  and managed to outlast two Tory prime ministers.But finally conceding defeat as the red wall was left in tatters, he said he will call it a day on his time as leader - although he refused to immediately step down.He said: I will not lead the party in any future general election campaign.I will discuss with my party to ensure there is a process of reflection on this result and I will lead the party during that period to ensure the discussion takes place and we will move on into the future.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She only took the party reins in July but was booted out by voters in East Dunbartonshire as SNP rival Amy Callaghan beat her by just . Ms Swinson, , joined DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds, Tory Brexiteer Zac Goldsmith and Shadow Cabinet member Sue Hayman in being ousted. The defeat was a huge embarrassment for her after waging a presidential-style election campaign with her face plastered across the battle bus. But instead of trying to revive Lib Dem fortunes in its former heartlands of the South West, she targeted Remain-supporting areas of London and the Home Counties. Astonishingly, she repeatedly claimed she was a genuine contender to become PM. Her voice cracking with emotion last night, Ms Swinson congratulated her opponent but said: “Tonight we have seen that it looks likely that Boris Johnson is on course to get a majority, and its clearly a good night for the SNP. “Some will be celebrating the wave of nationalism that is sweeping on both sides of the border. These are signicant results for the future of our country. These results will bring read and dismay – people are looking for hope.” Her defeat means the Lib Dems are now expected to be searching for a fourth leader in less than three years. Other big names to go included Labour ’s Mary Creagh in Wakefield, Melanie Onn in Grimsby, Caroline Flint in Don Valley and Laura Pidcock in North West Durham. Ms Pidcock, a key ally of Jeremy Corbyn , had been touted as future leader by his supporters. Labour was frustrated in its attempt to oust Iain Duncan Smith in Chingford and Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab scraped home despite a strong challenge from the Lib Dems in Esther and Walton. And there were sighs of relief as Labour party chair Ian Lavery survived by the skin of his teeth in Wansbeck. DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds was ousted in Belfast North by Sinn Fein’s John Finucane.  Sinn Fein won the seat with , votes to the DUP’s , – the first time the seat has fallen to the republicans since partition. Veteran aposBeast of Bolsoverapos Dennis Skinner made history as he lost his seat to Tories after  years. The -year-old former miner was dealt a devastating blow after his , majority in Bolsover, Derbyshire, was wiped out by a Tory surge. Tory candidate Mark Fletcher won , votes to Mr Skinneraposs , as his vote share plunged by  points. It finally ends the reign of Britainaposs oldest MP and one of its most famous attack dogs against the Tories. Former Labour veteran MP Frank Field was ousted in Birkenhead after becoming an independent. The chair of the Work and Pensions Committee was not realistically expected to keep his seat. Labour took it with a , majority, with Mr Field coming second on ,. Mr Field was never afraid to challenge the Labour leadership, most recently over Brexit when he repeatedly voted with the Tory government. As a result, he lost a confidence vote in his constituency party, then quit the Labour group in Parliament. Mr Field, who entered Parliament in , has been a fierce critic of Universal Credit , describing it as being as disastrous as the poll tax. And despite nominating him, he has been a vocal critic of Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership – ­especially over the anti-Semitism row that has rocked the party recently. Chuka Umunna, who was Labouraposs shadow business minister, defected first to the Independent Group, then eventually to the Liberal Democrats, failed in his bid to be re-elected in Cities of London and Westminster. Shadow Environment Secretary Sue Hayman was ousted in Workington, Cumbria – the town which was identied early in the campaign as potentially holding the key to a Tory triumph. Right-wing think-tank Onward claimed “Workington Man” was the type of voter the Conservatives needed to win over – a Brexit-supporting, older, white, non-graduate male from the North of England with an interest in rugby league and a tendency to vote Labour. Critics blasted the portrait as crude. But voters in the Labour heartland backed Mr Johnson over their well-liked Labour candidate, Ms Hayman. She saw her , majority vanish in a .% swing to Mark Jenkinson, who secured a majority of ,, as she became the first big scalp of the night.  Brexiteer Tory Zac Goldsmith lost his ­Richmond Park seat to the Lib Dems by , votes. The environmentalist was defeated by old rival Sarah Olney, who he beat to the ultra-marginal seat by just  votes in . He was made an environment minister, attending cabinet, when Boris Johnson took over as Tory leader.

This is the story of how he transformed the Labour party, but ultimately failed to transform the country.In the hours after the defeat a deflated Mr Corbyn said it had been a very disappointing night, with support crumbling in former Labour heartlands.Mr Corbyn acknowledged that he had to leave Labouraposs helm after suffering a second General Election defeat as he criticised media attacks towards himself, his family and the party.I want to also make it clear that I will not lead the party in any future general election campaign, he said as he accepted victory in his Islington North constituency. I will discuss with our party to ensure there is a process now of reflection on this result and on the policies that the party will take going forward. And I will lead the party during that period to ensure that discussion takes place and we move on into the future. Labour MP Anna McMorrin, who retained Cardf North, said she blames Mr Corbyn for the partyaposs election defeat.  She said: In the last few weeks of the campaign we knocked on around , doors, and a large proportion of those people we spoke to, the issue was Jeremy Corbyn .In  Mr Corbyn had been a back bencher and prominent voice on the left for thirty years. When he announced he was standing he was seen by many as just another in a long list of left wingers taking a tilt at the top job, with little hope of winning. In fact most bookies gave him odds of - and he only scraped into the race after colleagues begged more moderate MPs to put him on the ballot to broaden the debate.Well, Diane Abbott and John McDonnell have done it before, so it was my turn, he later told the.But whereas previous attempts to win Labour leadership contests from the left have failed miserably - Mr Corbynaposs campaign tapped into a desire for change. Membership surged as people raced to join the party and back the unassuming Islington North MP for Labouraposs top job.  A summer of packed rallies followed, and when the votes were counted Mr Corbyn had seen off the front runners and defied conventional political wisdom. It wouldnapost be the last time. Allies praised his front line campaigning style, shaped by years of grassroots activism, for delivering the victory. For his entire adult le the Labour MP had taken to the streets to back the causes he believed in. He joined the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament as a schoolboy and was chair of the Stop the War coalition in the run up to the invasion of Iraq. Famously he had served on the National Executive of the Anti-Apartheid Movement, and was arrested in  for protesting outside South Africa House. Mr Corbynaposs championing of causes often put him on the wrong side of the Labour leadership - particularly under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.His activism in this time also saw him champion Irish republicanism and Palestinian statehood. It was this campaigning which would later see his opponents accused of supporting the IRA and violent groups in the Middle East. A serial rebel he was viewed by colleagues as a fringe figure - and it led many of them to questionwas fit to lead the party. What followed was brutal fight for the soul of the Labour party. Corbynaposs supporters rallied around the remnants of his campaign, creating Momentum to reshape the Labour party in his image and organise the those who had joined the party to support him.  Following Leave winning the EU referendum in , simmering resentment from MPs turned into open rebellion. In June,  Labour front benchers resigned in as many hours. Prominent moderates like Hilary Benn, Tom Watson and Angela Eagle called on Mr Corbyn to quit. He refused and the ugly row became a leadership challenge with Owen Smith throwing down the gauntlet. That second race confirmed Mr Corbynaposs grip on the party - he won % of the vote. Supporters soon took over the partyaposs ruling National Executive Committee - and saw gains in constituency partyaposs across the country.  A trio of poor by-election performances followed, but Mr Corbynaposs internal critics were a spent force.By the time Theresa May called the snap general election in , many had written Mr Corbyn off.Nothing before the election suggested that Mrs May was about to throw away her majority. But a disastrous manesto launch for the Tories saw them stumble in that campaign. . It was the opportunity Mr Corbynaposs team needed. A radical manesto filled with popular policies lined up with youthful enthusiasm for the Labour leader. Instead of disastrous defeat the Labour leader made moderate gains. His critics pointed out that he did not win the election. But to many of his allies this was the all the proof they needed that Corbynism could win votes - and maybe even an election.  These hopes were dashed last night. Labour suffered its worst general election results since  with dozens of seats that the party had held for a letime going Tory blue. The defeat was in many ways shaped by Mr Cobynaposs politics - his flaws and his blindspots. Once a passionate campaigner for limiting Britainaposs involvement in the EU, he led a party dominated by Remainers. The partyaposs supporters though were split.Months of uncertainty followed as the party battled over its Brexit position - would it back a second referendum or stay neutral  An earlier fudge had seen them through the  election, but as pressure built around the issue, and Boris Johnson made it his focus, their policy left neither Leavers nor Remainers convinced."},{"url":null,"title":"labours emma dent coad loses","story":"NewsShouts of shame as Labours Emma Dent Coad loses Kensington to ToriesThe seat has ed to the Tories after the shock upset in  while Lib Dem Sam Gyimah came thirdShareCommentsByNicola BartlettPolitical Correspondent:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video shouts-shame-tories-take-kensington-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news politics labours-emma-dent-coad-loses-\"\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Mr Anderson took the constituency of Ashfield in Nottinghamshire from Labour with , votes . Ashfield Independents candidate Jason Zadrozny  won , votes , while Labouraposs Natalie Fleet won , votes . The seat had been held by Labour since , with MP Gloria De Piero serving from .She had announced in July that she was resigning as Shadow Justice Minister and would not stand in the general election. In the bizarre Facebook clip, Mr Anderson said: I stood on this spot a few months ago banging on about nuisance tenants throughout this lovely estate and the fact they were making peoples lives a complete misery.  People say, aposthey have got to live somewhereapos - thataposs right, so my plan would be, and again this is just my own personal opinion, is that these people who have to live somewhere, letaposs have them in a tent, in the middle of a field. Six oaposclock every morning, letaposs have them up, letaposs have them in the field, picking potatoes or any other seasonal vegetables, back in the tent, cold shower, lights out, six oaposclock, same again the next day. That would be my solution.Mr Anderson was previously a Labour supporter, but said he was driven out of the party by Momentum activists. He said he worked at homeless charities before moving into politics. In the caption accompanying the footage, Mr Anderson said his solution would: Reduce anti social behaviour. Free up much needed housing for decent people. Solve the labour shortage on our farms.Many Facebook users reacted angrily to the video, with one writing: I live on a Council estate and have c**p neighbours but all live in private housing nothing to do with council so donapost assume all have council houses have trouble makers.During the campaign Mr Anderson was caught getting his friend to act as a aposswing voterapos.

It’s done, we’ve lost. Weeds are already growing thickly among the hope we’ve sown these past weeks and months. Sitting in Waltham Forest watching the good people of Chingford quietly going about the business of counting votes, we are still waiting for the result here. But we know deep down what the exit poll, and some hard early losses have already told us. That those careless people who smash up things and then retreat back into their money are once more in charge of our country. That the scrubbed boy in the blue rosette whose aftershave I am drowning in is in charge. In my mind, the only voice I can hear is Neil Kinnock’s. “I warn you,” he is saying, “do not be ordinary, young, poor or old.” Or,  years after his speech, do not be on zero hours, or on Universal Credit, or a woman who wears a hijab. That exit poll means Trump’s coming for our NHS. That Boris is emboldened. That Cummings’ hate won. It means Brexit for Christmas. A hard-right cabinet full of horric new year’s resolutions. And a  vision of hell. We’re broken-hearted not because we’ve lost a game, but because we know in our hearts what this means for so many people in this country.It means the foodbank queues will get longer. The tented cities will grow. It means more kids going to school hungry and schools falling apart and our dreams of rebuilding our precious social security system lie in tatters. It’s a bitter, bitter blow to everyone who cares about our planet. And it reveals hard truths it will take time to come to terms with.But let others recriminate. We’ve got work to do. There are people who will need us more in the next five years than they have ever needed us. It’s time to put our arms around each other. For nine long years, communities have been propping each other up. Running soup kitchens for homeless people and gathering clothes for refugees, and keeping foodbanks stocked. Our task now is even bigger than this. We need to quietly look out for our neighbours, notice the kids with holes in their shoes and the elderly people who have stopped going out.We will have to defend our communities, street by street and house by house. Solidarity will always be the strength of our movement, and we stand on the shoulders of those who came before.The people who ran the soup kitchens during the miners’ strike, and stood in the pouring rain campaigning for the release of Nelson Mandela for decades in Trafalgar Square.

For whatever reason, voters have ed the Tory leader a Commons majority after he risked his career by focusing on leaving the EU above all . His victory in the  general election means we are likely to be officially out of the EU at the end of January. But it is by no means the end of the road, no matter how loudly the Prime Minister proclaims it. So what exactly is going to happen with Brexit , when will it happen, and will it happen at all  Here is everything you need to know. The Prime Minister plans to railroad his withdrawal agreement through Parliament to make sure we leave the EU by January .  MPs will come to the Commonsto begin swearing in on Tuesday  December. The Queen will attend Parliament for a stripped-down Queenaposs Speech on Thursday  December with no ceremonial robes and no golden carriage. MPs will then hold the second reading vote on Boris Johnsonaposs Brexit deal before Christmas - probably on Friday or the Monday after next - to pass its first hurdle. MPs will spend much of the month carrying out detailed scrutiny of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill - the legal mechanism for translating the Prime Ministeraposs Brexit deal into law. They need to go through a committee stage, aposthird readingapos and the House of Lords before it receives Royal Assent before January . Unfortunately for the nation, it has loads of problems which we explained previously here:Clause  of the Bill has a trapdoor to no-deal Brexit. It says MPs wonapost get a veto on the hard deadline of  December  to get a trade deal . There will also be checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. And the Bill stops short of guaranteeing workersapos rights will continue to be aligned with the EU.Even more unfortunately for the nation, it seems quite likely to pass despite these problems. That is because Boris Johnson ousted nearly all the Tories who were critical of his deal, and made every single candidate sign a loyalty pledge saying they would the his deal through. Is  February  the end   No. Boris Johnson claimed the deal passing would get Brexit out of Parliament and stop people talking about it, but this is a lie. That is because the deal contains a hard deadline of just  months,  December , to secure a Free Trade Agreement with the EU. Most experts including EU chief Michel Barnier say that is simply not possible. If that deadline is not extended, and Boris Johnson says it wonapost be, we could be facing a no-deal Brexit on  January  when the apostransition periodapos, continuing current EU rules, ends. Meanwhile we will be embroiled in months,not years, of trade talks with the EU and other countries, including the US, India and Australia. The Tories say theyaposll aposaim toapos have % of UK trade covered by free trade agreements within the next  years - starting with US, Australia, New Zealand and Japan. But it could be a long road. The EUaposs trade deal with Canada took seven years.  Is a second referendum still possible  Technically a referendum is always possibleMPs vote for it. But it becomes much, much more dficultBrexit is passed on January . At this point, although there is a transition period, the UK will have legally left its membership of the EU under Article  of the Lisbon Treaty. Before we left, a second referendum would have been held on whether to revoke our exit - effectively cancelling the notice we gave to leave. But after we leave, the UK would have to reapply for membership under Article  of the Lisbon Treaty. Weaposd have to satisfy certain conditions and win approval of the European Council, Commission and Parliament. ,],totalVotes:,votesToShow:,mentometerId:,publicationId:,callbackUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  status,voteActionUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  vote,closed:,closedMessage:This poll has been closed!,hideResults:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true\""},{"url":null,"title":"what happens mps lose seats","story":"NewsWhat happens to MPs when they lose their seats in a general election From Jo Swinson to Anna Soubry, a number of high profile MPs lost their seats in the  general election - so what happens to them now ShareCommentsByDaisy Naylor:,  DEC NewsJo Swinson is one of many high profile MPs to have lost their seat at this general election \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

While the electoral bloodbath unfolded across the country, senior Labour figures started to hint they could throw their hats in the ring to succeed Mr Corbyn.Emily Thornberry declared the real fight has to begin now in an emotional speech on Labouraposs election wipeout. The Shadow Foreign secretary claimed we will fight with the same courage my friend Jeremy showed in what may be interpreted as a pitch for leadership.  Labouraposs Jess Phillips added: If people trust me then yes I will take a role in rebuilding. “But I’m not going to sit here and make your headlines tonight when the thing that matters to me more than anything is having a healthy vehicle to change the world is in tatters. “This isn’t about headlines - this is about people’s lives.” Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer said: “There is no hiding from the overall result. It is devastating. It will hurt the millions of people who so desperately need a Labour Government.“They have suffered so much under ten years of Tory austerity and will suffer more because of this result. We must now reflect but we must also rebuild. “ "},{"url":null,"title":"who won general election 2019","story":"NewsWho won the general election   Results in full and map of new MPsThe Conservative Party has won the  general election, defeating Labour by a signicant majority.

Harvey Richards  West, which sells luxury homes in Whitstable, Kent, allegedly fitted the gates after a man and his dog started sleeping in the entrance of the Grade II listed building two weeks ago.

Pat Walton, , who met the homeless man while shopping, said: What a disgusting response from a business who could have done something to help him instead. I first saw the poor chap when I walked past him a few weeks ago. I spoke to him and I said aposlovey, have you got nowhere to go apos He was really nice and told me he was supposed to be getting into a council home soon. He has been there for a couple of weeks.

After the gates were taken down, Mrs Walton said: It was the right thing to do. People were up in arms about it. Retired Ministry of Defence worker Mrs Walton added that the homeless man has been talking to social services and hopes to be housed in the new year. The sharp central spike on the gate was reminiscent of the infamous aposLondon pavement spikesapos which appeared on the floors of shop doorways in  to discourage rough sleepers.

Kieran Hubbard, , who had recently broken up with his girlfriend, was referred to a senior psychiatrist after he was found at the top of a motorway bridge. But although the consultant recommended Kieran be admitted as an inpatient due to concerns for his safety, healthcare professionals overruled her and instead suggested he be seen at home. The following day Kieran drove to a building site where he had been working in Ancoats, Manchester and hanged himself inside a former mill he was helping renovate.In the minutes before his death he left a series of notes reading aposaposlove and goodbyeaposapos and sent a heartbreaking Facebook message to his father Kevin saying his mental condition had left him “paralysed with an overwhelming sense of fear.”In his message, Kieran said: “It sounds ridiculous to anyone who doesn’t suffer with mental health but I wouldn’t wish it on anyone. It completely takes over you mentally and physically. It’s like a complete state of trauma and you can’t speak, feel an urge to cry, too scared to be with anyone but not wanting to be alone, feeling lost about what to do or how to do it. “Feeling in a daze and simultaneously being unaware but also aware of everything around you. You just want to stay in bed and escape but then you fear what other people are thinkingyou don’t act normal, this continues until either you just give up through exhaustion or collapse and fall asleep.” Mr Hubbard, , a director of  the construction company Kieran was working for raced to the scene after getting the message but by the time he arrived his son was already dead.  At an inquest he condemned local mental health services for letting his son down as a coroner said he would be filing a report to NHS officials calling for better provisions for patients. Mr Hubbard from Terrington St Clement, near Kings Lynn said: aposaposWe were let down by the system. The whole system let him down. He wasn’t hiding his illness, he wanted help and they let him down. He was passed from pillar to post.” Kieran, who was living in temporary accommodation in Salford, had just become a father but in the lead-up to his death in February last year he had split up with the childaposs mother and his mental condition deteriorated.  He was later found on a motorway bridge and referred to the Greater Manchester Mental Health Team for a psychiatric assessment. Mr Hubbard told the Manchester hearing: aposaposHe knew we loved him but he couldn’t get the suicidal thoughts out of his head. It was becoming more and more frequent but he said but he said he had no intention of doing it. “The very last time I spoke to him properly was at am on February . He was very calm and said he was fine. I offered to go pick him up and bring him to Norfolk because I didn’t want him on his own. He was adamant he was fine and wasn’t at risk, in a good place. “He was going to go see the baby that afternoon he seemed quite happy he seemed fine, he had new medication, so he was going to start that.  “But then one of his friends phoned me up and said you better get in touch with Kieran he has posted something. “Straight away as soon as he said it I panicked. I immediately packed up work and tried ringing him no end of times and he wouldn’t answer. “When I got in the car and set off, he did answer and he just said ‘I love you’. “I phoned the Salford Mental Health unit and told them to get to him but they advised me to phone . aposaposI had numerous calls from the police on the way asking me his car registration and I was trying to tell them the site address. I got there and went straight round the back and saw Kieran’s car.aposapos Dr Suraya Khan, consultant psychiatrist said Kieran was referred to her on February  and added: aposaposI was concerned about him being in acute mental health crisis and I concluded he was suffering from a recurrent depressive disorder. At that point he was suffering a current severe depressive episode and it was marked by recurrent suicidal thoughts.  “His depression had all the core features – loss of interest and enjoyment, pervasive low mood and lack of energy. He also had poor sleep and poor concentration, feelings of helplessness and worthlessness. He said thoughts of his newly born baby were a protective factor and I suggested inpatient treatment and I identied a need for the bed. aposaposI spoke to a duty worker and explained that these are my findings but when I requested the bed there was a member of the Salford management team present who advised me that he wouldn’t be entitled to a bed in Salford because although he was temporarily residing in Salford, he was registered with a GP in Bury.  “She advised that the duty worker contact Bury bed management but they had replied that Bury bed management said no admission indicated. I got the impression that Kieran didn’t meet the threshold for their admission. It was an unusual refusal which I have never experienced having assessed a patient’s clear diagnosis.aposapos Sharon Morrison a mental health nurse who investigated the tragedy said: aposaposPennine Care told me they had left the referral open and were waiting for more information.  aposaposMy understanding was that the team had talked about whether or not Kieran needed a bed and together they came to the conclusion that he would be OK for him to be at home because he now understood what a home-based treatment team was about.aposaposBut recording a conclusion of suicide coroner Nigel Meadows said: aposaposIt appears Dr Khan’s clinical decision about the need for an inpatient bed was in practical terms overruled by a group of mental health practitioners who are not psychiatrists."},{"url":null,"title":"grandad battered pub goer pool","story":"NewsGrandad battered pub-goer with pool cue wrongly thinking he was an old nemesisHugh Hill, , was heard shouting and swearing that his victim had \"sliced me  years ago\" when he smashed a pool cue over the mans head at a pub in Ramsgate, KentShareCommentsByAndy RobinsonLaura Sharman:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsHugh Hill, , mistakenly thought his victim was someone who allegedly attacked him  years ago\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

His willingness to approach another inidual from behind and strike them with a weapon shows him to be an extremely violent and unpredictable offender who is prepared to cause serious harm to other people.  His offending is further aggravated by his decision to deny the charge, despite the obvious evidence against him.

They got burnt in the process, then everybody was evacuated and the kids ran out of the church screaming.  I suppose it was quite dangerous to have young children carrying candles, but it was an accident. The headteacher said that the school was aposdevastatedapos by the incident. He added: Our thoughts and prayers are with the child and his family at this dficult time. Following this incident our pupils, staff and families are being given support.  London Fire Brigade assistant commissioner for fire safety Dan Daly said the incident should make adults think twice about their candle usage. He said: This horric accident is a stark reminder of the risk real candles can pose. They are a completely unnecessary hazard when it comes to children and school plays. Sadly this isnapost the first time we have seen clothing and costumes set alight by candles and people need to recognise the risk and prevent these incidents from happening again.  People should not be using real candles - especially around children, costumes and decorations - when there are far safer alternatives available.

Jed Gadbsy has sported his mullet for the past five years, having snipped his barnet into shape as a joke with friends. However, the laughter stopped when he went to Brisbane, Australia last weekend for a birthday celebration only to be barred from entering two clubs. After a spot of bowling he had gone with a group of friends to the cityaposs Valley precinct, only to be denied access at the door. They took my ID off me, scanned me and then security guard leaned over and said aposoh Iaposm not allowed to let you in because of your mullet, itaposs against the dress codeapos, Jed said. First he was refused entry to Retroaposs Cocktail Lounge and then RG. The experience has left Jed, who says he was not drunk at the time, feeling discriminated against.Lawyer Bill Potts told now that he had never heard of a case like Jedaposs while urging venues not to go down the mullet discrimination road. I can understand itsomebody is drunk or disorderly or violent but when we start entering into hair taste this is a whole new world, he said. Jed says he has no plans to cut off the mullet anytime soon. Staff from Retroaposs approached now while they were filming Jed and attempted to explain their door policy.

Richard Williams, , opened his online welfare entitlement aposportalapos to find he had been allocated £ to last until January - on top of a separate sum of p that went into his bank account. He now has no idea how he will manage over the festive period - or keep a roof over his head as he is already in rent arrears. Distraught Richard revealed he has had to rely on a freebie electricity aposvoucherapos to keep the lights on in his flat in Plymouth, Devon. Richard has also had to turn to his severely ill mum for meals and feels ashamed about using a food bank.  He said: I have got all of £. and that has got to last me until January  because of their silly assessment period. The DWP confirmed Richard had been handed less than his usual allowance - because he had earned £ in wages from a previous job. Are you a struggling parent  Contact us on webnews@trinitymirror Richard revealed he quit his role as a fire safety assessor for Wood Group at Devonport dockyard on November  this year after a workplace dispute. He has struggled to find any work since - so reactivated an old Universal Credit claim to help him get through Christmas and New Year. Richard qualied for monthly housing and allowance payments totalling £. But welfare assessment officials docked most of his pay - on the grounds he still had a source of income between November  and December  - meaning he only qualied for a mere £. in December Januaryaposs welfare pay-slip, equivalent to £. a week. Richard expects to finally receive his full money come January  - when Universal Credit is set to pay out againhe remains out of work. But his rent arrears will have soared to £, by then, he says, plunging him into financial misery. And heaposs frustrated his pleas for a Universal Credit aposadvanceapos to get him through until the start of  fell on deaf ears.  I feel right - although I donapost want to be homeless, Richard said. I need the people in charge of Universal Credit to really help me at the moment. I rang them and explained I needed an advance, and they said, aposno, itaposs up to the systemapos . I said, aposwell, who controls your system  Who controls your computer  They wouldnapost give me a proper answer. Itaposs disgusting - itaposs really bad. Universal Credit is a single monthly payment for people in or out of work. It replaces some of the benefits and tax credits that you might be getting now: Richard believes the welfare system - introduced by the Tories in a streamlined overhaul of the historic entitlement structure - is not working and letting a lot of people down. The DWP said it wrote off £. of Richardaposs £ dockyard wage in November December when assessing how much Universal Credit he would then be entitled to. But he said thereaposs no consideration for the fact people live month by month and donapost have spare income to sort out them out later on.

If the projections are correct, we now face the prospect of a miserable five years during which inequality will become ingrained, our health service sold off and schools left to rot. Labour was not lacking in ambition.  Their manesto set out a blueprint for a fairer country that no longer turned its back on injustice, and offered opportunity for all. They went to the country with a programme to rescue our NHS, repair our schools and restore pride in our communities. The alternative was a Tory agenda that was built on lies and  promises, none more  than the pledge to “get Brexit done”. It appeared last night that these lies worked.

Everybody in this league would want to add quality to their squad.“Looking at the bench on Saturday at Arbroath, we are a bit short. If we get a couple of injuries then you are short but you are always looking to improve anyway.“I’ve said before, I don’t want to go back to chopping and changing  players or whatever every window. That has happened for a number of windows at this club and that has to stop.“That’s why we were so busy in the summer so we don’t have to keep doing that. It has taken a bit of time to get everything right since then.“We are looking where we are short and what we can add but it has to be quality not just to add numbers to bulk up the squad for the second half of the season.”Next up for the Dark Blues is a home clash with one of the form sides in the ision at the moment, Dunfermline.Since Dundee have taken just one point from their last , Stevie Crawford’s Pars have racked up three wins on the spin.“It shows you what can happen,” added James. “We’ve kind of switched. Dunfermline have started winning games and we’ve started losing them.“I met Stevie at a reserve game recently and we were talking about how quickly things can turn.“It shows you thatyou put a couple of results together you’re right back up there. They’re in the play-off places where we need to get back to.“It’s a big game on Saturday, we need to be really positive and take the game to them.”The Dens gaffer is wary of the threat posed by Dunfermline frontman Kevin Nisbet, who has scored  goals in his last seven matches for the Pars.But he says,his team can supply the Dundee strikers with the service Nisbet has enjoyed at East End Park then it’ll be the home attackers making the headlines.He said: “Nisbet is a player I like.“He was a threat in the first game of the season and we’ve obviously seen what he can do since then.“They get the ball into the box for him. The big thing is they’re creating the chances for him and he’s putting them away.“I believe we’ve got strikers who are every bit as good as anybody in the league – and they will score plenty of goals with the right service.Arbroath - Dundee: Dark Blues# winless run extends to four thanks to Bobby Linn#s curler\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp arbroath---dundee-dark-blues-winless-run-extends-to-four-thanks-to-bobby-linns-curler embed # secrettQXpZpu\" data-secret\"tQXpZpu\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"“With the strikers we’ve got in our team, we have to play to their strengths.

The boys are working really hard and I think we do have what it takes. It’s just a case of getting a result next time, kicking on and believing.“We understand there is big expectation from the fans and they deserve better.“We are trying to recty it but we need big guts and to take games by the scruff of the neck.“We need everyone in the dressing-room to stand up and be counted.“Hopefully, once we get a result we can kick on and look up the table.”Their winless run may have continued at Gayfield where the Dark Blues were held to a - draw at the weekend but McGhee thinks there were some shoots of recovery in a second half where Dundee created a number of opportunities.“We showed a bit more character in the second half,” he added. “At the Queens game, the second half was pretty flat, this week we knew we couldn’t do the same thing.“I think we created a lot of chances and, on another day, could have scored another two or three goals.“We worked on attacking in the week leading up to the game and I think you could see that.“We had a lot of chances but, unfortunately, couldn’t put them away. We showed a bit of character but it’s not good enough for a club like Dundee going four games without winning.“We all know it and are aware of it – it’s something we are trying to recty as soon as possible.”As much as any chance of catching rivals United at the top has slipped away with the Tangerines opening up a very healthy gap, McGhee knows, having played in the Championship for a few years now, the seven-point dference to Inverness in second place isn’t insurmountable.“The last four results haven’t been good enough and people have been questioning the boys’ commitment and desire but we all try our heart out and sometimes things don’t come off.“We know it isn’t good enough and we are working really hard to recty it. We have a big second half of the season coming up, one that we’ll need to go on winning runs.“If you can do that it really helps and you shoot right back up the table. In this league, anybody can beat anyone.“I’m sure as soon as we get three points we’ll be back on the horse and kick on.”Next up is another tough one against an opponent in Dunfermline who have taken advantage of Dundee’s results to jump above the Dark Blues into third spot.McGhee said: “Dunfermline is a massive game, every one is right now, especially with the run we are on.#We need to put things right quickly.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/12/2.17440821-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/12/2.17440821-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/12/2.17440821-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/12/2.17440821-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"evening telegraphs christmas cash winner ready for a spending spree","story":"Shonni Cullen is celebrating her festive fortune after winning the #s Christmas cash contest.The -year-old Dundee woman scooped the £ prize when her name was plucked out the hat from more than  potential winners.Shonni, of Baldovie Terrace, told how she had already completed her Christmas shopping and was planning to spoil herself and fiancee Chris Webster with a little extra bonus gts.She said: #To be honest, I am not sure what I will spend the money on although I have got a few wee things to get and possibly buy myself clothes and an extra present for Chris.#We only got engaged in July, so we have not set a date yet for the wedding, so the money will go on us after getting most of my Christmas presents.

I’ve just said to them to make sure the ankle is as right as it can be before he comes back into training.“I would love both him and Ojo back. It’s an area of the team that we’ve had to manage and play people out of position at times.“If we can get both boys fully fit after the break then it will be like two new signings for us.“We’ll concentrate on who’s available and on picking up three points tomorrow and trying to finish the month as strongly as we can.”The Dons will attempt to get back to winning ways tomorrow when Hamilton come to Pittodrie.Last Saturday’s - defeat to Hibs at Easter Road ended a run of six games unbeaten.McInnes said: “We’d lost two in  going into the Hibs game. It’s a tough game at Easter Road, although we have always done particularly well there.“They are a team of similar size and probably ambitions and it was disappointing to lose.“Looking back it didn’t feel like a - game – we were well in the game and we had good opportunities to score the first goal.“We got into good areas but we weren’t clinical enough. We look at the first goal and from our point of view it’s avoidable.“We’ve concentrated on looking at the goals we’ve lost and the types of goals we’ve lost in the last couple of games.“We want to make sure we give ourselves every chance of winning by eradicating the type of goals we’ve lost.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column october 25 2019","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe have been overwhelmed this week by the musical talent across Argyll # from world-winning drummers, to the singers at last week#s Mòd in Glasgow and the original performers on the MOJO stage in Ardfern.It is encouraging to see such home-grown talent.

Funds raised go towards the peace building work of the Peace Pledge Union, who are unashamedly against wars and the causes of wars.On Tuesday November  and Thursday November  we will be selling white poppies from the foyer of the Lochgilphead Co-op.Bob Dixon, MinardSir,I agree with the points made by Robert MacIntyre in last week#s edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser, when he says that the proposed education cuts are #madness#.This madness is being forced on councils by the SNP government and its Green Party allies at Holyrood, who for years have been voting for Scottish Government budgets which force councils to make cuts.Unless the SNP and the Greens change course and stop cutting the money they give to councils, this madness will continue.I hope that Mr MacIntyre, a former SNP councillor, will write to the leaders of the SNP and the Greens and demand they give councils enough money to stop these mad cuts.Councillor Alan Reid, Liberal Democrat candidate for Argyll and ButeDear AileenWe are responding to your recent consultation about the council budget.Whilst we are very sympathetic to the dficulties that all public bodies, including the Scottish Government, have faced as a result of a decade of austerity it is only fair to point out that this was imposed not by the Scottish Parliament, but by Westminster.The truth is that overall the Scottish Government has maintained the overall funding for local government, as a share of the overall budget, at around  per cent.Councils have, once again, the option of raising additional funds by increasing the council tax, something they have sought for a long while.The inidual share of the total funding allocated to councils is decided by COSLA, using a needs-based formula. Argyll and Bute Council will receive a total of £. million to fund their services in - which, taken alongside the council tax increase they have decided to implement, will give the council an additional £. million this year compared to last – a rise of . per cent.They will also receive their fair share of the extra funding that has already been announced during the current financial year including £ million for teacher’s pay and £. million for increased teacher’s pension contributions.The council could do a number of things to improve its own prospects.You and your administration could work hard to influence the COSLA formula which does not favour rural authorities with falling populations. The Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance has confirmed to us that he is always willing to consider suggestions, through COSLA, from inidual local authorities.You and your administration could be more imaginative in streamlining central management and devolving delivery and local decision-making closer to local people.You and your administration could maximise income whilst remembering that local businesses are the leblood of recovery. The recent massive hike in inspection charges for food products is an example of the wrong decision being likely to damage the economy rather than enhance it.You and your administration could maximise your assets by working with communities. The council has been slow to undertake any signicant asset transfer which could lead to useful and productive partnerships.You and your administration could be more responsive to, and careful with, communities. The waste of money and time on things like the abortive Traffic Regulating Order for Mull and Iona indicates where you are not using resource wisely and storing up dficulties for the future.You and your administration could ensure that any cuts do not fall on essential services needed for future success. The proposed reduction in educational support staff is an example of where a choice is being made that will not only be counterproductive in terms of our collective future and wellbeing, but will also lose the council local sympathy and support.And you and your administration could prepare to use the already agreed additional £ million for the rural growth deal – coming jointly from the Scottish and UK Governments # to make a long term dference in your performance by instituting a step change in the local economy.As your local constituency parliamentarians we are committed to ensuring the maximum resource comes from central government to Argyll and Bute.We are always happy to work alongside, and in support of, the council and we would be keen to meet to help you develop a detailed plan for the future of the area we are all elected to serve. But we must all be straight with local people and explain that responsibility for the dficulties that the council is experiencing do not all lie at the door of the Scottish Government, and therefore nor do all the possible solutions.Michael Russell MSP and Brendan O’Hara MP"},{"url":null,"title":"negotiating the modern world","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhy is it so hard to negotiate the modern world That is the question asked by Dame Helen Mirren in the Radio Times.

Last year the SNP councillors supported the administration’s budget, this year there were only slight dferences between the administration’s budget and the SNP’s one.It would be great to see our MP and MSP work with the council to make the case to the Scottish Government for more money for Argyll and Bute. COSLA has made a very clear request of the Scottish Government in terms of funding for local councils next year – three per cent plus inflation. The choices facing the council would be substantially dferentthis was delivered and of course it’s the Scottish Cabinet, including our MSP, who actually make the decisions.The fact is that over the past  years, the council has had to make savings of over £million. That means real hardship for many local people – many jobs lost, many services withdrawn. That is the sad reality.Like all councillors I#m sure, I would be happy to work with the local MP and MSP to make the case for more funding for Argyll and Bute.Councillor Aileen Morton, Argyll and Bute Council leaderSir,Regarding council leader Aileen Morton’s comments in the edition of the Advertiser dated October  # why should the public tolerate more cuts to their services year on yearthey are consistently paying their council tax and other taxes This seems unfair and should be challenged. Surely council leader Morton should be saying to the Scottish Government that the funding provided is not enough and we can’t make any more cuts.Instead of a reduced budget, the council should be asking for an increased budget to operate services when you consider all the cutbacks to their budget over the past few years.Perhapsthe situation was made clear to the Scottish Government by local councils that annual cuts to local authority services cannot be sustained, this situation will stop.It is unfair on council staff too, with threats of cutbacks having a negative effect on their own jobs through no fault of their own. Adding more work to an employee already struggling with their workload causes more stress which is not good for staff or their employer.Instead of accepting a reduced budget, please therefore can the budget be challenged and not accepted Peter Laing, LochgilpheadSir,Being non-funded, Mojo Festival of Original Music relies on my own initial outlay and the kindly volunteering of the team to help achieve at least a small bonus for all the hard working and talented acts who put on a really good night at the event.This year, even though we had more expenses, we had an even bigger attendance which meant we made roughly the same profit as last yearto share out, giving the bands £ each. Also the bands sold tickets along with their merchandise to give an extra £ approx to the cause. We had a total of  people in attendancewhich is our best ever turnout.The best part though was how much everyone enjoyed what was a night of some of the best original music Argyll has to offer # and you can#t put a price on that. Well done to all who were there and supported the whole event.Dan and crew, Mojo organisersSir,Among the many concerns caused by you-know-what is the very real fear that hospitals and high street pharmacies will run out of vital medical supplies which would normally arrive from factories in Malta, Hungary and Poland.So why are generic medicines not made in Lochgilphead, in Campbeltown and in Rothesay  After all, calcium supplement tablets are made in Galashiels by a Japanese brewery company.Glasgow Health Board built a brand new wee factory on the Western Infirmary Glasgow University campus  years to manufacture some but not all of their requirements. Not only did this save a great deal of money but the board  also earned considerable extra income by selling their products to other health boards, including Dumbarton and Argyll.All in all, the costs of building and equipping the Hillhead factory proved to be a very sound investment indeed.Duncan I Macdougall, TarbertSir,I write following last week#s open letter by SNP politicians Mike Russell and Brendan O#Hara in which they attempted to evade responsibility for the budget problems facing Argyll and Bute Council.These comments display extraordinary hypocrisy, revealing how out-of-touch these SNP politicians are with the realities of the challenges facing Argyll and Bute Council.The financial pressures on this council are a direct consequence of the repeated unfair financial settlements imposed on the council by the SNP government over the last  years.Brendan O#Hara should get on the phone to Nicola Sturgeon and demand a fair deal for Argyll and Bute instead of blaming everyone .Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters human impact on climate change then and now","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHuman activity from the industrial revolution onwards is causing global warming which,not halted, will have catastrophic consequences.Now scientists suggest that human activity several centuries earlier also caused climate change*.

Those of us familiar with it know full well to treat it with respect and to be particularly careful when coming away from Cairnbaan towards Lochgilphead.Like Rev Mackenzie, I am aware of a number of accidents there over the last  months. I would estimate at least five,not more. This is a hugely disproportionate amount compared with other junctions on this road. That fact alone should ring alarm bells with the roads authority.This, however, is not the be-all-and-end-all. I have personally witnessed more near misses at the junction than I would care to mention. The problem comes particularly, but not exclusively, during the height of the tourist season with drivers who are not familiar with the area.Rev Mackenzie quite rightly points out there is a deceptive vista that appears to make the road look like a long straight one and despite the presence of warning signs, for some reason, these are ignored.I thought it rather a trite response from Argyll and Bute Council, which is effectively saying the junction meets all legal requirements sign wise and motorists need to be more aware. It is effectively shrugging its shoulders about the reality of the situation and refusing to take the constant presence of risk seriously.It really does need someone to come up with a genuine solution that will eliminate these risks as far as humanly possible and hopefully curtail the number of incidents that will inevitably occur in futurenothing positive is done.Peter J Garrett, Ardrishaig.Sir,We are now into gloomier weather conditions and on occasions a low sun casts long shadows on our roads.I have advice for cyclists who venture on to the highways wearing black hats, black jackets, black trousers, black shoes, carrying black bags and riding their black bikes.Wear clothes that enhance your visibility, please.Earlier this year, in such conditions, I passed such a cyclist on my way into Oban. He was just starting on the incline out of Kilmore so the black tarmac was his background.It was his moving right foot on the pedal I noticed.

The games were well contested, and the Argyll boys could have won both games. Two lapses of concentration against Lomond let them in for easy tries and only two points separated the teams in the Shawlands game at the end, when SAS had been in the lead for large parts of the match.The whole team thought it was important to finish the group with a good home win.The boys set out their stall early at MacRae Park when a contested ruck ended with a good turnover from SAS number seven McLean and a great pass out to winger Gritten from number eight McColl-Smith, who then released MacKay. The full back ran  yards to score under the posts and then convert his own try.SAS were next on the score sheet when Captain Donald Self went over the whitewash. MacKay converted and SAS were  –  up.Some good play from both teams was making for a great game, enjoyed by a large home crowd. Pupils were given the chance to watch the game and they made their voices heard and, spurred on by the crowd, Euan MacArthur was next on the score sheet and once again MacKay converted the try.The first half finished - to the home team.The second half started with Boclair coming back at SAS and, after some good running, they pulled a try back.SAS found themselves under sustained pressure and soon Boclair had a second try. Only one try was converted, and the score was -. Another try, this one converted, for Boclair and the pressure was really on.South Argyll thought they had secured the game when Ellis went over and grounded the ball only to realise he had gone over the dead ball line. No try and the pressure was on again. Minutes later, after some great forward work to turn the ball over, McArthur again went over for South Argyll#s fourth try. Another two points from MacKay made the score -.After the restart Boclair went all out to get another score. Great defensive work from the SA backs kept Boclair out for a sustained period of attack until, with only seconds to go, the scored their fourth try.As the conversion attempt fell short the final whistle blew and South Argyll celebrated a hard-fought win.While South Argyll didn not get out of the group stages they can be very pleased with third place,only one point behind second spot."},{"url":null,"title":"a garden of festive delight","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowNot your common or garden evening of entertainment, a special festive concert will be held next week near Minard.Friends of Crarae will present their annual carol concert at Crarae Garden on Thursday December .The evening will feature Cumlodden choir and guests and the audience is welcome to sing along.Festive refreshments and a raffle will be available at the concert, which opens at .pm for a .pm start.Tickets will cost £ on the door, and the National Trust for Scotland shop will be open for those last-minute gts."},{"url":null,"title":"an ardrishaig piano recital to remember","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSaturday November  was a cold and frosty day and, whilst the audience had the luxury of warm hats and coats to fend off the chill of a  degrees centigrade hall, this was not afforded to soloist of the day, the -year-old Ukrainian Russian pianist Vitaly Pisarenko.When many would, however, have struggled with the cold, from his first entry he appeared unphased by it and indeed gave us a memorable exhibition of astonishing virtuosity and musicianship.Each half of his well-balanced programme started with early Beethoven sonatas, beginning with his first, Op. No. . Dedicated to his hero, Haydn, this was delivered with the reverence it deserved and the clarity and drive of the final Prestissimo would have pleased the dedicatee no end.The first half ended with two Chopin Polonaises # Op.  Nos.  and  # and his third Ballade. The second Polonaise was particularly impressive with its menacing opening figure and Vitaly#s judicious use of the sustaining pedal lent great clarity to all three pieces and indeed to all his recital.After the intermission came Beethoven#s Sonata Op.  No. . By this time Beethoven had developed his own inidual persona and the three contrasting movements of this work were beautully executed, particularly the Adagio with its slow melody and stuttering accompaniment and the contrasting fluidity of the final Allegretto.Next we heard Bela Bartok#s Suite Op. . This was typical Bartok from beginning to end, spikey, angular and generally very speedy and played with incredible precision. When I said to Vitaly that it sounded fiendishly dficult he retorted: # It#s actually quite easy I learned it in three days.#While not normal fare for our audience this, hopefully, was an interestingFirebird is probably Stravinsky#s best known work apart from, maybe, his #Rite of Spring#, and both were originally written as ballet scores. However, due to their popularity, over time these and other works of his have been transcribed by ious people for all sorts of instrumental combinations, and the Agosti transcription of Firebird for piano solo that Vitaly played as his finale is probably the most well known. It makes huge demands on the soloist as Agosti endeavoured to encapsulate Stravinsky#s rich orchestration into a work for only two hands it only works in the correct hands and Vitaly#s were just such hands.This was an electrying rendition and not just for the sheer virtuosity as there were gorgeous quiet sections as well. The thunderous applause at the end said it all.Virtuosity is a given nowadays and over the years we have heard some fine pianists at Ardrishaig, but it was Vitaly#s musical integrity and attention to detail which was a cut above and truly inspirational. This was indeed a recital to remember.The concert, in Ardrishaig Public Hall, was staged by Mid Argyll Arts Association in association with Argyll and Bute Concert tours."},{"url":null,"title":"stormy argyll weather to subside for polling day","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more #

I didn#t think the majority would be what it was, and I think this is a victory for the organisation of the SNP in Argyll and Bute.#I am very, very happy and very, very tired in equal measure.#Gary Mulvaney, who received  more votes than in the  election, commented: #I#m pleased our vote has increased, but I#ve felt like we have been swimming against the tide sometimes. I am delighted, however, that we now have a majority Conservative government. We need a strong Westminster government to get Brexit done and move forward.#LibDem candidate Alan Reid was the constituency MP for  years from  before being succeeded in  by Brendan O#Hara. Mr Reid said: #I am obviously disappointed not to have won but I would congratulate Brendan on a convincing victory.#A newbie to the political scene, Scottish Labour candidate Rhea Barnes remarked: #It#s been a well-fought campaign conducted in a well mannered way and I thank the other candidates for that, and I congratulate Brendan on his election as MP.#Alongside postal votes and proxies, votes made their way across Argyll and Bute in ballot boxes transported by car, boat, and helicopter to the Lochgilphead Joint Campus count centre.Returning officer Cleland Sneddon said: #We have a dedicated team of knowledgeable election staff which meant that everything went extremely smoothly, despite the unique challenges involved in administering a count on this scale.#I would like to thank everyone involved for ensuring that Argyll and Bute’s UK general election count went so well.#"},{"url":null,"title":"online-self-help-guide-asksara-launches-borders","story":"A FREE, online self-help guide has been launched by the Health and Social Care Partnership to help people find products and solutions which enable people to stay at home for longer.AskSARA is an online resource to help people live le to the highest standard by improving their quality of le by making skills such as cooking, bathing and taking medication, easier.This can be provided through mobility equipment or products which encourage independence.AskSARA is a  hour service and is open to family members, carers and friends, as well as service users.In partnership with the Disabled Living Foundation to provide the Borders AskSARA programme, the first of its kind in Scotland.To use the service, people have to choose between three options - health, home or daily activities - and answer some questions to receive a report from an occupational therapist who will offer recommendations for advice and support.If any concerns are raised in the report, AskSARA will suggest an occupational therapy session through a What Matters Hub.Developers say that AskSARA has the capability to improve capacity in the community for those who access health and social care services to better manage their conditions and support those who care for them.AskSARA also have the opportunity to improve the overall health of the population and reduce the number of hospital admissions.Councillor Tom Weatherston, Executive Member for Adult Social Care, said: ldquoPeople are increasingly willing and able to exert more choice and control over the things that will make a dference to their lives but with so much information available online, it can be dficult to know what can be trusted.\"AskSARA is an award-winning, tested resource that provides expert advice and information on products and equipment that can help you, or someone you care about, with your health, your home or your daily activities.ldquoWith access to over , daily living products from more almost , trusted suppliers, it has the potential to be of signicant help to people and I would encourage anyone who thinks they may benefit to go through the self-assessment process and take advantage of the personalised guidance that AskSARA provides.ldquoWe also hope that carers will find AskSARA useful by helping to identy suitable equipment for the people they care for.

tricks of the trade.Its December now and, as most of the country are battening down the hatches, we keen photographers are getting their thermies ready for sorties outside to shoot winter scenes.The first pieces of kit before you even think about cameras are proper winter outdoor clothing. Plenty of layers, with a good waterproof top layer. Good thermal socks too as you may find yourself standing around for ages on the spot waiting for suitable light to shoot a scene.If you are comfortable then yoursquoll be thinking about photography and not about getting home to a warm fire. Thatrsquos protection for you, but you have to think about your equipment too.Top-end cameras have good weather sealing these days but it may not be  per cent effective, so get a rain cover for your camera bag and a cover for your camera. You can easily make a camera cover from plastic bags and rubber bands, and yoursquore recycling into the bargain.Another thing to think about is batteries, take at least one spare with you and keep it your pocket, not the camera bag. When itrsquos really cold the batteries donrsquot last very long at all so keeping them a bit warmer than ambient maintains their charge until you need it.Snow scenes make great subjects to photograph, and extremely popular. They are one of my favourite genres, running a close second to pictures of the night sky.There is a big problem with snow scenes however and that is SNOW. In a lot of hurriedly taken snow scenes, the snow will appear blue or grey. Thats not the cameras fault, its exposure meter doing what it was designed to do and try and get a compromise exposure to fit the whole frame. However, the camera tries to base everything on what we call an  per cent grey and averages the exposure to suit. Snow is very reflective, particularly in sunlight, and fools the camera meter into under-exposing the scene hence everything will appear dull and not like the lovely glistening snow you were looking at.This is where the photographer has to intervene. We deliberately over-expose what the camera meter is telling us by at least one stop, probably two. It ies a little between cameras and personal preference. I like to over-expose by one and a half stops. Stop! Whatrsquos a stop  A stop is the doubling or halving of the amount of light reaching your sensor . For example,the camera meter says expose for  th of a second, one stop over-exposed would be  th of a second and two stops over would be  th of a second. Using this method you compensate for the light meter wanting to under-expose.On your camera, you can achieve this by either using full manual control of your exposure or using an exposure compensation setting, which many cameras have. Et voila, nice white snow every time. Be careful you donrsquot drop the shutter speed too low though, or you wont get sharp shots handheld, even with image stabilisation . I try to avoid going below  th handheld, faster than that sometimes, depending on how much coffee Ive had.Irsquom not going to be popular for saying this but I hope we get Beast from the East . I had a couple of the best days out with a camera Irsquove had in years during and after that storm.Herersquos a couple of shots I took before sunrise two days before The Beast struck proper. The sunrise one is two exposures blended, one for the sky and one for the snow. If Irsquod just exposed to get the snow right Irsquod have blown out the sky. If Irsquod exposed for the sky the snow would have been dark grey. Sometimes you have to resort to a few tricks.Photo of the month this time is Festival Salute by our syllabus secretary Alistair Peacock. It is a multi-award-winning image this one, and one my favourites. Taken in Edinburgh around Tattoo time, Alistair asked this US soldierhe could take a photo of him. He obliged by standing to attention and snapping a salute, what a bonus. Perfectly exposed and works well in monochrome, great shot Alistair.

particularly bathers going through the motions and winning the No-Belle Prize - the capers and costumes were crazy, and the fun-filled score was sensational.But the true highlights of this adorable show were the tearjerkers and the heart-breaking performances of Aimee Richardson, as Belle, and Sam Johnston, as Prince Danton.The Right Angle Theatre Company has uncovered a couple of crackers with these two.Their dueted version of Calum Scotts Youre the Reason was breathtaking.Johnston had already made an impact with his remarkably good take on Im On My Way, and Richardson had shone throughout the early scenes, but once together it was veneration rather than laughter that resounded around the Volunteer Hall.Steve Hartley-Oliver didnt help either with his accomplished performance as the tormented Beast.And, while slightly more limited in his vocal range than the two leads, his performance of Lewis Capaldis Someone You Loved had most reaching for the tissues.But Beauty and the Beast is much, much more than a weep-fest.Tracy Borthwick and Emma Wilson were a hoot as Belles sisters, Whitney and Britney.From their fainting fits at the sight of Gustave to their obsession with treatments, laughs were never far away.And the dynamic duo of Stuart Mitchell and Amanda Blacklock as the Brawest beauticians in Galae, Marcell and Monique, had the hall in uproar for much of the night.Clad in Olivia Newtown-John-esque Lets Get Physical clobber from the s, Blacklock and Mitchell stole many a scene.And their accents -

This is his third win in the event following victories in , when he defeated current club captain Willie Ross in a final that was extended to  holes after the first game finished all square, and likewise, in , when he defeated Iain McGougan, also at the th hole. This year his victim was Ian Docherty, after halving the first match over  holes an extra round was required to separate the players and again it was Stephen who prevailed by the score of four and three.Ian Docherty’s brother John had a terric season picking up a number of prizes including the George Durnan two-rounder. Alan McLean picked up two lovely pieces of silverware to try and keep up with son Murdo in the prize money stakes and there were multiple prizes for Brian Cook, Kevin Allibone, Kevin Gilchrist, Stevie Gorman and Michael Morrison who took the John McLean two-round scratch trophy despite missing the majority of the season after an accident.The biggest cheer of the night was reserved for Iain MacKinnon for his fine victory in the Glencalladh bowl.An excellent evening came to an end with captain’s we, Kirsteen Ross receiving a bouquet from Finlay Wylie for all of her work in presenting the prizes."},{"url":null,"title":"dunaverty lotto rolls over","story":"The next draw, for a jackpot of £, will be held on Sunday November .Tickets are available from the club steward, committee members, at Muneroy Tearoom and also at the Burnside bar."},{"url":null,"title":"leader november 1 2019","story":"It is devastating news for the Kintyre economy that one of the area#s biggest employers looks set to lose up to  per cent of its workforce.It must be devastating news for all CS Wind UK#s staff, with the uncertainty surrounding jobs made all the worse in the lead up to Christmas.The company#s next potential order is due for production in , so there is a future for the factory and we are sure the company is doing all it can to secure that future.Our fingers are crossed that the talks with Argyll and Bute Council, the Scottish and Westminster governments and other organisations are successful in finding a solution to the shortfall in orders.By chance, the news of redundancies at CS Wind came the same week as Amazon revealed its power purchase agreement with a Kintyre wind farm.Attempts by the Courier to confirm the location of the wind farm were unsuccessful but,it comes to fruition, it is to be hoped it will bring jobs to the area."},{"url":null,"title":"come and join the fun at campbeltown picture house","story":"pm # The Aeronauts.

Last month rector William Crossan said staffing levels were being reviewed and two teaching posts could be lost at the school.On Monday Lieutenant Commander Mark Farley of the US Navy told the Kintyre Working Group that there was only a #remote possibility# that a pull-out would be cancelled. He added: #But you can be sure of our desire to stay.#An outstanding relationship has been built up with the local people, and it is a perfect location, with great training facilities.#It is understood that no alternative location for the unit has been identied yet.And RAF spokesman said there had been talks with the US military about the withdrawal.#The future of the base is under continuing review and the departure of the US Navy is not the only factor which has to be taken into account.#In June RAF Machrihanish was reduced to #care and maintenance# status.FIFTY YEARS AGOShellfish plant operationalCampbeltown at last has a stake in the new, growing shellfish processing industry.Two local men, Mr George McMillan and Mr Duncan L.

This output is expected to increase next week, when they will employ an additional three workers.At present  bags of the #queenie# scallops are being processed daily. By the beginning of December it is hoped that  bags will be handled.Mr George McMillan said that it is hoped eventually to employ from  to  people. He stressed that meantime Davaar Seafoods was occupying only part of the slaughterhouse building on a temporary basis. He mentioned that the firm was #hoping to get the whole building#.Samples of Davaar Seafoods produce were sent to consumers in Chicago and Paris and opinions passed on the quality of the samples were favourable.The scallop processing method employed is a simple one. The shellfish are dipped into hot water, and the shells open. The insides of the creatures are removed and scraped clean. Then the meat is thoroughly washed.Shellfish factories are operating successfully in Tarbert and Port Ellen.Harmony Hour guests of R.A.F. on thThe th of November,  will long be remembered by the members of Campbeltown Harmony Hour Club who were guests at an excellent fireworks display at R.A.F.

Burnley Campbell, and others also extended a cordial welcome, the men being cheered as they marched with the colours to headquarters.The cadre was entertained at a civic luncheon in McColl#s Hotel in the afternoon.Those present said they were delighted to welcome home the local battalion. Throughout the war they had watched with pride the heroic work performed by the battalion, and they would remember with gratitude the sacrices that had been made.Maclachlan of Maclachlan mentioned that the total casualties of the  th Argylls during the war were  officers and  other ranks.The honours of the regiment received were one V.C., two D.S.O.#s, many M.C.#s and M.M.#s, and other lesser honours.Major Lockie, who commanded the cadre, acknowledged the cordial welcome they had received.A day of remembranceThe King#s desire that the first anniversary of the Armistice should be observed by a two minutes silence in reverent remembrance of the glorious dead was fulfilled all over the country on Tuesday.In London wreaths were laid on the Cenotaph in Whitehall. These included one from the King and Queen, one from President Poincaré and one from the Prime Minister.The scenes in the streets of Glasgow were full of solemnity, when all traffic stopped and the crowds stood in reverent silence as the clocks stuck eleven. Work ceased in the Clyde shipyards and on the shipping in the river.In Campbeltown the signal was given by the sounding of three long syren blasts from H.M.S. Thames, and the fallen were honoured by the uncovering of heads.Of course in a comparatively quiet country town the tribute lacked the impressiveness that characterised it in busy cities.In the Grammar School the scholars assembled in the large room at .a.m., when the rector gave a short address on the meaning of the celebration, read the King#s message, and explained shortly the aims of the League of Nations Union.A hymn as then sung, the two minutes# silence observed, and after the National Anthem had been sung, the pupils were dismissed for the day.In Dalintober School the period of silence was similarly observed and the scholars were afterwards dismissed."},{"url":null,"title":"leader november 15 2019","story":"Remembrance is one of the main topics in this week#s Courier.We increasingly rely on our youngsters to keep the memory of the First and Second World Wars alive as those who experienced them first-hand # and second-hand # fade away.Renowned First World War poet Wilfred Owen, who was himself killed in action in , wrote of #the old lie# # #Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori#, which translates from Latin as #It is sweet and proper to die for one#s country#.Remembrance should not be about glorying war, but remembering the horric atrocities which are committed in its name so that in future they may be avoided.The four young people who took part in the service at Glenbarr War Memorial are direct descendants of men from the area who fell in battle.

I think the going rate was £ per day, quite a sum in , and I believe there was quite a queue, unfortunately I couldn#t sign up as I was working at Jaeger.It was quite an event and some friends who were taking part told me later about their experiences with fake blood and bandages etc and others getting kitted out with Russian army unorms and weapons. Several of the buildings around the airfield were flying the Hammer and Sickle and painted up with Russian signage etc to suit the situation.If I remember correctly the premiere of the finished film was shown in Campbeltown and those watching who had ever flown into the town on normal domestic flights could easily recognise the approach to the airport and runway with the loch beyond. With a few patches of articial snow here and there it could well have been in Siberia. There were great hoots and laughter at the showing whenever those in the audience recognised their pals in unorm with rles at the ready or being carried in on stretchers. Great memories.I also remember the scrapped jet engines from the wrecked airliner lying in McFadyen#s yard in Glebe street for a long time.

Social care, mental health and primary care services are all crying out for more support, and better resourcing them would take the pressure off the accident and emergency service.The SNP government have failed to meet the AE target time every month for over two years. They need to take swt action to properly prepare AE departments before winter sets in. A good place to start would be publishing the integrated workforce plan that staff were told would be out last year. Another broken SNP promise.Yours,Alan Reid, Liberal Democrat candidate for Argyll  Bute.Connected nationSir,Before I address Alan Reid’s comments on superfast broadband , it ought to be remembered that this is the same ex Liberal Democrat MP who propped up the Tories and imposed years of toxic austerity measures on Scotland, shrinking the UK economy by £ billion, imposing Dickensian social policies # like the Bedroom Tax # on the poorest in society, and voluntarily choosing to make Tory cuts possible.The Liberal Democrats are deeply stained by austerity and they will remain, rightly, untrusted as the Tories little helpers.Mr Reid berates the SNP government for alleged failure to deliver superfast broadband. Yet, inspite of the unique dficulties in delivering superfast broadband in rural Scotland, which BT described as the ‘most signicant geographic challenge in the UK, and arguably Europe’, the latest Ofcom ‘Connected Nations’  report shows that Scotland outperforms the UK as a whole when it comes to new broadband deployment.There remains work to be done and the Scottish government is committed to delivering the best possible value and completing the roll out by  .Mr Reid is right to say that contracts have not been finalised yet, but with telecommunications and broadband reserved to Westminster, the changes in contracts imposed by UK ministers mean that bidders require additional time to recalibrate their bids.It is up to Mr Reid to carp from the sidelines, but readers can be confident that this SNP Scottish government will deliver a future proof network that will make Scotland one of the best connected places in Europe.Yours,Ron Wilson,Secretary Kintyre SNP.Coffee thanksSir,This year our World’s Biggest Coffee Morning fundraiser entered its th year.In community centres, schools and workplaces, thousands of coffee mornings were held across Scotland to raise money and help us support people affected by cancer.I would like to offer a huge and heartfelt thanks to every single one of your readers who held or attended a coffee morning – your energy and generosity never ceases to amaze us.Whether it’s specialist cancer nurses, support workers or benefit advisors, we can only offer the support that people with cancer need thanks to the tireless fundraising efforts of our supporters.The number of people who need our help is growing, and we want to offer support to everyone who needs it.

But she asked why the young woman was so determined to climb the stairs, even though she was clearly very ill and finding it dficult.This led to me mentioning who Anne Frank was and that people visit the attic because itrsquos the place where she hid.ldquoWhy was she hiding  was the inevitable question, just as bedtime arrived.I was suddenly presented with a dilemma, not so much that bedtime was now delayed, but how to explain to a six-year-old the depth of evil and hatred that was the reason for Anne Frank having to hide in an attic with her family. And then whether to explain what happened to her after she was discovered.I knew that I couldnrsquot just ignore her question. So we searched for images of Anne Frank, which meant she became a real person for my daughter.Skye studied her and said she looked nice and kind, and asked again why she was hiding.I explained that people who didnrsquot even know her hated her just because she was a bit dferent to them. I couldnrsquot explain the horrors of genocide and concentration camps, but she understood that Anne Frank and her family must have been really scared to hide in an attic.ldquoWhat happened to her  asked Skye as she dressed for bed.This was not a bedtime story I wanted to tell. Indeed, for a child so young, it was not a story I wanted to tell at all. She knows there are bad people and staying safe is important, but we feel the need to protect our children from the evil and hatred that is sadly so deep-seated.But it is at this young age that the seeds of intolerance and hatred can be plantedthey are not encouraged and helped to feel empathy to others, including those who are dferent in fact, especially those who are dferent.So I told her a lsquochild-friendlyrsquo version of Anne Frankrsquos story,there can be such a thing. I gave no details of the horror of the Holocaust but we imagined how she must have missed her family when they were split up, and how sad it was that she died not long before the war ended.She wanted to look at Anne Frankrsquos photo again and say goodnight to her.ldquoThank goodness that could never happen to us here, could it dad ldquoNo, that is not going to happen, and we have to make sure it doesnrsquot happen to anyone  either, I reassured her.I felt quite emotional as I went downstairs with my kids sleeping safely in their cosy beds. I thought of the families in Syria who cannot keep their children safe from hatred and violence. I knew that such horrors could happen anywhere, at any time yes, even here yes, maybe even to us or our neighbours or friends. In fact, hatred of dference is indeed amongst us.A friend of mine was on a bus heading from East Lothian into Edinburgh last week and witnessed a horrible racist verbal assault on a Polish family. The horric murders in London are also part of the same hatred of dference ndash a man so full of hatred for people who think dferently that he randomly killed two amazing young people.Hatred is a virus that can infect any society and any inidual in it. History has taught us that fanning its flames can be an easy way for politicians to win power. But like real fire, once itrsquos released it can spread and destroy uncontrollably.People say fight fire with fire, but here the comparison ends, for we cannot fight hatred with hatred. Hatred only spawns more of it.And so I searched for words of that remarkable young woman Anne Frank, who left her diary behind, unknowing that it would be her gt to the world. Words I could share with my daughter, from one young thinking child to another. Despite writing at a time of unimaginable fear and horror, in her diary she has left us a timeless message of hope that comes from her rejection of hate:ldquoItrsquos dficult in times like these ideals, dreams and cherished hopes rise within us, only to be crushed by grim reality. Itrsquos a wonder I havenrsquot abandoned all my ideals, they seem so absurd and impractical. Yet I cling to them because I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are truly good at heart.It is our responsibility to live up to that inspiring message from a young woman who was a victim of the hate she rejected utterly to show our children, our family and friends, our colleagues and those we meet on a bus, that love, tolerance, empathy and respect of dference is the counter to hate.And we should expect no less from all our politicians."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-replace-old-boxing-gym-housing","story":"REM Associates have lodged planning applications seeking to replace the th century former Tranent Methodist Church building on Bridge Street with four two-bedroom flats.They submitted the applications on behalf of businessman and premises owner Alex Brown, who founded Bronx Boxing Gym, which was based at the old church, a decade ago.In recent years, Mr Brown had no involvement in the running of the boxing club but still let its boxers use the building.However, costly repairs were needed to make the former church safe, which led to the boxing club vacating the premises.Earlier this year, the club moved to the newly established Fit-in Fitness Gym on High Street, Musselburgh.A planning application has been submitted for the former church building and the east wall which faces the car park on Coal Neuk to be demolished.Drawings included within a second planning application show designs for erecting four two-bedroom flats with a basement car park with space for four cars."},{"url":null,"title":"familys-spectacular-christmas-lights-display","story":"The Woods family open their very own Santarsquos grotto and decorate their home each year to raise money for Mission Christmas and Cash for Kids.This year, there are more than , lights at their family home and in their garden.Dad Stevie Woods said the family ldquojust love Christmas and hope the stream of visitors theyrsquore expecting will leave donations for charity, either cash or a toy.They raised pound on their opening night.The lights were switched on for visitors on Sunday at pm and will be on from .pm to pm daily until Christmas.The grotto is open for visitors, who can enjoy the Disney characters painted on the inside and the Christmas films playing.There is also a Santa Sleigh where children can get their photograph taken, and this year there will be the addition of a Santa train, which Stevie made himself out of whisky barrels.He said: ldquoLast year we raised about pound so wersquore hoping to beat that.

And so it might yet prove with another of Fukuyamas pronouncements. It is his contention that the developed world has recently become more peaceable thanks to women as heads of state and in positions of political influence.Ive often heard people say there would be less conflict and fewer warswomen were in charge. Usually its the middle-aged and elderly ndash mothers, aunts and grandmothers ndash who make this claim. They have never scaled the heights of a male-dominated industry or profession, yet hope that the women they see in charge are imbued with the same gentle, conciliatory and nurturing personalities as themselves. And there, I would suggest, is the snag.Nor am I being unduly cynical. A study by the University of Chicago covering  years of European historyhas shown that not only were queens more inclined to take their country into battle than kings, but also more certain to win.:Nicola Sturgeon announces funding for women leaders schemeIn Victorias day, Britain was at war with some part of the empire, or would-be empire, almost every year of her reign. Three hundred years earlier, Elizabeth I set a gold standard for empire building, showing her mettle as she fought off Spanish incursions, despatching her own conquistadors across the globe, and managing to maintain stability in a precariously inflammable period of religious stre asshe were refereeing a game of croquet.The leader of the Chicago study, Professor Oeindrila Dube, points out that you need only think of Catherine the Great of Russia, or Isabella I of Castile to appreciate that, in previous centuries, royal women were every bit as war-like as men. When circumstances dictated, they didnrsquot hesitate to shed blood.Quite how they felt privately, of course, is another matter. Henry VIIIs daughter, who earned the title Bloody Mary after condemning almost  Protestants and religious dissenters to the pyre, was apparently a warm and affectionate person. What her notorious actions indicate, perhaps, is less a vengeful nature and more the vicious tenor of her times.Even our own Mary Queen of Scots was no peacenik, riding at the head of her troops on more than one occasion and, far from avoiding conflict, at times seeming actively to court it.Professor Dubersquos analysis of royal authority shows that when a queen was in power, she was even more effective than a man. Since she would often work in partnership with her consort, her subjects were effectively getting two warriors for the price of one. There is, however, a great dference between what was required of female rulers in the reign of Victoria and before, and attitudes in modern times.In almost every era prior to our own Elizabethan age, to be a woman was seen to be weak. Debate raged across Europe in the th century about how worthy and capable females could ever beplaced on a throne. John Knox, enraged at Mary of Guise becoming Regent of Scotland, spoke for many when he declared her appointment ldquoas seemly a sight as to put a saddle upon the back of an unruly cow.Given such hostility, itrsquos entirely possible that it was not the assistance of their husbands that made Boudiccas of high-ranking women, but the need to show that they were every bit as aggressive and dangerous as men. The message needed to be sent that anyone who tried to topple them would live ndash albeit briefly ndash to regret it.Margaret Thatcher thrust us into battle in the Falklands where many other prime ministers might have hesitated. You could see her pugnacity, on this and other inflammatory issues, as the problem with Fukuyamas theory. Women who reach the political pinnacle today have had to fight to get there. These are no ordinary women, these are powerful women. Hilary Clintonrsquos personality surely proves that point: her pitch for the presidency showed her to be a great deal more hawk than dove.:Project aims to help women stand for electionYet Fukuyama ndash and others ndash might nevertheless be right in hoping for a less violent futuremore women are at the top table. Nobody has done more to show Germany in a pacic and positively humanitarian light than Angela Merkel, even though she knew her policies risked her political standing in some quarters.To date, the performance of those like Mary Robinson, when she was Irish president, or Helle Thorning-Schmidt when Denmarkrsquos prime minister, or New Zealandrsquos Jacinda Ardern, not to mention Scotlands first minister, offers reason to hope. The ability to compromise, to use diplomatic means to defuse conflict, or find a way around an impasse is, while by no means solely a female quality, certainly one at which we are beginning to excel.Sweeping generalisation though it is, women are undoubtedly less physically combative and martial than men, though potentially nasty nevertheless. It can be seen as early as the school playground that our preferred weaponry is verbal attack and the ability to work stealthily, in ways of which Machiavelli would approve, to undermine the enemy.Irsquove never believed we are nicer than men ndash my experience has been quite the opposite. Yet in the West at least, attitudes in government and society are changing. Itrsquos now possible to be feminine and command respect. Gender no longer signals deficiency. Increasingly, even, it could be seen as a positive advantage.Growing numbers of women are rising through the democratic ranks on the strength of their strategic and negotiating skills, rather than their gung-ho, macho credentials. As a new generation is attracted to these roles, seeing that they no longer need to act tough in order to succeed, then things might just improve. Perhaps it is a reasonable assumption after all that, with more female hands at the tiller, nations will become stronger and safer."},{"url":null,"title":"bomb-squad-called-motherwell-polling-station-suspicious-device-found","story":"Police confirmed that residents of Motherwells Glen Tower flats will now be able toto their homes after a controlled explosion was carried out on the device.Officers were called to the flats on RangeRoad at around  am this morning after the suspicious package was discovered on the ground floor.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Bomb squad called to Motherwell polling station\",\"description\": \"Bomb squad called to Motherwell polling station\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media DXdcRJh poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests DXdcRJh.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": :Voters head to the polls for third General Election in five yearsWhile North LanarkshireCouncilmoved the polling station to nearby Knowetop Primary School in Knowetop Avenue.Chief Inspector Mark Leonard said: ldquoOfficers responded to reports of a suspicious device on the ground floor of Glen Tower flats, Motherwell around  am on Thursday, December.ldquoA cordon was placed around the building and residents within the cordon were evacuated for safety reasons.

We will not let you down.ldquoThe  referendum was a once in a generation event.

It means less energy and less space is needed to treat a higher quantity of waste water, reducing the operating costs of the site. It also removes the need to chemically treat the effluent, increasing the protection of the rivers Don and Urie, and provides the capacity to support the local community as it continues to grow and flourish. The project was delivered by Scottish Water alliance partner ESD and included building new sewer pipework, improving the resilience of the site to flooding and upgrading existing equipment. Ms Gougeon said: “While treating waste water isn’t something people probably like to think about too often, it is something that is absolutely vital to protect not only our health and sanitation, but also the environment. “Developing new, more efficient ways of treating waste water through the deployment of new technology, is hugely important as Scotland takes decisive steps towards tackling the climate emergency we are facing around the world.” Chief Executive of Scottish Water Douglas Millican said: “We are always looking for ways to innovate and protect the environment both locally and globally, so it is very exciting to see this new state-of-the-art treatment works officially opened here in Inverurie – the first of its kind in Scotland. “Not only does it mean we can continue to treat waste water effectively and protect the environment for years to come, it also underlines our commitment to pursue new ways to lower our energy requirements, towards reaching our ambitious goal of achieving net zero emissions by .” Most construction work on site was completed in the Spring and the new treatment process has since been closely monitored during commissioning and beyond.While most of the work took place within the established Scottish Water site, installation of new pipework beneath the railway line involved a closure to Keithhall Road which was completed ahead of schedule in April .data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"A group of Logie Durno Primary School pupils taking part in the Wee Sleep Out\"  Wee Sleep Out at Logie Durno School viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"ESD Chief Operating Officer Wendy Cooper said: “We are very proud of what has been achieved at Inverurie, successfully delivering a cutting edge new wastewater treatment technology in Scotland for the first time. “Success in this project has involved close collaboration between Scottish Water, ESD, Royal HaskoningDHV and our wider supply chain.

Those talks are critical to the future of our industry.“It is these negotiations that will be the real bread and butter of Brexit for NFU Scotland members. That is where the terms of the trade deal between the UK and the EU will be agreed.“For NFUS, ensuring as free and as frictionless trade in agri-food goods with the EU, which remains our principal market outside of the UK, has been our priority from the start of this process.“Whether negotiating with the EU, or establishing new trade deals with other countries worldwide, a red line for us is that Scotland’s high standards must be recognised and protected.“Our members can be reassured that their union has begun engagement with this new parliament today and we will make tracks to Westminster at the earliest opportunity as we enter a new era for Scottish farming and crofting.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

These may have been used to tie mooring ropes onto, to help hold the roof on.The archaeologists working on site uncovered the carved stones scattered around a hearth within the remains of an enigmatic structure that contained three cists, two hearths and a partial ring of holes packed with broken off upstanding stones. Three of the roughly carved figures were also important enough to the people who used the building to be incorporated within the structure of one of the hearths and in the foundations of one of the standing stones. The purpose of the building and how it was used by the inhabitants of this site four thousand years ago is still an enigma.Dating the necked stones firmly will require further work, since they have also been found on Iron Age sites in Orkney. On initial evidence, the ones from Finstown possibly date to around the Late Neolithic or Early Bronze Age, roughly BC.Identying the purpose of these stones, andthey are figurines, will also require further work, with a close study for abrasion, wear and any other marks on these anthropomorphic objects.Futher details in The Orcadian on Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The uncertainty over Britainrsquos future was a concern among businesses and some have shted operations out of the UK. There are still questions over the future relationship after Brexit and whether tarf-free trade between the UK and the EU will continue after a standstill transition period expires at the end of .ldquoI deeply regret that the United Kingdom, our friends, are leaving the European Union, Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar told reporters in Brussels.But he conceded: ldquoItrsquos always easier for us to be able to negotiate with a partner who has a strong personal mandate and can control a majority in their parliament. -- --Luxembourg prime minister Xavier Bettel said: ldquoI still regret the outcome of the referendum but I respect it. Irsquom happy that it will be finally now over with this situation where we are able to agree here but in London they are not able to agree. So, finished, this situation, and thatrsquos good for all of us.Joachim Lang, chief executive of the Federation of German Industries, said no German company wants Brexit but ldquoour companies are breathing a sigh of relief that there is finally a mandate to accept the withdrawal agreement.When Britain voted to leave the EU in June , there were concerns that it could lead to other departures, but those fears have dissipated as the process has been so politically isive and expensive.Although the pathway to Britainrsquos departure by January  is reasonably clear, the future relationship between the country and the EU is not. Discussions can only begin after Britain formally leaves. The EU has already said that its main Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier will lead those discussions.After congratulating Mr Johnson on his victory, new EU Council president Charles Michel said: ldquoWe expect as soon as possible the vote by the British Parliament on the withdrawal agreement. -- --ldquoWe are ready, he told reporters as he arrived to chair the meeting of Britainrsquos  EU partner countries. ldquoThe European Union will negotiate in order to have close co-operation in the future with the UK.Ultimately, the Brexit orce negotiations may prove to be the easy part. If Britain does leave at the end of next month, it will have less than a year to negotiate a new trade agreement with its partners and get it endorsed in all their parliaments. Most trade pacts take several years to agree.But the EU member countries will first have to agree on a new negotiating mandate for Mr Barnier.ldquoWe are all set, said new European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, whose powerful executive arm negotiates trade deals on behalf of EU member countries. The commission also supervised the Brexit talks.ldquoWe have the structures internally. We are ready to negotiate whatever is necessary, she said.Asked whether it is possible to seal a trade deal in under a year, Mr Michel said: ldquoIt is not my intention to predict based on the experience of the past.copy -.

As an obstetrician, I have written often about the priority we should put on the health of our pregnant women and families as they truly hold the future health of the nation in their hands.We are less good at talking about the end of le, dying and the bereavement that follows. Circumstances surrounding a loved one’s death can be remembered by those left behind for the rest of their lives. The impact on families of a ‘bad death’ can be devastating and, of course, there is also an effect on healthcare professionals who deal with death and dying frequently.I remember a weekend working on the maternity unit when I was pregnant with my first child. I met a young woman who was at the same stage as me, but her baby had stopped moving. Initial scans had failed to find a heartbeat. Often this is when I can use my experience to find that elusive heartbeat, but not that day. I had to tell that young couple that their baby, their child, had died – feeling so guilty that mine was still alive. At the end of my sht, I felt exhausted, bereft and deeply sad.: Le expectancy going backwards in ‘many parts’ of Scotland, report finds: Grieving Scottish couple’s stillbirth charity to benefit from Christmas concertIt is often said that time heals but I am not sure about that. I think the passage of time can make it easier to deal with grief, but the pain may never leave us.Conversations are starting around ‘living’ grief and bereavement. As the numbers of people living with dementia increases, the experience of their carers is becoming a focus. They are living with and caring for someone, often a lelong partner, who may no longer care for them or even recognise them.Not a time of joy for allCarers may be isolated, restricted by the frailty and confused behaviour of the person they look after. Comments come from others like “at least they’re still with you”, yet they are grieving for the person they have already lost. For example, “I’m not a widow yet, but I don’t feel married either”, as one lady told me. Carers feel guilty and internalise their own emotions. Together in Dementia Everydayoffers a support network for the carers of those with dementia, allowing those dficult thoughts and feelings to be surfaced.I recently attended an NHS Education for Scotland conference that used the power of patient stories to explore the impact of bereavement on people. The main realisation was that we need to give our staff the permission, time, space, and support to discuss these cases as teams, exploring feelings and emotions, not just clinical facts. It often feels safer to focus on the latter, but the former may prove far more therapeutic. This, of course, can apply to the conversations we also have with patients and families and you can have with your own families at home.Why indeed am I writing an article about death and bereavement, when you perhaps want to read something uplting at this time of year The reality is that Christmas is not a time of joy for everyone – loss can be felt keenly, absence of a family member all the more obvious, a strong sense of missing someone or shared experiences, a trigger for grief suppressed. So at this time of preparation for celebration often with family, take some time to really talk, to acknowledge grief and even the awkwardness about mentioning it. I guarantee both you and the person you are talking to will feel better for it.

This week he gave me detailed instructions for how to spoil his ballot.They can’t be printed in a family newspaper.No one really wanted this election, and the mood throughout has been one of distrust and disappointment. It was called because the politicians couldn’t compromise, so the people had to.: General Election : UK heads to the polls for third election in five years: General Election : These are the key battleground seats in ScotlandThe unpopularity contestProfessor Sir John Curtice dubbed it ‘unpopularity contest’: to lead the country at the most critical time in modern history, the choice was between the least popular new Prime Minister ever, or the least popular leader of the opposition. Uninspiring options yielded only agonising, grudging decisions.When I joined the Tory candidate for Stirling on the doorsteps, I heard voters wrestle with their dilemmas out loud, unprompted. “I wanted to stay in the UK and the EU” “Boris Johnson - what will he do next ” And from someone who voted against Scottish independence: “Why are we Better Together in the UK and not in Europe ”In many parts of Scotland,you supported staying in the UK and the UK staying in the EU, you had to choose which union mattered most. But compromise and disappointment didn’t stop at the border.Brexit Party supporters were told they would trigger a political earthquake across half the country, there wasn’t even a tremor. Nowhere are the stakes higher than in Northern Ireland, but electoral pacts reduced the options for Unionists and Nationalists, Remainers and Leavers alike.: Do I need a polling card or ID to vote in the general election  Can I take photos at the polling station  Voting rules explainedQuestioning old party loyaltiesAnd everywhere, supporters of both the main parties were forced to question political loyalties stretching back generations.For every Corbyn partisan, there was a Labour voter feeling betrayed because their party has ignored them over Europe, or even more painfully, because the stain of anti-semitism has become impossible to conceal or ignore.Equally, Le-long Tories have asked themselves similar questions, wondering whether a party led by Boris Johnson still represents their values.You heard it in the tone of the challenges from audience members at the live TV debates - rare occasions when party leaders face scrutiny from a crowd they haven’t hand-picked.After nine years of austerity and three and a half years on from the EU referendum, the skepticism tipped into cynicism. It’s healthy to laugh at our leaders, but what does it say that the biggest punchline was a Prime Minister saying the truth matters to him To cut through the malaise, both parties tore up their fiscal blueprints and promised more spending than they have in generations. On both sides, the pledges should have been popular: tens of thousands of new nurses and police a publicly-run railway, postal service and utilities.But many simply refused to believe them. It’s not hard to see why when Labour made a £bn promise to compensate women hit by the rising retirement age, the day after their manesto launch, and Johnson floated the scrapping of the TV license - effectively overhauling the funding of the BBC - at a campaign event, conveniently on his most dficult day of the election.Meanwhile, the SNP put forward spending plans that would be undeliverable in an independent Scotland, while the Liberal Democrats overhyped themselves to the point of ridicule.It simply hardened the impression that politicians are willing to say and do anything to get your vote today, but only answer the questions tomorrow.An election of evasionThe -hour news cycle and our always-on social media culture should mean a new age of transparency, scrutiny and accountability. But this election was a pageant of evasion and deception.A Prime Minister who wants to open trade talks with Donald Trump refused to be interviewed for  minutes by Andrew Neil. Both sides played favourites with the questions they took from journalists and the outlets they appeared on. Frontbenchers have haunted spin rooms and trolled from the sidelines.The Conservative Party rebranded its twitter feed ‘FactCheckUK’ during the first debate, and paid to have Google search results for the Labour manesto led by its own attacks - a commentary on its own offering, which abandoned bold promises on tax cuts and social care Johnson made during the Tory leadership campaign.When events broke through the slogans, memes and s**tposts, like the photo of four-year-old Jack Williment-Barr sleeping on the floor of Leeds General Infirmary, they were drowned out by a tide of misdirection and misinformation - briefings about punches that were never thrown, and conspiracy theories boosted by columnists and candidates.Most worrying of all, both leaders betrayed a disqualying lack of empathy when it mattered most. Apologies for failures over antisemitism, Islamophobia, and isive past rhetoric had to be dragged out them.Easier to drive a JCB through a polystyrene wall. Somehow, as society grows more aware of the power and nuance of words and deeds, our politics become more macho and unaccountable.New normalFor most of this election, journalists covering the campaign have complained about it being too predictable, almost boring. It’s understandable: we’ve seen the Corbyn Labour playbook before, and Johnson’s message of ‘get Brexit done’ was as strong, stable and inert as two years ago.But we’ve had technology lessons with Jenner Arcuri, the continuing storm over anti-semitism, a terrorist tragedy, secret trade documents and claims of Russian hacking, and a Prime Minister asked how many children he has - a question we still don’t have a definitive answer to.Consider how far the range of what is reasonable has shted: it was news that the President of the United States didn’t make an unprecedented partisan intervention in British domestic politics.Polling dayThis was the first winter election in half a century, and the first December election in a century.Going into polling day, experts said as many as  seats were too close to call. There were former Tory cabinet ministers standing against their party, ex-Prime Ministers telling voters not to back their side, and outgoing Labour MPs endorsing former rivals. This was a remarkable, unique, unrepeatable campaign.If it felt like the most important election in a generation didn’t matter, it’s because a now tired lesson was confirmed: you can’t push a binary constitutional issue through the world’s oldest parliamentary democracy.The machinery is too delicate things break.It can only yield more disappointment. Voters won’t have said no to indyref, and Brexit won’t get done both of the UK’s most isive questions will hang over the country into  and beyond.At least this part was over by Christmas.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"gary rhodes a pioneer who inspired so many young cooks tributes pour in for tv chef","story":"Described as a pioneer who \"inpsired many young cooks\" and the man who \"almost single handedly put British food on the world stage\", Rhodes was one of the best known ambassadors for British cuisine and inspired a generation of Brits to enjoy cooking. window.twttr The top chef, who received five Michelin stars during his career, he is best known for his work on MasterChef, Ready Steady Cook and Hells Kitchen.

She followed Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn#s position, stating she would like to see a new Brexit deal negotiated with the EU and put to the British people in a referendum, with no Brexit the other option.Jenner Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, said her priority was to #uphold democracy# and to see Brexit through #as soon as possible#.The SNP#s Robert Leslie said that Orkney and Shetland had not voted for Brexit yet #we could suffer most# from the country leaving the EU. He added he would like to remain in the EU and help reform it from within as part of an independent Scotland.The Brexit Party#s Robert Smith did not attend, but his stance of a #clean-break Brexit# with a free trade deal with the EU was announced to the room.Unsurprisingly, Brexit proved the hottest topic of the evening with several questions based around that subject.Ms Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, surprised most in attendance by repeatedly going against party policy # firstly by saying she supported the actions of Gina Miller, who took the Conservative government to court over Brexit, because she was #upholding democracy# and secondly by saying that the government#s #settled status# scheme for EU citizens needed a #total overhaul#.So it would seem the only candidate willing to represent the more than nine and a half thousand brexit voters in Orkney and Shetland is working fisherman Robert Smith of the Brexit party. It would seem Boris promise that all tories elected in this election would back his brexit plan was a bit of the mark. Or maybe it shows that his brexit plan is not brexit at alltheir candidate For the isles is willing to back it.Good to see that the Brexit Party is not drawn into this level of debate. I am sure Robert Smith was absent because he was busy getting Brexit Done. Too right that a clean-break Brexit is what we need. Like was said before, a free trade deal will be the #easiest in human history#. Wise words from Liam Fox, and still yet to be disproved by the #facts#.Robert Leslie, SNP, is obviously unaware ofthe impact of independence. The EU has stated repeatedly that , wewill be automatically out of the EU on Independence Day # with #No Deal#.#When part of the territory of a Member State ceases to be a part of that State, e.g. because that territory becomes an independent state, the treaties will no longer apply #Westminster will no longer fund our #notional budget deficit#. It will become real. Nicola Sturgeon#s Scottish Growth Commission proposed a multi-year plan to reduce it to EU-acceptable levels. We must also have our own, independent central bank and therefore, our own currency. That will take nine yearsand will require tens of billions in foreign reserves.If Britain #remains# there would be a #hard UK border# with EU tarfs . Negotiations will be with Brussels, not Westminster.It will take at least  years, with austerity,to rejoin.And  when we do we shall join the euro and pass control of our economy trade and fishing agriculture to the EU.SNP EU Brexit policy is nonsense. Scots are shrewd people and will not buy it.No, I was absent because I was at sea.#with Rees-Mogg hiding below decks I think she was campaigning in the SW of England.Not surprising. The Brexit party are all at sea.At least you were at sea doing an honest days work Robert, unlike the other candidates. Nobody will know more about the negative effects of European Union membership than you!I#m a bit baffled. I read tonight that Jo Swinson has apologised that she and her Lib Dems backed the Tories# austerity policies. But last night I saw Willie Rennie backing those policies to the hilt. What a party.Jo was talking about the past.Willie was thinking about the future.Now  have quit, including Rees Mogg. Like what Robert did there though, referring to Jacob#s sister, formerly of the Brexit Party, and no longer campaigning for them in the South East of England. You#ve got to ask how a spare bedroom tax would impact on that family# including in their second and third homes and any additional properties in their portfolios.WHY SOCIALIST SNP MEMBERS SHOULD VOTE LABOUR TOMORROW:For the first time in forty years and possibly for the last time during my le, we have the chance to support a manesto that includes widespread nationalisation and the restoration of worker’s rights.These are policies that any self-respecting socialist would have regarded as red lines before Thatcher came along and “modernised” British politics.After Brexit and Scottish independence, we willto the natural battle between left and right. It will even take place within the SNP itself, once the phoney pre-independence “party of national unity” approach falls apart.During these debates, the left will highlight support for Corbyn’s radical policies as evidence that these are still relevant and can still win votes.Meanwhile, the right will highlight the lack of support for Labour as evidence that strong unions and public ownership are no longer winning policies and should be abandoned forever.If you can’t use your vote to get your candidate elected tomorrow, at lease use it to make a statement.The ideas behind Labour’s bold policies need to be kept alive.They will be as relevant in an independent Scotland as they will anywhere .Absolutely.Absolutely not, Johan. I am old enough to remember the Winter of Discontent. Comrade Corbyn, Comrade Scargill. First Secretary Sturgeon! Reach for the rusty tin, self-castration before I would vote Socialist or Nationalist.I am almost old enough to remember the s also. I went missing from hom when I wis about , because I was busy helping a couple of older folk collect fire wood in the absence of coal during the Tories  day week I think.We are not going back to the s, with what we know now we can run things much better under Corbyn.The absence of coal was due to Socialist and le long Soviet supporterMick McGahey#s miners strike. Hardly down to the Tories. Just the Unions holding the country to ransom. Thank God the Maggie neutered that bunch.It#s almost like you are saying Shetland needs a vocal and united local Labour Party willing to take a stand on environmental and equality issues and prepared to ensure people#s concerns are properly considered.Will the local branch make a start to rebuilding by considering whether it isn#t time to call an end to Sullom Voe Yes, it would be goodmembers stopped voting for other partiesIt#s almost like you are trying to change the subject. Which of the parties that plan to close Sullom Voe did you vote for It’s important that unions be strong but not omnipotent, as in the s when many major industries were still nationalised. We meed balance.Combining the two is all very fine for those who, like me, benefited from working in the public sector however it leads to a two-tier workforce, with those in the private sector footing the bill, in taxes or high product prices, for the privileged ones in the public sector. That also hits private sector pay as employers must maintain viability with their increased costs.Having said that, re-nationalisation of electricity would be hilariously apt because government would become directly accountable totaxpayers and or bill-payers for the soaring costs of energy arising from “decarbonisation”, associated with the lunacy of unilateral “declarations of climate emergency” and policies like Labour’s “net zero ”.The IPCC does not call for that and condemns unilateral action as being unhelpful in achieving international agreement.I voted for Blair when sanity prevailed,now Corbyn takes us all back, well he is trying to, but the result empowers Boris!!! So now we have a Boris   Sturgeon catfight. Interesting times ahead, perhaps an Independent Shetland is the way forward, history repeating.Agreed Johan, and Labour has had my vote this time, but when there is a chance of turffing out an austerity backing LibDem# The main thing is people are being offered a chance to take back control of the vital services they depend on that should never have been privatised in the first place.New management systems will mean these can in future serve the people rather than serving corporate greed.Whether we get there this election or not, Corbin#s bold ideas have reignited the debate and energised thousands more activists than the Tories have active members. Hope remains for a fairer society in which the economy works for the good of the people as well as the environment they depend on.The LibDems on the other hand remain forever compromised between the freedom of business to exploit people and the freedom of people not to be exploited. Some wonderful handwringing from Carmichael on Viking Energy this election.Well done for your stand there and on UHA.Particularly pleasing to see Friends of the Earth saying Labour#s manesto was better for the environment than that of the Greens.O dear, poor Peter.On the wrong side again..."},{"url":null,"title":"sumburgh airport closed after lightning strike ","story":"Sumburgh Airport has been forced to close after a lightning strike was believed to have hit the terminal building earlier this afternoon.Highlands and Islands Airports Limitedstated: #Severe weather has affected our communications systems and the airport is currently closed until pm.#Engineers are currently working to resolve the situation.

Trees decorated or sponsored by local people, churches, organisations and businesses will delight , while musicians and singers will play live Christmas music on the hour. Take a seat, close your eyes, pray and invite God to bring you into not ‘that Christmassy feeling’ but the deep joy that comes from knowing Him through Jesus Christ.There will be a number of points where guets can interact with the trees – for instance add to the decorations of a tree with your own words of joy and thanksgiving, post prayer requests for personal needs and other situations around the world at the Prayer Tree, and use the Blue Christmas ‘remembering’ tree to remember those whose presence we miss due to distance or death. A Kids’ Craft room will be open for children to take some time to also engage with the theme of Christmas Joy.When you’ve spent some time taking in the Christmas forest, head through the link corridor to the new hall, where hot drinks and festive treats will be served. Viewing of the trees and enjoying refreshments can take place on Friday pm-pm, Saturday am-.pm and Sunday pm-pm. The suggested donation for entrance is £and gts will be gratefully received.Rev.

It can, however, offer a “true reflection” of an person’s own experiences, Jake Mac Siacais says ahead of his autobiography launch. From the perspective of those who know him, as an Irish language activist and lelong republican, his story is undoubtedly a fascinating one, and it is one that is laid bare in honest detail in his new book, Ón Taobh Istigh.Written in Irish, the autobiography starts as most stories do – at the beginning. Born onto a wooden bath board, Jake’s translated introduction describes his own beginning as neither “the most auspicious” nor “the worst”. It was, by his account, a relatively unremarkable day, although the events that have marked his le have been anything but.Our recent conflict and, of course, the republican struggle had a profound impact on Jake from an early age. Having joined the Fianna aged just , he had, by the time he was , resigned himself to either prison or death. For him, the latter came first. Arrested, questioned, and waterboarded by the RUC, he was eventually imprisoned at -years-old and would spend the best part of a decade in ‘the Crum’ and Long Kesh – eventually being moved to the H-Blocks in . During his part in the blanket protest, he became a friend and close confidant of Bobby Sands, who would die on hunger-strike in . As well as offering an honest and heartfelt insight into one of the most tragic periods our recent history, Ón Taobh Istigh is a discerning look at the social and political events that have shaped our post-conflict society.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, Jake told how he wrote the book as a means of dealing with his own personal struggle with depression.“I had suffered severe depression from  to  and I had worked through that with counselling,” he explained. “Then in , February, the counsellor said to me that one of the things that some people find useful is to write things down. So I just started to write my le story and somebody suggested that it would make a great book, so that’s what I did.”He continued: “It meant that I was examining my le in detail, going through everything that I’ve been through and literally just pouring it out on pages. “I decided that in the book I would be as honest and as forthright as I could, but that I would do it in a way which didn’t inidually insult or attack people. I deal with the politics of things, but not with iniduals.“I’ve dealt in detail with all of the major periods the struggle, the peace process – all of that.”He added: “I’m sure that historical figures will recognise themselves in the book, but the book is written with the clear intention of laying out how I remember things, and not straying into making judgements of any iniduals.”Ón Taobh Istigh is a forthright and genuine attempt by Jake to tell his story. While he admits that memory is often subjective, it is a “true reflection” of his own experiences.“I say in the introduction of the book that memory is never a trustworthy tool, or a very forensic tool,” he said.“It’s dficult to trust anyone ’s recall, and even more dficult when it comes to your own because memory is inclined to remember those things which it is favourable to remember, and to forget those things that are painful or dficult. Therefore, before you read this book bear in mind that it’s a true reflection of what I experienced, but others may take a dferent view.”Ón Taobh Istigh will be launched at Cultúrlann McAdam Ó Fiaich on Saturday at pm."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"meabha puts irish women in the frame","story":"AN intricate painting is proving to be much more than meets the eye in its celebration of Irish women and their place in the world.Entitled Mná hÉireann Women of Ireland, the painting was created by West Belfast artist Meabha Magerr. The striking piece was commissioned by go-to Andersonstown physiotherapist Dan Turley, taking pride of place in his home.Meabha, originally from Inishmore Crescent, now based across the water, told the Andersonstown News that her interest and talent in art flourished ever since “I could hold a crayon”.“In our household, thankfully, you were allowed to be who and what you were. I passed my -Plus and wanted to go to the school around the corner and that was St Genevieve’s. I had always had a love of painting and came from an artistic, creative family.”Friends since they were teenagers, Dan commissioned Meabha, who has displayed her work at the annual Féile an Phobail artists showcase in St Mary’s University College, to create Mná hÉireann.“My biggest problem was finding the right face, the central figure in this case of the piece, to signy le force and strength. I had painted a portrait of Clannad’s Moya Brennan before and I just kept coming back to her face, especially with her being a Celtic woman, a setter of pace. I did change it slightly, the hair, the colour of the eyes, I wanted to convey the feel of her, not necessarily a repeat portrait,” she said.She continued: “I’ve known Dan since I was , we have a lot of banter. He’s a Michelangelo man and just to annoy him I painted the ‘Da Vinci rose’ in it,” she laughed. “There are forget-me-nots in the painting and fuschias, deora Dé God’s tears, as I’d imagine he’d cry to see the persecution women have and continue to face at the injustices in the world.“Dan was very clear that he wanted only positives in the piece, no negatives.”Contained in Mná hÉireann are leaves of ious sizes withnames on them of women from throughout history in delicate gold lettering, and not immediately obvious.“I spent time researching and wanted to go beyond the obvious,” explained Meabha. “Countess Markievicz is there, my great aunt Nano Mullan is on it who fought alongside Countess Markievicz, Sonia O’Sullivan is there. The names are quite hard to read and that was deliberate, as throughout history women haven’t always been seen. They’ve had to come through back doors, pretend to be less than they were.”The prolic artist said the painting and the names contained in it have proved quite the talking point.“James Barry is on it. A woman who wanted to join the Irish army as a military surgeon and disguised herself as a man to do.”James Barry became a pioneering surgeon who carried out the first successful Caesarean delivery.Meabha spoke of how “not all the contributions, the names are immediately obvious”.“Sinéad Burke is there, Sinéad who is three-and-a-half foot tall, a Dublin-based teacher, PhD student and activist. When I first read about her, I nearly skimmed past the article, which was about the fashion industry. I love style but have no interest in fashion. I soon realised the article wasn’t about fashion in that sense, it was about inclusion – a much bigger topic and much more far reaching in many areas of le.“There are olives painted in the portrait, in dferent stages of development which are symbolizing peace. Some are ripe, some aren’t, the meaning behind this is that this is an ongoing stage, peace is a circle of work that will never end, we are always going to have to work hard for it.“I’m glad that the painting is proving to be such a talking point in Dan’s house. It’s as much about learning in that you pick a name and find out more, there is meaning behind each chosen colour, flower and there are emeralds, in this particular case placed in the Celtic crown to represent the four green fields.“The ring formation of the wreath signies everlasting protection. I didn’t want to follow the trend of portraying a warrior queen, that has been well covered by many fabulous artists. I wanted to make this piece more personal.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"tourism numbers soar in west belfast","story":"A new report has shown that West Belfast welcomed record number of tourists this year.Figures recorded for  thus far have shown at least  million visitor trips in this part of the city.Research commissioned by West Belfast tourism body Fáilte Feirste Thiar shows a dramatic increase in people visiting our local attractions, which have helped generate millions for the city’s economy. The staggering tourism data represents an almost  per cent visitor increase since  when over  million vistor trips were recorded.Fáilte Feirste Thiar Executive Director, Harry Connolly, said the record numbers were indicative of the “world class” attractions on offer in West Belfast.“Two million visitors have engaged with our established, world class visitor attractions and that includes the Coiste Political Walking Tours, Black Taxi Tours, people downloading the mural map and discovering the our murals by themselves, or visiting the new James Connolly Visitor Centre,” he said.“West Belfast also offers an urban and rural mix, where people can go to the Bog Meadows and the Belfast Hills or they can go to the city and see what our community has to offer.”He added: “The off-season in West Belfast used to be a lot longer, but that’s shortening and it shows that we are now a year-round destination.”Amongst this year’s tourism highlights were the opening of the new James Connolly Visitor Centre and the annual Féile an Phobail, which welcomed the world to West Belfast with hundreds of events including Michael Conlan’s headline bout in the Falls Park. While celebrating our culture and heritage, Mr Connolly said that the hospitality and tourism industry now employs , local people, who are boosting “regeneration”.“This is , homes, families and jobs sustained, which is enormous,” he said.“When we were established we wanted to ensure that tourism was part of the overall programme for social and economic regeneration. “You can really see now how tourism is having a very positive and profound impact on social and economic development of West Belfast.”Not content to rest on their laurels, Fáilte Feirste Thiar are already looking to  with the aim of bringing even more tourists to the area.“As we approach , we believe that we have a firm foundation in place to make sure that West Belfast’s potential is realised,” Harry enthused.“What will help us achieve that is new world class transformational projects. In , we look forward to seeing the development of the Roddy McCorley Society Museum and interactive visitor’s centre. “Of course, in the early part of  we hope to see permission granted to allow Casement Park to be granted, which will be an absolute game-changer. “We see the continued growth of Féile an Phobail, we hope to have Michael Conlan back in the Falls Park to win a world title, and we look forward to the enormous event that will be.”Commenting on the latest figures, outgoing West Belfast MP and Fáilte Feirste Thiar Chairperson, Paul Maskey, said: “When you look at the numbers it’s absolutely phenomenal. “Other parts of this city are now looking at West Belfast to learn and to see what lessons they can take from it moving forward. “Fáilte Feirste Thiar is engaging with organisations in other parts of the city to help them do that.“Tourism is vitally important for our economy in West Belfast and it is sustaining many jobs in the area, and that includes restaraunts, shops, bars and clubs.”He added: “We want to increase those numbers in the time ahead, and it is our job to do that.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"voters go to polls for westminster election","story":"POLLING stations have opened across the North in the General Election. candidates are competing for  Westminster seats.Polling stations opened at am and will close at pm with results expected to be finalised early on Friday morning.A total of ,, people are eligible to vote across the north.North Belfast is expected to witness one of the tightest contests, between DUP’s Nigel Dodds and Sinn Féin’s John Finucane, with Nuala McAllister of Alliance the other candidate on the ballot paper.In South Belfast, SDLP’s Claire Hanna is the bookies favourite to oust outgoing DUP MP Emma Little-Pengelly.

Westminster majority means the DUP’s ability to thwart his Brexit proposals is diminished..pushSome checks on goods moving between the rest of the UK and Northern Ireland are expected to take place to keep the Irish land border with the EU frictionless.The speed with which that could happen is disputed but the UK is set to leave the bloc at the end of next month.During the campaign, the Prime Minister attempted to deny that some goods will have to be checked when moving between the rest of the UK and Northern Ireland.This election result is a vote to end paralysis, not a mandate to force through a deal that would be disruptive to businessAnn McGregorJeremy Corbyn said he had obtained a confidential report which “drives a coach and horses” through the claim that there will be no border in the Irish Sea under the Brexit plan.Ann McGregor, chief executive of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said: “This election result is a vote to end paralysis, not a mandate to force through a deal that would be disruptive to business.“The business community will be calling on the Prime Minister to provide swt certainty about what Brexit means and time to prepare for and implement it.”She added: “The Prime Minister’s current deal, which effectively gives Northern Ireland two borders, should be a concern for all of us – not just business leaders and employers.“Politicians from all parties, and anyone with a vested interest in the Northern Ireland economy, need to recognise the major risks to business growth and job creation, and the serious consequences for young people seeking a career in Northern Ireland.”Queen’s University Belfast reader in sociology Katy Hayward said the result was partly down to electoral pacts to maximise the anti-Brexit vote rather than reliance on tactical voting.She said more unionists and nationalists voted for middle-ground parties like the pro-Remain Alliance Party and SDLP.Demographic change in Northern Ireland’s balance between nationalist and unionist voters was alluded to by DUP leader Arlene Foster.She said the numbers were against her losing candidates in North and South Belfast.The results are symbolically signicant, as there are now more nationalist and republican MPs from Northern Irelandthan unionists , reversing the  seven split from the  election.Irish senator Mark Daly urged the Irish Government to make preparations for a United Ireland.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has rejected the suggestion as inflammatory to unionists.Mr Daly said: “For many unionists in Northern Ireland, their link to the UK is through Scotland andScotland votes for independence, then many will question the future of the Union.“The Irish government needs to show the people of Northern Ireland, particularly the unionist community, a clear alternative and a vision for the future that is inclusive.”"},{"url":null,"title":"election results bring scottish independence and irish unity to

I lost two jobs in six months to a year. I wasn’t seeing or spending time with my kids and I wasn’t going to football. Everything I loved was going.”Aaron’s le got back on track when he went to see professionals.In an searingly honest account he said: “I first went to Jigsaw Counselling in North Belfast because I wanted to be away from where I thought people might know me and then after a few weeks I just thought I’d go to Holy Trinity Counselling which was near me.As soon as I started to speak about things I would well up and start to cry.

I didn’t feel comfortable speaking to my friends or even my brothers about my problems but going in to speak to a professional, who was a stranger to me, was a big help. I learnt to trust the person and really opened and I would strongly advise anyone going through dark times to do the same.“What happened to Jerry is a tragedy and I feel so much for his family and what they are going through right now and send my thoughts and prayers to them all.“When I went into counselling there was a lot of past hurt and pain. I spoke about that and other stuff I had seen in the past and also about the present stuff which was ongoing at the time including how I felt personally and what the underlying problems were.“I didn’t know at the time what they were, but speaking to a stranger I opened up and shed many a tear. That was when I noticed the hurt coming out.“As soon as I started to speak about things I would well up and start to cry. I was carrying the hurt for maybe longer than I ever knew.I have never spoken about these things to my family but with Jerry Thompson’s death and how it has affected so many people I thought I should speak up and hopefully my story can bring people in trouble some help and some hope.Aaron Smyth“I was never a confident person growing up and never believed in myself. Even when I won awards during football I still had massive self-doubt.“I was always a bit of a rocket and I won’t ever lose that but now I know I’m in control where before I was reckless and lost.“I had no feelings or emotions and everything was a blur and the world around me was falling down.“Speaking to someone made me see what I was doing and it opened up to me everything I should change. I recognised and realised a lot about myself which I didn’t know and it made me realise the pain I carried was all bottled up and gradually became a bigger problem.“I have never spoken about these things to my family but with Jerry Thompson’s death and how it has affected so many people I thought I should speak up and hopefully my story can bring people in trouble some help and some hope.

Its about hard work and dedication,\" he said of its joint ninth place.Principal of Castlederg High School Elaine McKelvey said she was \"delighted\" it was the highest-ranking non-grammar school in the league table.\"These results are testimony to the excellent provision for learning made at Castlederg High School by a highly dedicated staff, working in partnership with very supportive parents to ensure the best possible outcome for each young person,\" she said.Mrs McKelvey paid tribute to the hard work and dedication of staff during \"a most challenging period for educational delivery within all schools in Northern Ireland, given the shortfall in capital funding and inequitable remuneration for teaching staff\".\"Most of all though, we are tremendously proud of our pupils and their achievements, noting the breadth of opportunity for the future that such excellent exam results have created for them,\" she added.The Department of Education said the information contained in the league table relating to GCSE results \"does not provide a valid basis for comparing performance between schools, since it takes no account of intakes of the schools or of any other factors that may affect pupil performance\".It added: \"No single measurement can constitute a fair or accurate evaluation of a school, and the figures should be considered in the context of other information about schools and their pupils.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38779460.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/POLITICS724.jpg","title":"alex kane five talking points from the general election campaign","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The leaders debatesUUP’s Steve Aiken, Sinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill, DUP’s Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, SDLP’s Colum Eastwood and Naomi Long of Alliance, at last night’s debate The leaders debates, which are often fairly dull, predictable events, had a more important purpose this time.With a new round of talks due to start on Monday, observers were looking for some evidence that the parties might be ready to break the ongoing impasse and reboot the Executive, but that evidence was in small supply.The exchanges between the UUP and DUP and between the SDLP and Sinn Fein were particularly snarly, making a complete mockery of the unionist pacts in North Belfast and Fermanagh and South Tyrone, as well as the nationalist pacts in North and South Belfast.Lets face it,the moderate branches of both communities are this tetchy with each other, it doesnt augur well for reaching a settlement before January .While Sinn Fein and the DUP were able to maintain a veneer of civility, it was clear, when an Irish Language Act and reforming the petition of concern were mentioned, that there was nothing approaching a meeting of minds.. Loyalist ralliesRally in Ulster Hall is a chance to resist Brexit deal. Picture By: Arthur Allison Pacemaker Press  There had been a view in some quarters that the public meetings organised by a section of loyalism would probably run out of steam.They didnt. Indeed, they seem to have energised a younger generation of loyalism which has, up until now, tended to keep its head down and do most of its activism on social media. The target of their anger is Boris Johnsons Betrayal Act, so it will be interesting to see what will happenhe manages to win a comfortable majority and pushes ahead with his deal.While it is true that a result which curtails Johnsons room for manoeuvre would dissipate some of the anger, it is also true that, having been harnessed and galvanised, it is hard to see this new movementjust disappearing.The reaction of this movement could prove crucial when the new talks begin.. Boris in Northern IrelandPacemaker Press   Prime Minister Boris Johnson during a visit to Tayto Castle in County Armagh Northern Ireland on Thursday afternoon.Pic Colm Lenaghan Pacemaker  Boris Johnson only made one trip to Northern Ireland during the entire campaign and used it to produce waterfalls of waffle about what was, or wasnt, included in his withdrawal agreement.He hadnt a clue. Im not even sure he could have pointed to the Irish Sea on a map, let alone known where Northern Ireland ended and the Republic began.Bizarrely, he didnt seem to have the slightest concern about trumpeting his ignorance, even when he was having a meeting with local Conservative members. Okay, he knows that the four candidates being fielded by his party wouldnt be getting enough votes between them to fill a smallish hall in the middle of nowhere, but you would have thought that he could, at the very least, have been honest with them. But no, not a bit of it. He continued to waffle. Maybe he just cant help himself.He had already proved that he wasnt listening to the views of the DUP, so why would he even begin to care what anyone  he met during the visit was thinking . Finucane is caugh shortEvery campaign produces a story which is remembered long after the election is over. This particular one isnt as historically signicant as the Relief of Mafeking or the Relief of Derry. That said, the Relief of Finucane was splashed across the front of the Belfastand followed up by a number of other media outlets. It gave rise to a stream of jokes, most of them involving number ones, number twos, iations of flushing away support, inconvenient truths and his determination to meet the challenge from the DU Pee.My own favourite was that he hadnt really done anything wrong because the General Election is based on a \"first p****d the post\" form of voting.If nothing , we can always rely on our much celebrated sense of humour to see us through."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38780628.ece/ac386/BINARY/POLITIC%201843.jpg","title":"at a glance northern irelands 2019 general election winners","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Asked whether a Boris Brexit might be al for the Irish unity project, O’Neill insisted that running Northern Ireland into the ground was not the way forward for unity — which wiped out a few decades of recent republican history. Naomi Long also rejected the inevitability thesis.Colum Eastwood drew applause by attacking Sinn Fein for being absent from Westminster yet trousering millions in expenses. O’Neill responded sharply, by claiming the SDLP leader was “disingenuous”, highlighting SNP impotence in London. Special status for the North — which a Boris Brexit represented — was a product of Sinn Fein activism beyond Westminster, she claimed. We were only  minutes in and pan-nationalism and pan-unionism both seemed in tatters – except in North and South Belfast of course.Eastwood has enjoyed a good campaign. The nadir of his party’s  removal from Westminster left some wondering whether the SDLP would ever . He now stands of the brink of heading here along with a colleague. The SDLP leader may also have been buoyed by the apparent photo endorsement from Fine Gael Taoiseach Leo Varadkar. Interesting that, given it is only eleven months since the launch of the “historic partnership” between the SDLP and, er, Fianna Fáil — a tie-up rejected by the SDLP’s MP-to-be in South Belfast.Naomi Long performed solidly and it has been a fine year for her party, its vote up % in the council elections and % in the Europeans. But a First-Past-the-Post contest remains dficult terrain for Alliance. Another issue is that Westminster contests are for the true believers. In , those identying as unionist or nationalist were twice as likely to vote as those eschewing such labels.The debate moved onto the health crisis and the associated problem of Assembly restoration. It was everyone ’s fault that it was mothballed. Not their party’s responsibility. Oh no. Michelle O’Neill gave no ground on an Irish Language Act, insisting it was a right. “It’s not an either or” in terms of a Language Act versus dealing with the health crisis was her line. Good luck with those talks on Monday, Secretary of State.Each representative performed creditably. But how much any of Tuesday night really mattered is questionable. The viewing figure for Sunday night’s UTV leaders’ debate was just shy of ,. More watched the programme immediately afterwards, where the contestants had to eat grubs in a jungle. Maybe UTV host Marc Mallett should have made similar demands upon the politicians. An internal BBC document this week showed less than half of - year olds watch BBC in an average week — and younger electors are least likely to vote anyway.A viewing figure of , for an election debate is not a bad figure, but over , people voted in Northern Ireland’s  Westminster election.So,  out of  voters last time didn’t bother tuning in.

This is the first time for me to come on the scene and build on that going forward,” he said. Mr Doherty finished in fourth place after Frank McCoubrey of the DUP.Monica Digney of the republican pro-le party Aontu was at the count centre with party leader Peadar Toibin.“I’m just so relieved it’s over,” she said.“We’re not expecting to top any polls. We’re looking to maximise the vote andwe do that, I will be thrilled. We got a great reaction of the doors. There were so many areas we didn’t get around to because we’re only a small party.”Both Ms Digney and DonnaMarie Higgins of the Alliance Party lost their £ deposits after failing to win % of the vote."},{"url":null,"title":"west tyrone orfhlaith begley romps home for sinn fein in border constituency","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The collaboration between Balenciaga and Nuriev reimagines a sofa — the center of so many homes — as an example of environmentally conscious design, giving generations of garments and other materials another le. The oblong sofa — inspired by typical overstuffed recliners — is upholstered with damaged or otherwise unsellable garments and off-cuts from obsolete stocks of Balenciaga clothing, encased by scrapped transparent vinyl. Patterns, cuts, and tags within the stuffing are recognizably Balenciaga, a mix of past seasons and ideas. Intended to encourage sustainable practices within design and where, the piece reflects Balenciaga’s recognition of the responsibility designers have to counterbalance their environmental impact, and dedication to implementing programs that upcycle waste and contribute to a circular economy. A post shared by  Harry Nurievon Dec ,  at :am PSTLast year, artist Harry Nuriev had one of the most memorable installations of Art Basel Miami, putting together a Balenciaga office. He obviously knew he was onto a winner, because this year he yet again took inspiration from the fashion house – this time in the form of a sofa.Nuriev stuffed a large couch with off-cuts of Balenciaga clothes that weren’t going to be sold, making for an incredibly chic sitting situation. Giving it extra fashion credentials, model Bella Hadid even visited the installation and posed on it.Dior brought back a retro designer\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Dior Men’s creative director Kim Jones decided to hold his pre-fall  show in Miami to coincide with Art Basel.

Al though many EU leaders are relieved that the Brexit saga is finally coming to an end, more than three years after Britons voted to leave, just as many are saddened by the departure of a heavyweight member state.The sense of relief was evident among European business groups too, although it was tinged with some regret. The uncertainty over Britain’s future was a concern among businesses and some have shted operations out of the UK. There are still questions over the future relationship after Brexit and whether tarf-free trade between the UK and the EU will continue after a standstill transition period expires at the end of .“I deeply regret that the United Kingdom, our friends, are leaving the European Union,” Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar told reporters in Brussels.But he conceded: “It’s always easier for us to be able to negotiate with a partner who has a strong personal mandate and can control a majority in their parliament.”Luxembourg prime minister Xavier Bettel said: “I still regret the outcome of the referendum but I respect it. I’m happy that it will be finally now over with this situation where we are able to agree here but in London they are not able to agree. So, finished, this situation, and that’s good for all of us.”Joachim Lang, chief executive of the Federation of German Industries, said no German company wants Brexit but “our companies are breathing a sigh of relief that there is finally a mandate to accept the withdrawal agreement”.When Britain voted to leave the EU in June , there were concerns that it could lead to other departures, but those fears have dissipated as the process has been so politically isive and expensive.Although the pathway to Britain’s departure by January  is reasonably clear, the future relationship between the country and the EU is not. Discussions can only begin after Britain formally leaves. The EU has already said that its main Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier will lead those discussions.After congratulating Mr Johnson on his victory, new EU Council president Charles Michel said: “We expect as soon as possible the vote by the British Parliament on the withdrawal agreement.”“We are ready,” he told reporters as he arrived to chair the meeting of Britain’s  EU partner countries. “The European Union will negotiate in order to have close co-operation in the future with the UK.”Ultimately, the Brexit orce negotiations may prove to be the easy part. If Britain does leave at the end of next month, it will have less than a year to negotiate a new trade agreement with its partners and get it endorsed in all their parliaments. Most trade pacts take several years to agree.But the EU member countries will first have to agree on a new negotiating mandate for Mr Barnier.“We are all set,” said new European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, whose powerful executive arm negotiates trade deals on behalf of EU member countries. The commission also supervised the Brexit talks.“We have the structures internally. We are ready to negotiate whatever is necessary,” she said.Asked whether it is possible to seal a trade deal in under a year, Mr Michel said: “It is not my intention to predict based on the experience of the past.”"},{"url":null,"title":"500689","story":"The Creggan Community Collective has organised a pre-Christmas cultural event that will be taking place this week.Based at An Cro Mor, Creggan Community Collective has liaised with Valued Voices to arrange an evening of stories, poems, music, song and craic for Wednesday th December at pm.This free event will bring together Creggan writers Ben Dillon, Liam Diver, Caitlin Browne performing alongside poet, playwright and filmmaker, Damian Gorman, currently in the city working with the Playhouse.

Barker, who previously held the post of Vice Chairman, takes over from the outgoing Brian Smith who served his five years in the chair. Former Chairman John Keenan was also nominated for ato hot-seat but opted not to let his name go forward. Keenan addressed the floor, explaining that, while he was honoured to have been asked to lead the county again, he endorsed Barker as a suitable candidate. In his address, Barker thanked his club Moneymore for his grounding in administration, where he became Secretary at the age of  and after five years he had a similar stint as Chairman. googletag.cmd.push “I am looking forward to taking Derry in a new direction in ,” he said. He told club delegates in attendance that he wished for his tenure not to be about me but about the county. Barker confirmed that he has already set the wheels in motion for an in-depth review of Derry GAA, under the guidance of high ranking Ulster GAA Official and former Ballinderry Chairman Stephen McGeehan. It is based around – as Barker outlined - where the currently sits, where it needs to go and how it will get here. The findings of the review are due to be fed back early in . googletag.cmd.push With Barker moving up the ladder, former All-Ireland winning defender Kieran McKeever was elected unopposed as Vice Chairman. McKeever was last year tasked by the now defunct Advisory Committee to brainstorm ideas at a well-attended meeting of football people on the direction they feel the county needed to take. The Dungiven man is the first of four new faces now in office. At last years AGM, no Treasurer was elected and when Michael Hasson was co-opted at a later stage, he stood down before the end of his tenure. Liam Peoples, who previously held the post, was nominated this year but didnt stand. There was a vote between the other two candidates with Ogra Colmcilles Martin Devlin elected ahead of Limavady man Mark Gannon. Patsy Mullan didnt wish to seek re-election as Coaching Officer. Karl Diamond was nominated but didnt stand. Hugh McGrath and Bobby Farren, who stood against Brian Smith for the chair last year, were the other nominations. Foreglen delegate Noel McFeely asked the floorMcGraths position as Logistics Manager with the county teams was a conflict of interests. In a show of hands, called by Brian Smith who oversaw the election of officers, both names were put forward with Farren winning by one vote, -. Outgoing PRO Conor Nicholl didnt seek aand Lissans Ciaran McRory was elected, as was Paul Birt to the new post of Assistant Treasurer. RECOMMENDATIONS Following the election of officers, the proposed motions recommendations were discussed. However, with a query raised from the floor that none of the listed suggestions from clubs had been cross-referenced with the GAAs Official Guide, they could only be put forward as recommendations. Ballinderry were calling for adult club players be guaranteed a minimum of two championship games in the year. Pat McGuckin spoke on the issue citing the level of preparation that goes in at club level and that players deserve the same chances as inter-county players. Newbridge delegate Seamus McNeill also touched on the issue but suggested that until the CCCC in Croke Park give clubs a better window for championship games, there was very little counties could do. Stephen Barker, who also sits on the fixtures taskforce in Croke Park, highlighted that there are moves to condense the inter-county season further. In terms of the club championships, Barker stated that the CCC are pondering over three options – a championship based on groups, ato the backdoor model and retaining the knock-out format. Loup called for senior leagues to be revert to  teams. Games Administrator Breige ONeill pointed out that unless clubs were prepared to play without county players, then the situation was unlikely to change. While Barker stressed that league sizes would remain, the CCC are exploring a system that will give players more league games. The possibility of a split after  rounds, with the top and bottom half splitting off - a system currently implemented in Antrim. It would give an additional five matches to decide relegation, promotion and league titles. Slaughtneil outlined a recommendation for the club championships, football and hurling, to be played in over a  week period, with a game every three weeks to allow dual clubs adequate time for structured training. With winners needed for the Ulster competitions in October, this format would require the championship to roll out in mid-July. New Slaughtneil Chairman Sean McGuigan, stated that he was happy to wait on the outcome of the CCCs proposals. FINANCE Earlier in the meeting, a financial report - audited by ASM Chartered Accountants - was delivered by Central Council Delegate Danny Scullion, as a result of no official treasurer being appointed after Michael Hasson stepped down during the year. The report outlined an operating surplus of pound, for the year and in his address, outgoing Chairman Brian Smith referenced unnecessary speculation that the county were in financial dficulties. The gate receipts for  totaled pound,, a figure that increased almost pound, from the previous year. Another signicant change related to team expenses. The total came to pound, with and increase of just over pound, since . Within the breakdown, there was an increase of pound, for teams administration expenses from . In explanation of the increase, Danny Scullion highlighted that two members of the senior hurling management team are travelling from Dublin and there was an increase in number on football management teams. With the costs involved, Scullion stated that the situation needs monitored in future. It is predicted that the loan currently taken out to the cover the cost of development at Owenbeg is due to be paid off by next summer.

Of the  times St Pauls have hosted their highly popular minor tournament, the cup has been taken back across the Bann on  occasions. Glens four in a row stands out, Ballinderry also have four titles while last years triumph was a third success for Bellaghy, who defeated Lavey in the county final. googletag.cmd.push “We are looking forward to it, it is a great tournament and we have looked on at other Derry teams being successful,” commented Lavey manager Michael Hassan, who was recently appointed as the clubs senior manager for next season. Read also: Hassan named as Lavey senior boss...  “It seems to be very professionally run and you are up against the best teams in Ulster. Our aim at the start of the year was to get back to a county final. We did and won it, so we are in bonus territory.” In recent years, the Lavey underage regeneration has saw them back in Grade A again after a spell in the doldrums. They have begun to churn out players on school and college teams with regularity. The recent U winning team represented the first batch to make it through, which bolstered their run to the  county senior final. googletag.cmd.push The current Lavey minor team were Feacuteile champions. In recent years. back to back U championships were secured. They lost to Carrickmore in the final of the Paul McGirr tournament last year and have been successful at Oacuteg Sport. Also, this season, they won the minor hurling championship thanks to a mesmerising display of free-taking from Enda Downey to edge out a fancied Ballinascreen team in the final. In football terms, seven of the current side played in last years defeat to Bellaghy but barring Ryan McGill and Cormac Collins, the other  players expected to start on Saturday will be eligible next season. Four of the starting team, Patrick McGurk, Rory McGill, Niall Duggan and Segdae Melaugh – are currently in their first year of U. Others have dipped in and out, but the underage scene in Derry has, largely, been the Bellaghy, Lavey and Magherafelt show in recent years. Lavey needed extra time to see off Magherafelt before defeating Glen to win the first minor title since the   teams managed by current Chairman Paddy Chivers. From that group, Seamus and Henry Downey have sons now leading the Lavey attack, where Johnny McGurks two sons also feature. All-Ireland Club winning goalkeeper Brendan Regans son Louis is also in the squad. In the county final win over Glen, it was Laveys hunger on the breaking ball that gave them a  to control the game. Cormac Collins and Jamie Duggan are a formidable midfield pairing. James McGurk almost single-handedly dragged Lavey back into their U final with Carrickmore last year and he is an effective leader of the attack. Their inside line is likely to feature the Downey trio, Matthew, Enda and Callum. Matthew is likely to play up front. If Laveys midfield can win enough ball to allow Enda to play inside with him, it will be a cocktail that will pose a serious threat. In the recent Rannafast final, Calum Downey and Patrick McGurk handed more ball than most others on the park andthey can link the play from defence Lavey have the tools to break free. On Saturday, Lavey are in action against Cavan champions Drumloman Gaels, an amalgamation of Mullahoran and Ballymachugh. They come into the Ulster scene on the back of winning the Cavan U championship, therefore wont have played together as a group until Saturday. At midfield Liam Corr and the free-scoring Caolaacuten OReilly will pose a threat to Lavey, while their attack centres around Shane Tynan. Laveys defence will need to get to grips with Tynan, with the dangerous duo of Conor Coyle and Matthew McGahern the benefactors of any link play from midfield. “We are going into the unknown. Like we did every other year, we have done a biton other teams but well be concentrating on our own performance, at getting to that level we need to be at,” Hassan added. “From the Glen game, there are things that didnt go right and we worked on that at training. We are trying to concentrate at getting to a higher level than we did against Glen and see where it takes us. “In the county final, the support we had was like an extra man to the players and I have no doubt it will be the same next Saturday.” It will be eight weeks since their county final and after two weeks off, challenge games and gym work was factored in to freshen things up. “The lads have their batteries recharged. It has been a tough year and with winning the hurling and football, they needed a bit of a rest. They look fresh physically and mentality at the minute,” Hassan continued. Calum Downey had his leg strapped in the recent Rannafast final but the Lavey boss confirmed all his players will be  percent ahead of this weekend. Last year Bellaghy took much of the first-half to get to grips with Dunloy in their first game. If Lavey can do likewise in this years opener, they have the attacking power to advance to the last four. VERDICT:Lavey Lavey squad: Jack Scullion, Niall Rafferty, Shea O’Neill, Segdae Melaugh, Niall Duggan, Ryan Farrell, Ryan McGill , Cormac Collins , Jamie Duggan, Patrick McGurk, James McGurk, Rory McGill, Callum Downey, Enda Downey, Matthew Downey, Louis Regan, Joseph McGurk, Max Kuzogi, Conlan O’Kane, Jake O’Connell, Jack McKendry, Dara Young, Adam Maher, Oisin Madden, Joseph Duggan.

In the first instance, we urge all players to read in detail the full report from the GAA’s Fixtures Review Taskforce. Key principles agreed by the GPA and CPA are based upon the fundamental understanding that inter-county players are also club players and that this connection is the basis of the GAA. These are:  The club is the primary basic unit of the GAA from which everything springs. Therefore, this must be recognised in the status which club games are given. googletag.cmd.push  The inter-county game is the GAA’s biggest promotional and developmental tool. It is also the GAA’s primary revenue generator. This must be fully recognised in restructuring our national games calendar. Furthermore, both organisations are in agreement that, following the recent publication of the Fixtures Calendar Review Taskforce report, and prior to the next phase in that process which includes a series of regional seminars in which all key stakeholders will be provided with the opportunity to provide further views and feedback, there are a number of key points centred around time and governance that we mutually support and wish to highlight. googletag.cmd.push These are:  The Club Window in April May should be ened to a -week period to allow the fairest opportunity for the window to be successfully utilised.  The demands placed upon inter-county players in both club and inter-county windows will need to be governed to ensure the games training load is not detrimental to the players’ welfare.  The Club Window post the All-Ireland football final needs to be a minimum of  weeks before provincial club championships begin.  Club Windows will only work fairly for all,inter county competitions start their championships on the same dates.  There needs to be stronger adherence to provisions regarding the availability of inter-county players to clubs as referenced within GPA Squad Charters.  Bar club teams involved in provincial championships November should be used exclusively as an off season for inter-county players.  There needs to be strong governance and guidelines introduced to ensure club fixtures schedules are appropriately set out and adhered to throughout the year. “One of our core pillars is to protect the welfare of our members, statedPaul Flynn, GPA CEO. It is therefore vital that fixtures are properly governed to ensure the fundamental link between club and inter-county players is fully recognised and strengthened within the fixtures calendar. “This year we put a motion before GAA Congress to provide for a GPA representative to sit on the Central Competitions Control Committee to input on fixtures involving inter-county hurling and football competitions only, in a bid to improve the situation for our members.” “We will work towards this with the CPA, while prioritising the welfare of our members, keeping in focus the amount of games they are expected to play and amount of training they are expected to undertake.” Micheacuteal Briody, Chairman of the CPA, admitted that both the GPA and CPA have agreed the the current fixtures calendar isnt the best fit for both sets of players. “The CPA have advocated for a radical structural change to the fixtures calendar since our formation in , Briody commented. It is important now that the options for change put forward from the Task Force are disseminated to clubs immediately so that the debate can begin nationwide on what level of change is acceptable.” “We will work to ensurethis communication does happen effectively and it is criticalthat all clubs become aware of the options that are being presented and then vote for change that will alleviate the current unsatisfactory schedule.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I knew him from gigs and as a customer of Cool Discs when I worked there. More than that though I felt I knew him more through other people’s recollections of him and to deliver the eulogy I give you me and Mickey’s friends.Joe Brown said: “Derry sadly lost a man you don’t meet every day. There was nothing lying beneath, no agendas, no jagged edges. “A rock solid partner to Breige and an inspirational man of music, art and literature. I saw his band Idol Threat with The Undertones a number of times and became friends with him in the early s, going to gigs. “People were drawn to him and the inspirational effect he had on them. I heard so many bands for the first time through his record collection. I’ll always remember Mickey as a man who embraced le and had an incredible gt of bringing people together, loved a party and kept me from going sane Derry feels like a dferent place without him, every now and then nature conjures up someone very unique and special, who so many had barrels of affection for and who’ll be sadly missed by us all”.Mickey Rooney said: “His flat was always open to the outsiders, his heart was open to all no matter what creed or colour and his mind was always open to whatever experiences came his way”.Raymond Gorman said: “There was definitely no one like him, it took real guts to dress as a punk back in the day, it was a very violent time, Mickey was fearless and hated bullies. The last time I spoke to him he was enthusing about his latest music pourchases and gigs he’d been to. I think he’d be annoyed with everyone being too sad about his passing, remember him with the smile he put on your face when you met him”.Louise McIntyre said: “I first knew Mickey as a teenager growing up in the Brandywell, he was in my older brother’s class in school, I never actually got to talk to him back then as he was a quiet sort. “My earliest memory is looking across at Mickey’s backyard flat roof extension roof and seeing him lying up there with a small radio to his ear listening to his music, even then I knew he was dferent   cool. Several years later we crossed paths again and became a true friend he was doing best man at our wedding. He always remembered birthdays and special occasions. “Mickey stood head and shoulders above everyone  in more ways than one. He was an inspiration and a Derry legend. I somehow hope that he knew this, and that Derry will be an emptier place without him. Thanks for the memories Mickey xx”.Liz Brown said: “One of lasting memories Ill carry of Mickey was his genuine love and kindness towards his friends and loved ones. Like gravity, Mickey had an unseen force that pulled people together and kept their feet on the ground”.Paul McCartney paid a touching tribute in the Journal the day of Mickey’s funeral. “As the s began, you’d usually touch base with Mickey in the town centre on a Saturday. He had a band called The Idol Threats and soon the band I played in, Graffiti, ended up regularly supporting them. I don’t think I saw a local group as musically adventurous until That Petrol Emotion came along. It was a million miles apart from The Undertones and The Moondogs and Mickey was crucial to this process. He wasn’t just the drummer - he was the lyricist also.

I knew him from gigs and as a customer of Cool Discs when I worked there. More than that though I felt I knew him more through other people’s recollections of him and to deliver the eulogy I give you me and Mickey’s friends.Joe Brown said: “Derry sadly lost a man you don’t meet every day. There was nothing lying beneath, no agendas, no jagged edges. “A rock solid partner to Breige and an inspirational man of music, art and literature. I saw his band Idol Threat with The Undertones a number of times and became friends with him in the early s, going to gigs. “People were drawn to him and the inspirational effect he had on them. I heard so many bands for the first time through his record collection. I’ll always remember Mickey as a man who embraced le and had an incredible gt of bringing people together, loved a party and kept me from going sane Derry feels like a dferent place without him, every now and then nature conjures up someone very unique and special, who so many had barrels of affection for and who’ll be sadly missed by us all”.Mickey Rooney said: “His flat was always open to the outsiders, his heart was open to all no matter what creed or colour and his mind was always open to whatever experiences came his way”.Raymond Gorman said: “There was definitely no one like him, it took real guts to dress as a punk back in the day, it was a very violent time, Mickey was fearless and hated bullies. The last time I spoke to him he was enthusing about his latest music pourchases and gigs he’d been to. I think he’d be annoyed with everyone being too sad about his passing, remember him with the smile he put on your face when you met him”.Louise McIntyre said: “I first knew Mickey as a teenager growing up in the Brandywell, he was in my older brother’s class in school, I never actually got to talk to him back then as he was a quiet sort. “My earliest memory is looking across at Mickey’s backyard flat roof extension roof and seeing him lying up there with a small radio to his ear listening to his music, even then I knew he was dferent   cool. Several years later we crossed paths again and became a true friend he was doing best man at our wedding. He always remembered birthdays and special occasions. “Mickey stood head and shoulders above everyone  in more ways than one. He was an inspiration and a Derry legend. I somehow hope that he knew this, and that Derry will be an emptier place without him. Thanks for the memories Mickey xx”.Liz Brown said: “One of lasting memories Ill carry of Mickey was his genuine love and kindness towards his friends and loved ones. Like gravity, Mickey had an unseen force that pulled people together and kept their feet on the ground”.Paul McCartney paid a touching tribute in the Journal the day of Mickey’s funeral. “As the s began, you’d usually touch base with Mickey in the town centre on a Saturday. He had a band called The Idol Threats and soon the band I played in, Graffiti, ended up regularly supporting them. I don’t think I saw a local group as musically adventurous until That Petrol Emotion came along. It was a million miles apart from The Undertones and The Moondogs and Mickey was crucial to this process. He wasn’t just the drummer - he was the lyricist also. Just as the music was very involving and mysterious, so, too, were the words and song titles - ‘Lonely Beach Now, ‘Postcard from Abroad’ and the legendary ‘Little Green Men on The Moon.Mickey was a kind and generous guy, but also grateful and reciprocal for everything he received. He remembered everyone’s birthday and was always there with a card or gt. He constantly exuded a spirit of fun and that amazing sense of humour of his was just non-stop and incredible - you simply didn’t know what would come next.“Politics  He didn’t do them, and they did not happen in the many get-togethers in his legendary Abercorn Place flat. I think I can genuinely describe him as an “Enemy of Sectarianism”. When Mickey was cruelly affected by ill health in recent years, this sense of civility never eroded. So lucky are many of us for having this wonderful and inspirational human being around for many years”. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The origin tale of the lake, known as ‘The Death of Eochaidh son of Mairid’ is over a thousand years old in oral tradition, but has now been brought up to date in a new telling by children’s author, Maacuteire Zepf.Liacute Ban’s story is tale bursting with colour, from giant horses and ancient gods to mermaids and monks. It tells of a young girl who is transformed into a mermaid when a magical curse floods their ringfort, creating Lough Neagh Six Irish-medium primary schools in the Mid-Ulster area have been working on the story with Maacuteire Zepf over the past months, writing their own creative responses and drawing original illustrations for the story.The young writers and illustrators from Dungannon, Coalisland, Magherafelt, Ballinascreen, Cookstown and Tirkane then came together at the Seamus Heaney HomePlace in Bellaghy on th December for a collaborative showcase performance of their work, to celebrate the project and to hear the story told in its entirety.The story of Liacute Ban is deeply rooted in the locality of the area, mentioning local places by name. References to the legend can also be spotted in many local place names.The project has been funded by a partnership between the Irish Writers’ Centre in Dublin and Mid-Ulster District Council.Martin Kearney, Chair of Mid-Ulster District Council attended the event. He said: “The story of Eochaidh and Liacute Ban shows just how rich and deep our local culture really is. Watching the children take it to their hearts today has been a lovely experience”Commenting on the project, Maacuteire Zepf said: “It was such a joy to unearth this gem of a local story with the children and to see their intense excitement about such an ancient tale. Hopefully, we can be assured now that Liacute Ban will live on now for the next generation.”Hilary Copeland, Acting Director of the Irish Writers’ Centre added:The Irish Writers Centre is delighted to support the Liacute Ban project. Our ‘writer-led’ programme offers writers the opportunity to develop their own creative projects, making use of their skills and experience with language and storytelling. We are grateful to Foras na Gaeilge for their continued support of Irish literature projects as Gaeilge.’ googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The centre hosts the trail around our Prayer Garden which has reconstructed Celtic towers, monastic cells and a thatched church with a pellet burning stove inside.Each of these buildings in the garden has its own Christmas theme and, in the tradition of the great Irish storytellers, characters telling the Christian stories behind some of our favourite Christmas traditions. These include the story of St Nicholas, the Candy Cane, and of course the greatest story ever told, the birth of Jesus.The tranquil setting is an oasis for families looking to escape the ramped up commercialism, hustle and bustle which can dominate this time of year. Take some time together to enjoy an experience which will have the children discussing the real Christmas story long after this event.Families enjoy a guided trail under starlight and a very special dramatic piece created especially for this event and performed by young people. Children can take part in craft activities including cookie decorating while the parents can take a few moments to enjoy a hot drink and festive homemade treats in the IOSAS Centre Cafeacute whilst listening to live music.Our aim is to capture the excitement of the season and combine it with the true spirit of the Christmas message.The Celtic Garden Christmas Trail at the IOSAS Centre – the traditions of Christmas past for a wonderful family Christmas present.The centre can be contacted on  . googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Crucially, Jamie McDonagh, wanted by a number of other clubs in recent weeks, has decided to stay at the club, signing for another year.This is the most important piece of business that weve done up until this point in terms of keeping the nucleus of last years group together, he explained. Everyone here played a huge part for us last year so it was a no-brainer to try and tie everybody down at the club for this coming season. There was a lot of success last year but we need to push it on and I think to achieve success here its going to be very important that the people who were here last year and here to push us on. This gives us that feel from last year but more importantly it gives us really good players and really good people at the club for . googletag.cmd.push  On Jamie McDonagh... Its a major boost. I think Jamie was outstanding for us last year. In my opinion hes one of the top wide players in the country. Jamie filled a lot of gaps last year for us but this year I predominantly see him as a forward player. When we look at Jamie, theres no-one in the country who has a better delivery of the ball and I think theres more to come form him. Some of our biggest rivals were looking to take Jamie. I think everybody in the league knows what he brings to the table. He was fantastic for us last year so were delighted to get it over the line and this could be a big, big year for Jamie. googletag.cmd.push  On Darren Cole... Hes a class act – i said it all last year that Darren Cole is as good a footballer as there is in the county. Everything is easy to Darren Cole, I never see him out of position, out of control. Everything he does is easy for him and thats the sign of a fantastic player. Darrens challenge now is to get back into the first team squad as quickly as possible and hes shown brilliant appetite in the off-season so far. Hes fortunate that theres a couple of other young players here pushing to get fit alongside him so hell have all the support thats required to get him back playing because when Darren Cole is playing theres nobody better in my opinion in the league.”  On Eoin Toal... Eoin Toal in my opinion went from being a young player with a lot of potential to a man who was undroppable. He played every game, made very few mistakes and really matured. Ive watched him in recent weeks playing for Northern Ireland at the highest level and hes wearing the captains armband there when theres so many high level players there from Scotland and England. Eoin has gone in and taken that captaincy and really stood out. You only have to look at his performances over the course of last year because as the season went on he was getting stronger and stronger. It will be interesting to seehe stays for the three years becausehe keeps going the way hes going theres a good chance that he wont see out the contract and one of the big guns from England or Scotland could snap him up.  On Nathan Gartside... I think Nathan and Peter Cherrie are going to fight it out to be number one this year. Last year we were flogging the same players and we fell over the line. We looked tired and fatigued and using the same  or  players – This year we need a squad of  players all on a similar level of ability. Nathans application over the past ten months has probably been the best at the club in the way he trains and conducts himself. His work in the off-season and his ability and his drive to do better is superb and to have the two boys here next year will be a huge asset to Derry City Football Club. Weve a goalkeeper of  whos been about the league and we have a goalkeeper at  who is going to be about for a very long time.  On Mark McChrystal... If I was a young player now and I was looking for a figure that could inspire me to have a good carer in the game then I couldnt look past Mark McChrystal. He probably has one of the best attitudes Ive ever worked with. Lets not forget that some of the best players in this league are in their thirties and Mark has a lot to offer, both on the pitch and off the pitch, and what a fantastic servant he has been. His experience is massive because he has played at the top level. Not just that but hes a brilliant person. He demands respect and hes fitter now than he has been in a long time and thats testament to the person he is.

An economist is also helping compile the document.City deals are packages of funding and decision making powers which allow councils to boost the economy through the development of large projects in their respective areas.The deals are designed to allow councils to take charge and responsibility of decisions that affect their area, do what they think is best to help businesses grow, create economic growth and decide how public money should be spent.Newry, Mourne and Down is one of five local authorities paired with Belfast City Council, universities and theprivate sector who have

the councilrsquos Enterprise, Tourism and Regeneration Committee, politicians were told that officials have been working on the detailed outline business case since last May, with a consultancy team helping prepare the document.Council officials say that when work on the business case is completed next spring, it will provide a detailed analysis and assessment of the projectrsquos strategic fit within the City Deal.In addition, the document will also outline detailed project costs, the benefits, risks and funding requirements.Politicians were told this week that the documentrsquos analysis will recommend a particular procurement route in order to deliver the scheme.It has also been confirmed that the ongoing development of the business case involves planning considerations and the development of exemplar design and output specications, prior to any formal procurement exercise being undertaken.Politicians were informed on Monday night that the outline business case will provide detail on the technical expertise in terms of the design, construction and maintenance of similar international attractions and also provide detailed analysis of commercial operations of a visitor attraction of this scale.It is understood that council officials are working alongside Tourism NI to secure financial backing for other aspects of the tourism investment and support to move the projects through a series of key stages, including the preparation of business cases and planning approval.Other aspects of the Mournes Gateway scheme include an elevated tree top walk in Tollymore Forest Park, a new visitor centre and bird hide at the Murlough Nature Reserve and a new bridge constructed under the main Kilkeel Road at the Bloody Bridge on the outskirts of the town.Consultants appointed by the local authority to look at developing the resortrsquos visitor infrastructure have also come up with proposals for the Islands Park, with upgrades planned for existing car parks, alongside new public toilet provision.There are also proposals to reduce the the tree line in Donard Forest on the slopes of the Mournes, with a so-called green travel network which would allow visitors to hire bicycles and electric bikes to make their way round ious attractions is also suggested.The ious proposals form the core of the so-called Mourne Mountains Gateway Study and have

Someone came forward and this was welcomed by elderly people who would not be forced to travel outside the town to access services.Cllr Walker says it is vital that Ballynahinch retains its dedicated postal office and appealed to someone the townrsquos business community to consider taking over the service.ldquoBallynahinch is Down Districtrsquos third largest town and it would be a body blowthe planned temporary closure became permanent, he said.ldquoThe bottom lines appears to be thatno one comes forward to offer to run the service it will close and that will impact on people across the community.ldquoThe role of local post offices has changed considerably over recent years, with many transferring to large supermarkets which ensured that they were open for much longer, including weekends.ldquoMany elderly people prefer to conduct their business at post offices, not banks. That is one of the many reasons why this vitally important service is not lost to Ballynahinch. A number of local post offices, which provide a much broader range of services including banking facilities, are now housed in retail premises.Cllr Walker added: ldquoIt is my hope that one of the major retailers in Ballynahinch will come forward to ensure that the service is not lost to the town.

And while there is a signicant financial benefit for securing geopark status, council officials insist the benefits are not just economic.They have previously argued that geoparks have a ldquosignicant role to play in empowering local communities and giving them the opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the arearsquos signicant geological and other heritage.There are currently  geoparks found in  countries across the world, all of which have been developed using a bottom-up approach with local communities playing a signicant role in this process.Currently, there are three designated geoparks in Ireland. In addition to the Marble Arch Caves in Fermanagh, they include The Burren and Clfs of Moher in Co Clare and the Copper Coast geopark in Co Waterford.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokeswoman confirmed on Monday afternoon that the local authorityrsquos bid for geopark was formally submitted last month..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th December 2019 Publication.jpg","title":"Book delves into the history around Strangford  ","story":"INVERBRENA Local History Group has launched the latest edition of its annual magazine mdash just in time for Christmas.Memories From Inverbrena: Strangford  features a selection of memories, stories, histories and photographs of people and places within the Strangford area, preserved for future generations.The magazine includes an article by Michael McConville in which he chronicles the history of the the local parish drama club during the s and s, including a selection of photographs of local amateur actors and actresses who participated in some of the popular well received productions.In his second article in this yearrsquos publication, Michael remembers happy days potato picking, recalling how everyone worked together as a team, both boys and girls, and all getting the same pay at the end of the day.Melanie Hamill puts pen to paper to provide an invaluable record of her splendid conversion of Strangford Presbyterian Church, earning it the prestigious  Heritage Angel award for Best Rescue of a Historic Building Or Place for projects under pound million.

These included the non-replacement of clerical staff who resign and y delays in the supply of equipment necessary for class use.Mr Ellis also slammed a proposal to impose a charge for school transport and labelled it as ldquoclearly unfair.He stressed that he was not taking the negative attitude that all cuts are bad.

He was very young and had been badly neglected. He had been kept in a confined space or a very small pen. Sony was very loving. All he wanted was to be loved and he thrived on attention.ldquoHe was a huge dog but very dirty. When we gave him a bath his coat came up lovely and white. We got him started with his first round of vaccinations and our followers stood by us financially.Monica works closely with Corran Kennels, on the Tobercorran Road outside Downpatrick, who come to her for helpthey need a puppy or dog re-homed, and Animal Connexions, based at Nutts Corner outside Belfast.Monica said: ldquoRecently a litter of  kittens were about to be euthanised and we managed to be able to find homes for all of them within a short period of time.Monica added that she has her own account with the two branches of Castle Vets in Downpatrick and Castlewellan and pays for any necessary medical attention abandoned pets may need out of her own pocket.ldquoMembers of the public are so good. When we put up an appeal on the page that an animal requires surgery or medicine they phone the vets and give money and it comes off the bill.ldquoI am so grateful to everyone. It can be tough going and running something like this takes a big chunk out of your le, but our team of volunteers are thankfully very enthusiastic.ldquoAnyone can follow the page. Just ask to join the group through the socialmedia network and followers will be able to keep up-to-date with what we are doing.Lana King, from Burrenreagh, is a volunteer with the not-for-profit organisation.She said: ldquoWhile the main aim of the page back in  originally was to reunite owners with their pets, there are times when nobody comes looking for a little lost one and thatrsquos when Monica goes beyond the call of duty and ensures they have a second chance with a new family.ldquoShe gets to know the potential owner, carries out a home check and follows it up. There is nothing she loves more than to hear how the pets she has helped to re-home or re-habilitate are doing.Lana added: ldquoMonica really is the back bone of Lost Found Pets South Down and has gained the admiration and respect from anyone who comes into contact with her.ldquoNothing is ever too much bother for her.ldquoShe has devoted her le to animals and makes sure every pet that comes to her receives the very best of care.ldquoEven though Monica suffers with a debilitating disease called lupus, she just gets up every morning and gets on with it.ldquoHer sharp wit, sense of humour and contagious laugh lts the spirits of people who are going through the heartbreak of having their pet go missing and reassures them because they know Monica will do everything she can to reunite them with their beloved pet.Lana added: ldquoMonica helps those pets who have found themselves either lost, abandoned, abused or simply not having a loving home to call their own..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th December 2019 Health.jpg","title":"Health workers take  industrial strike action  ","story":"HEALTH workers in Downpatrick took strike action last Friday ahead of a series of protests calling for pay parity and adequate nursing numbers.Nurses were working to rule yesterday and today at the Downshire and Downe Hospitals while a joint strike planned between their union, the Royal College of Nursing , and Unison, will be held next Wednesday.Hospital and outlying district services will be impacted as the strike will run from am until pm mdash unless a deal is done before that.Unison and the RCN are demanding equal pay for its members in line with UK counterparts and for increased nurse recruitment to protect patients in a failing health service.Domestics, porters, catering staff, administrative staff, dental nurses from all wards and departments in the Downe and Downshire Hospitals and outlying facilities will join nurses who have voted to strike for the first time in their -year history.Public support was high for health workers, including nurses from the Down Outpatients Department, who took part in Fridayrsquos strike.Hundreds of Unison members joined the picket in the morning and afternoon at Downshire Hospitalrsquos entrance with local drivers sounding support as they passed.The impact of the action closed the Outpatients department at the Downe Hospital, along with the Ulster Hospital, Lagan Valley, Ards and Bangor Hospitals.The Community Dental Service was impacted with the cancellation of the Ballynahinch clinic and two clinics at Downe Hospital on Friday afternoon.The impact was widespread for patients as day case surgery, ENT and gynaecology at Lagan Valley Hospital was cancelled along with the closure of the Medical Day Case Unit, Dermatology Laser Unit, Cath Lab and Ambulatory Hubs at the Ulster Hospital.The South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust said that that all affected patients had been contacted and would be rescheduled for appointments at a future date.Staff from the Downshire Hospital were strengthened by colleagues from the nearby Downe, who joined the picket.Unison members who work in the transport and domiciliary care went out on strike from am- noon while the rest of the workers came out from pm-pm.South Down MP Chris Hazzard and SDLP election candidate Michael Savage showed their support as did SDLP MLA Colin McGrath and Downpatrick councillors Oonagh Hanlon and John Trainor.Unison branch secretary Marian Ritchie called on all the elected representatives present to give members more than a show of support.She told cheering strikers: ldquoWe want every politician here now to give a commitment to say, as iniduals and as a group, that every single one of the the health service staff will get a pay rise and pay parity.The call was met with shouts of ldquoGet back to work by the strikers.Ms Ritchie also told her colleagues: ldquoThe Permanent Secretary says that he has the money but not the authority and the only ones that have the authority are the politicians.

McIlhone won the ball off a Ballynagross defender and without even looking up let one fly from  yards out.Goalkeeper Ross Preece was stranded in no manrsquos land and his despairing outstretched attempt to tip the ball over the crossbar failed as the ball nestled in the back of the net.Two minutes later, man of the match Ross Armstrong made it -. He chased a lost cause of a ball into the box where Marron and Preece were favourites to win the race, but Armstrongrsquos sheer desire helped to get him to the ball first and he was able to dink it into an empty net.With  minutes gone Armstrong pounced again to make it - after McIlhone had carved out the opening.Killough continued to bombard Ballynagross with everything and anything, but Ballynagross bravely weathered the storm and gradually started to create chances of their own.With  minutes gone they patiently worked an opening for Ryan McKinney, but he was denied a goal when the impressive Sean Og Burns got back to hack the ball off the line.That was as good as it got for Ballynagross as Killough made it - three minutes later. Gareth George picked the ball up from a Ben McLaughlin throw and immediately set off on one of his trademark, penetrating runs.George had only one thing on his mind after leaving three players for dead and his unerring finish into the bottom corner had Preece clutching at thin air.Six minutes later it was - when Armstrong headed a free back across the box and McIlhone had all the time in the world to send Killough into delirium.With  minutes gone a delightful cross from Adam George was met perfectly by Armstrong and the big striker powered an unstoppable header to the net to make it -.Some of Killoughrsquos play in the first half was breathtaking and few teams could have lived with them and as the players trooped off at half-time, everyone feared for Ballynagross.However, the break gave Campbell the chance to reorganise his troops and the were a dferent proposition in the second half.Marron pulled one back from the spot after Sean Og Burns took down Philip Doran in the box, but despite creating several other chances, that was it for Ballynagross.Eoin Rooney and Conor McCarron had shots well saved by Killough lsquokeeper Eddie Hinc, while Liam Graham headed over at the other end and Preece saved from Gareth George.Killough were a pale shadow of the side that lit up Binnian Park in the first  minutes, but they can be forgiven for taking their foot off the pedal after taking a - lead.Ballynagross can only reflect on what might have been, had they been able to field at full strength, but football can be a cruel game as they found out on Friday night.Killough: Eddie Hinc, Matthew Burns, Ben McLaughlin, Colm Stranney, Sean Og Burns, Matt McKiernan, Gareth George, Adam George, Tony McIlhone, Ross Armstrong, Riain Burns: Subs: Liam Graham, Seamas Tumelty, Ryan McIlhone, Robbie Hagan, Ruairi Sharvin.Ballynagross: Ross Preece, Deaglan Craig, Tom McNeill, Aaron Beattie, Conor Marron, Conor McCarron, Karl Johnston, Mark Magill, Daniel Taggart, Declan Dowie, Ryan McKinney.

Over the past year, the level of recycled waste has increased by %.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran hopes the work to provide mains power to the new Flying Horse Road facility is completed as soon as possible.ldquoI do not know why there is no mains power but it is a little embarrassing that the CCTV cameras at a poundm centre cannot be operated and we have had to hire in a private security firm, he said.ldquoThis represents an additional cost to already hard-pressed ratepayers and I hope that we are talking about days, not weeks, for the mains power to be supplied. It is an issue council officers need to be on top of.Cllr Curran said that many people were keen to see the new centre opened, given that its predecessor at nearby Cloonagh Road was struggling to cope with the huge demand being placed upon it.He continued: ldquoIt is great to have such a modern recycling facility on our doorstep to meet the needs of people who are clearly recycling their waste in increasing numbers. The new centre is being well used and the council deserves credit for this major investment but, in my opinion, the mains power issue should have been sorted before it opened for business.Cllr Curran said that given the increased emphasis on recycling, the council is behind innovative plans to allow groups and charities across the district to reuse ious items dumped at household recycling centres in Downpatrick, Castlewellan and Ballynahinch.He added: ldquoA number of groups have expressed an interest in taking part and I have no doubt that this scheme will be a success with ious items destined for the scrapheap given a new lease of le.A council spokeswoman confirmed that the recycling centre was operating without mains power.ldquoIt has taken longer than anticipated to connect the mains power supply at the new site, said the spokeswoman.ldquoAs a temporary measure, a generator and security firm are being used to cover requirements. Newry, Mourne and Down Council is working to have the mains power installed as soon as possible.The Recorder asked the local authority how much it is paying the security firm to police the new civic amenity site outside its normal operating hours but was not provided with an answer..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th December 2019 Leitrim.jpg","title":"Sr Bartholomew’s centenary celebrations  ","story":"THE family of a Leitrim nun, who has lived in Africa for  years, flew thousands of miles to help her celebrate her  birthday.Sr Mary Bartholomew was joined by five nieces, including Dympna Kelly and Eileen Ramsey from her home village, who arrived in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, to mark her milestone birthday last week.Another niece, Mary McAleenan, from Slievnaboley, near Leitrim, who wasnrsquot able to make the journey, says her aunt had been on an adventure since she left home in  on board the Warwick Castle to care for ldquothe poorest of the poor amid the soaring heat of South Africa.Sr Bartholmew, was born Philomena Cunningham on December , , and enjoyed growing up with her four sisters and three brothers on what is now known as Kilnhill Road in Leitrim.She and her older sister, Mary Bernadette, who also became a nun, were among the first girls to play camogie in Leitrim before an official team had even been set up by the local Fontenoys GAA club.She was educated at Sacred Heart Grammar School in Newry and with her heart set on a religious vocation she entered the Assumption Convent in Ballynahinch just as World War II began.Her niece, Mary, said that being a nun in those days brought honour to a family and having two daughters as nuns set the Cunninghams apart within their small rural village.ldquoThere were nine other postulants accompanying Sr Bartholomew on the long voyage across to Africa. Her ship was the last passenger ship to sail to the continent for many years, as most ships were then commissioned for the war effort, Mary explained.The young nun swapped the green fields and rain of home for the blistering heat and bustle of Grahamstown in the Eastern Cape, which must have been quite an experience.She completed her religious formation and academic teacher training before taking her vows in . Over the following decades she taught in several schools. Eventually, on retiring, she was assigned a new mission, opening a clinic and a pre-school within an encampment that catered for over , refugees fleeing the horrors of the Mozambique war.In Sr Bartholomewrsquos own words of this period in her le, recorded in a book written over  years ago, Drumgooland ndash A Parish Divided, she recalls: ldquoWith missionary zeal we did our utmost over the following years to render whatever assistance we could to the many thousands of refugees, I taught including adults.ldquoThese poor people had a minimum of education and were eager to learn English. After class we would sit around and read the bible in Shangaan, the local language, and gave help when it was needed.Niece Mary takes up the story again. She added: ldquoNuns donrsquot retire and while Sr Bartholomew found the intense heat too much after several years, she made for the cooler environment of an office and spent time in general admin.Sr Bartholomew would often make the trip back home to Leitrim after Vatican II came to pass when the rigours and discipline of a pious le became more relaxed in the s. However, she was always looked forward to going back to Port Elizabeth.Her last trip home was some years ago when her older sister, Eileen, was seriously ill.ldquoShe had managed to hold her hand and chat briefly before she passed away, Mary recalled. She stayed until Eileenrsquos months mind,and left shortly after.

Election. PA Photo.- StrangfordThe DUPs Jim Shannon was re-elected MP for the Co Down constituency of Strangford with , votes to spare in a wave of unionist anger at Boris Johnsons Brexit strategy.He said it was a vote of opposition to the Prime Ministers proposed deal over concerns it would create a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Mr Shannon delivered his maiden speech to the House of Commons in the Ulster Scots tongue when first elected in .On Friday, he said: \"The union has been degraded and downgraded by Boris Johnson.\"He would take your alsatian dog for a walk, he would come back an hour later and give you a chihuahua and tell you it was all right.\"He said they needed to convince the British premier of the importance of the union, and claimed the DUPs numbers in the next Parliament would give it influence.Mr Shannon added: \"We will do our bit to make sure that the union, for those who live in Leicester, London, Manchester, Newcastle or wherever  in the UK, also is the same for the people of Strangford and the people of Strangford have told me that.\"His closest rival, the cross-community Alliance partys Kellie Armstrong, said Northern Ireland deserved a restored devolved government.She said: \"We have a health service that is falling apart, we have education that needs reform, we have infrastructure that is in a desperate state of crisis and it is time for the Assembly to be back.\"She added: \"We have had enough, you have had enough and it is time to move on.\"- West TyroneIn an unsurprising victory, Orfhlaith Begley raced across the line to claim the West Tyrone seat.In an election that saw , votes polled, Ms Begley won the seat with , votes.It was expected that the Carrickmore woman would hold to the seat, which has been in Sinn Feins hands since  after Pat Doherty was elected.The -year-old is the first woman to hold the West Tyrone seat.She was selected by Sinn Fein to contest the by-election in  after Barry McElduff stepped down from the seat following a controversy over a video he posted to Twitter.The turnout for West Tyrone was .%, slightly more than the by-election which saw .% of the electorate cast its vote.Speaking after her win, Ms Begley said: \"This was a crucial election, the election of a generation and clearly people wanted their views heard in terms of Brexit.\"This is a border constituency that rejected Brexit in the referendum and people came out again in this election to once again reject Brexit.\"People have been very energised in terms of of this campaign and people came out in their thousands to reject Brexit but also to reject Tory austerity.\"They sent a very clear message that they see their future in a new Ireland for all.\"Sinn Fein has made its voice count where it matters, in terms of Brussels, we have been there, in Dublin and we also travel to London on a regular basis.\"We gave a pledge in  that we would ensure special status for the North, we would protect the Good Friday Agreement and the all Ireland economy and we have delivered on all three of those.\"-North BelfastSinn Feins John Finucane has declared North Belfast has rejected Brexit after winning the seat from incumbent, the Democratic Unionist Party deputy leader Nigel Dodds.Mr Finucane triumphed following a tight contest with Mr Dodds taking the seat with , votes ahead of his rival who finished on , votes.The Sinn Fein man, who benefited from a pro-Remain alliance with the SDLP and Green Party who stood aside in support of him, said his victory was a rejection of Brexit.\"I want to thank each and every person who came out to vote for me today and I also want to acknowledge here tonight that there were those who stretched themselves and I know that this election was an election that transcended party politics and I know that I was very much the beneficiary of that today,\" he said.\"I think this election is about the future of North Belfast, we saw the threat of Brexit and what that meant for the people of Belfast, we saw the threat to our economy, the threat to our childrens futures and I think that message, that remain voice that was heard in  was amplied beyond recognition again tonight.\"North Belfast rejects Brexit, North Belfast is a Remain constituency, North Belfast wants a future as part of the European Union and I think that is hugely signicant.\"He added: \"As an MP I pledge to you all tonight that I will work for every single person in this constituency whether you voted for me or not.\"Referring to Sinn Feins policy of not taking seats at Westminster, Mr Dodds said he \"regrets North Belfast will be left unrepresented in the House of Commons at a challenging time\".The DUP man who had held the seat since  said: \"As far as Brexit is concerned, it is very clear now that Brexit is going to happen with Boris Johnsons predicted majority and it is very very important that the Northern Ireland Assembly is got up and running as quickly as possible so that the Northern Ireland Executive and politicians can have a role in that going forward. But Boris Johnson needs to understand that we must have a Brexit that ensures that it protects the integrity of the United Kingdom and is the best deal for Northern Ireland and that is something we will continue to work with the Government on in the days ahead.\"- Mid UlsterSinn Feins Francie Molloy has comfortably retained his seat in Mid Ulster with .% of the vote.It is a seat the party has held for  years, with former deputy first minister Martin McGuinness the MP from  until  when he was replaced by Mr Molloy in a by-election.With , votes polled, Mr Molloys share is down slightly since the  election when he won .% of the vote.He said: \"This was a Brexit election. Brexit has wrecked the entire political process and it is going to wreck the Union as well. The one certainty for us toto the European Union is Irish unity. Thats the open door we have to Europe and I would hope to continue that as soon as possible.\"As in the  election, Molloys nearest rival was the DUPs Keith Buchanan, whose vote decreased to ,.Mel Boyle of the Alliance Party increased the partys share from .% to .%, while the SDLPs Denise Johnston increased her party share by .%.Turnout in Mid Ulster was .%.- East LondonderryIn one of the most unsurprising victories of the night, the DUPs Gregory Campbell has retained his seat in East Londonderry.With a lions share of the vote at ,, Mr Campbell was ed comfortably.\"When those who try to analyse and say votes are down, I hope they will look at the vote we got in East Londonderry and see that our majority is up,\" he said.\"Thats because the people here want a hardworking, effective hard hitting MP who doesnt pull any punches and thats what they will get in the next few years.\"We will wait to see the outcome, and hopefully all parties commit to get back to Stormont to make this country the best country in the United Kingdom and make it a much more prosperous country weve had in the past.\"Speaking before his win, Mr Campbell said the onus was on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to deliver on his brexit promises, adding: \"Well, whatever majority Boris has there will be an onus on him to deliver on no checks east-west and an even bigger issue on how does he preside over the UK, Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and how does he cement that and build that for the future.\"In my view, he has to do that on an economic basis, so that people here and in Scotland see a tangible benefit of staying in the UK, and then people will want to stay.\"The incumbent Mr Campbell romped home against newcomer SDLP candidate Cara Hunter on ,, who pipped Sinn Fein to the post for second place by just  votes.Also running against Mr Campbell was Richard Holmes, UUP, Sinn Feins Dermot Nicholl, the Alliance Partys Chris McCaw, and from newly-formed Aontu party Sean McNicholl.- FoyleWhat was initially thought to be a tight race saw the SDLPs Colum Eastwood win back the Foyle seat from Sinn Feins Elisha McCallion with a huge majority.The SDLP will be celebrating tonight after garnering , votes, against Ms McCallions ,.Ms McCallion was previously elected in  from Mr Eastwoods colleague Mark Durkan by the tightest of margins with only  votes, in what is historically an SDLP heartland and the home of former leader John Hume.It was clear from early in the evening that the SDLP were due to make something of a comeback in Northern Irish politics, as Mr Eastwood and his colleague Claire Hanna were both predicted for victories.It was made even clearer when upon her arrival to the Magherafelt count centre, Ms McCallion congratulated her rival before the votes had even been called out.\"Keep it up,\" she said as hugged Mr Eastwood.Mr Eastwood said that he was keen for Northern Ireland to \"get back to work\".\"I want to especially thank the people of Derry, I think they have sent a clear message, roared that message to all of us in politics today,\" Mr Eastwood said during his victory speech.\"This is a story about the revival of the SDLP but its more about the message and desire of the people of our city and the people of the north generally.\"We hear you loud and clear, we know you want someone to go to Westminster to fight your case, to stand up to Boris Johnson, to protect us from Brexit.\"You also want us to get back to work in Stormont, no more excuses will be accepted by the people of our city or by the people of Northern Ireland.\"Monday is an opportunity, lets get on with it.\"The total votes polled for the Foyle constituency was ,, which marked a .% turnout.In third was the DUPs Gary Middleton on ,.Candidates who also ran in the constituency are Alliances Rachael Ferguson, UUP representative Darren Guy, Aontus Dr Anne McCloskey and People Before Profits Shaun Harkin.- West BelfastAnother thumping Sinn Fein majority in west Belfast has sent a loud message to the Conservatives that it is time for Irish unity, ing MP Paul Maskey said.Mr Maskeys , votes in the republican stronghold was more than his five rival candidates polled combined.However, his vote was down from the , he received in , with his , majority reduced to a still sizeable ,.Mr Maskey was first elected in , having succeeded long standing MP Gerry Adams when the then Sinn Fein president resigned from the UK parliament to run for a seat in the Irish Dail.Mr Maskey thanked his family and supporters as he paid tribute to the people of west Belfast and the economic and social advances he said had been achieved in recent years.\"What it looks like in Britain is that the Tories are going into a massive majority,\" he said.\"This election and this election in Belfast sends a massive clear message to the Tories that we are not going away and our voice is going to be heard loud and clear, as it has been in England, in London, in Europe, in America and indeed on this island.\"Mr Maskey added: \"We will continue to make sure that our voice is heard.\"We have a mandate to deliver equality and respect and we have a mandate to deliver unity.\"People Before Profit leader Gerry Carroll came in a distant second in the contest with , votes.The DUPs Frank McCoubrey secured , votes, the SDLPs Paul Doherty ,, the Alliance Partys Donnamarie Higgins , and Aontus Monica Digney ,.Upper BannThe DUP have had a triumphant victory in Upper Bann as newcomer Carla Lockhart secures her former colleagues seat.Former DUP MP for the area since , David Simpson stood down and was replaced with -year-old Ms Lockhart who has been an MLA for Upper Bann since the  election.Ms Lockhart pipped opposition rival Sinn Feins John ODowd to top the poll with , to Mr ODowds ,, who also came second to the DUP in .Speaking after her victory, Ms Lockhart thanked God and her predecessor who she said she will lean on for guidance in

It boasts a unique approach to teaching vocational skills, as well as academic and sports facilities.In particular, one alleyway on the school site had seen sheds transformed into small businesses, which the pupils ran - earning qualications and gathering valuable work experience, with staff and students hoping to open it up to the public soon.ldquoItrsquos a bit like Diagon Alley, isnrsquot it  said Ms Wood. Here the school hosts its own bike repair shop, in the form of Spokes, a cafe, its own radio station - The Voice - and plans for a zero-waste food shop are well under way.Robin Hackett, head of KS, showed me around some of the buildings.ldquoThe cafe opened to our students around July time, and was fully operational and officially in September, for the new academic year, he said.ldquoIt opened at the same time as our radio station, with money generously donated from the Postcode Community Trust.ldquoNext on the agenda is our plan to open a fully zero-waste food shop. Wersquove been having talks with other similar shops around Cardf and here in Penarth, like Foxyrsquos, about how to do it.ldquoThe idea is that, because wersquore a residential school, it will give our pupils a place to shop for things like cereal, fruit, biscuits and so on without plastic wrappers or other waste.ldquoOur initial, short-term plan is to reduce our own, internal impact on the environment, butwe can get it up and running to the extent we want, we may as well open it to the local community. Imagine - popping over to the school, grab a tea or a coffee, do your food shop and get your bike serviced, all by our pupils.The pupils I spoke to were enthusiastic about opening their school to the community, and plenty of them had applied for shts in the shop and cafe.One proudly told me he had secured shts in the cafe, and while we peered through the window into the future site of the zero-waste shop, he made sure I noticed the poster for the Lego club. He was the president of it.ldquoWersquore hoping to open the shop in January, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore just waiting on the builders now.ldquoA lot of kids here struggle in academic settings, so this is all building good skills for the future. Our philosophy is, one percent change at a time adds up to a lot.We moved across the alleyway to the schoolrsquos music room.It was well-stocked with plenty of high-tech equipment, from first-class ampliers to cutting-edge keyboards. Excitingly, the school also has a state-of-the-art soundbooth on the way from Germany.ldquoWersquore looking to rent it out to local bands and others as a rehearsal and recording space, once wersquove built it up to the second floor, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore investing in better equipment, and wersquoll be holding radio production workshops with the local primaries, like Victoria Road.The school doesnrsquot just offer vocational opportunities, either.ldquoRecently a lot of pupils went to Belgium, to Ypres, said principal Matthew Burns. ldquoThe best part is they cycled most of the way there!ldquoOver five days, they would cycle a huge distance, and then ride a coach or the Eurostar partway. That way, they got all the way to Ypres, to hear the Last Post and lay a wreath.ldquoWe also put a lot of emphasis on sport, with a state of the art Astroturf we rent out to the community, and a great football team - we recently attended a tournament at Heronsbridge and only narrowly lost to the overall winners.ldquoOutside of that, our KS group are putting together a foodbox raiser for Christmas for those in need, and wersquove just had our drama and music department invited to put on a production for the Senedd.With IT suites, science labs and gymnasiums, this barely scratched the surface of what the school had to offer. Itrsquos no surprise the school has been so successful, with such close attention from its staff. As a school focussing on children with learning dficulties, the pupil number is kept low, with around  pupils attending at any one time. The largest class has eight pupils, with most having fewer.ldquoWe have around  day pupils and  at the moment in residential, staying in one of our four homes on and off the site, said Ms Wood. ldquoFor those children, we offer a  week-a-year provision.ldquoThe houses are lovely - we really want it to feel like their own home, their own bedroom, with their belongings.ldquoIt forms part of our relational approach - how we talk to our children and how we talk to each other. If we have a new pupil arrive here, the first thing to focus on is building a positive relationship with them.ldquoThe conversations are all about recognising whatrsquos going on and supporting them, in their own time.Judging by the smiles on the faces of staff and students alike, itrsquos an approach to be emulated the world over. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Sadly, these ldquowins have not been quick, yet to become a reality.Penarth commuters are still being shuttled into work each morning on overcrowded pacers, and this is simply not good enough. The new rolling stock we were promised seems many years away, when the reality is we need it now. Welsh Government need to pull their finger out and sort this out. Transport is their responsibility and they need to get a grip of the situation.The controversial Barry incinerator is a saga that seems to be rumbling on and on. I have long held deep concerns about the site, with the minister responsible for making the decision indicating almost two years ago she was ldquominded to insist an Environmental Impact Assessment be carried out.This week in the Assembly, I raised these concerns yet again, and the minister confirmed that an Environmental Statement has been submitted by the developer and is currently being reviewed. She claimed NRW are monitoring compliance throughout the testing phase, and that this is the latest position.Locally, there have been several apparently unconfirmed rumours that the site will be up and running in a matter of days, and I was disappointed the minister failed to give a categorical answer on this. I have always said the site is wholly unsuitable, and the Welsh Assembly have let local people down in their handling of this.I was very pleased last week to see a statement from Cardf and the Vale Health Board dropping controversial plans to close the Sam Davies ward at Barry Hospital. Under the proposals, the  bed ward was to close, with services transferred to the Heath and Llandough. While I welcome the announcement, they also confirmed new proposals will be brought forward this week. Given the statement did not include explicit commitment to keep the ward open, I fear we will see a rehashed version of the same plans in the near future. It has not been a good month for the Welsh NHS, with recent figures confirming wait times were joint worst on record. Irsquom calling for a cast iron guarantee from them that under the revised plans, the ward will remain open. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

That can only mean one thing – the dreaded hangover.We’ve all been there, right  That last round of tequila shots sounded like a mighty fine idea, but now it’s the morning after the night before and you are paying for it – with interest.Your head is pounding, your stomach is queasy, and it feels like something small and furry crawled into your mouth overnight and died there.Granted, the damage has well and truly been done – but what can you do about it now  How do you cure that hangover  Heck, can you even cure a hangover Well, that depends on who you ask. There’s a host of weird and wonderful hangover cure claims floating around, but the old saying ‘horses for courses’ applies here. That is to say, what works for one person may not do a thing for another.At the risk of stating the obvious, the best way to avoid a hangover is to drink less alcohol. Or none at all.It’s also a very good idea to eat a decent meal before heading out, and alternating between an alcoholic beverage and a hydrating glass of water can lessen the effects of a hangover.Assuming, though, that all that sage advice went out of the window last night, here’s six hangover cures to try.A hearty bowl of soupOkay, so this is only a good ideayou can still stand straight, but Austrians swear by this method.When you’ve had a skinful of booze, grab a big bowl of goulash soup before heading to bed.It will prevent the alcohol soaking further into your bloodstream, and is always a better idea than that kebab you were craving at am.Eat a protein breakfastDr Andrew Irvine, who published How To Cure A Hangover, suggests a simple breakfast.“Protein, in the form of eggs, will help your hypoglycaemia , as will porridge,” he says. “The headache should ease once the blood sugar level has been corrected, then take some soluble paracetamol.”BeroccaThe Aussies, it’s fair to say, seem know a thing or two about drinking.After one too many tinnies, simply drop a tablet of this over-the-counter, nutrient-packed tablet in a glass of water.Works bestyou do the same before drinking. It may not completely cure your hangover, but it’s a refreshing pick-me-up that’s packed with vitamins.ParacetamolDissolve a soluble paracetamol tablet in a glass of water and not only will it go a long way towards curing that throbbing headache, but it will provide rehydration, which is all important. Unlike Ibuprofen it won’t irritate the stomach.Be warned, though: too much paracetamol is toxic to the liver – and it has probably taken enough of a pounding as it is. and cure your hangover\" data-s-urlclick\" news -ways-try-and-cure-your-hangover-\" data-s-el\"in article - bottom\" aria-label\"Share by email\" data-param-subject\" ways toand cure your hangover\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-fixed i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" style\"width:pxheight:px\" i-amphtml-layout\"fixed\"\" and cure your hangover\" data-s-urlclick\" news -ways-try-and-cure-your-hangover-\" data-s-el\"in article - bottom\" aria-label\"Share to Facebook\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-fixed i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" style\"width:pxheight:px\" i-amphtml-layout\"fixed\" and cure your hangover\" data-s-urlclick\" news -ways-try-and-cure-your-hangover-\" data-s-el\"in article - bottom\" aria-label\"Share to Twitter\" data-param-text\" ways toand cure your hangover\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-fixed i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" style\"width:pxheight:px\" i-amphtml-layout\"fixed\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful linksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":null,"title":"these are foods you shouldnt feed your dog christmas ","story":"Your card will now be declinedyou pay contactless five times in a row - here’s whyTributes to larger than le NI footballer Jerry Thompson who died suddenlyNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsPeopleThe ethanol in alcohol can hit an animals bloodstream faster than humans.

Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con211.jpg","title":"connaire mcgreevy brewing a burgeoning m business","story":"Posted on Monday December  by Ulster Business In the last  years Co Down man Connaire McGreevy has built his facilities management business CTS Projects into a £m firm, started a brewery, bought a bar and chaired a football club. He speaks to John Mulgrew about further growth, holding back on GB expansion due to Brexit, and why staying in the EU is the best deal we have “It’s good for the environment, businesses and people,” Connaire McGreevy tells me.He’s speaking of course about EU membership, and he’s one of Northern Ireland’s business leaders not concerned with remaining partisan on the matter, as we head into a Christmas General Election and sit with a deal on the table which would likely lead to increased costs and bureaucracy between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Connaire founded CTS Projects back in , and has developed it into a erse facilities management business, recently expanding further into the Republic – giving him reach from Donegal to Waterford, and “everything in between”.“We are an all-island facilities management company with signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland,” he told Ulster Business.“It has had signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland. We made moves after the Brexit referendum – we needed to ersy with a subsidiary.“There has been signicant growth in the Republic of Ireland, with % year-on-year. In business, it’s easy to grow from a base of nothing so we will see that normalise.”CTS began le refurbishing rundown properties, such as old social housing stock, to get them prepared to accept new tenants. That then grew and developed to include a focus on renewable heating, such as biomass boilers and solar  – focusing on energy efficiency. Around % of its work is with public sector clients, and the remainder with private companies.Those private sector clients include private office schemes in Belfast, looking after all of the main facilities management. CTS has grown into a -strong full-time workforce, with around  additional full-time sub-contractors also working for the business. And it’s on track to hit £m turnover this year.But CTS, like many other firms, has actively held back investing in new operations in GB, until there is a clear Brexit outcome.“Unfortunately we have noticed NI business opportunities have started to stagnate or decline,” he said. “A lack of an Assembly is having an impact on public sector– core maintenance, as opposed to new infrastructure development,” he says. “With private, there has been a downturn.”But he says since the summer “people seem to have found a new sense of confidence”. He says some of those who were holding back post-referendum appear to have now pushed forward with some investment.Speaking about which areas the company has grown in to, he said it has developed further into a more erse building management business.“We also expanded into fire and security in  – areas such as fire extinguishers, alarms and . We have found that energy efficiency and the environmentalis coming to the fore.” That includes areas such as battery energy storage and solar  for homes.“We have a lot of public sector clients in housing, education and healthcare. We have had local government in the past, and are actively targeting that area with new innovation.”Connaire’s own interest in decent beer drew out his entrepreneurship five years ago when he set up Mourne Mountains Brewery in Warrenpoint. On a separate note, he’s also the current chairman of Warrenpoint Town FC.“ was a passion turned into a business,” he says. “It’s exciting stuff, in terms of creating beer and marking five years. It’s still in its infancy and has been impacted by a mushroom of craft breweries.“I am still optimistic in the market, but I don’t see it growing as fast anymore. Looking at the market across the island, some may close their doors. The scale might not be there, and there are lots of larger breweries and imported beers – the consumer has so much choice. People know what they are looking for.”An opportunity also came knocking recently which saw Connaire taking on a bar in Warrenpoint, the Ye Old Ship Inn, which he says has a very personal connection.Connaire’s sister Ciara, who worked with him in CTS Projects and was a former gaelic footballer, passed away suddenly in . Connaire says she had worked in bars over the years, and the idea of taking one on was a conversation which they had.“There is vertical integration with the bar, as it’s an outlet there for us, with pop-up bars with the brewery.”But he, like many others in the brewing and distilling industry, says Northern Ireland’s licensing laws “are in the dark ages”. The main concern is that beer producers cannot sell their products to the public during a tour of the brewery, and require a drinks licence to do so.“We have a number of tourists who arrive at the doors, asking about tours and beer… it’s embarrassing for Northern Ireland. We don’t have the legislation in place. I am passionate about tourism in the area, and we have tourism projects in the mix.”With Brexit, Connaire believes the current deal from Prime Minister Boris Johnson would create a ergence down the Irish Sea, making all-island business a more attractive and palatable affair for companies here.“It’s an administrative border – paperwork, time and a cost to business,” he says. “Our plans would be going into GB to set up new company, with a small acquisition and some back office administration support. “All-island, under the deal it looks like we can have easy access, which is welcome. It’s so connected and any ergence is going to have an impact.”He said that could have an impact on foreign direct investmentas companies from outside the UK and Ireland. And Connaire says there is still no clarity of what a potential deal with the EU could look like on the outside.“It’s a waypoint in that journey and we have to be very cautious,” he said. “I personally feel we get the best deal possible being in the EU. Looking across the world, there are now trading blocs everywhere.“At this stage, in business circles, a lot of people are holding back investment to see what the trading environment is like. It’s the most uncertain period in my business journey.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20191106_8525_web.jpg","title":"leading from the front kpmgs johnny hanna","story":"Posted on Wednesday December  by Ulster Business Fresh from a three month sabbatical travelling with his family, KPMG’s new partner in charge, Johnny Hanna, sits down with Ulster Business to discuss growing an already-strong local professional services firm with global reach, developing the next generation and what’s needed to set Northern Ireland apart on the world stage Johnny Hanna’s new role as partner in charge at KPMG in Northern Ireland sees him take the helm of an organisation already in a strong position, but also one which is very much in growth mode.And with more than  years under his belt working across KPMG, he’s now been tasked with taking the next leap forward – building on its strong client base, tackling the new business landscape which lies around the corner, and growing the next generation of top talent.While a global firm, KPMG works with a host of Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes – having le-long relationships with indigenous success stories such as First Derivatives and Norbrook – while also working with global businesses with connections to the UK and Ireland.TALENTKPMG now boasts a Belfast workforce of nearly  staff. But as the intake of top new graduates and experienced hires grows, that number looks set to expand and develop further still. Johnny’s confident that the company will continue to grow at its offices at the Soloist building in Belfast city centre. He points to the benefits for KPMG staff of signicant collaboration and shared working opportunities with Dublin as part a successful all-island business now employing over  people. The firm’s Corporate Finance team, for example, led by Russell Smyth are the go-to advisors in the renewables sector when it comes to fundraising for new assets north and south.“It’s an exciting time for the firm,” Johnny says. “We have done a lot in the last few years, working with many new clients, investing in our new office and increasing our graduate numbers. In addition there has been a record number of promotions. I’ve been working closely with our previous partner in charge John Hansen on all of that as well as continuing to grow and drive our large tax team, an area of expertise which we’ve always been renowned for.“My focus will be about maintaining this momentum and ensuring we continue to offer the expertise and solutions which our clients need, which will drive our growth. That means being alive to changing trading conditions, increased regulation and a business environment increasingly uncertain, disruptive and complex”.A law graduate from Queen’s University Belfast, Johnny’s also a fellow of Chartered Accountants Ireland, and a Chartered Tax Adviser– starting his career in Dublin with the former Arthur Andersen, which was later merged with KPMG.The Newry man became a partner with KPMG in  and has been head of tax in Northern Ireland since . The tax practice boasts around  tax professionals, most of which are dual qualied in tax and accountancy. “It’s a key dferentiator for us,” he says.“And while tax and audit represent the more traditional strands of business, KPMG has invested signicantly in new skills, specialisms and services arising from technological advances such as articical intelligence and cyber-security.”Johnny takes over his role at a time when Northern Ireland, along with the rest of the UK and Ireland, is undergoing arguably its biggest business and economic sht in a generation.“Brexit is just one part of it. We have been working closely with companies to prepare for Brexit, whether there is a ‘no deal’ or some sort of deal here.“We have had a lot of engagement with business groups and other stakeholders over the last three years to highlight our concerns and those of our clients. Wherever we end up on Brexit will definitely dictate the future trading conditions. Our role will be to help clients navigate their way around any new barriers they could face, as well as examining the potential opportunities which may arise from the UK’s exit from the EU.” ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Attracting foreign direct investmentis something which cannot be ignored here, and a dferentiator for Northern Ireland could help bolster that – whether it’s a deal which moulds Northern Ireland as a unique business destination in the UK and Ireland, finally introducing a lower devolved rate of corporation tax or ideally a package of measures.“Not long after I took over the head of Tax role in  we co-hosted a breakfast in our KPMG New York office with ious international businesses. At that time there was a lot of talk around the reduced corporation tax rate. There was a lot of positivity and enthusiasm in the room that morning around the opportunity for Northern Ireland, and I’m looking forward to getting back to those types of discussions.“Northern Ireland requires a range of tools to help drive economic success in the post-Brexit era. It’s investment in infrastructure and skills, initiatives on export-led growth, delivering a .% tax rate and some sort of devolution of income tax powers – we need step change initiatives which can really turbocharge the private sector.”COMMUNITYGetting the right talent is also key for KPMG, building and developing a workforce which is increasingly erse, as well as giving back to the community. That includes a range of initiatives, including the recent launch of a skills-based scheme which has seen KPMG staff volunteering to help children, from a wide iety of backgrounds, with their literacy and numeracy skills.“Our graduates want to do more than get their qualications and service clients. They want to know that what they are doing has a broader purpose and objective. They want to know about our commitment to the local community and on environmental issues and be proud to work for KPMG”.  “We are ambitious to keep growing the practice and have a fantastic pool of talent in Belfast at all levels to help us realise those ambitions.“Ensuring we maintain the right culture within the firm for our people to reach their full potential and achieve their career aspirations is incredibly important. I was delighted we were able to add to our already strong team with the recent addition of four new partners in Ashleen Feeney, Paddy Doherty, Neil O’Hare and Dominic Mudge within our Deal Advisory, Tax and Audit teams.  “My role is to ensure that when I hand over to the next partner in charge, we are in an even stronger position than we are today. That’s the challenge and the goal but given the strong team and our market position, I know that I will relish the opportunity”.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
