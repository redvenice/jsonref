September 10, 2006. Jacksonville: Terrell Owens leaps over Donovin DaruiusSome of his fans applauded his decision, with one tweeting: ‘keep being authentic bro!!! Do not be conformed of this world.’However, others slammed his decision, with one saying on the star\u0027s Facebook page that she was ‘truly very disappointed that you will not be in Canton. The honor you have been given was deserved but I feel like you are throwing it back in their face. I’m a Grandma saying Shame On You.’Another posted that he was ‘dishonoring’ fellow inductees, Canton Ohio and its citizens.   File photo from 2012: Seattle Seahawks wide receiver Terrell Owens stands on the sidelines during the first half of an NFL football preseason game against the Tennessee TitansAnd while others begged him to reconsider, some simply congratulated him for giving so much to the sport.The hall confirmed that the former All-Pro receiver informed them he would not be on hand on August 4 for the enshrinements.\u0027We are disappointed but will respect Terrell\u0027s decision not to participate in the enshrinement,\u0027 Hall of Fame President \u0026amp CEO David Baker said.\u0027While unprecedented, the Pro Football Hall of Fame, the nearly 5,000 volunteers and the entire community are committed to celebrating the excellence of the Class of 2018 that will kick off the NFL\u0027s 99th season.Share this article\u0027As we do not want to detract from this great honor being enjoyed by the seven other members of the class of 2018 – Bobby Beathard, Robert Brazile, Brian Dawkins, Jerry Kramer, Ray Lewis, Randy Moss and Brian Urlacher – their family, friends, and fans, the Pro Football Hall of Fame will have no further comment on the decision made by Terrell Owens.\u0027Owens entered the league as a third-round pick by San Francisco in 1996 and developed into a star known for some memorable playoff appearances.This includes his winning 25-yard TD catch to beat Green Bay in 1999, his 177 yards in a comeback win against the Giants in 2003, and his nine catches for 122 yards in the 2004 Super Bowl against New England just seven weeks after breaking his leg.

Among the reasons he fell short were his being considered a isive teammate and negative presence in the locker room.Still, he received strong consideration for the hall before getting in last February, along with Moss, another standout receiver.\u0027I think T.O. actually was disappointed when he got in this year,\u0027 said Paul Domowitch of the Philadelphia Daily News, who presented Owens\u0027 case for induction and has been on the selection committee for 16 years.\u0027I think he was happier when he got snubbed and could play the part of the persecuted victim and moan on every radio talk show that was willing to bring him on about the unfairness of the process.\u0027Maybe he was worried that he would become forgotten after the induction ceremony. This way, he gets his gold jacket, but still will be remembered as the guy who told the hall to go stuff it,\u0027 he added.Another Owens supporter in the hall voting, Jarrett Bell of USA Today, has been on the selection committee for 21 years and was \u0027at a loss to understand\u0027 why Owens would decline to attend the inductions.But Bell, like Baker, stressed Owens\u0027 absence would not affect the ceremony much.\u0027Think of the other members of the class of 2018,\u0027 Bell said. He added: \u0027They deserve their upcoming honor and the celebration. There\u0027s no stain on them because someone doesn\u0027t want to show up.\u0027Think of the players who gave their all to the sport, including many worthy of Hall of Fame consideration, who will never be enshrined. \u0027Think of the family members of former players, coaches and officials – many of whom have passed away – pushing for their loved ones to receive special recognition for career accomplishments. Then think of Terrell Owens. In that order.\u0027          Terrell Owens  attends Nickelodeon\u0027s 2018 Kids\u0027 Choice Awards at The Forum on March 24, 2018 in Inglewood, CaliforniaIn a possible indicator that he might skip the August ceremony, Owens did not attend the announcement that he had been selected to the hall.\u0027All these years Owens wanted to go to the hall and was quite vocal about it,\u0027 said Rick Gosselin, a hall voter for 23 years.\u0027Now he doesn\u0027t want to go to the hall? It\u0027s kind of puzzling. ... I wonder what all of his new teammates wearing those gold jackets think,\u0027 he added.Owens did thank the 49ers, Eagles, Cowboys, Bills and Bengals in his statement and called becoming a Hall of Famer \u0027an honor to be part of such elite company. This honor is something that I will cherish forever\u0027.Although he will not be on hand to see his bust unveiled in August, Bell said: \u0027Don\u0027t think of even considering it a sad day for the Hall of Fame. The hall will always be bigger than one person.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Brexit Secretary David Davis revealed Theresa adds 2022 end date Irish border plan","story":"Bruce Springsteen\u0027s net worth revealed ahead of his Tony Awards performanceRealm Royale: All you need to knowSpandau Ballet London show announced as Ross William Wild is confirmed as new singer Pippa Middleton pregnant: When is the Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s sister due? Kids See Ghosts: Twitter reacts to Kanye West and Kid Cudi albumHereditary film trailer, release date, plot and cast revealedTony Awards 2018 host, date and nominations revealedHow to Train Your Dragon 3: All you need to know about The Hidden WorldSnow Patrol tour 2018: All you need to know about the band\u0027s UK \u0026 Ireland showsTyson Fury v Sefer Seferi: What time is the fight, what channel is it on and what is the undercard?Who is Sefer Seferi?

He is said to have bribed officials and removed enemies with almost daily contract killings with Putin\u0027s knowledge and authorisation          Putin was once so close to Barsukov (pictured) that the mobster was nicknamed St Petersburg\u0027s \u0027night governor\u0027 because he ruled the city after dark. Putin is even said to have granted his oil company lucrative petrol concessions while he was in charge\u0027I can never forgive betrayal\u0027: Chilling vow by Putin...Putin tried to kidnap me because I¿ve hit him where it hurts...Share this articleIt looks at how Putin has kept them in check and touches on what ties, if any, President Trump might have to this vast underworld.The book has led commentators to question what relationship the state continues to have with the Russian mafia figures like Barsukov, whose right arm was amputated in 1994 after he was sprayed with machine gun fire in a failed attempt on his life.\u0027Putin and Barsukov are tied to each other by blood and cocaine money, which were laundered via oil trade and other city projects,\u0027 said businessman Maksim Freidzon as the book was released.\u0027Barsukov was a sort of walking skeleton\u0027 added Freidzon, who has been exiled in Israel since claiming he himself was forced to pay $10,000 bribes to Putin in the early 1990s in order to run his business.In the book, Galeotti details how when Putin left St Petersburg City Hall, one of his first jobs inside the Kremlin was to bring down Barsukov.Putin\u0027s growing and supreme authority was challenged as Barsukov continued to push for total control of the oil industry around St Petersburg.Barsukov had become a thorn in Putin\u0027s side, \u0027the unmanageable criminal\u0027 who refused to be cowed by his former \u0027man in City Hall\u0027. He refused to go quietly, sell up, flee into exile and vanish.          As the trial into the godfather (pictured with wife Marina) continues, more lurid details about Putin\u0027s unsavoury dealings are revealed in a revelatory book by British professor Mark Galeotti charting links between the old Soviet criminal fraternity and the country\u0027s modern-day rulers          The book The Vory: Russia\u0027s Super Mafia details the origins of Russia\u0027s notorious vor-v-zakone - or thief-in-laws  and explores their rise during the collapse of the USSR and how they influence modern-day Russia. It has led commentators to question what relationship the state continues to have with Russian mafia figures like Barsukov, pictured on holiday with his family          When Putin left St Petersburg for the Kremlin, one of his first jobs was to order Barsukov\u0027s demise. The mobster, pictured playing Louis XIV of France in a Russian movie, had become a thorn in Putin\u0027s side, \u0027the unmanageable criminal\u0027 who refused to be cowed by his \u0027ex-man in City Hall\u0027. He refused to go quietly, sell up, flee into exile and vanish          \u0027Putin and Barsukov are tied to each other by blood and cocaine money, which were laundered via oil trade and other city projects,\u0027 said businessman Maksim Freidzon - who is now in exile in Israel - as the book was releasedAnd so in 2007 Putin ordered his demise. He airlifted in police commandos from Moscow in a \u0027full military operation\u0027 to grab Barsukov – then flew him straight back to Moscow where he was jailed for 23 years for ordering killings, extortion, money laundering and fraud.Commentators said Putin was showing \u0027it doesn\u0027t matter how big you are, the state is back and we can reach out and take down anyone\u0027.Unlike other criminals Barsukov has never been sent to a Siberian penal colony. Instead he has languished in high-security detention jails in Moscow, under Putin\u0027s watchful eye. He knows he will never be freed while the president remains in power.Putin\u0027s uncomfortable link to Barsukov is just one of the examples of the Kremlin\u0027s dealings with Russia\u0027s underworld cited by Galeotti in 30 years of research for his book.He charts how the mob graduated after the USSR\u0027s demise from control over the sudden explosion in nightclubs, strip clubs, prostitution and street kiosks to big time business, and ultimately controlling a string of ports, more than 100 companies.Stalin had used powerful criminals - the \u0027vory\u0027 - in Siberian jails as collaborators to control the millions of political detainees he condemned to incarceration.In return for almost running his evil gulags, these collaborators secured privileges.Yet not all hardened criminals leaders would collaborate: the most powerful were called \u0027vory v zakone\u0027, who owed their allegiance to their own codes.          Putin, pictured during his time as Deputy Mayor airlifted in police commandos from Moscow in a \u0027full military operation\u0027 to grab Barsukov – then flew him straight back to Moscow where he was jailed for 23 years for ordering killings, extortion, money laundering and fraud          Putin\u0027s uncomfortable links to Barsukov is just one of the examples of the Kremlin\u0027s dealings with Russia\u0027s underworld cited by Galeotti in 30 years of research for his book          But just as Putin crushed Barsukov (pictured second from left) so he has tamed the mafia, and deployed them in the interests of the state, as defined by his regime, according to Galeotti. \u0027The Russian mob,\u0027 he wrote, \u0027is being mobilised as a tool of foreign policy in arguably the world\u0027s first criminal political war.\u0027Endless shortages under Leonid Brezhnev\u0027s stagnation era led to a spiralling of organised crime - in many case led by these long before the Red Flag came down.When Mikhail Gorbachev defied Russian gravity by imposing curbs, these released jail godfathers took the lead in supplying banned alcohol, then laundered the profits.When the planned communist economy collapsed, the rising mafia gangs born out of these jail and gulag experiences supplied everything from consumer goods to security instead of the incapable state run by a sozzled Boris Yeltsin.A bargain was struck which destroyed the moral authority of the state: mafia rings were allowed to flourish in return for enriching apparatchiks with often stupendous bribes, but also accepting the overall control of senior state officials.\u0027This was in many ways the model for Putin\u0027s national policy,\u0027 writes Galeotti.\u0027The criminals soon realised that so long as they were discreet, so long as they cut officials into part of the action, then the state would not treat them as a threat.\u0027Today this seems normal in Russia: national and regional officials live in luxurious mansions, drive expensive limousines, and enjoy exotic foreign holidays, which bear no relationship to their modest salaries. Few even bother to ask how this happens.But just as Putin crushed Barsukov, so he has tamed the mafia, and deployed them in the interests of the state, as defined by his regime, according to Galeotti.          Barsukov was flown back to Moscow after being seized by Putin\u0027s men where he was jailed for 23 years for ordering killings, extortion, money laundering and fraud. Despite the one-armed gangster\u0027s incarceration, his Tambov gang have continued to murder in St Petersburg as they were behind this shooting of a Russian businessman in 2006  Unlike other criminals Barsukov (pictured in court in 2016) has never been sent to a Siberian penal colony. Instead he has languished in high-security detention jails in Moscow, under Putin\u0027s watchful eye. He knows he will never be freed while the president remains in power          But just as Putin crushed Barsukov - whose gang was behind this murder of a Russian businessman two years ago, so he has tamed the mafia, and deployed them in the interests of the state, as defined by his regime, according to Galeotti          \u0027The Russian mob,\u0027 Galeotti wrote, \u0027is being mobilised as a tool of foreign policy in arguably the world\u0027s first criminal political war.\u0027 Under Putin, the professor concludes, the state is \u0027the biggest gang in town\u0027. Pictured: Businessman Sergey Vasilyev murdered by the Tambov gang \u0027The Russian mob,\u0027 he wrote, \u0027is being mobilised as a tool of foreign policy in arguably the world\u0027s first criminal political war.\u0027Just as Putin has dragged the media and business to perform functions for the state so major league criminals - as well as for example hackers - have been dragooned into service.In his \u0027mobilisation state\u0027, there is also a \u0027spook crook\u0027 alliance which - assuming Theresa May is right that the Skripals were dosed in nerve agent by the Russians - may make it hard to prove exactly who was responsible: state agents or subverted brigands?And whether they were acting on specific orders or their own assessments that such murderous actions would be welcomed?Under Putin, the professor concludes, the state is \u0027the biggest gang in town\u0027.And others have branded modern Russia a \u0027mafia state\u0027.Galeotti said: \u0027Let\u0027s be honest: Russia is run by people who are stealing left, right, and centre – it\u0027s a kleptocracy.\u0027They\u0027re not doing it in usual mob ways, like shaking people down on the street corner.\u0027They\u0027re doing it through government contracts and corrupt sweetheart deals. There\u0027s a considerable overlap between how the gangsters operate and how the elite operate.\u0027The boundaries between the two are pretty permeable.\u0027As for Barsukov, he can only now expect a new jail term that will extend his incarceration possibly beyond Putin\u0027s lifetime.Resigned to a lifetime behind bars in his Moscow detention cell - said: \u0027I would have loved to go to a jail, to a penal colony, where I would be allowed to walk and breath fresh air.\u0027But I will never be allowed out of this strictest and most guarded detention centre in all Russia.\u0027They even refused to take me to hearings in St Petersburg, bringing court officials to Moscow instead.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/07/23/4D0723C700000578-5818663-image-a-5_1528410221547.jpg","title":"Michael McIntrye jokes Dublin stage show","story":"    Michael McIntyre appearing on stage in Dublin just three days after he was attacked by moped thieves          The comedian joked that he would be \u0027moving to Dublin\u0027 after the incident in London on Monday\u0027The show must go on... but I might not be there on time!\u0027...Share this articleMcIntyre was set upon near his home in Hampstead, North London on Monday in front of his 10-year-old son.Two robbers on a moped smashed the window of his £120,000 Range Rover with a hammer before making off with his watch. ‘I could have done with you lot this week, 9000 Dubliners,\u0027 he continued, \u0027Instead I was left to fend for myself.

By comparison, Brando was nearly twice his size, hitting the scales at more than 15 stone (95kg). The archives show a who\u0027s who of acting legends, all white, considered for the role including Alec Guinness, Al Pacino, Albert Finney and Dustin Hoffman.In 1963, Attenborough wrote to Guinness, asking him to play the title role, however, Guinness’s agent replied in the negative, with the actor himself following up with a derisive comment about his portly physique: \u0027I’m too big, grey, fat and blue-eyed and would sound like Peter Sellers.\u0027          Gandhi director Richard Attenborough considered a who\u0027s who of acting legends including Alec Guinness, Al Pacino, Albert Finney and Dustin Hoffman          Richard Attenborough directing Gandhi, 1982Finney (The Bourne Ultimatum and Skyfall) also declined.

Hollywood icon Marlon BrandoThe hunt continued as the director realised the idea of having a white actor play the part of the Father of the Nation would not pan out. So, instead of choosing Brando, the actor famous for such films as A Streetcar Named Desire and The Godfather, Attenborough settled for Ben Kingsley, who he had seen in Bertolt Brecht’s Baal at the Donmar Warehouse.Riverdale producer signs a $400MILLION all-cash deal to stay...Shopfitters discover chest stuffed with £1m worth of...Share this articleSir Ben Kingsley, born Krishna Pandit Bhanji, was part Gujarati by descent.

Pippa then launched the party planning online magazine Party Times, perhaps drawing inspiration from her family’s own business in the same industry.Pippa later published the book Celebrate after becoming renowned around the world following her sister Kate’s wedding. However, it did not perform well and many thought that the book did not bring anything new to the table.She has written for a number of publications including The Spectator, The Sunday Telegraph and was named the contributing editor of Vanity Fair in 2013.

He is said to have bribed officials and removed enemies with almost daily contract killings with Putin\u0027s knowledge and authorisation          Putin was once so close to Barsukov (pictured) that the mobster was nicknamed St Petersburg\u0027s \u0027night governor\u0027 because he ruled the city after dark.

He refused to go quietly, sell up, flee into exile and vanish.          As the trial into the godfather (pictured with wife Marina) continues, more lurid details about Putin\u0027s unsavoury dealings are revealed in a revelatory book by British professor Mark Galeotti charting links between the old Soviet criminal fraternity and the country\u0027s modern-day rulers          The book The Vory: Russia\u0027s Super Mafia details the origins of Russia\u0027s notorious vor-v-zakone - or thief-in-laws  and explores their rise during the collapse of the USSR and how they influence modern-day Russia. It has led commentators to question what relationship the state continues to have with Russian mafia figures like Barsukov, pictured on holiday with his family          When Putin left St Petersburg for the Kremlin, one of his first jobs was to order Barsukov\u0027s demise. The mobster, pictured playing Louis XIV of France in a Russian movie, had become a thorn in Putin\u0027s side, \u0027the unmanageable criminal\u0027 who refused to be cowed by his \u0027ex-man in City Hall\u0027. He refused to go quietly, sell up, flee into exile and vanish          \u0027Putin and Barsukov are tied to each other by blood and cocaine money, which were laundered via oil trade and other city projects,\u0027 said businessman Maksim Freidzon - who is now in exile in Israel - as the book was releasedAnd so in 2007 Putin ordered his demise. He airlifted in police commandos from Moscow in a \u0027full military operation\u0027 to grab Barsukov – then flew him straight back to Moscow where he was jailed for 23 years for ordering killings, extortion, money laundering and fraud.Commentators said Putin was showing \u0027it doesn\u0027t matter how big you are, the state is back and we can reach out and take down anyone\u0027.Unlike other criminals Barsukov has never been sent to a Siberian penal colony. Instead he has languished in high-security detention jails in Moscow, under Putin\u0027s watchful eye. He knows he will never be freed while the president remains in power.Putin\u0027s uncomfortable link to Barsukov is just one of the examples of the Kremlin\u0027s dealings with Russia\u0027s underworld cited by Galeotti in 30 years of research for his book.He charts how the mob graduated after the USSR\u0027s demise from control over the sudden explosion in nightclubs, strip clubs, prostitution and street kiosks to big time business, and ultimately controlling a string of ports, more than 100 companies.Stalin had used powerful criminals - the \u0027vory\u0027 - in Siberian jails as collaborators to control the millions of political detainees he condemned to incarceration.In return for almost running his evil gulags, these collaborators secured privileges.Yet not all hardened criminals leaders would collaborate: the most powerful were called \u0027vory v zakone\u0027, who owed their allegiance to their own codes.          Putin, pictured during his time as Deputy Mayor airlifted in police commandos from Moscow in a \u0027full military operation\u0027 to grab Barsukov – then flew him straight back to Moscow where he was jailed for 23 years for ordering killings, extortion, money laundering and fraud          Putin\u0027s uncomfortable links to Barsukov is just one of the examples of the Kremlin\u0027s dealings with Russia\u0027s underworld cited by Galeotti in 30 years of research for his book          But just as Putin crushed Barsukov (pictured second from left) so he has tamed the mafia, and deployed them in the interests of the state, as defined by his regime, according to Galeotti. \u0027The Russian mob,\u0027 he wrote, \u0027is being mobilised as a tool of foreign policy in arguably the world\u0027s first criminal political war.\u0027Endless shortages under Leonid Brezhnev\u0027s stagnation era led to a spiralling of organised crime - in many case led by these long before the Red Flag came down.When Mikhail Gorbachev defied Russian gravity by imposing curbs, these released jail godfathers took the lead in supplying banned alcohol, then laundered the profits.When the planned communist economy collapsed, the rising mafia gangs born out of these jail and gulag experiences supplied everything from consumer goods to security instead of the incapable state run by a sozzled Boris Yeltsin.A bargain was struck which destroyed the moral authority of the state: mafia rings were allowed to flourish in return for enriching apparatchiks with often stupendous bribes, but also accepting the overall control of senior state officials.\u0027This was in many ways the model for Putin\u0027s national policy,\u0027 writes Galeotti.\u0027The criminals soon realised that so long as they were discreet, so long as they cut officials into part of the action, then the state would not treat them as a threat.\u0027Today this seems normal in Russia: national and regional officials live in luxurious mansions, drive expensive limousines, and enjoy exotic foreign holidays, which bear no relationship to their modest salaries. Few even bother to ask how this happens.But just as Putin crushed Barsukov, so he has tamed the mafia, and deployed them in the interests of the state, as defined by his regime, according to Galeotti.          Barsukov was flown back to Moscow after being seized by Putin\u0027s men where he was jailed for 23 years for ordering killings, extortion, money laundering and fraud. Despite the one-armed gangster\u0027s incarceration, his Tambov gang have continued to murder in St Petersburg as they were behind this shooting of a Russian businessman in 2006  Unlike other criminals Barsukov (pictured in court in 2016) has never been sent to a Siberian penal colony. Instead he has languished in high-security detention jails in Moscow, under Putin\u0027s watchful eye. He knows he will never be freed while the president remains in power          But just as Putin crushed Barsukov - whose gang was behind this murder of a Russian businessman two years ago, so he has tamed the mafia, and deployed them in the interests of the state, as defined by his regime, according to Galeotti          \u0027The Russian mob,\u0027 Galeotti wrote, \u0027is being mobilised as a tool of foreign policy in arguably the world\u0027s first criminal political war.\u0027 Under Putin, the professor concludes, the state is \u0027the biggest gang in town\u0027. Pictured: Businessman Sergey Vasilyev murdered by the Tambov gang \u0027The Russian mob,\u0027 he wrote, \u0027is being mobilised as a tool of foreign policy in arguably the world\u0027s first criminal political war.\u0027Just as Putin has dragged the media and business to perform functions for the state so major league criminals - as well as for example hackers - have been dragooned into service.In his \u0027mobilisation state\u0027, there is also a \u0027spook crook\u0027 alliance which - assuming Theresa May is right that the Skripals were dosed in nerve agent by the Russians - may make it hard to prove exactly who was responsible: state agents or subverted brigands?And whether they were acting on specific orders or their own assessments that such murderous actions would be welcomed?Under Putin, the professor concludes, the state is \u0027the biggest gang in town\u0027.And others have branded modern Russia a \u0027mafia state\u0027.Galeotti said: \u0027Let\u0027s be honest: Russia is run by people who are stealing left, right, and centre – it\u0027s a kleptocracy.\u0027They\u0027re not doing it in usual mob ways, like shaking people down on the street corner.\u0027They\u0027re doing it through government contracts and corrupt sweetheart deals. There\u0027s a considerable overlap between how the gangsters operate and how the elite operate.\u0027The boundaries between the two are pretty permeable.\u0027As for Barsukov, he can only now expect a new jail term that will extend his incarceration possibly beyond Putin\u0027s lifetime.Resigned to a lifetime behind bars in his Moscow detention cell - said: \u0027I would have loved to go to a jail, to a penal colony, where I would be allowed to walk and breath fresh air.\u0027But I will never be allowed out of this strictest and most guarded detention centre in all Russia.\u0027They even refused to take me to hearings in St Petersburg, bringing court officials to Moscow instead.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/08/10/4D0B598C00000578-0-image-a-4_1528451951114.jpg","title":"Contractor ridiculed misspelling school road outside primary","story":"    Schoolboy error: Contractors misspelled the word \u0027school\u0027 outside of Woodslee Primary A spokesperson for Wirral Council said it hoped teachers had given the workers \u0027a detention to work on his lines\u0027.They added the contractor had been awarded \u0027top marks\u0027 for correcting its mistake on the same day.Hilarious moment man smacks himself in the face with an...Road wars!

The drum major is poised to parade in his final Trooping the Colour on a day which will also mark the end of his four-decade career in the British Army (pictured outside the Officers Mess in Munster, 1986)Drum Major Staite also leads one of the massed bands during the parade in slow and quick time - something the father-of-two agreed very few people get to do.\u0027A lot of people tell you it is great to march behind a band, but you can\u0027t beat marching in front of it,\u0027 he said.During his career Drum Major Staite said he has visited 40 of the 50 states in America, and has worked in Kenya, Northern Ireland, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iraq.It was during a posting to West Berlin on his first deployment that he also patrolled the Berlin Wall and guarded Adolf Hitler\u0027s deputy, Rudolf Hess, when he was held at Spandau prison.Quizzed on what that experience was like, Drum Major Staite who plans on retiring to Middlesbrough with his wife Fee, said: \u0027You just sat in a sanger at Spandau prison.\u0027You weren\u0027t really allowed to look into the yard, it was just a normal prison with one person in it. But driving around the Berlin wall in those days was something very, very different.\u0027Posted to Household Division headquarters in 2000, he was involved in the funeral of the Queen Mother and Lady Margaret Thatcher, the closing ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games and the royal weddings of Prince Charles and Prince William.June 9 will mark 38 years 355 days in uniform for Drum Major Staite, who described his impending last Trooping the Colour as a \u0027very special moment\u0027.He has also chosen the march the Grenadier Guards will step on to Horse Guards to, which is Wadi Al Batin - a battle honour from the 1991 Gulf War - in which he fought.\u0027Marching on to parade with the band playing Wadi al Batin for me, which is the march I chose, that will be quite emotional,\u0027 he added.Once the parade is finished Drum Major Staite said his state clothing will have to be handed back, something he said he will probably do \u0027with a tear in my eye\u0027.   Turban-wearing Coldstream Guards soldier will make history at Trooping the Colour as the first soldier to parade in Sikh headdress A Coldstream Guards soldier who will wear a turban as he parades during Trooping the Colour has said he hopes it is looked upon as a \u0027new change in history\u0027.More than 1,000 soldiers will take part in the ceremony which marks the Queen\u0027s official birthday on Saturday as the nation honours the monarch.For Guardsman Charanpreet Singh Lall the event is not only his first Trooping the Colour, but also marks the first time a member of the Coldstream Guards has taken part wearing a turban.The 22-year-old from Leicester told the said: \u0027I hope that people watching, that they will just acknowledge it and that they will look at it as a new change in history.\u0027I hope that more people like me, not just Sikhs but from other religions and different backgrounds, that they will be encouraged to join the Army.\u0027A member of the 1st Battalion Coldstream Guards, the turban he will be wearing during Trooping the Colour will be black, featuring the ceremonial cap star to match the bearskin hats.Sikh Coldstream Guard becomes the FIRST soldier to wear a...Prince Harry\u0027s stepbrother and stepsister revealed after...Former head of British forces Field Marshal Guthrie, 79, is...It\u0027s hardly Royal Ascot!

The hand-carved corporation stalls, near the high altar, were taken away a fortnight ago, and early next year the remainder of the greatly admired Victorian pews will also go. These pews, designed by architect Sir George Gilbert Scott in the mid-19th century, will be taken to a disused aircraft hangar for storage before being sold.The removal of the pews, after a long and expensive legal battle, will create a vast open space under the abbey’s spectacular fan vaulting. Supporters of the project say this will allow the abbey to host community events, concerts, exhibitions and even formal dinners, and allow the restoration of ancient ledger stones in the floor, hidden for 150 years. Critics say the pews’ removal will drastically harm the significance of the grade I-listed abbey, and much fine craftsmanship and architectural heritage will be lost.The bitter dispute over Bath Abbey’s pews is far from unique. Pews have been stripped from churches all over the country in recent years, to the dismay of conservationists and traditionalists. The idea is enthusiastically endorsed, however, by those who say such buildings must meet 21st-century needs.Bath Abbey’s £19.3m Footprint project, which will open up spaces, create a learning centre and a song school, and install a modern kitchen, lavatories and underfloor heating fuelled by Bath’s natural hot springs, involves the permanent removal of most of its pews.In the nave, about 100 pews will be replaced with Slovenian-made lightweight stackable and linkable chairs, costing £200 each. “The pews are jolly uncomfortable, especially during a two-hour concert,” said Charles Curnock, Footprint’s project director. “And there’s no disabled access. People in wheelchairs have to sit in a corner or at the back.”The removal of the pews will also allow for the crumbling floor of the abbey to be properly repaired, and ledger stones restored. Between 1618 and 1845, records show 8,499 bodies were buried under the abbey. These have shrunk and shifted over time, creating voids and dips in the floor.“We could have carried on bodging, but we wanted to do a proper job, one that will hopefully be good for another couple of hundred years,” said Curnock.Frank Mowat, the abbey’s executive director, said: “Cathedrals and abbeys are for cities and local communities. Historically, events were held in an open space here. We want to go back to our original purpose, but also make ourselves fit for future purpose.”A policy for hiring out the abbey had yet to be drawn up, but would be sensitive, he added. Having a flexible, rentable space could significantly boost the abbey’s income, much of which now comes from visitor donations. The pews will sell for perhaps £400 each, making barely a dent in its £30,000 weekly operating costs.Christopher Costelloe of the Victorian Society, which challenged the abbey’s plans, said the legal case had been “one of the most important we’ve fought for years and of course we were very disappointed by the outcome”. The ruling was made by the chancellor of the Bath and Wells diocese. This person “has a close involvement with the abbey and is appointed by the bishop,” he added. “It does not give the appearance of justice.”In a separate case, an ecclesiastical court ruled last week that the unauthorised removal of seven pews from the 14th-century Our Lady of Bloxham church in Oxfordshire – once called “one of the grandest in the country” by architecture scholar Sir Nikolaus Pevsner – had harmed its historical significance. But it acknowledged that their removal “was necessary in order to serve the wider community”.A grade II-listed church in Oldham recently won approval for a plan to remove its pews in order to meet community needs in an area of significant deprivation. St Thomas Werneth, which holds two services a week, wants to host English-language classes and a job club. Other churches have removed traditional pews to make room for parent-and-toddler groups, debt clinics, food banks and social activities.“Pews remain an important feature of many churches and are often integral to their historic character,” said Luke March of the National Churches Trust. “However, keeping churches well used for community activities and worship can require flexible seating arrangements. It’s always important that the history, and significance, of the pews in a church is understood before changes are planned, and the most important retained.”The Victorian Society acknowledged that the removal of Scott’s pews will make Bath Abbey’s space more flexible. But Costelloe said: “You have to balance that against our heritage. Now this fine craftsmanship will be lost to the public for ever.”In medieval times, most churches had no furniture: congregations stood to worship, with only the elderly and infirm sitting on stone benches at the perimeter (hence the expression “the weak go to the wall”).After the Reformation, as sermons became commonplace and sometimes lengthy, bench seating began to be introduced. Enclosed “box pews”, some with doors, curtains, even fireplaces, were often paid for by landowners and families of high social standing.In the 19th century, the Incorporated Church Building Society – which celebrates its bicentenary this year – launched a massive church expansion programme in response to a growing population and urbanisation.The vast majority of the extra 2.4 million pew spaces it created could be sat in for free. Neat lines of forward-facing wooden pews, providing a sense of order, calm and solidity, were the norm right through until the end of the 20th century. But few were as fancy as the ornately carved benches installed in Bath Abbey between 1859 and 1874, as part of Sir George Gilbert Scott’s restoration of the church.St Peter’s, Sark, is the last church in the British Isles to still have pews rented by local landowners and gentry. The £1,000 cost of building the church in the early 19th century was partly met by 40 families on the tiny island, who subscribed for pews that were attached to their tenements in perpetuity. The rent has been unchanged for many decades and now provides an income of about £5 a year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4cbf318425925f71cb05f2d4f8b21dd4077caf1/511_0_5228_3137/master/5228.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ceea8f63d5695d7de8987e3a7c59fc1","title":"forgotten buildings of britain in pictures","story":"SAVE Britain’s Heritage’s latest Buildings at Risk Catalogue, Revive and Survive, features over 100 empty and neglected buildings gathered from all round the country which need a fresh start to give them renewed life and to ensure their survival"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d2240e3925ddca31a197c77f3ebea5cbe3f84a3/0_405_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b042f0c1f5a74dbde80f241a7506bf7d","title":"the 20 photographs of the week","story":"The eruption of the Fuego volcano in Guatemala, demonstrations in Gaza, rescued cats in Syria and Sloane Stephens at the French Open – the week captured by the world’s best photojournalists"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94a86719191755e65104e889a6b566d00ce839ef/0_2_4133_2480/master/4133.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2907c3c12e7242091e4a129a9b85e104","title":"weird world cup beermats in pictures","story":"When discussing their favourite World Cup moments – Rob Green’s blunders in goal for England, John Barnes rapping – London-based graphic designers Gordon Reid and Callum Stephenson had an idea.

It was also home to a young Mary Ann Evans, better known by her pen name, George Eliot.Today, despite enjoying Grade II-listed status, the property is all but abandoned. The paintwork is cracked, its wooden window frames have been replaced with plastic, and graffiti is scrawled across the walls. An unsightly steel fence runs along one side of the litter-strewn lawn, and a large To Let sign hangs outside. Until recently, the only clue to its historical importance was a small bronze plaque above the entrance.Bird Grove became a Bangladeshi Community Centre in the mid-1970s, and it allowed free access for Eliot enthusiasts. Visitors came from as far away as Japan. But funding dried up and the centre closed.Open letters bemoaning the building’s disrepair, coordinated by Burton, have attracted some high-profile signatories. George Eliot’s biographer, Rosemary Ashton, the Bafta-winning director Giles Foster, and the screenwriter Andrew Davies, who adapted Middlemarch for the BBC in 1994, all lent their support. “But nothing much came of it,” Burton said.There is now hope that the bicentennial of Eliot’s birth next year, combined with Coventry’s future city of culture status, will kickstart a restoration project aimed at raising awareness of Eliot’s connection to the city.“We want 2021 to have some sort of legacy, even if it’s just another plaque,” Burton said, “and to raise awareness of what George Eliot means to Coventry. We do our best, but sometimes you’re banging your head against a lot of indifference.”Concerns about the plight of the house will this month see it added to a 1,500-strong database of at-risk properties drawn up by campaign group SAVE Britain’s Heritage.“Obviously, if a building doesn’t have a use, it is very vulnerable,” said Liz Fuller, SAVE’s buildings at risk officer. “It could fall down. It could be burned down. Vandals could get in. In order to survive, these buildings need a new use.”Fuller shares Burton’s belief in the historic importance of Bird Grove when it comes to understanding Eliot.“She moved in quite intellectual circles while she was there, and it was obviously a formative time of her life, though she wasn’t writing her novels at that stage.”She remains hopeful that the property could be restored and reconnected to its literary past.“If you compare it to the old photos, you can see that the character could be brought out. It could be a writers’ retreat or an education centre or a museum dedicated to George Eliot.”Bird Grove is typical of many of the properties on SAVE’s database in that it has a complicated ownership history, which has contributed to its neglect. “Maybe a property has been owned by a particular family for a long time and there’s not a lot of agreement on what people want to do with it,” Fuller said. “Or there isn’t an understanding of how to maintain it. There might be some complicated access problems. If it’s an industrial building, the economy and the demographic of the area might have changed vastly so the original use is no longer practical.”Joining Bird Grove on this year’s list of entries to SAVE’s database is the Bronte cinema in Howarth, West Yorkshire.“It’s unlisted and, for that reason, unknown and therefore a little more vulnerable,” Fuller said. “It could make a theatre or a cinema again, or some kind of cultural centre. Haworth is overrun by people on the Brontë trail, so you would think it could have some related use.” Also on the list is the Newark Corn Exchange, a grand Italian Baroque building in Nottinghamshire that was built in the mid-19th century. Once used as a bingo hall, it now stands empty and is up for sale.Another entry is a row of Victorian allotment sheds – again in Coventry. “They are very inidual, very charming, but they really need to be given a good dose of TLC,” Fuller said. “People are nervous about taking on an old building. They think it will be more expensive and complicated, which is not necessarily the case. In a lot of cases, it can be cheaper or more energy-efficient to give them a new use.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b74cb7bdf55b007c29cef5b7c852966ff179224/189_206_2290_1374/master/2290.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=151ef41b255ecf99ed9bd197528b43e3","title":"has fiction lost its sense of humour","story":"According to the judges of the Wodehouse prize, this is the worst year for comic writing in the award’s 18-year history. So why the long faces? Sam Leith explores the funny side of fiction“Is the comic novel dead?” This outstanding instance of a QTWTAIN (Question To Which The Answer Is No) greeted the news of the non-awarding of this year’s Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse prize for comic fiction. The prize – traditional bounty: a pig named after your book – wasn’t awarded because, according to the judges, not one of the 62 novels submitted for the prize was funny enough. This struck a lot of people, including me, as funny. The fact there was a “rollover prize” mooted for next year, in the form of a bigger pig, seemed even funnier.A more interesting question might have been: was the comic novel ever alive? Is there something distinctive you can point to that can be called “comic fiction”? And are those two questions, or a different way of phrasing the same one? The late Philip Roth was rightly praised for his humour – David Baddiel said he was funny in the way a standup was funny – but none of the obituaries called him a “comic novelist”. Edward St Aubyn’s Patrick Melrose novels are very funny, but you probably wouldn’t call them comic novels. AL Kennedy is extremely funny, but, again, doesn’t seem to merit the label “comic novelist”. Others seem to travel more in that direction, but it’s a matter of fine judgment where the line is crossed. Anthony Powell? Evelyn Waugh? Ronald Firbank? Malcolm Bradbury? Vladimir Nabokov? Stella Gibbons?The besetting problem with talking about this subject is that being funny is very far from a monopoly held by the comic novel. The critic James Wood raised a red flag over the whole idea of the form in his slighting review of one book he considered an example:There is comedy, and then there is something called the Comic Novel, and these are related to each other rather as the year is related to a pocket diary – the latter a meaner, tidier, simpler version of the former. Comedy is the angle at which most of us see the world, the way that our very light is filtered. The novel is, by and large, a secular, comic form: one can be suspicious of any serious novelist who seems entirely immune to the comic. But the Comic Novel flattens comedy into the bar code of “the joke” – a strip of easy-to-swipe predictability. The Comic Novel might imagine itself descended from Cervantes and Fielding, but it is really the stunted offspring of Waugh and Wodehouse, lacking the magic of either. That deprecatory note is a common one: the Comic Novel as the revolving bow tie, the novelty Christmas jumper of fiction. Not many writers self-identify unhesitatingly as “comic novelists”. “I don’t sit around all day thinking of a label to attach to myself,” Tibor Fischer says. “But people do seem to be laughing at me.” Marina Lewycka says: “It’s a label that’s stuck on me whether I like it or not.” David Nobbs (of Reginald Perrin fame) asked his publishers to remove the endorsement “probably our finest postwar comic novelist” from his paperbacks not because he was irked by “probably” but because he was irked by “comic”.If I read him right, what Wood is effectively saying is that the “Comic Novel” is a tautology presented as a unique selling point. Comedy is central to fiction because fiction shares the mechanisms of laughter itself. Most theories of humour stress surprise, or unlikely juxtaposition. Fiction is all about surprise and unlikely juxtaposition. The whole form is comic at its root – not only in its reliance on coincidence but in the basic novelistic idea that you see characters both from the inside and the outside. There is a binocularity of vision implicit in the novel, in other words: the same multiple perspective that elsewhere provokes laughter. Here’s Wood’s “way that our light is filtered”. The novel’s worldview is comic. Another word for it would be – in its large sense – irony. You’re invested in a character’s personal struggles but you also see how absurd they are sub specie aeternitatis.According to one old definition, comedy is unimportant things happening to unimportant people and tragedy is important things happening to important people. The territory of the novel is the former, even when it’s the latter. Or an alternative definition: tragedy is when I cut my finger comedy is when you fall into an open sewer and die (Mel Brooks). Novels have it both ways. The novelist David Mitchell told me years ago, and I think he’s right, that the difference between great writers and very good ones is that all the great ones are funny. Samuel Beckett: nihilist or barrel of laughs? Chekhov: tragedian or comic playwright? (Fun footnote: when George and Weedon Grossmith’s The Diary of a Nobody became popular in pre-revolutionary Russia, the Russians are said to have thought it was a tragedy in the Chekhovian mould.) The novel’s very origins are, famously, comic: head back through Charles Dickens to Jane Austen and Laurence Sterne and Tobias Smollett and Henry Fielding and Jonathan Swift and the picaresque bits of Daniel Defoe in the direction of Don Quixote wave at Geoffrey Chaucer (we can argue over Samuel Richardson – I think he’s very funny but there is a case that he’s the inventor of the non-comic novel in English and therefore something of a mould-breaker).But whatever the underlying place of humour in the mechanics of the form, it’s fair to say there have been swings back and forth in the extent to which humour is foregrounded in the material. Fischer argues that “until the late 19th century when the French and Russians came in and made the novel the premier vehicle for the expression of the soul, the novel always had something of light entertainment about it. It wasn’t seen as serious literature till you got to Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy and Flaubert.” And to each action, a reaction. Perhaps until the novel started being serious there wasn’t any need for the Comic Novel as a distinct entity.But, for a while, an entity it became. A few years back, Jonathan Coe argued that the modern comic novel started in 1954, with Kingsley Amis’s Lucky Jim – and that it set the template for much that was to come. Coe pointed, in particular, to the blokiness of that book its declared interest in “difficulties with girls” and noted lack of interest in “difficulties suffered by girls”. That’s worth attention. When “comic novelists” are discussed, most of the names that come up are men. Helen Fielding and Lewycka have been the only two outright female winners in the 18-year run of the Wodehouse prize (Hannah Rothschild, joint winner in 2016, makes it two and a half), and though 2003 had a two-thirds female shortlist the winner was a man: DBC Pierre. Marian Keyes said at the Hay festival last weekend: “The one thing I have a grudge about is the Wodehouse prize for comic writing. I have never been shortlisted. Say what you like about me, my books are funny, they are comic. What else do I have to do to qualify?”You might think of Keyes, Nora Ephron, Beryl Bainbridge, Sue Townsend, Nancy Mitford, Richmal Crompton, Alice Thomas Ellis, Nicola Barker and Nina Stibbe when you think of comic fiction. But it is more often male writers who are cited as being squarely in that tradition: Mark Twain, James Thurber, Carl Hiaasen, the Grossmiths and Saki, Steve Toltz and Pauls Murray and Beatty, Joseph Connolly, Christopher Brookmyre and Tom Sharpe, Ben Elton and Stephen Fry, Douglas Adams, Jonathan Ames and both Amises, Howard Jacobson and Michael Frayn, and so on and so on.“The long-standing domination of literature by men and the male point of view is (thank goodness) on its way out,” Coe says now, “and I think that may have something to do with why the ‘comic novel’ seems to be fading: the term somehow carries a whiff of the bar room and the gentlemen’s club – it all feels too gendered and out of date. But I’m sure comedy in fiction will be – perhaps is being – reinvented, and women writers will play the leading role in that.”As well as sexual anxiety, a lot of the mainstream of comic fiction has been about social anxiety. The Lucky Jim strand is, as DJ Taylor puts it, one that foregrounds what he calls “Richard Hoggart man”: “These characters are making their way on brainpower but find themselves in situations where brainpower isn’t enough” – and the comedy arises from their rage at being socially inferior and intellectually superior at the same time. Here are the grammar school generation fallen among idiotic old duffers Funny Young Men. And the mid-to-late-20th-century social setup that gave that generation its rocket fuel has changed. Yet of course Fielding, Austen, Thackeray, Trollope, Dickens – before they knew they were writing “comic novels” – also made social anxiety and class ambition engines of comedy.And there we return to the difficulty of definition. The comic novel might be one of those things, like a highly reactive element never found in its pure form, that you can’t isolate many unalloyed examples of – but you can detect everywhere in admixture. Wood may not think the victim of his review did it as well as Waugh or Wodehouse, but he admits that those writers have something imitable in common – and that done well it can be “magic”. What are its elements? I’d suggest they are a nudge northwards on the sentence-level chuckleometer, a more than usually hectic way with plot and a more than usually cartoony way with characters, or at least a willingness – as Dickens did – to splice two-dimensional characters in with their more rounded counterparts.There is an associated quality that flows from this, perhaps, to do with the extent to which you see the author pulling the strings. If one pole of literary endeavour can be seen as a sort of extreme naturalism – contriving to present characters and situations with the illusion of an author reporting on, rather than creating, a situation – comic novels inhabit the antipole. You delight in (or, if you’re James Wood, grind your teeth at) the presence of the author: the unlikeliness of the situations, the showy dance moves in the prose. Coe talks of “the comic novel’s wilful artificiality” Taylor talks of “stage management”. Done badly it descends into jocularity and contrivance done well it is, indeed, magic.And as if in rebuke to the Wodehouse prize, the Pulitzer this year found just such magic in Andrew Sean Greer’s Less. “Finally, a comic novel gets a Pulitzer prize,” announced the Washington Post.But is that an outlier? Are the times simply too dark and too absurd in themselves for comic fiction to flourish? Is it impossible to make bad taste jokes when the news is a bad taste joke? There is a final canard to add to our duck soup: that comic novels are generally “light” or “escapist”. That is a drastic under-reading. Thomas Pynchon wrote a comic novel about the V-2 bombardment of London. Kurt Vonnegut wrote a comic novel about the firebombing of Dresden. Joseph Heller wrote a comic novel about the futility of war. Apartheid-era South Africa was what got Tom Sharpe started. For Fischer, it was Hungarian totalitarianism. Lewycka took on Ukraine’s Holodomor. Shalom Auslander took on Anne Frank. Ian McEwan’s most ostentatiously comic novel, Solar, had the prospect of planetary extinction as its backdrop. And, of course, depressions and recessions of every kind are fertile ground for comic fiction. Coe’s breakthrough What a Carve Up! made hay with the dark side of the Thatcher years. The Great Depression gave us Nathanael West and Damon Runyon among others. And Miriam Toews’s wildly, sob-makingly funny All My Puny Sorrows was a comic novel about her sister’s suicide. We can already see comic fiction responding to our own era – Jacobson transposing Donald Trump into fairytale in Pussy, for instance, and Coe working on a contemporary novel in his Rotters’ Club series.Of course, comparisons are odorous. And the most odorous of all is perhaps Wodehouse himself. As probably our language’s pre-eminent comic novelist, it may be natural that he should give his name to a prize for comic fiction – but he is a bit of a red herring in the history of comic writing. He’s close to sui generis. He doesn’t seem to articulate, except glancingly, the political satire or the social anxiety that fuels most comic fiction. There’s pure sunshine in Wodehouse. Taylor calls him a one-off: “He created a world of his own.” Coe calls him “the elephant in my comic room”. As Fischer says: “Wodehouse was a particular sort of light comic novelist – a sort of good-natured comic sensibility – and I can’t think of anyone who still does it in that way Pratchett, maybe, but he’s gone, and Douglas Adams, perhaps. Most comic fiction uses darker and crueller jokes.” He adds: “Just because you’re funny doesn’t mean you’re not serious.”So to see comic fiction as generally escapist – or generally Wodehousian – is to ignore most comic fiction. It is, rather, more often a slant way of approaching serious things. The Comic Novel may be a faltering proposition, if it was ever a proposition in the first place .But is comic fiction dead? Don’t make me laugh."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30256a862d5380e096a7d3c7b19024cc44250b35/0_163_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7794427eb20768cfde07633a516703aa","title":"uk railways great timetable fiasco whats gone wrong","story":"For hundreds of thousands of commuters, a rail timetable change will never seem innocuous again. Before the schedules were switched three weeks ago, plenty of people had predicted teething troubles: train companies had spoken of the logistical challenge ahead, and commuters were told to expect some initial disruption.At the time, Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), a key commuter franchise that runs a sprawling array of routes from Brighton through London to Luton and beyond, seemed to have put recent problems behind it. There had been warning signs on Northern, which covers cities including Manchester, Liverpool and Newcastle. But still, the sheer scale of cancellations, delays, confusion and misinformation that arrived with the new timetable came as a shock.One rail grandee had predicted problems. But Sir Michael Holden, a former boss of East Coast, said the chaos had surprised him. “Never in my worst nightmares did I imagine it could conceivably be anything like as bad as it is,” he said. Nigel Harris, editor of trade magazine Rail, said it was “the most chaotic, fundamental and humiliating failure it has been my misfortune to witness in 40\u0026nbspyears as a rail journalist”.What had been billed as a boost to services instead saw thousands cancelled: plummeting punctuality statistics for GTR and Northern masked even greater local problems. In some peak periods on the Manchester-Preston line, or on Thameslink mainline trains, two in three trains were failing to run at all. Instead of a few days of hiccups, it swiftly became clear weeks of convulsions were ahead, with emergency timetables being introduced to slash services and stem the chaos.Around 8,000 services on GTR have so far been cancelled or severely delayed, while some 5,000 Northern trains have suffered the same fate since 20 May – excluding two days of strikes when 2,000 trains were pulled in advance.As the cumulative fury of commuters swells into a political crisis, how did this self-inflicted disaster come about?This blow to the reputation of England’s railways came, ironically, at what should have been a moment of triumph. Instead of the usual twice-yearly tweaks, the national timetable was to undergo wholesale revisions to take advantage of new technology, new trains and years of engineering work. The Great North Rail project, which included electrification and the construction of a new piece of track, the Ordsall Chord, was designed to allow more trains to travel through Manchester, speed up journeys and make new direct links possible.In the south, commuters were set to reap the fruits of a project so long in the gestation it was once called Thameslink 2000: a £7bn overhaul that included rebuilding London Bridge station, adding modern signalling and buying new trains so that dozens of services could pass per hour with automated, Tube-style frequency. Every single train timing was redrawn on GTR’s franchise in an attempt to harvest the benefits of that work, add extra services and – laughable though it sounds now – increase reliability.The fundamental problem was the lack of drivers. Both GTR and the company that operates Northern’s franchise, Arriva Rail North, claim to be employing more than enough drivers to run the expanded services the May timetable was due to provide. However, what is needed on every train is a driver who has been trained both on the exact model of train and the full route they are to operate. That takes time and resources: new drivers are trained by qualified drivers, taking them out of the action too and compounding the shortage.That, of course, is foreseeable – which is why services have to be planned many months in advance. Normally, the process of setting timetables starts 16 months ahead, to be thrashed out by train companies and approved by Network Rail – the state-owned operator of Britain’s rail infrastructure – with three to six months to spare. This time, it was a matter of weeks.There is no single answer, though there are interconnecting issues from north to south. For Northern, Network Rail accepts a large part of the blame for a long-delayed infrastructure upgrade – the electrification of the line past Bolton. Work that should have been long finished has dragged on: a first contractor was replaced by Carillion – but then Carillion imploded. And Carillion’s replacement has had to grapple with ground scarred by old mines, taking weeks to put up power lines that would normally go in overnight.But Northern has also struggled with industrial relations: goodwill, which has often buoyed up an industry reliant on overtime and rest-day working, has evaporated in parts. All retraining has had to take place on working days, leading to an acute shortage of trained drivers even before the May changeover.GTR, meanwhile, had been through well-documented problems of its own, with strikes by guards and drivers heaping on commuter despair. The Southern part of the franchise has been a byword for rail failure since 2015 (although right now, almost unnoticed, it is thriving since the timetable change). A set of interrelated problems, on track and trains, had been identified by Chris Gibb, the senior railwayman brought in by transport secretary Chris Grayling to help restore some quality to GTR in December 2016. He warned that a phased introduction of new services would be vital to make Thameslink work.That view was shared by Network Rail and GTR: but delaying new services needed the Department for Transport’s approval – which came long after Network Rail planners needed to start drawing up the timetable. When the DfT belatedly decided phasing was a good idea, the planners’ work was scrapped and the process started again, four months late already. And yet more issues arose: GTR’s planning team, shorn of numerous experienced staff, requested thousands of changes months later.Two inquiries lie ahead: one commissioned by Grayling from Professor Stephen Glaister, chair of the Office of Rail and Road regulator and an investigation by the transport select committee.The latter may yet bring the axe hovering closer over Grayling’s head. The transport secretary has angered Network Rail by immediately blaming them. Then in his statement to the Commons, he claimed he had been “personally assured” by GTR that the service would work, and risked alienating allies such as Gibb, who chaired the Thameslink readiness board, by joking about trusting experts.Grayling’s claim of receiving assurances could yet be called into question by GTR executives. Conversely, should GTR prove to have not informed the readiness board that they did not have sufficient drivers, it calls into question the competence of a company supposedly intensely monitored by the DfT. And Network Rail, as a publicly owned company, reports to the transport secretary – the one accountable person, as Labour points out, in a fragmented industry.Possibly, yes: even leaving aside questions of state versus private, a single accountable body with proper oversight might have acted sooner. In Scotland, where track and train come under joint supervision, the late delivery of Hitachi trains prompted Scotrail to defer its own new timetable. This was a course of action that England’s fragmented system was apparently unable to take.A senior industry source said: “It’s a system issue – you’ve got to get all the elements right. We’ve bitten off more than we could chew. We knew that it was going to be the biggest timetable change ever, and the industry didn’t spend enough time checking it would work – until it was too late.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0fa5b06b0b2b61d66fcfcaeb54da6c19030444ec/7_397_2743_1646/master/2743.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2d6ab2e765d2b208ae7c3e3986c6070","title":"its not just bikini parades that have had their day so has miss america","story":"The bikini ban brought in by the Miss America contest manages to feel both welcome and absurd. The all-female organisers of the 97-year-old pageant are responding to #MeToo by ditching the swimwear round (four years after Miss World got rid of it). It’s being replaced by an “interactive section” where contestants explain their achievements and goals. They can also wear “whatever they want” in the eveningwear round and there will be “all female shapes and sizes”. Miss America wants to stop being viewed as a pageant, more as a competition that helps smart young women pay for college. Which sounds workable – just get back to us when the contestants are allowed to wear paper bags on their heads.There’s been a backlash to the ban from former contestants and what one could only assume to be time-travellers from 1972, who strongly feel that women should have the right to express their inner beauty, academic brilliance and profound insights on environmental issues via the medium of the string bikini. While those running Miss America should be applauded for ignoring the naysayers, what about the biggest, most female-positive change of all – stopping Miss America altogether? In fact, ditching all beauty pageants? And I include those creepy ones where eight-year-old girls are tarted up to resemble the death masks of meth-addicted Baby Janes.While there are male equivalents to these contests, these mainly focus on bodybuilding, with the contestants sometimes resembling steroid-infested, fake-tanned police lineups. While it’s undoubtedly intriguing to see how intense exercise and “supplements” can manipulate the human form to the point that it becomes its own tangerine-hued bouncy castle, the only plausible response to some of those involved seems to be to scream and run. Yet the female pageants manage to be worse, because of history, context and the fact that, despite all the earnest cheerleading for intellect and personality, they primarily revolve around an anachronistic grading of female looks.There lies the problem for Miss America and any other pageants wishing, however sincerely, to modernise. Just restyling as a competition (that happens to feature gorgeous women), getting rid of bikinis and allowing in token plus-size contestants doesn’t alter the fact that the entire premise is the notion of beauty as the only female currency that truly matters. There can’t be any nods to #MeToo or anything else powered by the newly invigorated female resistance, when their very existence undermines the fact that it should be what women say and do that counts, not how they look. In this way, an “empowered” beauty pageant becomes… just a very pretty-looking oxymoron.If Miss America truly wishes to ring the changes, it should consider disappearing altogether. In the meantime, regarding the “whatever you want” eveningwear round, one hears The Handmaid’s Tale look is big this year.A scheme in Gwent, south-east Wales, means first-time, drunk-and-disorderly offenders who get involved in minor fights could avoid fines and prison sentences by attending a behavioural course.In the same way that motorists are sent on speed-awareness courses, the drunks would attend the moderately priced class, but avoid further penalties. The police and crime commissioner for Gwent, Jeffrey Cuthbert, said: “When people consume substantial amounts of alcohol, iniduals can act out of character.” Quite.I’m reminded of my intense dislike for that petty little phrase “in vino veritas”, which always seemed to be permission to drink-shame people already crippled by filthy hangovers. As in: “Not only am I going to torture you for your appalling behaviour last night, I’m going to make out that this is your true grotty nature that your sober self tries to hide from the world and I’m going to give this trite, judgmental nonsense credence by spouting a bit of Latin in a superior, knowing voice that grates on everyone’s nerves.”In truth, there’s hardly ever any “veritas” in “vino” – it’s all just vino, or beer, or whatever else you drank. It wasn’t true of me in my drunken heyday, when I was annoying and boring people with my antics, so, bar racist or misogynist outbursts, I’ve always tried to give others the benefit of the doubt. Drunken behaviour merely speaks of a person’s level of inebriation, not their essential character. That was always my excuse and I stuck to it for many years, against stiff opposition and mounting evidence.Well done, Gwent police for the lateral thinking: the first time they screw up, don’t shame drunks – give them a warning and also a break.There’s a new Amazon device coming out (so far, just in the US) called the Echo Look, described as “a smart camera that helps you get dressed”. It will judge your outfit and tell you if you look good or bad, using input from various stylists, fashion “influencers” and the like.What sounds a bit like a computerised “bezzie” isn’t entirely about helping you out, because (and this may shock some people) the advice links to items that you can buy and (another shock) these things are often available from Amazon.What woman hasn’t dreamed of an electronic device designed to make her feel paranoid about how she looks?Then again, what’s new? For too many years, women have been constantly nagged by society at large that they’ll never look good enough and are fundamentally worthless unless they spend all their money and every waking hour trying to disguise their core unsightliness. They stagger desperately from product to outfit to hot yoga session in their relentless and doomed quest for acceptance.Basically, Echo Look is just going to do to women what our systemically sexist culture is already doing – it might just be a bit less spiteful about it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45ac83a750f4824a48257aab1fa7f5c8239a690a/113_0_3510_2106/master/3510.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35765d09add543b125eefc8a83d9eaf5","title":"love island dating men masculinity tv","story":"Women have no idea what men talk about when we are not in the room. Well, how could we? By definition, the conversation changes when we walk in. But most women have their suspicions. Locker room talk had a grim reputation even before Donald Trump. At best, women tend to assume that it’s secretly rather boring: all sport and cars, light on emotions.And that’s where the return of Love Island, ITV2’s spectacularly vacuous hit reality show, has proved unexpectedly interesting. For those readers sadly unfamiliar with the oeuvre, imagine Big Brother minus most of the clothes and all the intellectual pretensions. What’s left is a bunch of swishy-haired young women in skimpy bikinis and heels, thrown together somewhere around a swimming pool with a bunch of improbably muscled hunks in trunks. It’s about\u0026nbspas deep as a puddle in a summer drought, the last place on Earth you’d expect to find men’s innermost feelings laid bare. But while the rather seedy hook is the prospect of people trying to cop off with each other while under 24-hour surveillance, the TV gold here is in the endless conversations.The boys (for some reason they’re always boys, never men) huddle in one corner and the girls in another, earnestly swapping advice as they pick over the entrails of what can barely be called relationships yet. It’s the all-boys-together exchanges that are oddly revelatory. We are not used to seeing young men portrayed as vulnerable and insecure. Parents of sons see the hidden uncertainty in their own boys – the older my son and his friends get, the easier it is to recognise the softness still buried inside hulking great teens hanging out on street corners – but not always in other people’s. And while, rightly, there is much debate about how a porn-influenced culture promoting wildly unrealistic ideas of beauty hurts girls, or how dating apps such as Tinder have poisoned their relationships, we talk rather less about the impact on boys. Love Island is a reminder that it can be brutal for them too.Cheesy old Blind Date, the dating show my generation grew up with, at least paid lip service to the idea that personality mattered. Hidden behind a screen, contestants had a chance to win over their potential dates with terrible chat-up lines before the big reveal. But Love Island’s format is the horribly unforgiving swipe-left culture of online dating made flesh.It opens with the men being paraded one by one, like beefy show ponies, in front of the women, who are instructed to step forward if they fancy anyone. If the attraction’s mutual, you’re now a “couple”. If it isn’t, rejection is swift and crushingly public: the sexual equivalent of being picked last in PE, in front of millions. There’s no pretence that choices are made on the basis of anything other than “Well, would you?” since contestants barely exchange a sentence before matching. Those who don’t fit a certain, narrow definition of beauty are vulnerable. Samira, the sole black woman in the show, was last to be picked despite being gorgeous while Alex, an A\u0026ampE doctor adrift in a sea of spray-tanned models, was rebuffed by all the women. So far the standout theme is the rawness of rejection, and the way the men in particular cope.No doubt all the contestants are conscious that survival depends on charming voting viewers at home. They’d be mad not to be previous winners made six-figure sums from their overnight celebrity, helping explain the oft-quoted statistic that more people applied for Love Island this year than Oxbridge.But you’d need a heart of stone not to be moved by the sight of the lads earnestly comforting a distressed Alex, telling him he’s got a “great personality” and that it’s good to be smart even if it’s doing him no favours right now. There was something poignant, too, about watching laddish Jack pretending to the woman he was evidently falling for that he’s thrilled she only wants to be friends. How often do mass media portray young men putting a brave, rather than angry, face on sexual rejection? Yet it seems an important thing for teenage boys to witness, and to see rewarded.When young men hit the headlines, it’s so often in a threatening context: as sexual predators and perpetrators of violence, gang members and radicalised terror suspects, internet trolls and violent incels. Toxic masculinity evidently is a problem, one we too often shy away from naming.But there is another story that isn’t told enough, because it’s the kind of story the media are badly equipped to tell: the one where nothing much happens. Stuff doesn’t go dramatically wrong. Nobody dies. There is no news. Perfectly nice boys make mistakes but grow up into perfectly nice men, capable of dealing maturely with disappointment, with lives every bit as real as those that make the news. It’s ironic, obviously, that it should take a show as fake and exploitative as Love Island to put these lives on screen.But just like love, maybe reality sometimes hides in the last place anyone would ever think to look."},{"url":null,"title":"the biggest unsolved mysteries of 2018 so far","story":"Detectives of the internet, unite! We’ve gathered some of this year’s most puzzling conundrumsIt has been 74 days, 14 minutes and 23 seconds since the world first learned that someone once bit Beyoncé. However, despite the internet’s best efforts to discover the culprit, the mystery of #WhoBitBeyoncé remains stubbornly unsolved.It’s not just Beyoncé’s biter befuddling us all: we’re less than halfway through the year but already 2018 has raised more questions than it has answered. Here are some of the weirdest unsolved mysteries of the year so far.We know Trump is terrified of sharks, but is the president petrified of water? An incident at the Weird House this week suggests this might be the case. During a Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) hurricane preparedness meeting on Wednesday, Trump inexplicably took his water bottle off the table and put the offending object on the floor. A split second later an apparently H2O-phobic Mike Pence did the same. While the other people around the table did not bat an eyelid at this behaviour, the internet was immediately intrigued. What was going on?The most generous explanation is that step one of hurricane preparedness is removing all table-standing water bottles to the safety of the floor, and Trump and Pence were simply attentive students. Another theory is that Trump is playing three-dimensional chess with water bottles and this stunt, which went viral, is a genius move designed to distract us from the real issues. Alternatively, one might consider the idea that nothing Trump does makes sense, and Pence is an obsequious pawn who does anything his master does.No, I’m not talking about Steve Bannon. On 17 May, Saagar Enjeti, a White House correspondent for the Daily Caller, tweeted a photo of a ziplock bag stuffed full of wet socks that, inexplicably, was lying on the floor of the White House briefing room. Five days later, he tweeted another picture of the socks which, it seems, hadn’t been claimed. I contacted Enjeti this week to find out if there had been further developments and he informed me that the socks seem to have gone. One hopes, to a far better place. In May a severed foot inside a hiking shoe washed up on the shores of British Columbia. This was the 14th human foot since 2007 to be discovered on the coastline. Over the years there have been various theories regarding the feet: a serial killer, a mafia calling card, something to do with the new series of Twin Peaks. The mostly likely hypothesis, though, is modern footwear. Most of the feet found are sneakers their robust but lightweight material protecting a foot from decomposing, while pulling the foot towards shore. But who knows, in the future we may find it was all a grim guerrilla marketing campaign for a new type of Air Max.The first lady recently spent almost a month out of the public eye, sparking fervent rumours about her whereabouts. However, she reappeared this week, as Trump has vociferously pointed out. On Wednesday the president tweeted that that the media: “Reported everything from near death, to facelift, to left the WH (and me) for NY or Virginia, to abuse. All Fake, she is doing really well!” Later on Wednesday Melania Trump sat next to her husband at the Fema hurricane briefing where she did not appear fazed by the bizarre water bottle maneuverings. “She went through a little rough patch but she’s doing great,” Trump announced at the briefing.Of all the bizarre things to have happened in 2018, Melania going missing is probably the least mysterious. Hearing nonstop news about your husband’s affair with porn stars, coupled with having to undergo kidney surgery, certainly constitutes a “rough patch”. So while Melania’s whereabouts for a month may remain a mystery, her motives from disappearing from the public gaze are not.In March, the actor Tiffany Haddish told GQ magazine that she once saw a fellow celebrity bite Beyoncé on the face at a party. The internet immediately dropped everything it was doing and started a crazed search for the mysterious biter. A shortlist of suspects was immediately drawn up and elite task forces created to investigate the issue. Chrissy Teigen told US Weekly that people have “honestly texted me mood boards about this, like actually full CSI, with pictures of actresses connected with red string as to where in the country they were that night.” It was quickly decided that Sanaa Lathan, from Love \u0026amp Basketball fame, was the culprit. Lathan, however, denied these rumours. The case of #WhoBitBeyonce remains open.Earlier this month Trump was presented with a letter from North Korea’s Kim Jong-un which came in an extremely large envelope. No one is sure why the envelope was so large, however some believe it was an attempt to make Trump’s hands look small. We’re also not clear what was in the envelope, although White House officials have confirmed that Trump has read its contents. Perhaps we will know more next week: Trump is meeting with Kim in Singapore on 12 June. No doubt he will use the occasion to inform Kim that he too has envelopes in his stationary cupboard, and they are much bigger and more powerful than his.Actually, that wasn’t a mystery at all. It’s obviously Laurel.Last month a burned-out Honda Civic was found dangling from a bridge in Toronto. It was quickly lowered to the ground by the fire department but nobody knows why it was there. A preliminary theory, that it was a prop for a movie shoot, was quickly retracted and the case still isn’t solved. What with dangling cars and severed feet, Canada’s not quite the quiet country it’s often made out to be.

This was the Dorset Gravel Dash, an on- and off-road bike-packing event that starts and finishes in Swanage. I’d never bike-packed before, but it’s similar to touring, only with less luggage, arranged in frame bags rather than panniers. It had already been an eventful initiation. Under non-stop sun we traversed mud, sand, road, hill forts and rocky paths too steep for me to cycle up or down. One recently acquired companion, Ricky, was coated in thorns after somersaulting over his handlebars into a gorse bush on the first day. It took three men to lift him out. Despite having spent 90 minutes that morning having prickles removed with tweezers and a pen knife, he was still freckled with them.One of our number had cannibalised a chopping board from a hedge to stop a bag rubbing on a wheel. Another had done a backward somersault trying to cycle up a barrow, and his legs were drenched from attempting to cycle through an enormous ford. We were eight people alone in rural Dorset on bikes. As the event’s organiser, Charlie the Bikemonger, put it, we were engaged in scouting for adults.The first day was a test of endurance, a blur of 60 hot miles from Swanage to Shillingstone via Corfe Castle, of tough climbs to astonishing views, of grass and rock, mud and sand, road and gravel. Fellow rider Caren’s shoulder muscles had knotted painfully and my back ached. We ran out of water on one hot stretch of road, flagging slowly as our upper bodies mutinied, to find the volunteers had run out of water when we reached them. It was only three miles to the Sailor’s Return pub in Chaldon Herring, though, where we stopped for a sandwich, drank pints of lime and soda and hid in the shade.At about 3pm someone pointed out we’d only done 30 miles, half of the day’s total. At this rate we’d be cycling until midnight. With the day dragging on into early evening, with 15 miles to go, Caren’s shoulder had worsened and she opted for the quickest on-road route to camp and, by this stage, I wasn’t sad to join her. We crawled along a loose, narrow sandy trail between stinging nettles and cow parsley. We followed two guys cycling up Bulbarrow Hill, with Toploader’s Dancing in the Moonlight playing on a loudspeaker. Volunteers gave us more water and brownies at the summit with a spectacular view for the final descent. We set up our tents under greying skies as fat drops of rain began to fall, and awaited the arrival of our companions. The camping field had no showers or toilets, but it did have a huge tipi and some gazebos where organisers served vegetable and goat stews, and a cash bar. There was live music, and at the end of the night I walked back to my tent with cider in my belly under a sky dancing with lightning. The following day, a particularly deep puddle dealt the killer blow to my derailleur. Thankfully, my companions included a bike builder, a mechanic and several skilled amateurs, and at the side of that muddy track they removed the derailleur and shortened the chain to set it on a convenient cog, the only gear I’d have for the final 22 miles. Picking our way through sandy paths on coastal moorland on the final miles, via Old Harry Rocks, a quiet fell upon the group. The expanse of grey-blue water behind us was blanketed with a late afternoon haze, and the Scots pines in the bright sun framed a line of weary adult cycling scouts slowly weaving their way home.Having just one gear was a lot of fun but, after 15 miles of punishment on hills and soft mud, the chain began jumping between cogs, occasionally stopping the pedals dead. Once or twice it locked in a bigger cog, and we had to release the back wheel, with an almighty pinging sound as the tension released. To avoid provoking the chain further I dismounted and walked the last few hills atop brilliant white cliffs as that magical blue haze coated the coast below us on both sides. There was a final walk down a rocky descent – where it was rumoured someone broke a leg last year – to the Red Lion in Swanage, in the midst of a pirate festival and their very rowdy drinking competition. A few riders stood around cheering the pirates as they downed yards of ale. The Dorset Gravel Dash was undoubtedly a challenge, but my riding buddies and I came away from it with good memories, new friends and a real sense of achievement. Traipsing across country by bike, camping and getting caked in mud with friends is definitely my idea of fun, and I can’t wait to do it again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15a95297b008723a9c4d46ad573318e7f38edb20/0_278_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=156cf9626eebf13720764bb85fa0026a","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"Foraging wood ducks, an adder taking a dip and a fearless baby rabbit are among this week’s pick on images from the natural world"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e87f81d323dfcc986e5489db0a28af023925563/0_219_6580_3948/master/6580.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67fb849648c8c97707781109992d91d3","title":"the wild workout a yorkshire coastal adventure","story":"The North York Moors national park hugs a coastline made for adventurers and the curious. Sarah Wharton tries her hand at foraging, fossil hunting, hiking and stand-up paddleboardingStay over in StaithesThe eclectic personality of Staithes reflects residents past and present. In the jumble of tiny cottages that spill down a gorge to the harbour have lived James Cook (later Captain), who came to work in a grocer’s store, and the influential Staithes group, a 19th-century artists’ group. It’s home to the Staithes festival of arts and heritage in September, and is a shoo-in for basecamp on a trip that takes in culture, natural history and a yomp. Rest up at the Endeavour B\u0026ampB, where host David Linley is a walking encyclopedia of activities, and heritage tales. He makes a mean breakfast too: don’t miss the kippers from Staithes’ own smokehouse. For dinner, try the delicious crab salad at the Royal George – like all pubs in this fishing village that’s something of a sovereign state, it’s independent and family owned. And if food and flavours really are your thing, then book a day of coastal foraging and cooking tips with Taste the Wild, which runs courses out of Staithes. Co-founder Chris Bax says: “Foraging reflects the resurgence of ersity in food: we let people rediscover things we used to eat but have dropped out of fashion.” The Attenborough in all of us will want to get closer to wildlife in an area rich in flora and fauna from moor to sky to sea. Jump aboard a birdwatching and cetacean safari with ecologist Richard Baines at Yorkshire Coast Nature (YCN) and you might just see some minke whales. Or stay grounded and snap up a seabird photography workshop with YCN’s Steve Race. Find your waveStand-up paddleboarding is “surfing without the faff of having to get up while the wave is breaking all over you,” says Simon Palmer, explorer, who co-founded SUP Adventures with Dan Fawkes. Both have that ex-military knack of turning what should be a gruelling encounter – with messy sea, two left feet or black skies – into a fun escapade and day-long grin. “People love it because it’s so accessible, irrespective of ability. It’s a terrific confidence booster if you’re anxious about getting out to learn a new activity or getting in the water. And it’s an all-body workout too.” Conquer position, posture and paddling technique at postcard-pretty Sandsend or alongside Saltburn’s trim, elegant Victorian pier. Then treat yourself to a follow-up session to learn how to read wave conditions and ride on to the beach. For something more stretchy, try SUP Adventures’ river yoga. Determined to have a Point Break moment? Head for surf spots at Staithes, where the rock bottom breaks produce powerful and defined waves (experienced surfers only). Or dip a beginner’s toe at Whitby’s West Cliff beach with Whitby Surf School. Hike into natureIf watersports aren’t your thing, then hiking along this extravagantly handsome Jurassic coastline, creaking with 200m years of stories, puritanical Victorian glamour and fishing folklore, will definitely get your heart rate up. North Yorks Moors senior ranger Bernie McLinden offers some tips: “Hayburn Wyke is a fantastic place to get to,” he says, referring to a secretish cove at the southern end of the North York Moors national park. “I was there at 7pm last night and even spotted a couple of surfers: they seemed to be having a great time.” With a waterfall that plops on to the beach, it’s a fairytale scene to take in on a circular five-mile walk that goes south along the Cleveland Way and returns along part of the Cinder Track, a defunct 21-mile railway line from Whitby to Scarborough that’s great cycling too. Another inspiring journey is the “source-to-sea” hike that picks up the river Esk at Westerdale Moor and closes at Whitby’s harbour mouth. At 37 miles, the full walk takes three or four days, but the Esk Valley railway enables you to cheat and do a day’s chunk to suit. “You might be lucky enough to see an otter along the way,” McLinden says. “At Sleights, if it’s the right time of year, you can see salmon leap. And in springtime, the woodland areas across the park are just wonderful, brimming with the beauty of the bluebells, primroses and ramsons.” Back in Staithes, if you have just 15 minutes to spare you can sprint southwards then upwards on to the cliff and a new part of the England Coast Path, to get the best view of the waterside hamlet. If you have longer, plump for a four-mile circle, taking in the industrial ironstone past of Port Mulgrave. Paddle back in timeThe Dinosaur Coast has never been more alive than when kinetic geologist, marine biologist and sailor Peter McGrath is talking about the natural kingdom that surrounds smartly turned-out Runswick Bay. He says: “One of ‘my’ best finds in 40 years came from my daughter Ruby on one of her first fossiling trips. ‘I’ve found an ammonite,’ she shouted casually. Not just any ammonite! A rare 18cm Hilderocas bifrons is a very good find.” McGrath is on a mission to discover and photograph every fossilised and living thing he can in the area, and shares his vast expertise with interested visitors as part of local firm Barefoot Kayak’s fossil foray team. If McGrath is the vim in this expedition, topping up your knowledge of fossil poo and Devil’s toenails (coprolites and Gryphaea respectively), Barefoot Kayak’s founder, paddlesport guide and coastguard Andy Monaghan provides the calm – putting the newly waterborne at ease with a deceptively laid-back style that nails safety. Paddling along with the duo is relaxing and stimulating in equal measure. Sea kayaking is manageable for most people and great for independent travellers or family groups with a yen for adventure.

After that he will depart from Disney permanently.Lasseter in November took what he called a six-month “sabbatical.” He apologised “to anyone who has ever been on the receiving end of an unwanted hug” or any other gesture that made them feel “disrespected or uncomfortable”. At the time, Lasseter signalled that he hoped to then return to Disney. “The last six months have provided an opportunity to reflect on my life, career and personal priorities,” Lasseter said in a statement. “While I remain dedicated to the art of animation and inspired by the creative talent at Pixar and Disney, I have decided the end of this year is the right time to begin focusing on new creative challenges.”The 61-year-old Lasseter, easily recognisable for his bright Hawaiian shirts, is the highest-ranking Hollywood executive to be toppled in the wake of the #MeToo movement. A pioneer in digital animation, he has been a creative force behind every Pixar release as well as Disney hits like Frozen, Moana and Zootopia. Lasseter directed Pixar’s breakthrough feature Toy Story as well as it first sequel, Toy Story 2.After Disney acquired Pixar in 2006, Lasseter was named chief creative officer of Pixar as well as Disney Animation. Under Lasseter, the previously flagging animation studio was reborn through both Pixar and Disney releases that have amassed billions in box office and a string of Oscars.Bob Iger, chief executive of Disney, praised Lasseter for his vision and assembling storytellers and innovators “to set the standard in animation for generations to come”“John had a remarkable tenure at Pixar and Disney Animation, reinventing the animation business, taking breathtaking risks, and telling original, high quality stories that will last forever. We are profoundly grateful for his contribution, which included a masterful and remarkable turnaround of The Walt Disney Animation Studios.”Pixar’s latest, Incredibles 2, opens in the US next week. Lasseter is an executive producer of the anticipated sequel, which is expected to be among the biggest box-office debuts for an animated release.Disney has not announced his successor."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2932949032395c0cfd12f7b9b23a5a59a09687d9/0_6_1654_992/master/1654.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=829ec400b1f7cdb4e9af5234a721b084","title":"re possessed exploring hereditary and hollywoods love of the haunted house","story":"From crumbling mansions to newlyweds buying a bargain fixer-upper, architecture in films holds the perfect backdrop for generational anxietiesIf there’s a supernatural estate agency in the afterlife, the ghost’s dream home would probably be something like the Winchester Mystery House in San Jose, California. It was built in 1884 by Sarah Winchester, heiress to the rifle fortune and, legend has it, she was told by a medium that it had to accommodate the spirits of those killed by her late husband’s guns. Thus, she employed an army of builders to continually extend the house for 40 years to no particular plan. You couldn’t wish for anything spookier: stained glass, odd-shaped roofs and turrets, corridors and staircases that lead nowhere, doors that open on to nothing. It makes no sense at all.Before you say: “Someone should make a movie out of that!” they already have. It was called Winchester. Starring Helen Mirren, it came out last year and was rubbish. But the point is, by accident or design, houses are the scariest places of all. The movies know this very well. Just as old houses are adaptable to modern lifestyles, so haunted-house stories have accommodated our generational anxieties. And just as we prefer not to think about who lived (and died) in our house before we moved in, so haunted-house movies find a way of tapping into older, deeper fears. “When we go home and shoot the bolt on the door, we like to think we’re locking trouble out,” wrote Stephen King in his book Danse Macabre. “The good horror story … whispers that we are not locking the world out we are locking ourselves in – with them.” Those ghosts of terrors past are very at home in Hereditary – a terrifying new horror whose title hints at things we want to inherit (property) and things we don’t (the family “curse”). Anchored by a terrific performance from Toni Collette, Hereditary is a magnificent, mysterious tale of grief and guilt and dread. Everyone in this family seems to be shrouded in their own personal cloud: Collette has just buried her “difficult” mother husband Gabriel Byrne is withdrawn, morose the teenage son is a monosyllabic stoner the young daughter scribbles angry drawings and snips the heads off dead birds. The family home itself adds to the gloom: a large, wooden affair surrounded by birch forests, apparently in the middle of nowhere. Architecturally, it’s not your classic gloomy gothic – it’s more 20th century – but it is still a place of unease. It’s imposing, cavernous and too quiet, and severely short on lighting fixtures. Driving the point home, Collette is an artist specialising in detailed little scenes from her own life recreated using tiny model houses. Like Sarah Winchester, she plays out her neuroses architecturally. This was one of the foundations of gothic horror: that the house was a reflection of its inhabitants’ troubled psyches and repressed secrets. Away from the presentable public areas, those dark corners and secret basements and attics corresponded to the spaces of our unconscious. Women are usually the victims, locked into prisons of the patriarchy, haunted by past wives and stern governesses and curtailed passions, as in Jane Eyre or Rebecca or Shirley Jackson’s The Haunting of Hill House, the basis for Robert Wise’s classic The Haunting. So many of our haunted-house movies are still rooted in this gothic tradition, such as Guillermo del Toro’s Crimson Peak or the Daniel Radcliffe-led The Woman in Black, or Nicole Kidman’s The Others. Even Polanski’s Rosemary’s Baby, set in 1960s New York, still found a pocket of gothic gloom in the Dakota Apartments, where the patriarchy works its satanic tricks on poor, waif-like Mia Farrow. The urban familiarity only makes it worse. You could almost see modern architecture as an attempt to exorcise all this, to dispel the dark corners and secret spaces and flood our living spaces with purifying light, but in the movies at least, you can never completely cast the devil out of the home. At best, you’re just sweeping it under the carpet and papering over the cracks.Property prices being what they are, crumbling old mansions are also harder to come by in the modern era, but more pressing anxieties have come to haunt the domestic realm – such as economics. That was the case with The Amityville Horror, which has spawned a whole sub-genre of imitators and sequels. It’s the classic story (supposedly true – but aren’t they all?) of upwardly mobile newlyweds who think they’ve found a bargain fixer-upper and ignore all the warning signs: the scary attic windows the fact that the previous tenant murdered his family with a shotgun or that classic giveaway, the former Native American burial site. Amityville wasn’t a great movie but it clearly struck a chord with audiences in 1979, who were facing economic uncertainty and high mortgage rates. The same fears have come back to haunt the modern market. Lo-fi hit Paranormal Activity, released before the 2008 crash, played on ideas of an aspirational couple whose starter home comes with a hidden debt to repay. Meanwhile, Tobe Hooper and Stephen Spielberg’s 1982 Poltergeist was set not in a scary old building but a sunny new one in a planned community (sadly built on the site of an old cemetery). Six years later, Tim Burton’s Beetlejuice taught a similar lesson, albeit with a cheerier tone. It presents its ghost couple with a fate worse than death: having your perfect clapboard country home taken over by gentrifying yuppies, who set about giving it a lurid postmodern makeover. This decor paranoia still runs strong. Most viewers probably related to Darren Aronofsky’s Mother! less for its biblical-environmental allegories than its nightmare scenario of uninvited guests trashing your paintwork and sitting on your unbraced sink. What makes Hereditary’s house all the scarier is that we never get a sense of its layout. That’s because there isn’t really one. The movie was not shot inside a house but on purpose-built sets. It’s the same trick Stanley Kubrick used in The Shining and, before that, Robert Wise in The Haunting: two seminal house horrors where our inability to mentally map the space adds to the unease. Conspiracy theorists have obsessively pored over the Overlook Hotel’s floor plan and found it doesn’t add up. Likewise with The Haunting, the sets were purpose-built to look slightly off, and filmed with distorting lenses. That “offness” of the house was there in Shirley Jackson’s source novel: “It had an unbelievably faulty design which left it chillingly wrong in all its dimensions, so that the walls seemed always in one direction a fraction longer than the eye could endure, and in another direction a fraction less than the barest possible tolerable length.” Jackson’s book also references the Winchester Mystery House. Might she have visited it? Hereditary doesn’t pander to the cliches of the genre but it knows its history: there are no creaky floorboards, no peeling wallpaper. Haunted-house movies are now themselves haunted by what came before, and so few have surprises to spring. Movies such as Hereditary show that if you get the architectural wrongness right from the start, the house becomes part of the terror rather than just the venue for it.Hereditary is in cinemas from 15 June"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e7915efb7abf67ee15671e8b90d994257fe411e/212_351_3110_1866/master/3110.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5158f7944920a859d04d67d2d7931a04","title":"england hope russia world cup 2018","story":"England have shown rare togetherness in the buildup to the tournament with the squad not baring the scars of past failuresOutside Elland Road on Thursday night there was little to suggest excitement levels for Russia 2018 are lower than before any major tournament over the past two decades. An hour after the final whistle England’s players began to leave the Bremner Suite with their families to spend their final days at home before flying to Russia for five weeks, if we allow ourselves to imagine a final in Moscow’s Luzhniki Stadium on 15 July.They emerged to screaming fans, from teenagers to pensioners, some clambering up stairs to get a better view. Harry Kane received the loudest cheers as he happily signed shirts and flags. Marcus Rashford did not stop for supporters but his strike from 30 yards against Costa Rica will be ingrained in their memories. This is not a golden generation of England players yet but there is a sense they offer something different and a willingness to interact with the public and media over the past fortnight means Gareth Southgate’s squad depart with no shortage of goodwill.In selecting a youthful and inexperienced World Cup party, with an average age of 26 years and 18 days on the opening game against Tunisia on 18 June, Southgate has, intentionally or otherwise, wiped the slate clean. Few of them were involved in the scarring collapse against Iceland at Euro 2016 or the World Cup squads that limply surrendered to Germany in 2010 and failed to get out of the group in Brazil in 2014.The toxicity has also been stripped away. The approach to this tournament has included Frank Lampard and Rio Ferdinand talk of a isiveness in the England camp under past regimes, but there was an air of togetherness at St George’s Park in Staffordshire where they completed their preparations.Fabian Delph talked animatedly about team-bonding exercises, revealing who is king of table tennis (Raheem Sterling) and pool (himself). It was a marked contrast to Joe Hart’s steadfast refusal to ulge any details about a darts competition before Euro 2016. A layer of suspicion and fear has been dissolved and that freedom is being reflected in the way they are playing. “I’m not getting carried away about how far this team can get but the performances in the warm-up game, particularly against Costa Rica were encouraging,” Kevin Miles, chief executive of the Football Supporters Federation, said. “From people I speak to, we like the lack of assumption in the team, the lack of ego and the lack of cliques.”England will stay in the seaside town of Repino on the Gulf of Finland. Aside from the challenge of acclimatising to Volgograd, the venue for their first game that will be at least 10F warmer, they may have to contend with the tedium of a town without a wealth of attractions. But Gary Lineker, who will anchor the BBC’s coverage in Russia, does not buy into that. “Sometimes we get a little bit distracted by excuses,” he said. “I’ve heard before: ‘Oh they’re really bored before a World Cup’. Come on. Get real. You’re in a nice hotel, you’ve got box sets and PlayStations, computers in your pocket, telephones. When I played in Mexico in 1986 we were allowed one phone call home a week. You had to make your own entertainment. Yes, it’s boring at times but once you start winning it’s less boring. It’s funny that.”Away from the England bubble, attention will fall on the altogether more serious problems facing this World Cup, some of which could not have been envisaged when Russia was picked as host on a dramatic evening eight years ago. It is among the most politically charged sporting events in history – and the landscape is ever changing. In January, a delegation from the FA, the national police chiefs’ council, the Home Office and the Football Supporters Federation went on a reconnaissance mission to the country, visiting the group stage venues with consular staff from the British embassy.They were reassured that the Russian police were committed to ensuring fan safety. But by the time the FA returned in April to inspect the locations where England could play in the knockout stages, the consular staff had been deported. The expulsion of 23 diplomats was a result of rising tensions between Russia and Britain after the poisoning of Sergei Skripal in Salisbury. Last month, the head of MI5 said Russia was responsible for undermining European democracies. So it is understandable there should be nervousness around security for travelling fans and the team. That is not forgetting the vicious attacks by Russian hooligans on English fans in Marseille during Euro 2016.There have been suggestions that this is partly the reason behind the relatively low number of English fans travelling. Fewer than 10,000 supporters are expected in Russia and the only match for which the FA have sold all of their allocation is the final group game against Belgium in Kaliningrad.Miles thinks there are multiple factors at play. “Marseille has left its mark on some,” he said, “But we had scare stories before Ukraine about gangs of racist hooligans which never materialised. The key issue is it’s not known as a holiday destination. The riverfront in Volgograd isn’t Copacabana beach. There’s not an appetite for people to spend a family holiday there, then you’ve got the distances required to travel between venues and the cost of hotels because there aren’t very many.”The last sporting event anywhere close to this size held in Russia was the Sochi Winter Olympics in 2014, which have since been revealed to have been corrupted by state-sponsored doping. Fifa have promised the drugs tests taken in Russia will be immediately removed from the country and sent to a laboratory in Switzerland. With 2.5 million tickets on sale for 64 games in 12 stadiums and 11 cities the World Cup is a different beast.Vladimir Putin’s hope when his country applied to be hosts was presumably to showcase Russia’s might to the west. Now the main aim surely is to repair an image damaged by wars in Syria and Ukraine and a hacking scandal. The understanding from the British security services is that he does not want the World Cup to be undermined by troublemakers.“The Russians know they are being judged on hospitality and not how hard they are,” Miles said. “We have to take the police on their word and they have told us they are going to keep fans safe. Once the Fifa roadshow rolls into town you know what to expect. The stadiums, fan zones and the way the city centres get dressed are similar for every tournament. It’s only beyond that that you see the different characteristics of the nation.”A Foreign Affairs Committee report published this week said non-match days and cities where England are not playing are major concerns, as is the welfare of BAME and LGBT fans. Gay supporters have been warned not to hold hands in public. Some of the England players, including Danny Rose, have expressed fears for their families if they were to travel. It has led some to question the wisdom of holding the tournament in Russia.Lineker has cautioned against using a broad brush to dismiss the suitability of Russia as a host country. “There’s been stuff before every World Cup I’ve ever been to,” he told the Observer. “In Brazil, there were massive demonstrations about stadium spending and public life. You can start being judgmental on this country or that country but we need to get our own house in order and how corrupt certain aspects of our lives are.“Come the start of the World Cup it’s always the same, once it starts it’s football and that’s all anyone cares about. I sense it will be all right.“Hopefully, English fans will keep out of trouble. It’s easy to blame wherever we go but there has generally been one common denominator over many World Cups which has depressed me for 30 years. The massive majority of people just there to enjoy the football.”It is to be hoped that this World Cup is remembered for the football, for an England side that was likable for once, and not events off the pitch."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce015593a811af904339fbbe8a9eb3a7599eb36e/0_103_3128_1877/master/3128.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eea297ef9b3bfd27a762766641120e51","title":"how to win world cup marco materazzi italy zinedine zidane","story":"You can win the World Cup only if everyone is together as Italy were under Marcello Lippi in 2006, says the still glowing defenderWinning a World Cup is the best feeling that a footballer can experience. It is something I – and so many people – dreamed about as a child and actually to do it is an incredible emotion that stays with you for the rest of your life.Clearly winning the World Cup is not very easy. Only 20 teams have done it so far and I can count myself lucky to be among those few people in the world who have had that feeling.The team must be united. That is more important than any inidual sporting ability. It is fundamental for everyone to be focused on the objective, to win the World Cup, and in 2006 we were. We were also a group of friends – more than just a collection of footballers – and that helped us enormously.Nothing could get to us. We were always stronger than any obstacle. For two years we had pushed forward together with this same group of players. We knew each other so well, during training and during matches, but also on a human level. We felt very strong together. We were confident we could achieve this great dream. The entire country had.And to those players (and managers) who want to win the World Cup – in my opinion – they must know one rule by heart: those who do not play are more important than those who do.Each day it’s fundamental that everyone feels involved, even those who won’t be part of the starting lineup the following match. This is what it means to be a team. Italy won the World Cup in 2006 because those who played and those who didn’t were on the same level there was never a problem, everyone was ready to sell their soul for the jersey whenever needed – it didn’t matter if you were the star player or not. Everyone, and I mean everyone.This type of spirit allows a team to get stronger in the summer of 2006 the famous Calciopoli scandal happened. The entire public opinion, and all of the press wanted to see Fabio Cannavaro excluded for this reason. Cannavaro was our captain, and the captain is untouchable, so we defended him, respected him and we came out of it stronger.Family also plays an important role: the wives and girlfriends were all together in another hotel, like they were on a retreat. This also shows unity, it allowed us to see them always the day after a match. They didn’t go shopping, they weren’t the stereotypical Wags: they brought our kids to play at the park. This is how a group at a World Cup is formed, with things off the pitch just as important.On the pitch the athletic preparation that precedes the World Cup is fundamental. You have to arrive in good shape. You play every four days so you must be in perfect condition. After the matches there’s a light workout, then you have one or two practices at most and you return to the pitch. There’s no time off.Knowing how to manage the moments as you get closer to the big matches is fundamental: everyone lives them in their own way. I would use my PlayStation! I would be alone in my room but we also got together as a group. The day of the final Italy-France, at 5.30pm, after the afternoon snack, a few hours before the match … I was in my room on the PlayStation with Francesco Totti and Vincenzo Iaquinta – that says it all.At a World Cup you don’t have time to celebrate after each win – perhaps you can in the quarter‑finals and semi-finals – because you can only look forward and the secret is to stay focused. After we beat Germany in Dortmund we were happy but we were already thinking of France. That’s a winning\u0026nbspmentality.Then there’s the manager. Being brave is a fundamental attribute of a winning manager at a World Cup. Marcello Lippi, the coach of our team in 2006, was that way: he made tough decisions and that changed the matches. If you have personality and courage, then the great champions also listen to you and respect you.From the mental aspect my advice is never to get discouraged. Among the unforgettable moments for me is, of course, the goal against France in the final … but just a few minutes before, I conceded a penalty. I can still remember that disappointment today, you feel bad inside. I was just hoping Zinedine Zidane would miss it. It didn’t go that way but I told myself not to give up and destiny gifted me that unforgettable goal.The main mental image I have from my World Cup is when Gigi Riva, the former Cagliari striker, a legend of Italian football who scored 35 goals in 42 matches for the national team, told me: “Marco, I would exchange 100 goals of mine for the one you scored.” Only then did I understand the importance of what I did. There I saw the magnitude of an extraordinary group. The World Cup can be won only by a group, like that fantastic Italy team.Interview by Fabrizio Romano"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b403842dc77864bcf2ffd65f3ba7ba435183805/38_0_1125_675/master/1125.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89b4f1623556be0adf1f43a21b96ba28","title":"my child lebensborn review","story":"The trials of caring for a child of the ‘master race’ are explored in a fearless game that brings the past to life and reveals the damage caused by social isolationAs babies, the children of the Lebensborn programme were given VIP treatment: two baths a day, extravagant meals, round-the-clock doting of specialist nurses who would disinfect every spoon and toy before it reached the child’s lips. Taken from unmarried Aryan teenage women, some as young as 16, and their Nazi officer fathers, the Lebensborn was a nursery for Hitler’s master race, a kind of inverse Holocaust: the systematic, bureaucratic, nurture of life according to race. Around 12,000 of these children were born in Norway, whose blond-haired, blue-eyed giantesses fitted the Nazi profile of an ideal woman. When the war ended, these children, many of whom had been taken from their mothers to be raised in one of nine specialist SS homes in the country, were given up for adoption.In My Child Lebensborn, you play as one of these adoptive parents who, in 1951, is poised to send your Lebensborn child (you choose the sex of your charge) off to school. Yours is the straightforward existence of the rural small town – your days spent working in a factory, your evenings and weekends harvesting fruit and mushrooms from the forest or catching fish in the lake. Your child is more excited than anxious about school, eager to make new friends and learn. The systematic way in which hope and joie de vivre are stamped out as she is ostracised by her classmates, teachers and, finally, society at large is the game’s terrible, affecting theme.The game, which was developed by the Nordic production company Teknopilot and supported by crowdfunding, works like sort of historical Tamagotchi. Each day, you have two units of time that you must spend meeting your child’s needs to prevent various meters from emptying. By bathing her when she arrives home from school, covered in bully-flung mud, you maintain her “cleanliness”. Cook dishes from bought and scavenged ingredients and you keep her from falling hungry. You mend her clothes and choose her outfits, paint pictures together and, if there’s time at the end of the day, read a bedtime story to draw her into slumber. On top of this, the rewarding, relentless routine of the carer, you also converse with your child. You advise her on how to deal with bullies, revise for school tests and, if you so choose, answer questions about her parents and why she is so\u0026nbspoften\u0026nbsptreated by others in a hurtful way (the instinct to protect the child from truths invariably amplifies her confusion).At the end of each chapter you can see how your dialogue choices have split between optimism, assertiveness and open-heartedness, and how key decisions to, for example, explain Nazism or to attempt to contact her parents compare with those of other players around the world. These reports offer one of the only moments of community and shared experience in a game that is otherwise relentlessly framed as a tale of us v them. And as the story is told, day by day, setback by setback, your feelings shift from sympathy to frustration, from control to anger. Yes, this is the thick injustice felt by the war child – the Isis toddler, the Boko Haram baby – or any young person made to suffer for the sins of the father, the faith or the state into which they were born.As a portrait of how any child’s spirit can be flattened and damaged by repeated “othering”, My Child Lebensborn is fierce and unflinching. As a tool to bring to vivid life the emotional texture of history, away from the dry dates and military manoeuvres laid out by so many male history writers, it is uniquely effective. As a video game, however, it’s a difficult ride – oppressive, psychologically strenuous and repetitive. But not all video games need be fun to be effective, and My Child Lebensborn will leave any caring, persistent player with an indelible memory.State of Decay 2(Xbox One, PC)This shadowy, dark fantasy netherworld of lumbering knights and crackling dragons made a star of its director, Hidetaka Miyazaki, in 2011.

But what about mothers: can they be artists? This still seems a debatable issue.In Sheila Heti’s new book, Motherhood, the narrator is a Canadian writer in her mid-30s who is ambivalent about having children: she worries that motherhood would affect her writing vocation. (Heti, as it happens, was a Canadian writer in her mid-30s when she wrote the book.) A review in the New Yorker appeared to agree with this thesis: “Writing depends on hoarding time, on putting up a boundary (often at home) between oneself and the immediate world around in order to visit a separate one in the mind. A mother must make herself always available. A writer needs to shut the door.”There are many more reasons not to have a baby than there are to have one. On the latter’s side, you want one, and on the former’s, literally everything else. Given that it is, still, considered radical for a woman to express anything but a full-throated desire for motherhood, any feminist has to cheer what Heti is doing here. But her arguments against motherhood aren’t really about motherhood at all. It gradually emerges that the narrator’s mother was not maternal and chose work over family. Thus the narrator grew up with the idea that one must choose – between being professionally satisfied and a good mother.The narrator’s boyfriend, Miles, eagerly endorses this idea, saying things such as: “We’re not made – cut to the cloth – to have normal lives.” And, just as Heti’s narrator brings her past experiences to bear, so I bring mine to her characters. Every time Miles spoke, I thought of all the men who dated my female friends through their 30s and claimed they were too unconventional to be stymied by a baby – only to then walk out when it was too late for the women, but leaving them free to have a baby at 45, or 50, or 55, with their new, much younger girlfriend.As I write this, on a sunny Sunday, my partner has taken our toddlers to the playground, leaving me free to focus. I have shut my door. We are both writers and before we had children we could spend the weekends writing. Now we take turns covering for the other. Deciding against children because you don’t want to compromise in that way is reasonable – even, in many ways, logical. But that is very different from blithely assuming the burden of child-raising will fall on the mother, because it is the norm for a man to put his work first but monstrous for a woman to do the same. If a woman feels she can’t do her work and be a mother, the problem is not motherhood: it’s her partner.In her excellent new standup special about parenthood, Hard Knock Wife, on Netflix, the comic Ali Wong says: “I’ll tell you how I balance family and career. I have a nanny. Yeah, my husband and I have to hustle very hard to not look after our baby.” Wong’s special and Heti’s book make for an entertaining double act, a look at motherhood from both sides of the fence: the latter’s is all breathless hypotheticals about how a baby might have a negative impact, while the former is a furious blast of reality. And where Heti’s narrator creates a kind of mental chaos to justify her choice, Wong creates a thrilling polemic out of a life that is genuinely chaotic.Without question, babies eat time. But I have found that work doesn’t suffer when you have children – everything else does. Your friends, your weekend lie-ins, your nights out: all the things you once thought you couldn’t do without, they fall away. But if you are driven to work, you cram that in around the children, in hours of the day you previously didn’t know existed. It turns out you don’t need eight solid, uninterrupted hours to do your work, that a gratefully grasped hour will suffice. And in a blink the kids are at school, and the day is yours again. A writer friend once told me that she loses two books with each child she has. “But then you come back motivated and write differently than you would have before.” Who can define what is actually lost?The real issue is not motherhood or female artistry, but how hard it still is for women to say they simply don’t want children – without feeling the need to justify that decision. As Wong rightly says, motherhood is “a whack-ass job” and one day, hopefully, more women will just admit this. And then, instead of talking about what they lose from their choices, they can talk about what they gain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21280072fdf3d492d8da9cfdc115430fa665755e/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1276488b83b790b920c97b7eeee1ff2","title":"blind date impassioned short shorts stu richard","story":"Was Stu, 29, charity worker, a bit full-on for Richard, 32, employment lawyer?What were you hoping for?Someone with a good heart and a cheeky smile.First impressions?Handsome and polite nervous but quietly confident.What did you talk about?Yorkshire, Gladiators, and living your best authentic life.Any awkward moments?During one of my rants about a city he misheard “too wide” as “too white”.Good table manners?Flawless.

I’ve got more confident as I’ve got older, but I still struggle to place value on what I do. I do it because I enjoy it, but I still have to work on that confidence often. The biggest achievement in my life of late is the ability to not care – to not judge myself so much. Not in a negative way, but in knowing I need to think like that to do things.I made my recording debut when I was 12, with my father, on his song, Lemon Incest. I remember those times fondly, because I was so fearless. I don’t think I really understood what I was doing. It took 30 minutes. I was swimming in a swimming pool before I did it, and I was desperate to go jump in the pool when I was done. And then when it came out and there was all the scandal, I was at boarding school, so I didn’t hear about it until a lot later.Art shouldn’t be censored. I feel that freedom of expression is the most precious thing, the thing we need right now more than anything. The world has become so violent, you need to be able to be free to analyse that. This is a very, very strange era. There’s so much rawness about religion… there’s something scary about the world right now.Being an actress hasn’t got much to do with my other job of music. I tend to work with directors I love and that I’d follow anywhere, and that’s because you often need to put yourself in someone else’s hands. But with music, you’re the one behind the project. I have to agree with the result. With film, I don’t. Sometimes I don’t even see the film. It took me a long time to come back to music because I couldn’t imagine doing it without my father, but I’m pleased I did.I’m thinking about #MeToo and about whether extremity is needed for change, change that is very much needed. But I’ve also been thinking about the cost to people’s lives, whether lives should be destroyed with tweets and the like. Judgment has become too immediate.

What’s the secret?Audrey I’m a music lecturer and, around 2004, I started a singing group for older adults. Donna arrived and she was loud. She declared she didn’t have a clue about singing but was willing to learn even though she was, let’s say, tunefully challenged.I started giving her a lift to lessons and it gave us time to chat, mostly about music. Donna wanted me to go to concerts with her and we have enjoyed many together. I took her backstage on Errol Brown’s last tour, when I was a backing singer.Donna is funny. She has lots of stories, is well-read and full of facts. Anything I ask, she’ll answer. No topics are off-limits. She has told me about her previous relationships and her ex-husband.In 2012, we went on holiday together to New York. Donna had travelled a lot on her own, but didn’t have the confidence to go there alone. We saw sights, laughed, ate and shopped – and survived Hurricane Sandy. Now she is not as mobile, we sit and talk in her home, and watch the news. She loves my Jamaican cooking.Donna thinks it’s unusual that I still stick around. She doesn’t have family and I know it’s a lifeline for her, but it’s quite natural in the Caribbean community to have connections across generations. If I had an auntie in her situation, living alone, my mother would expect me to check in on her. That’s how I think of Donna, as an aunt.Neither of us is prepared to accept our fate. This is clearest when it comes to our beliefs on equal rights and justice. I won’t stand for any kind of racism and will argue that point if I see something unfair going on. As a younger woman, in the US, Donna worked as a social worker and is also quite the activist.If someone expects something of me, I’m probably not going to comply. Donna has that fight, too. I don’t want that to ever end.Donna I was immediately impressed by Audrey. She was signing us up for singing lessons and had her two young children with her. They didn’t want to be there, but she had them under control and, as a former teacher, I know what that takes. I knew we’d get our money’s worth and I never missed a lesson.She drove past me once at the bus stop, in the rain, and gave me a lift to the class every week from then on. I wasn’t used to that type of kindness since I moved to Manchester, England, from Indiana, US, in 1968.There’s a tendency that if someone likes you, you like them back, and, put simply, that works here. She has a stimulating personality and I was struck by her confidence and independence. She’s a problem-solver, enjoys work and is generous. She is busy, but I know if I call with something important, she will always give me the time.Audrey feels like family to me. I don’t have family myself, and her husband and children are wonderful. They join me for Thanksgiving each year. We go to a restaurant and I enjoy the family atmosphere and being around young people I find they are usually more open-minded than their parents or grandparents. We are comfortable together – no airs and graces.I am not very mobile now. Without Audrey I might be housebound. I think of her as my next-of-kin. Her friendship means the world to me. My peers are dying and sometimes, at my age, it can feel there is nothing to look forward to. Audrey keeps me in the queue to live.John A group of us had tickets to V festival in 2009 and a mate said a guy called Dave, who was a bit older, would give us a lift. I’m not sure what I was expecting, but he didn’t look his age. He turned up in his BMW and talked about horsepower for five hours. I thought he was boring as hell. But the next day he brought out a mini barbecue and great food, and I figured, maybe he’s not so bad after all.We live around the corner from each other so we started meeting at the pub or watching our mate’s band play. I came to realise he is not just fun but a truly kind soul. He wants people to be happy and would help anyone. He doesn’t do it for adulation he doesn’t like to see people struggling. If I rang him this second and said, “I need £1,000 and to get to France today”, he would be outside in a car within the hour.Being around someone like Dave, who is so full of life, is refreshing. We both like talking to people. We’re competitive and there’s an element of one-upmanship to our friendship, like who is funnier. At Christmas, we set ourselves a six-pack challenge to get in shape by summer, which we’re taking far too seriously. We fall out all the time, mostly about politics (I’m more leftwing and he is more rightwing), then we’re best mates again. We still go to festivals.Our friendship is fun, but it goes a lot deeper. I don’t know if he looks at me as some sort of weird son. I look up to him in some ways. My dad died when I was 19 and Dave is someone I can open up to about that loss where I wouldn’t with others. There’s no judgment, no condescension.Time with him always brings the unexpected. I can meet him for a drink at 1pm on a Friday and get home at 3pm on Saturday. The funny thing is we don’t have much in common. He loves cars, I couldn’t care less. I love sport, he thinks football is called soccer. But I’ve got somebody who I can forever take the mick out of for being older than me. If I was in bother and could only make one call, it would be to Dave.Dave My first impression of John was formed when he jumped into my car with a mutual friend of ours. I thought he was a bit ignorant because he didn’t want to join in our conversation about cars but he works as a journalist and so I thought he must have something about him which, it turns out, he does.John is massively into music, which is why he loves festivals, but I just went for the party. It was the first festival I’d been to since 1984.Our friendship was a gradual process. I counselled him through his orce. I also counselled his ex-wife, who was part of our friendship group, because I’ve learned never to take sides – something I’ve tried to teach him.We both like attention and if one is getting more, the other won’t like it. We moan about each other, but he’s very loyal. Having a mate who doesn’t take himself too seriously is great. We go to the gym together and, mostly, we go drinking. I wear my heart on my sleeve and he’s more closed, so I can drag things out of him. We’re just comfortable with each other and can laugh in any situation.I’ve never noticed the age difference. I suppose I’m paying it forward at the moment, so he can push me around in a wheelchair in my old age.Sian I met Dilys in Cardiff, where we both live, at an event called Superwoman, in 2013. We were both invited to speak and were at the same table. Dilys had a big reputation for her charity work with disabled people, as well as for being the world’s oldest female solo skyer. I was asked to talk about entrepreneurship and my media marketing company. We hit it off, and she roped me into my first skye, despite my fear of heights. I thought she was amazing and the way I want to be as I grow older. I meet people all the time, but connections like ours are rare. For the first time in a long while, I feel as if I fit in. She celebrates my overambitious nature, and understands why I have sometimes found it hard in circles of my own age.She’s the first person I ring when anything good or bad happens. She advises me on my love life, work and how to be a better person. It is always honest, and informed by her experiences. I get scared in relationships, for example. Dilys doesn’t want me to end up alone and is worried I will follow in her independent footsteps. She calms me down when I’m flighty or put up defences, and teaches me to see things from other people’s point of view, and to conduct myself with grace. She’s one of a kind.We love to sit with a takeaway and listen to Mozart. We like films and the theatre. When we’re giggling in a cab, taxi drivers ask how we met, but we never think of our age gap. She has more energy and can out-dance me. My family see how much good she does me. We’re straight-talking and speak nearly every day, so we invest in our friendship. I often walk into Dilys’s house when I’m stressed and within seconds I’ve chilled out. She’s like soul food.Dilys I could see Sian was solid gold. This glamorous, lively woman talked about being an entrepreneur, and her love for her father, and I thought she was more able than most. We just clicked.She started inviting me places. I went to the races with her, not the sort of thing I normally do. The new experiences we share help to keep me alive. She brought fun back into my life when I was working hard to run a charity. She’s a bubble of energy and warmth. She has integrity and likes me for who I am.When I was ill last Christmas, she came in like a hurricane, with decorations, firewood, champagne. I felt afraid and tearful, and she told me that wasn’t allowed. She really rescued me.I feel I understand her because she represents my younger self. I was a dancer and taught the art of movement in college. I was always a bit different mine wasn’t a typical path. I got married within six weeks but orced when my only son was seven. I was a free spirit. I’ve got the life I wanted, but it’s not always easy. I try to offer that perspective to Sian, without superiority or judgment.Sian isn’t a relation but feels like family. It’s a nontraditional friendship but our links are strong: we made them by choice.Rudolph Sara and I were at very different points in life when we became friends in 2008. I was on my third career and married with a toddler. Sara was in her 20s and wore a lot of spray tan. But we were both at the bottom of a new profession, as barristers, and that gave us common ground. I was coming to the end of my pupillage (the final part of training) and Sara was starting hers. We still work in the same office, practising immigration and asylum law. I thought she was witty, and liked hanging out with her. She thought I was scruffy and slapdash.Sara’s great company. She’s very clever. We enjoy a good gossip and she is an excellent enabler because she likes to eat and drink as much as I do.I’ve always been gregarious and had female friends, so it wasn’t a surprise to my wife, Clare. She and Sara get on well. We’ve been trying to get fit, and the three of us have a done a few 10km runs. No one has cast suspicions over our relationship at work – not to me, anyway. I find it depressing that a friendship of different sexes raises the question at all, but we don’t work in a gossipy environment.I’m tempted to say our age difference is inconsequential, but I don’t think that’s true. One thing it brings is perspective. A lot of people my age get complacent (if they think they’re successful) or fatalistic (if they think they’re a disappointment). The wind hasn’t changed yet for Sara, and that staves it off for me. I, in turn, can offer advice – with relationships or when she bought her first home. There’s an element of diplomacy when you deal with your generational peers. You know these are the folk against whom you are measured. That’s not the case with us. We tend to cooperate rather than compete.As relationships go, it’s quite honest. We get away with a fair degree of piss-taking because we’re confident enough in our mutual regard. I laugh at her for painting herself orange (the election of Trump has been a gift) and she mocks me for dressing like I found my clothes in a skip. She gets it in the neck for being stroppy and wet behind the ears, and I, apparently, am a grumpy old bastard.Sara When I moved to London in my 20s it was the furthest I had lived from home – north Wales – and I didn’t know anyone. Rudolph seemed approachable and made sure I had someone to go to for advice. He was a calming influence, both work-wise, and with time, personally. I remember talking to him about bad dates, and he became a great sounding board for problems with family or friends, advising me not to take things to heart. Having someone male, of a different age, to offer relationship advice has been valuable. I have come to consider him one of my closest friends. When I met my current boyfriend, it was really important to me that he liked Rudolph and vice versa.I didn’t think of him as being much older than me – until he invited me to his 50th birthday party. I’d never had friends who weren’t my own age. He was completely different. He was from a different background, for a start. Rudolph grew up with his parents in various countries I’m from a single-parent family, in which my sister and I were the first to go to university. For the job we do, however, neither of us is from the conventional background, so we have that in common. We are both state-school-educated, and neither of us had any family in the law or prior connections.He’s really laid-back, a bit of an old hippy. He’s not what you expect – in a good way. He has some great stories and has travelled to really random places, like Transylvania on honeymoon. We try to meet once a week for lunch. He’s introduced me to oysters, spicier food and authentic Chinese cuisine. I’ve spent a lot of time with his wife and kids. He’s been to most of my birthdays, and I’ve been to his. People think it’s strange that we’re friends, but he’s easy to get along with and preconceptions soon go out the window. He’ll talk to anybody, so a night out is always better with him there. He’s just a cool guy.John Irfan and I met in Oxford in May 2016. We were on a work course and I didn’t know anyone. I was sizing people up when Irfan plonked himself down and started talking. My first impression was that he was younger than me although, until now, I’ve never thought to ask his age. They say you form a view on someone within 10 seconds mine was that Irfan was worth spending time with. He’s earnest, a deep-talker, a quiet intellectual.We were both living in Manchester at the time and met for coffee. We both work in business: I’m a consultant (and a photographer) and Irfan is a project manager. We both coach and mentor people, too. Discussing this part of our lives quickly turned to more personal conversations and putting the world to rights. We bat all sorts of topics back and forth. Irfan now knows things about me that no one else does. He’s a visionary and a storyteller, and you feel better about the world when you’ve seen it through his eyes. It’s in both our natures to be startlingly open. I talk to people in lifts, and Irfan is from the same mould.I don’t see massive cultural differences although we both know there are nuances. I was brought up in a 1950s60s Irish Catholic immigrant family Irfan has a 1980s90s Pakistani immigrant upbringing. There are greater similarities than you might immediately see: respect, adherence to law and values. In particular, I admire his kindness to his mother, something that he does not from obligation but from his good nature.We’re at very different points in life. I’m a grandfather on my third marriage. He is just starting married life, yet I learn from him. He has taught me to stay calm and be kinder. I could count my true friends on my left hand. I trust Irfan. He’s non-judgmental. He listens to problems without telling you what to do. He’s also a hoot, without knowing it.Irfan From early on, I found John easy to talk to. I don’t like wafflers, and he gets straight to the point. He puts a different frame on things. He has a confidence which I think comes with age, so it stood out.Even though we had culturally very different upbringings, I quickly found similarities. We are both ambitious and seek to get the best out of ourselves and other people. We are both comfortable with who we are.I soon found myself seeking his advice on personal matters, for example when I met my wife – despite the fact he’s on his third marriage, so arguably not the best person to look to for relationship guidance. He came to my wedding. I’ve met his wife and he’s met mine, but the bond of friendship is very much ours.John does his best thinking while he’s walking. That’s one of the most useful things I’ve learned from him. I moved to London last year, and if I’ve had a difficult day or week, I will often walk to gather my thoughts. Now we are in different cities, we see each other once every three months, speak once a month, and text and WhatsApp messages fill the spaces in between.He pays for the meals, because he has more money. And we always have a story to tell. Our age gap brings a real sense of perspective to our conversations. He’s been there and done that, while I’m still finding things out about myself.• If you’re inspired to form an intergenerational friendship, you could try: Meetup, which helps you organise and attend events covering a wide range of interests goodgym, a community of runners who stop off on runs to visit older people or Nextdoor, a local social networking app for your neighbourhood.Commenting on this piece?

But the same qualities that make lamb so ideal for long and slow cooking – the rich meat, high in fat and flavour – also work their magic when you cook it for a much shorter time. Today’s dishes range from less than half an hour’s cooking (a Chinese stir-fry) to more than six hours (berbere-spiced shredded meat in pastry). You choose.Lamb and cumin is a pairing you’d normally associate with Middle Eastern cooking, but it is also a staple in the north-west of China, where there is a large Muslim community. According to my Taiwanese friend Gary Chang, there’s only one heat when stir-frying, and that’s “very hot”, so keep the flame high to achieve a good sear, and use a wok if you have one, or a high-sided saute pan if you don’t.Prep 15 minMarinate Up to 1 hrCook 25 minServes 4700g boneless lamb shoulder, skin, silverskin and gristle removed, then cut into 6cm x 5mm strips2 tsp cornflour1½ tbsp ground cumin90ml dark soy sauce60ml Shaoxing rice wine1 tbsp caster sugar2 aubergines, cut into 6cm x 2cm piecesSalt60ml vegetable oil2cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and cut into thin strips2 tbsp cumin seeds 3 red chillies, finely sliced on an angle (deseeded, if you prefer less heat)3 spring onions, finely sliced on an angle15g coriander, leaves and stalks separated1½ tsp rice-wine vinegarPat the lamb dry, then put it in a bowl with the cornflour, a tablespoon of ground cumin, half the dark soy sauce, half the Shaoxing rice wine and the sugar, toss to coat and leave to marinate for at least 30 minutes and up to an hour.Toss the aubergine with the remaining cumin and half a teaspoon of salt. Heat half the oil in a large wok or saute pan on a high flame, then fry the aubergine, stirring occasionally, for five minutes, until it’s beginning to brown.Add the ginger and one tablespoon of soy, and fry for three minutes more, stirring very often, until the aubergine is a dark golden brown. Remove the aubergine from the wok, wipe the pan clean, then return it to the heat. Put the cumin seeds in the hot pan and, taking care not to burn them, dry fry for around 30 seconds, until fragrant, then tip into a saucer.Return the pan to a high heat and, once it’s smoking, add the rest of the oil and swirl around. Add a third of the lamb, separating the pieces with a spoon, so they don’t clump together, then leave to sear undisturbed for two minutes. Stir-fry for another two minutes, until crisp and golden brown all over, then lift out of the wok with a slotted spoon, leaving the fat in the pan. Repeat with the rest of the lamb in two more batches, then drain and discard half of the fat.Return all the meat to the wok and, over a high heat, quickly toss with the aubergines, the remaining soy and rice wine, the chillies, spring onions, coriander and toasted cumin seeds, for only a few seconds, to warm through. Transfer to a platter, drizzle over the vinegar and serve straight away. Vermouth is an unsung ingredient that goes just that bit further than white wine (though the latter does make a decent substitute here), because it adds sweet, sharp and floral notes all at the same time. A bottle goes a long way, so keep one in the cupboard to elevate sauces and stews.4 small fennel bulbs (about 900g in total)500g minced lamb30g fresh white breadcrumbs, from about 1 slice of bread1 small onion, peeled and finely chopped 20g parsley leaves, finely chopped15g dill, finely chopped5 anchovy fillets, drained and finely chopped 1 tbsp fennel seeds, lightly toasted and crushed40g currantsSalt and black pepper2 tbsp olive oil200ml white vermouth (or dry white wine)6 plum tomatoes, roughly chopped 1 lemon – peel shaved into long strips, then cut into wedges, to serve20g pine nuts, lightly toastedTrim the fennel, discarding the stalks but reserving the fronds to garnish. Cut each bulb in half lengthways, then cut into 2cm-wide wedges.Put the mince in a large bowl with the breadcrumbs, onion, parsley, dill, anchovies, fennel seeds, currants, half a teaspoon of salt and a generous grind of black pepper. Mix to combine, then shape into about 30 golf-ball-sized balls.On a medium-high flame, heat the oil in a large saute pan for which you have a lid. Once hot, fry the half the meatballs for five minutes, turning regularly, until browned all over. Transfer to a plate with a slotted spoon, then repeat with the remaining meatballs.In the same pan, fry the fennel wedges for four minutes, turning them a few times, until browned all over. Add the vermouth and, once it’s bubbling, stir in the tomatoes, lemon peel, half a teaspoon of salt and plenty of pepper. Once the mix has come to a boil, lower the heat to medium-low, cover the pan and leave to simmer gently for 10 minutes, until the fennel is starting to soften.Return the meatballs to the pan, stir them through, cover and leave to cook for 30 minutes, until the fennel is soft and the meatballs are cooked.Remove the lid, increase the heat to medium-high and cook for five more minutes, stirring constantly, until the sauce thickens. Remove from the heat, sprinkle with the pine nuts and reserved fennel fronds, and serve with lemon wedges.These can be prepared in advance and frozen or refrigerated until ready to cook (remember to defrost before baking). They are also good the day after they are baked, reheated quickly in a hot oven. They make a perfect snack or starter when served with a simple green salad and some yoghurt. 1.5kg lamb shoulder on the bone (ie, about half a shoulder)1 tbsp berbere spice mix75ml olive oilSalt1 onion, peeled and finely chopped 3 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed30g barberries1 large potato, peeled and roughly grated1 tbsp maple syrup20g mint leaves, roughly chopped100g extra-mature cheddar, roughly grated500g filo pastry (12 sheets measuring 30cm x 30cm)150g unsalted butter, melted2 tsp nigella seedsHeat the oven to 160C320Fgas 2½. Rub the lamb all over with two teaspoons of the berbere, two tablespoons of oil and half a teaspoon of salt. Put in a high-sided baking dish, cover securely with foil and bake for three and a half to four hours, turning once or twice along the way. The meat should be falling off the bone and soft all the way through. Once cool enough to handle, shred the meat finely: you should end up with 450-500g.Meanwhile, heat three tablespoons of oil in a large saute pan on a medium-high flame, then fry the onion, stirring frequently, for eight minutes, until soft and golden brown. Add the garlic, barberries and the remaining teaspoon of berbere, and fry for two minutes more, until aromatic. Add the meat, potato, maple syrup and three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt, and cook for six minutes, stirring often, until the potato is semi-cooked. Take off the heat, stir in the mint and cheese, and leave to cool. You should now have about 900g of filling.Heat the oven to 180C350Fgas 4. Take two sheets of filo pastry, brush them with butter, then overlap the shorter ends to make one long sheet that is 60cm long x 30cm wide. With the long edge facing you, take 100g of the filling and spoon it evenly in a line along that edge. Carefully roll up the filo, encasing the filling, to make one long sausage. Next, starting at one end, roll the sausage into a tight coil, or “snail”. Transfer to a large baking tray (about 32cm x 32cm), and repeat with the remaining pastry and filling. Brush the snails all over with the remaining butter, sprinkle with the nigella seeds and a pinch of salt, and bake for 35-40 minutes, until golden brown. Serve warm with salad and yoghurt for dipping."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7014e862c35271bdd5b3b91d2a295f7f79c530b9/0_74_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a244be16a81438bc54374d6e301765fb","title":"anthony bourdain a life in pictures","story":"TV chef and travel host Anthony Bourdain, who has died at 61, was best known for his book Kitchen Confidential and his long-running TV series No Reservations"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/346384fe651f9fe61f20adbe7357e03035f0a6e2/694_233_1936_1162/master/1936.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31dec85e63a47222d085bece16737cc4","title":"kanye west kid cudi kids see ghosts review","story":"One week on from the underwhelming, muddled solo album Ye, West is newly galvanised by Cudi’s stoner wisdomChristian scripture teaches that on the seventh day, God looked over the world, nodded to himself in satisfaction and settled down for a hard-earned rest. But seven days after unveiling his own imperfect creation, self-proclaimed god Kanye West has had no time for slumber. Kids See Ghosts, West’s joint project with Kid Cudi, has arrived just one week on from his polarising, half-baked eighth solo album Ye – the worst record in his previously unimpeachable catalogue.Zeus chained Prometheus to a rock to have his liver pecked out. Kali trampled Shiva while wearing a skirt of human arms and severed heads. Now here comes West, whose rollout of Ye was punctured by his courting of America’s grim forces and offensive commentary on the history of slavery. The controversies that eternally follow West had always dissolved when it came to music-making – the component of his legacy that will endure long after the reality TV shows are pulled from the air and the pageantry around him turns to dust – but Ye suggested that even the music had lost its godlike vision and reach. Thankfully, Kids See Ghosts succeeds by avoiding most of the pitfalls that damaged his solo release. Ye teased the idea that the cabin-in-the-woods seclusion of Wyoming – where West has been bunkered down with collaborators – would spark trenchant, introspective meditations. Instead it featured the occasional arbitrary nod to his oft-discussed id and the news cycle that West himself had forged, sprayed with a high-end sheen and stitched together in time to meet a needlessly self-imposed deadline. The record was a prom student rushing down the stairs and out to the limo in a dishevelled, half-on tux.Enter Kid Cudi, whose colouring of West’s sound stretches all the way back to the anguished, melodic synthpop of 2008 record 808s \u0026amp Heartbreak. With him as co-pilot, Kids See Ghosts is a shotgun blast to the senses, swarming with blistering electronics, laser-cut samples, psychedelic crescendos and edges as blurry as a half-remembered dream. Like Ye and West’s recently helmed Pusha T record Daytona, the album is just seven tracks long. Kanye is due to produce two more records, presumably in this format, with Nas and Teyana Taylor. The brevity is effective as Kanye and Cudi stack ideas on top of ideas, packing the 23 minutes with as much creativity as possible. The chemistry is that of two old friends who no longer have to second-guess each other’s instincts.Ye felt sonically depressed, like every beat had been done before but better. Here, West stretches himself. Opener, Feel The Love, is a glorious riposte to the “love is all you need” hippie ideology West was pushing on Twitter just a couple weeks ago, unleashing sinister keys, a typically barbed verse from Pusha and a manic impression of a gun from Kanye that rivals Big Shaq’s ridiculous rasps. On the title track, West swathes Yasiin Bey’s voice in gentle electronics, while Cudi’s spiritual hums match the rumbling beat. Hearing the producer artfully fold the orchestration into the voices of his collaborators shows that his almighty ear for music is back.It would be horribly inaccurate to cast Cudi as simply a facilitator for West’s rediscovered form. In fact, Kids See Ghosts could be viewed primarily as an exercise in highlighting all of Cudi’s strengths while erasing the more outlandish proclivities. It is Kanye who is frequently pulled into Cudi’s lane and not vice versa. Reborn could pass for an early Cudi cut as he blesses himself over dinky piano keys. Freeee (Ghost Town, Pt. 2), the album’s undoubted centrepiece, is an acid-laced trip into bohemian spiritualism. Rap-rock hybrids like this are often execrable: it’s impossible to envision Kanye making it without Cudi in the booth to summon the spirit of flower power.But what’s perhaps most striking about Kids See Ghosts is how much both artists’ writing shines. West’s lyrics are as intricate and affecting as they have been in ages. On Cudi Montage, he lays out a brutal cycle of violence and the pain of loss before signing off with a shout-out to Alice Johnson, the African American grandmother jailed for over two decades on a non-violent drug charge who Kim Kardashian West recently – and successfully – lobbied for release. In these moments, he momentarily disentangles himself from the self-spun tabloid web. The spirit of the artist who once decried the capitalist grind on Spaceship, and called out George W Bush on live TV, again seems palpable. Cudi, meanwhile, indulges in the stoner wisdom that matches his languid flows: “Many things that will trouble you  Look beyond for a feelin’ like you never knew  Reachin’ out, huntin’ for the truth” Cudi needs to believe in more than the god sitting in the studio next to him.Kids See Ghosts will go down as a minor release in West’s canon, and this oddball odyssey to Wyoming won’t be remembered as one of his best eras. Yet the album does something he needed. It reasserts him as a fun, thrilling rap music-maker that tests the genre’s boundaries. Sometimes, gods need company."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad9d5b54d4aa798070af4c9c33839d1189df087b/0_105_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a2d4b4598a808aa08621e6d757bc483d","title":"nicola sturgeon calls for scotland to be given powers over migration","story":"SNP leader will tell conference that hostile environment is harming country’s interests Nicola Sturgeon will make a plea for vital migration powers to be devolved to Scotland, as her newly elected party deputy, Keith Brown, called on independence supporters to “get ready” for a second referendum.Addressing delegates at the Scottish National party’s summer conference in Aberdeen on Saturday afternoon, Sturgeon will say: “Westminster’s hostile environment to migration is not just a slogan. It is has a real impact on our public services and our economy.” Noting that, since the Brexit vote in June 2016, there has been a significant drop in the number of EU nurses registering in the UK, the SNP leader and Scotland’s first minister will insist: “Scotland is a welcoming country – our prosperity and our public services depend on it. If Westminster cannot, or will not, act in our best interests, it is time that our own parliament was able to do so. It’s time for powers over migration to come to Scotland.” Earlier on Friday, Keith Brown was elected SNP deputy leader, following a ballot of the party’s 118,000 plus membership. Brown, who is the Scottish government’s economy secretary, told delegates that another referendum was “undoubtedly ahead”. “While we wait for clarity on Brexit ... the challenge is for all of us in the party and the wider Yes movement across Scotland to get ready.”The contest to replace former MP Angus Robertson as party deputy had been dominated by questions about the timing of another independence referendum. There have been several public skirmishes in recent months about whether Sturgeon should deploy the mandate for a new referendum that she claims from the 2016 Holyrood elections before the parliamentary term ends in 2021. Alternatively, she could delay until an unarguable economic case for independence has been built and public opinion is more favourable.Enjoying the sunshine on the east coast, both activists and politicians were buoyed by two pieces of research released overnight before the start of the conference. A poll for the Times found the SNP continuing to marshal a substantial lead in both Westminster and Holyrood voting intentions, despite being in government for more than a decade. The survey by YouGov gives the party a 13-point lead over the Tories and a 17-point lead over Labour at Westminster, while at Holyrood the lead is 14 over the Tories and 19 over Labour. The YouGov survey also found voters continuing to switch from Labour to the SNP, suggesting that the election of Corbyn ally Richard Leonard as Scottish Labour leader last November has yet to bolster the party’s fortunes. The SNP’s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, used his address to conference to accuse Labour of effectively colluding with the Tories by failing to provide a strong enough opposition to Theresa May’s plans for a hard Brexit. Challenging Jeremy Corbyn to ditch his “ludicrous” stance on Brexit, Blackford said: “Labour must join with us and give full support to staying in the single market and the customs union to mitigate against the risks of a hard Brexit.” The YouGov poll also revealed that Sturgeon’s personal approval ratings have slipped to -2, from an unprecedented +56 point positive rating around the time of the general election of 2015, when the SNP won 56 of 59 Scottish seats in a landslide victory.There will be no scheduled discussion during the main conference of the report from the party’s Sustainable Growth Commission, published last week. The report intended to provide a fresh economic prospectus for independence to overcome what many see as the failings of the 2014 campaign’s arguments around currency and jobs.The report, which attracted criticism from opponents as well as supporters on the left of the independence movement, was referenced at several fringe events. At a debate organised by the Institute for Economic Affairs, veteran former SNP MP George Kerevan described the report as “a little too conservative for my case”, saying “if you start risking people at the other end – the poor, the unemployed, the people stuck in dead-end jobs ... then what is independence for?” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df960a74bafabe383d38e32db4a23e2e83e2019e/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5aa9754fc7e8ec2ff4a91d975d61563e","title":"more than 1m families waiting for social housing in england","story":"Shelter figures show 1.15 million households on waiting lists last year with only 290,000 homes made availableMore than 1 million families are stuck on waiting lists for social housing in England as the number of council homes in Britain slumps to a record low. Figures from the housing and homelessness charity Shelter show that a total of 1.15 million households were on waiting lists last year, with only 290,000 homes made available, leaving a national shortfall of more than 800,000 homes. Six London authorities were among the top 10 councils with the biggest shortfall, with areas including Brighton, Blackpool and Strood in Kent also struggling. In Newham, east London, 25,729 households were on the waiting list last year, with only 588 social homes available. In Brighton and Hove there were 24,392 families on lists, and 949 homes available. Shelter said the gap was caused by a lack of newbuild social homes, and many existing homes being sold off through the right-to-buy scheme and not being replaced. Polly Neate, the charity’s chief executive, said the fact that some survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire were still homeless a year on from the disaster had “totally shaken people’s trust in the safety net the state supposedly provides”.“Imagine, then, how frustrating life must be for the millions of people elsewhere in the country who have been stuck on waiting lists, often for years on end,” she said. “This is not just confined to London but happening right across the country, from Brighton to Blackpool. Families are unable to get settled and unable to get on with their lives. “The Grenfell tragedy must mark a turning point in our nation’s approach to social housing and its tenants. We clearly need a bold new plan for social housing so families are not condemned to waiting lists but given safe, secure and affordable housing as quickly as possible.”The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said more than 357,000 new affordable properties had been delivered since 2010.It said it would be investing a further £9bn in affordable homes, including £2bn to help councils and housing associations build properties for social rent, while also giving councils the power to borrow £1bn to build new properties in areas with the greatest affordability pressures.The £2bn was promised by Theresa May last year but critics, including Tory council leaders, say this is not enough to fix Britain’s housing crisis. Last month Roger Madelin, one of the country’s top property developers, told the  the UK’s system of funding social housing was “nuts” and called for higher taxes to speed up building."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2831ab86bff2fe95a71892add567f13ed518dfb/787_937_4198_2519/master/4198.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=163d81fc312d6227e29e38d82b3a0dce","title":"enaam ahmed european f3 hungaroring lewis hamilton ayrton senna","story":"Young British driver has his eyes on even bigger prizes after hitting the front early in his European F3 careerAs far as champagne moments go, the young British driver Enaam Ahmed has already pulled off an absolute corker. After a stunning double win in the European F3 series at the Hungaroring, the 18-year-old hurled himself from the top step and slammed the bottle to the floor, blowing its contents sky high, into his own face and sending his baseball cap cartwheeling. It was exuberant, spectacular stuff that reflects the driving and character of this refreshingly forthright teenager. More important, such is his promise it is not likely to be the last time he sprays bubbly with abandon.His celebration had not been planned but Ahmed is a singular character who likes doing things his own way. “It was completely spontaneous,” he says. “The cork blew my cap off and just missed my eye but I will do it again, it might become my signature move.”His confidence in a return to the top step is justified by a rookie season in European F3 that has far exceeded expectations and which he hopes will ultimately lead to a seat in Formula One. Yet he very nearly did even not make it to the grid this season.Of British Asian descent, Ahmed grew up in west London to mother Samina, an Indian Kenyan and dad Shami, who is Pakistani. Neither had any interest in, or experience of, motor racing. Lewis Hamilton’s F1 title in 2008 changed the eight‑year‑old’s life, however.“It was Lewis that got me into it,” he explains. “He caught my eye, because he was the first black driver. He caught everyone’s eye in Britain.”Fittingly, he began karting in 2008 at Rye House, where the four‑times world champion had raced as a youngster. By the time Ahmed was 14 he was considering making it a career. The success that followed convinced him it was the right route. That year he won five karting championships, including the world and European titles.It was a pivotal moment. “Racing was the only thing in my life that made me fully lit at all times,” he says with obvious passion. “Everyone has something they are good at and I loved racing, I loved the competition.”He graduated to British F3 in 2016 and, having learned the ropes, made an extraordinary assault on the championship the next year, taking the title by 164 points. In doing so he eclipsed one of the greats, claiming 13 wins, one more than Ayrton Senna managed in 1983.Ahmed remembers it as a special moment, one that he had earned with his distinctive and decisive style. In the final race at Donington, he was behind his team-mate Cameron Das. Enjoying a settled car with understeer, Ahmed relishes late braking and, determined not be denied a 13th triumph, made a late lunge at the Melbourne hairpin to take the lead and the win.But there it almost came to a halt. The move to European F3 – the stepping stone towards F2 – is prohibitively expensive and with no major team backing it looked like it might not happen. His parents went as far as putting their house on the market to raise funds for him to have a shot. It was on sale until December when finally he secured enough backing to enable the family to keep a roof above their heads.This season, expected to be a learning process against tough and experienced opposition, has been a revelation. He took his first podium in the opening round at Pau before his wins at the Hungaroring last weekend. He now leads the championship from the Ferrari academy driver Guanyu Zhou and Red Bull junior Dan Ticktum.There is some way to go but Ahmed is cautiously confident. “I think I could win it,” he says. “Before I didn’t believe it was possible but the goal is now in my sights.”There is more than raw talent here. Ahmed has been putting the hours in at every level, making a point of working on the cars post-race. “It makes for a lot of camaraderie with the guys,” he says. “Every team I work with I do the same and I feel I gain a lot of respect.”It has by no means been an easy ride but he insists at least he has not had to deal with any racism, his talent on the track doing the talking. “It’s quite easy to think that if people don’t like you on track it is racism,” he says. “It’s not. You have to earn respect, that’s what matters. No one likes a terrible driver.”His childhood dream of F1 remains the target, potentially painful for his mother who is still too fearful to watch him race, but nonetheless Ahmed will be throwing absolutely everything into achieving it, as he did on the podium in Hungary. “In racing you have to be on it at all times, you can’t leave anything on the table. You have to always be there. This was the only sport that got my adrenaline pumping. I just love it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75dff421155a0c14ecf1cd16a63dbd2bf395d841/152_124_3548_2128/master/3548.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8ce4fcae6e8614469f2093c9821443f","title":"simona halep wins french open womens title sloane stephens","story":"• Halep comes from set and break down to win 3-6, 6-4, 6-1• World No 1 finally claims first slam title after three final defeatsA year after blowing the French Open final from a set and a break up, Simona Halep won the title from a set and a break down, leaving Sloane Stephens spent and battered at the end of a wonderful conclusion to the tournament.A grand slam champion at last, after failing here against Maria Sharapova in 2014 and Jelena Ostapenko last year, as well as in this year’s Australian Open final, Halep let the tears flow the very second that Stephens’s last ball billowed the net. Nadia Comaneci hugged her tight, as she clambered into the stands to celebrate with family and friends, including her manager, Virginia Ruzici, the only other Romanian to lift the Coupe Suzanne Lenglen, 40 years ago.It was a heartwarming victory, one that looked unlikely for long stretches, but inevitable at the end, Halep dragging herself out of a numbing torpor to crush the American 3-6, 6-4, 6-1.“In the last game, I felt I could not breath any more,” she said. “I just did not want to repeat what happened last year. I am really thankful this has happened in Paris, my special city.”After a rousing burst to hold at the start, Halep lost her grip to gift Stephens an early break, but it did little to curb her no-nonsense hitting.Both players struck with full-blooded power from deep in a series of knife-edge rallies, before Stephens broke for a second time. And on they smote, the crowd captivated by their commitment. Only Camila Giorgi has been able to out-hit Stephens this tournament, though, and she patiently absorbed the best that Halep had to offer.Although Halep had already secured her world No 1 ranking by reaching the final, there was much more at stake here: her reputation. It would be going some to say she has choked on the big occasion, but she certainly has wrestled with her temperament under pressure.Stephens, meanwhile, remained a picture of calm, as she has done every time she has made a final, winning all six of them, none more career-changing than the US Open last year. That victory over her friend and compatriot Madison Keys in front of their home support heightened her thirst for the game’s biggest prizes and, when she beat Keys again in the semi-finals here, she showed there was no softness in her, just a steely determination to make the most of her talent. Where once there was petulance and attitude now their is contentment.Even when her level dipped and Halep worked her way back into the first-set fight, Stephens did not sway from her steady rhythm. Watching from side-on, the drawn-out exchanges were mesmeric, and Halep sucked it up to stay in contention at 3-5.She needed a change of gear – and a drop-shot that looked almost an afterthought caught everyone by surprise, to snatch a break point. Reverting to her programmed ways, she struck a forehand wide and the set was gone, in 42 minutes.Halep then needed a line-scorching forehand to save at the start of the second, but Stephens conjured a wonderful running save and cross-court chip to break again.Stephens’s strokes were flowing as smooth as Tupelo Honey now, and Halep was straining to stay with her. While the dirt near the net remained pristine, the players were digging trenches at either baseline, as they tested each other’s strength and technique to failure.As despair threatened to overwhelm her, she grabbed three break points, took the first and was back in the contest. It was the shift she had been waiting nearly an hour for.She held to love. Her fans found fresh voice. All of a sudden, her risky shots were landing clean. Stephens’s legs slowed. Her clarity of purpose deserted her. Halep broke again. It was the American’s turn to struggle – and she responded by breaking back to love and holding to 30.After looking as if she were about to trample Stephens underfoot, Halep had to dig deep as the rallies lengthened once more. But, hammering the backhand and waiting for a short reply to kill the point, she broke to level at a set apiece.Having avoided calamity, Halep had conviction in her athletic strut once more, looking altogether the more dominant player at the start of the decider. Still slugging away at her opponent’s increasingly weary backhand, she ground her way to a priceless 3-0 in 11 minutes. Having been on the bus home half an hour earlier, she was back on track. The title was hers to lose.The challenge for Stephens was not only to rediscover her touch and precision, but to find a second wind. This was the point when Halep faded against Ostapenko. However, when her passing shot clipped the net to confound Stephens’s response, she must have known it was finally her day. And, after a brilliant leaping backhand volley forced a bungled, close-quarters response from Stephens for another break, Halep’s coach, Darren Cahill, jumped from his seat, not a common site.The journey from there to the finish line was relatively stress-free. When a solid but not blinding serve turned Stephens’s racket to rubber and the ball sailed long, she was one game from elation.Stephens found a late gasp of resistance to save losing the set to love, but it was futile.The full-stop to the story arrived just past two hours as Halep found her first ace before finishing the job with a serve that Stephens could do no more than bat into the net."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d689431d1388bc8babf5835943954e0b27a903b/0_52_3420_2052/master/3420.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=656531ff768c68dcd43d38804c5b4773","title":"england v south africa first womens odi live","story":"45th over: South Africa 187-3 (Lee 86, du Preez 36) A wide slower ball from Gunn is blazed over extra cover for four by Lee. She has struck the ball so cleanly throughout the innings. South Africa need three to win.44th over: South Africa 180-3 (Lee 80, du Preez 35) Ten to win.43rd over: South Africa 177-3 (Lee 78, du Preez 34) A fine shot from du Preez, who pulls Brunt smoothly for four to bring up the fifty partnership. A dragged pull brings four more, and the last ball of the over is driven beautifully down the ground for two. Brunt ends with figures of 10-2-31-1. 42nd over: South Africa 167-3 (Lee 78, du Preez 24) Lee has an almighty heave at Marsh, dragging the ball back onto her body. England went up for LBW but there was a clear inside edge. Just one run from a good over. 41st over: South Africa 166-3 (Lee 78, du Preez 23) Brunt, who has two overs remaining, returns to the attack. A loose stroke from du Preez flies over backward point for one, another moment of frustration for England. This match is over.40th over: South Africa 163-3 (Lee 77, du Preez 21) Sarah Taylor misses a stumping chance! I’ve seen it all now. du Preez charged Marsh and missed, but the partially unsighted Taylor could not take the ball cleanly.“How definite is ‘definite’ (34th over)?” says Smylers. “CricketHer, at the ground, is claiming the catch was good, despite how it looked on TV.”39th over: South Africa 155-3 (Lee 76, du Preez 15) Gunn strays onto leg stump and is dragged around the corner for four by the superb Lee. She could still make her second ODI hundred: she needs 24, with 35 points remaining on the table.38th over: South Africa 151-3 (Lee 72, du Preez 14) Laura Marsh returns to the attack. An entirely forgettable over yields two runs. South Africa need 39 from 72 balls. 37th over: South Africa 149-3 (Lee 71, du Preez 13) Jenny Gunn replaces Sophie Ecclestone (10-0-32-0), and du Preez cuffs her down the ground for four more. It wasn’t the cleanest strike but once it cleared mid-on it raced away.36th over: South Africa 144-3 (Lee 70, du Preez 9) du Preez gets her first boundary, crashing Shrubsole through the covers. Shrubsole ends a good spell of bowling with figures of 10-0-36-2. It looks like there will be no miracle today.35th over: South Africa 137-3 (Lee 70, du Preez 3) The wicket of Lee would have given England a chance of slowly asphyxiating South Africa’s lower middle order. While she is at the crease, it’s hard to see South Africa losing this game. 34th over: South Africa 136-3 (Lee 69, du Preez 2) It would be presumptuous to say Brunt cheated by claiming that catch. It’s possible she knew the ball had grazed the floor, though that’s far from certain as it did end up cleanly in her hands. It certainly wasn’t as bad as, say, Steve Waugh against Brian Lara in 1994-95.Yes, the ball definitely touched the ground and Lee is returning to the middle.Is Lee about to be reprieved? There’s a bit of controversy here, because replays suggested Brunt may have grassed that catch and South Africa have told Lee to stay on the field. The umpires have now decided to go upstairs. England need a wicket now, ideally Lee, so there’s no point holding Shrubsole back. And she’s got the key wicket! Lee drove high to long off, where Brunt ed forward to take a superb catch!33rd over: South Africa 135-3 (Lee 68, du Preez 2) Good stuff from Ecclestone, who beats du Preez in the flight to end another thrifty over – two from it. South Africa need 55 from 17 overs. Should.32nd over: South Africa 133-3 (Lee 67, du Preez 1) Shrubsole, who has bowled excellently in this second spell, seams another beauty past du Preez’s outside edge. du Preez eventually gets off the mark from her 13th delivery. 31st over: South Africa 131-3 (Lee 66, du Preez 0) Lee swipes Ecclestone for a sweet straight six! That’s another belting stroke from Lee, who looks good for a second ODI hundred.30th over: South Africa 124-3 (Lee 59, du Preez 0) Shrubsole, who is not familiar with the concept of the lost cause, is making a lot of noise in an attempt to gee England up. She beats Lee outside off stump with a clever cutter Lee responds with a glorious chip over mid-off for four. Shot! While she is at the crease, South Africa will feel comfortable.29th over: South Africa 119-3 (Lee 54, du Preez 0) Ecclestone returns and bowls a good over, just one from it. England will try to squeeze the new batter du Preez and see what happens. South Africa need 71 from 21 overs.28th over: South Africa 118-3 (Lee 53, du Preez 0) Since you asked, India were 191 for three chasing 229 in the World Cup final, so England have a pretty powerful precedent to use as inspiration.Shrubsole gives England a bit of hope, bowling van Niekerk with a lovely slower delivery. She tried to glide it to third man but was beaten for lack of pace. It ends a high-class innings: 58 from 79 balls with 10 fours and one six.27th over: South Africa 114-2 (Lee 53, van Niekerk 54) Lee waves Brunt through backward point for four to bring up a calm, controlled half-century, her 16th in ODIs. This will be a huge win for South Africa, who have lost 19 of their last 20 completed ODIs against England. They have improved so much in the last few years.  26th over: South Africa 109-2 (Lee 49, van Niekerk 53) Anya Shrubsole is back in the attack. There’s no point England saving their best bowlers for the death overs, as there probably won’t be any. A good over goes for just a single. In other news, Ultra-Edge suggests there was a slight inside-edge from Lee before that LBW appeal in the previous over.25th over: South Africa 108-2 (Lee 49, van Niekerk 52) Brunt has a desperate LBW shout against Lee turned down by Tim Robinson. I’m pretty sure there was an inside edge. There was certainly a noise, though it may have been bat on pad, and it would have been very close if Lee didn’t hit it.24th over: South Africa 106-2 (Lee 48, van Niekerk 50) van Niekerk hammers Marsh for consecutive boundaries to reach a very accomplished fifty from just 61 balls. She has played some beautiful strokes, particularly through the covers and backward point.23rd over: South Africa 96-2 (Lee 47, van Niekerk 42) Brunt returns to the attack, with England in urgent need of a wicket. No sign of that, but she does restore a bit of order with some accurate wicket-to-wicket bowling.22nd over: South Africa 95-2 (Lee 47, van Niekerk 41) Lee lifts Marsh high over mid-off for four, a superb stroke that takes South Africa halfway to their target of 190. They are cruising to victory. 21st over: South Africa 87-2 (Lee 39, van Niekerk 41) In isolation this has been a fine spell from Ecclestone (6-0-20-0), but in the context of the match it probably isn’t enough for England. There’s a lot to like about her though, particular the variations in flight.20th over: South Africa 86-2 (Lee 38, van Niekerk 41) Laura Marsh replaces Nat Sciver and almost strikes when van Niekerk mishits a reverse sweep onto the knee of Sarah Taylor. I don’t know whether that goes down as a dropped catch it probably does for somebody as good as Taylor. 19th over: South Africa 80-2 (Lee 37, van Niekerk 37) Lee, beaten in the flight by Eccelstone, drags the ball this far wide of leg stump. That was a lovely bit of bowling from the impressive Ecclestone."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24b42529afea6c826e88e2c20531de60b4985f08/0_174_2354_1412/master/2354.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=813744fa23c5c54ccc5c0329090f7d5d","title":"french open 2018 sloane stephens simona halep live score","story":"Here’s Kevin Mitchell’s report from Roland Garros on Simona Halep’s long-awaited first grand slam victory. Thanks as always for following along with us and be sure to check back tomorrow for full coverage of the men’s final between Rafael Nadal and Dominic Thiem.She adds: “Last year it was tough to talk because I lost that match. I was dreaming about this moment since I was 14. Thank you for supporting me. I wanted this trophy to be here in France. Of course many congrats to Sloane. Last year you won US Open and you done a great job after those injuries. I know you will play many finals in the future. Good luck and take care of your body.”“Not the trophy I wanted but it’s still beautiful,” says Stephens in her runner-up remarks. “Congratulations on your first slam, it looks good on you. No one else I’d rather lose to than the No1 in the world.”She thanks Simona and her team and the tournament, wiping a few tears away, before passing off to Halep.“Honestly, I can’t believe it,” Halep says in the aftermath. “In last game I didn’t breathe anymore. I did everything I could. It’s amazing what is happening now.”What an inspired comeback from 12 months ago when Halep squandered a set and a break lead over Jeļena Ostapenko in the final. The world No1 has won a grand slam final for the first time in four tries and busted the narrative that she’s a player who comes up short in the big moments.Third set: Halep 3-6, 6-4, 6-1 Stephens: Stephens is not giving up without a fight.

Halep gifts her a point on a clumsy return, but forces deuce with a vicious backhand winner at the end of a lengthy rally.

A nice hold for Halep from love-30 down.Second set: Halep 3-6, 6-4 Stephens* (*denotes server): From 30-all, Stephens makes an error on a backhand and Halep has a look as a break point that could force a third set.

Second set: Halep 3-6, 4-4 Stephens* (*denotes server): Stephens runs out to 40-love, including her first ace of the afternoon, and has won seven straight points. She mixes in a few more unforced errors, but comes out in top on a baseline rally to earn the hold and they’re at 4-all in the second.Second set: *Halep 3-6, 4-3 Stephens (*denotes server): And just when it seems like the second set has slipped away from Stephens, she capitalizes on a series of forehand unforced errors by Halep for triple break point and winds up breaking at love when Halep goes wide on an inside-in return. All even in the second.Second set: Halep 3-6, 4-2 Stephens* (*denotes server): From 30-all, Stephens nets a backhand then a forehand and Halep breaks again.

Second set: Halep* 3-6, 1-2 Stephens (*denotes server): A great game by Halep, who comes up trump with a thrashing forehand to finish the job. Still a long way to go yet.

Second set: Halep 3-6, 0-2 Stephens* (*denotes server): Halep leaves the court wide open, allowing Stephens to gobble up the space and storm in at 30-15.

Second set: Halep* 3-6, 0-1 Stephens (*denotes server): Stephens comes out on top of a preposterous rally, which she clinches with a sweet, angled forehand, showcasing a glorious mix of agility and poise. Halep is outdoing Stephens in terms of forced errors, 17-6, and that’s conducive at an occasion like this. Stephens tries a drop shot at 15-0, but it plops into the net - a rare misstep from the American. Her defence has been great throughout the match and she stays in the point at 30-15 before sending another shot into the net. Then Halep plays a drop shot of her own! And it works beautifully as Stephens can’t quite get to it. Stephens shows her defence again though and a big serve takes the US Open champ to set point. Sloane then batters away at her opponent whose final shot of the set is VERY wide.Halep has a glimpse of daylight at 0-15 when Stephens is out of position but she can’t quit land her forehand where she needs to. Sloane then commits an error of her own sending a forehand wide to make it 15-30. It’s a rocky game for both players - Halep has a chance to bring up her first break point of the match at 30-30 but a sloppy shot ends that hope and Stephens survives. As much as Halep has looked a little tight in this match, Stephens has been superb. If Halep is committing errors, it’s because her opponent has put her under so much pressure she needs to switched on for every point in order to beat her. A welcome hold for Halep after Stephens nets at 40-30. How does Simona recover from that break? Well, she’s battling hard. She looks completely lost at 15-30 but somehow gets back into the point before an errant shot ends her hopes. She goes on to lose the game. Halep is giving it everything but Stephens is simply too good at the moment – and the unforced errors are starting to creep in.In the crowd is Jozy Altidore, who has a bit of time off this summer to follow his girlfriend Sloane Stephens now that the US had that little bit of misfortune around the World Cup. In fact, the TV feed cuts to Sloane warming up with a football before the match. Her close control is as good, if not a little better, than Jozy’s. Anyway, tennis: Halep has Stephens crashing around the baseline at 15-30 before an overhead at the net takes us to 30-30. But a crushing forehand is too good for Halep and we have our first break point. Stephens guides Halep around the court and she can’t get enough of a forehand and nets it. Halep has taken Navartilova’s advice and is being very aggressive compared to her performance last year. She gets a little more success than in Stephens’s first service game and takes her to 40-30 but can’t force a break point.Let’s see how Simona responds after the dominant game from Stephens. It’s not quite as smooth as the American’s effort and she looks more nervous than her opponent, although she famously has issues with that area of her game. It goes to deuce after great defence from Stephens at 40-30 but Halep battle through at advantage. The Romanian is having trouble breaking down her opponent though, even when she’s on top in rallies. Early days though...If Sloane has any nerves in her second grand slam final she is showing exactly zero signs of them. She leaps out to a 40-0 lead on her own serve. There’s a brief hiccup when she sends a forehand long but a lovely winner down the line secures the game.The players are out on court now and warming up. Just a reminder than Halep is going for her first grand slam title and Sloane Stephens her second in the last nine months (and, to be fair, her second in 20 years).Morning. Martina Navratilova - who knows a thing or two about winning majors - thinks Simona Halep will need to be a little more aggressive than last year if she’s to capture her first grand slam: “For me, the mistake Halep made in last year’s French Open final against Jelena Ostapenko was that she played too defensively, that she played not to lose. But champions learn from their mistakes so I don’t think she’s going to make the same mistake twice in the same situation, which is why I expect her to play aggressively against Stephens,” she wrote on the WTA site.Bryan will be here shortly, in the meantime here’s how the two finalists got here:It is testimony to the depth of their friendship that Sloane Stephens’s perfectly shaped backhand down the line to put Madison Keys out her misery and out of their French Open semi-final on Thursday was struck almost apologetically.When it landed like a merciful knife into the deuce corner to end their one‑sided match in just an hour and 17 minutes, the winner raised her arms in celebration, smiled broadly then looked immediately up the court on a packed Philippe-Chatrier to commiserate with her fellow American.She played an almost perfect defensive game, soaking up seven aces and keeping her mistakes to a minimum, to win 6-4, 6-4 and book a place in the final on Saturday against the world No 1, Simona Halep, who earlier took an hour and a half to break down the resistance of Garbiñe Muguruza, 6-1, 6-4.You can read the full story here:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0d00754a4de497170776ac9d2be33c9117663a3/0_78_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89968e220613900f0f90adf05565a646","title":"south africa v england rugby union first test live","story":"South Africa take advantage of their extra man, overwhelming England in the 22. Snyman could have charged over but flung the ball wide to Dyantyi, who almost dropped it in his excitement but instead caught it at the second attempt and touched down to claim a try on his debut. The conversion is good, too. 63 min: May is absolutely flattened by Dyanti after claiming a high kick from De Klerk, which turned out to be a setup. As the crowd acclaim Dyanti, Mako Vunipola is shown a yellow card for going in late on De Klerk. 62 min: Curry joins an attack at a tricky angle and bounds across the gain line and into South African territory, where England have sent little time this half. But their attack is then ruined by two outstanding tackles by De Klerk, first on Robshaw and then on Farrell. That earns him a standing ovation from the home fans. 59 min: Daly overhits a kick, sending the ball spinning beyond the end zone and giving South Arica a scrum 10 metres inside the English half. England substitution: Williams on Sinckler off.56 min: Pollard hits his penalty attempt against the post! It’s a bad miss, from a comfortable shooting position, and it allows England to welly the ball clear. 55 min: Dyantay rashly chucks the ball away as South Africa threaten to run through England again. England have a scrum just inside their own 22. South Africa turn it and win the penalty! 54 min: Scrum to South 10 metres inside’s England’s half after Ford unintentionally sends a kick into one of his own players. There’s a raggedness about England now. England’s discipline is fraying. Pollard is given another opportunity to increase his country’s lead and he takes it this time. 49 min: Itoje concedes a needless penalty and is relieved to see Pollard drive it wide from 30 metres. South Africa substitutions: Kitsohoff and De Toit on, Louw and Du Preez off. 45 min: De Klerk channels his inner Tomas Brolin and places a lovely low kick into the English corner, forcing them backwards again. England win the lineout and begin trying to burrow their way out of their 22. Then Youngs just punts it downfield. 44 min: South Africa slash England open with more jagged running and a try seems certain, as Dyanti is free on the let and baying for a pass. He would have got it to if not for a tremendous saving tackle by Daly. 42 min: Snyman goes loping 40 metres forward - all 6ft9in of him -, looking like a tree that has uprooted itself and decided to go for a gallop. He palms off Ford before being taken down by two defenders mid-way inside the English half. England are very much on the back foot on the high veld. 41 min: 15 seconds of the second half have elapsed and still no try. What a half that was! Seven tries were run in thanks to wonderfully sharp attacking by both sides and some chaotic defending. You sense England needed that penalty just before the break at a time when South Africa were threatening to generate an unbreakable flow. After Billy Vunipola forces an infringement, Farrell slots the ball over from just outside the 22. Sinckler pounces on the ball after a loose offload by South Africa in the English 22. It’s whacked into touch. South Africa win the line out and begin driving and the English defence again. And that defence disintegrates as Le Roux dashes between Brown and Daly to claim a try that puts South Africa in front. How unlikely that seemed when they went 24-3 down in the first 10 minutes! Pollard’s conversion puts them five points clear. 38 min: Itoje punished for a high tackle after taking down the excellent De Klerk, who had tapped and run from a previous penalty. Pollard finds touch near the English corner...37 min: Substitution: Brad Shields, the ex-New Zealander, comes on for his England debut in place of Isiekwe. Looks like Jones reckons England need an experienced head to steady themselves and stem the flow of the suddenly rampant South Africa.That’s a brilliant team try, with Nkosi touching down on the right-hand side this time after a whirlwind move. Pollard converts and England’s huge early lead has almost been wiped out. There’s no telling how this match will pan out: the intensity is fierce and the pace breathless. 33 min: Vermeulen is congratulated by his team-mates for stealing the ball off Sinckler on half-way. Suddenly there’s fresh spring in the Boks’ step...South Africa cranked up the pressure and went through about 10 phases, stretching England with each one. Eventually they worked it wide to Nkosi, who receives it 10 metres out and kicked for the end zone. Daly rushes across to intercept ... but es past it! Nkosi doesn’t pause to say thank, just es on the ball to claim a try on his debut! And Pollard tops it off with a conversion. 25 min: Daly shanks a miskick straight into touch, giving South Africa a lineout mid-way inside the English half. They win that but then throw the initiative away as Vermeulen is penalised for a knock-on. 23 min: Daly knocks on while trying to field a high kick. South Africa get the scrum just inside their own territory. That gives them the springboard for a spirited running attack, which takes them into the English half before Slade makes a splendid tackle.Pollard sends a kick deep into the English 22 and turns to issue a rallying cry to his team. The Boks’ win the 22 and eventually work the ball to Nkosi, who again launches into a lethal-looking run. Ford manages to stop him, but De Klerk is first to the break down, eludes a rash attempted tackle by Itoje and touches down. This first 20 minutes have been a try fest! Pollard misses the conversion.Ford swings a superb long pass to the right flank, where May collects it before chucking on to Farrell, arriving at speed on the underlap. And Farrell has a broad smile across his face as he runs unopposed for 20 metres before placing the ball down under the post. South Africa have been sliced open again and some of their fans are already booing. England are flying. Farrell converts.That’s an excellent try by England, glorious evidence of the menace of their backs. Ford was instrumental before May flung a pass wide to Daly on the left and Daly scampered in unopposed in the corner. The South African defence got completely discombobulated by England’s lines of attack there. Farrell converts.13 min: A brilliant offload by Slade allows Brown to go galloping into the Boks’ 22, where he runs into three opponents. England recycle, taking their phases into double figures. This is a very open and entertaining contest. Both sides look sharp and inventive in attack. An easy kick for the flyhalf. 9 min: South Africa exert pressure for the first time, setting up a series of charges inside the English 22. Nkosi is particularly difficult to stop. Brown manages to bundles him out in the corner. 7 min: England make their first mistake, Billy Vunipola bungling a simple attempted catch from a long kick downfield. But South Africa collapse the ensuing scrum, allowing England to get on the front foot again. He slots it over from wide on the left.What a start by England! A crossfield move finishes with Slade fizzing a pass to Brown, who swots two feeble tackles aside and dashing forward eight metres to touch down in the corner. Du Preez gives away a penalty 10 metres inside England’s half for going in from the side off his feet. Daly elects to shoot for goal. And it sails between the posts! 1 min: South Africa kick off. Billy Vunipola fields it in his own 22 and England begin going through the phases. Ultimately Farrell opts to kick clear. With the exception of a patch of seats in the top tier, Ellis Park is full as the teams stride out on to the pitch. England arrive first and are greeted by some polite applause and a few boos. Then come the home team, led out by Kolisi and greeted by enormous cheers. Everyone is on their feet, most with cameras to capture this historic moment. Kolisi himself looks composed. Eddie Jones has just been asked on Sky what his team need to improve after four losses in a row. ““We’ve had three losses,”” he replies testily. “We count the Barbarians game a warm-up game. We just have to concentrate and be very good at executing. We have to put the South African defence under pressure.” Once the Springboks team was seen as a symbol of white oppression in South Africa so the fact that today they are captained for the first time by a back man, Siya Kolisi, is being trumpeted as a sign of the progress made and an inspiration that could help stimulate much more cpositive changes. Jean De Villiers, a former Springbok captain and ex-team-mate of Kolisi, has just been talking to Sky about what he describes as a “huge moment” for South Africa. “This appointment is so much bigger than the game today,” he says. “But it’s important to separate two things. Siya has been selected because he’s the best captain, not because he’s black. But the fact that he is black creates so much interest and is so important in South Africa.” Byran Habana, in Sky’s studio, says: “It’s absolutely pivotal and monumental. South African rugby has been waiting for 24 years post-isolation for this moment. He is going to inspire many a person in South Africa today ... I’m not sure whether I’ve brought a tissue because I could be quite emotional during the national anthem today.” Hello. Ellis Park, Johannesburg, is no place for the meek, nor, more to the point, for the dishevelled or the dumb. So England best not perform today as they did in parts of the last Six Nations tournament, otherwise they’ll cop a fourth straight defeat (or fifth if you include the games against the BaBas) and more thorny questions will be asked of Eddie Jones. “When I look back I think we got tactically, physically and mentally tired,” Jones said this week, effectively admitting to errors that he aim to correct. He has made some interesting selections for this game, with Billy Vunipola starting his first match for over a year, Henry Slade coming in at centre, George Ford and Owen Farrell resuming their combination and Mike Bronw remaining on the left wing.If this match is both an attempt to begin (re)building in earnest for next year’s World Cup and to recover from recent outings, that probably goes for both teams. The Springboks, fielding a very different side to the one that lost narowly to Wales last week, include three debutants - S’busiso Nkosi, Aphiwe Dyantyi and RG Snyman - for their first Test under the captaincy of Siya Kolisi. They also give recalls to experienced scrumhalf Faf De Klerk and the full-back Willie le Roux, neither of whom have played for South Africa since 2016.

Like the pope, they back scientific opinion that climate change is caused by human activity and that global warming must be curbed.“We know that the challenges facing us are interconnected. If we are to eliminate poverty and hunger ... the more than 1 billion people without electricity today need to gain access to it,” Francis told them.“But that energy should also be clean, by a reduction in the systematic use of fossil fuels. Our desire to ensure energy for all must not lead to the undesired effect of a spiral of extreme climate changes due to a catastrophic rise in global temperatures, harsher environments and increased levels of poverty,” he said.

Photograph: Paul SherwoodAlmost 190 jobs are to be created in engineering, project management and software in Co Wicklow with the expansion of energy services company Crowley Carbon.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar made the jobs announcement at the company’s headquarters in Powerscourt House, Enniskerry, on Saturday. The 187 jobs will be created over the next three years with the assistance of Enterprise Ireland, which provides State support to companies creating employment in Ireland in manufacturing and internationally traded service sectors.Crowley Carbon, created in 2009, monitors and manages energy usage in 400 factories globally including Johnson \u0026amp Johnson, Bunge and GE. It provides renewable energy technology including solar and biomass to its customers to cut energy consumption. While headquartered in Enniskerry, it recently also opened in Kilkenny.Speaking at the event the Taoiseach said Crowley Carbon was “at the cutting edge of the energy efficiency sector, and I am delighted to see the company expanding its operations here”. He said the new jobs were a testament to the company’s success in recent years.Mr Varadkar, who attended a number of engagements in Wicklow on Saturday, added that supporting initiatives that contributed to Ireland’s climate and energy targets “is a priority for the Government and is also a key element of Project Ireland 2040 through the €500 million Climate Action Fund”.Minister for Health Simon Harris, a Wicklow TD, said the jobs were of “great significance to the local economy in Co Wicklow”.Chief executive and founder of Crowley Carbon Norman Crowley said the employees had “delivered unprecedented growth over the last two years, tripling the company’s size in 2017 and are on target to also triple in size in 2018. “Over the last 12 months they have expanded their Dubai and Dublin offices and opened offices in Sydney, Sophia, Sao Paulo and North Carolina.”Enterprise Ireland executive director for global business development Kevin Sherry said the State agency had worked very closely with Crowley Carbon over the past nine years, particularly “in the areas of research and development and new market development work in international markets”.He said the new high skilled jobs “will enable it to service a growing energy efficiency sector, driven by the strong market need to reduce energy costs, optimise energy generation levels and reduce dependence on fossil fuels”.Earlier the Taoiseach opened the Vartry reservoir walking trail along with Minister of State and local Fine Gael TD Andrew Doyle.Mr Doyle said the development and upgrade of 20km of walks around the reservoir had been “a long time in the making” and would provide the community and visitors “with safe access to areas that were previously inaccessible”.

Photograph: Nick BradshawIt took 35 years to build a landslide.Repealing the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution was neither quick nor easy, despite what the margin of difference might say.Sixty-six per cent said “Yes”. Makes it look simple.But that two-thirds majority conceals hard history and hard-fought battles behind a stunning final result.Woman by woman, story by story, year upon year, day after day. The rocks and pebbles of countless unjust ordeals and small personal tragedies piled up after each furtive trip to Liverpool and beyond.Brave campaigners for basic abortion rights did everything they could to increase the pressure, their efforts ignored and condemned by priests and politicians and that tiresome class of pious people who live in terror of the slippery slope.They thought they could hold back a landslide. On Friday, gravity kicked in. The slippery slope did for them in the end.The Eighth Amendment, which guaranteed a foetus the same right to life as the woman carrying it, is gone from the Constitution. Good riddance to it. It brought nothing but difficulty and despair to Irish women in times when they desperately needed proper care and compassion at home.It was a wonderful morning on Saturday in the RDS when the boxes were opened and the votes counted. It was a wonderful afternoon in Dublin Castle when crowds filled the courtyard to hear the official declaration. It was a wonderful day for Irish women.A day made even better in the happy knowledge that the vast majority of Irish men are looking out for them and want only the best for them. By voting in their droves to repeal, they placed the concerns of women far above the fears of ideologically-motivated crusaders who prize saving souls above having a heart.With repeal looking the likely outcome, there were calls from some quarters for a muted and dignified response. Perhaps it was the reason why there was neither screen nor public address system for the huge crowd at the castle.But no. For all the decades of all the women who suffered, and for all the women who fought and agitated for change, we had to celebrate this historic turning-point in modern Irish society.Some never thought they would live to see the day. Some, like Monica Barnes and Mary Holland and Nuala Fennell and many more, didn’t. The celebration was for them too.It was for Ailbhe Smyth, who never stopped fighting. It was for senator Ivana Bacik, Catherine Murphy, Joan Burton, Catherine McGuinness and many more who were there from the start.Political rivalries were cast aside for the day. “Oh, c’mere to me,” said socialist Bríd Smith, giving Fianna Fáil’s Timmy Dooley a hug.Obstetrician Peter Boylan, looking very cool in his shades turned up and it was like George Clooney had just rambled in, such was the clamour which greeted his entrance. The three co-directors of Together4Yes – Ailbhe Smyth, Orla O’Connor and Gráinne Griffin – arrived to rapturous welcome.Senators Lynne Ruane and Alice Mary Higgins were in floods. Ruth Coppinger was hugging for Ireland. Katherine Zappone, who demanded the referendum as her price for supporting the Government, was ecstatic.“Oh God, I told my husband I’d give up the fags if there was a repeal,” said Fine Gael’s Kate O’Connell, one of the party’s most active campaigners, as she ran out for a smoke.Brendan Howlin arrived in just after Mary Lou McDonald’s big entrance. The Labour party was fighting the cause when all the others didn’t want to know. “We never get the credit,” said Howlin, shrugging. “We carry the flag, but then in comes the fresh faced Leo to take all the glory.”Maybe not. Health Minister Simon Harris pretended to be embarrassed by the “I fancy Simon Harris” poster, but he was secretly thrilled. Wherever he went he was mobbed. No wonder Leo stuck close by him.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin maintained a low-key presence, but his early intervention and support for repeal and the proposed legislation was a pivotal point in the campaign.It was a courageous move which now sees him on the right side of history and one half of his parliamentary party stranded on the other.As Micheál walked through the crowd, tearful young women hugged him. A man and woman approached. “We’re one of those couples who had a fatal foetal abnormality,” the women said to him. “Thank you. Just, thank you,” she sobbed.Meanwhile, back in the RDS, the Attorney General was chatting to former Supreme Court Judge Catherine McGuinness.She had had eye surgery the day before but the doctor gave her a special dispensation to attend the count. “Theoretically I should have a patch over my eye today.”At Dublin Castle, Frank Crummy (81), who set up Ireland’s first family planning clinic, was resplendent in his repeal jumper, alongside his wife Evelyn.There was a lot of discussion about why so many politicians and pundits called the campaign so wrong. The Together4Yes team remains amused by the old school, outmoded metric used by some of them to evaluate their very effective efforts. It was as if they were affronted at the idea that people outside the Kildare Street bubble might actually know more than they do about what the electorate really wants these days.Independent TD Clare Daly, a politician hugely deserving of credit for the part she played, decided to stay away from the castle bunfight. Instead, a number of Johnny Come Lately politicians with a weakness for self-publicity preened and waved from the platform.It’s always the same.A third of the electorate voted No. “I feel like I’ve lost my country,” a woman told us amid the celebrations in the RDS. She was very sad. She couldn’t be consoled.Cheers and tears and champagne greeted the announcement. The sky fell in briefly when a few drops of rain fell. Everyone danced.Because it was a monumental day.

Photograph: Olivier HosletPool Photo via APThe headline of one tabloid screamed “Brexit back on course”.The polite reception in Brussels – and Dublin –\u0026nbspfor the UK’s latest Brexit paper on the “backstop”, prompted by relief that at last they had something to talk about, led some optimists in London to the view that a robust UK had pulled one over on Brussels.When Brexit secretary David Davis meets the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier on Monday morning for the next talks round, he will find that the gloves have come off.And he will be rapidly disabused of the hope that all the UK had to do to win brownie points for effort at the end of June summit was to demonstrate a plausible willingness to address the backstop issue. No-one really expected them to resolve the issue, they believe.That hurdle passed, the summer would allow them to engage in chasing the real prize, a comprehensive EU-UK agreement on their future relationship that would make the politically embarrassing backstop agreement redundant. It is only there, after all, to provide a guaranteed fallback should no other deal be done. Barnier on Friday made clear that that strategy would not wash. For a start the UK document paper can not be described as a plausible attempt at addressing the issue. Politely, he demolished it brick by brick.Crucially, he explained, member states were prepared to make an exceptional case of the North, waving common EU rules and practises for the first and last time, to preserve the frictionless Border and the Belfast Agreement. Such privileges were not on offer to the rest of the UK by virtue, not of malice, but its decision to leave the union. To imagine you could simply extend the backstop provisions UK-wide was presumptuous nonsense.The British paper’s failure to even discuss the EU-UK regulatory alignment that would be essential to any border-control-free regime is bizarre. As is its attempt to equate an “expectation” of a time limitation to the backstop with a specific commitment to one – as Barnier pointed out a time-limited backstop is no backstop, no guarantee.EU diplomats warn that the next couple of weeks will see as tough talks as any so far. They remain adamant that no acceptable deal on a backstop will see no deal on a Withdrawal Agreement and no transition.But there is another fatal flaw at the heart of the British strategy – an assumption, endlessly repeated, that a comprehensive deal will actually remove the necessity for the backstop and the inevitable Irish Sea checking of goods, food and animals.For one thing, the negotiation of an alternative deal is not a given. It will be a hugely complex process and most unlikely to be completed by the autumn.Moreover, should the deal not be able to provide the same level of safeguards required to deliver and maintain the North’s frictionless border – most unlikely if the UK maintains its refusal to stay in the customs union and single market – there will be an insistence by the EU that the “fallback” backstop remain in place.It’s not a case of eitheror, but both. And there is no way for May – or the DUP – to indefinitely avoid confronting the hard choices that the backstop will require.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3524258.1528480485!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"downing street rejects backstop only for north","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Union’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier rejected an arrangement that applies to the whole of the United Kingdom. Photograph: Francois LenoirReutersDowning Street has said Britain will never accept a backstop that applies only to Northern Ireland, following EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier’s rejection of an arrangement that applies to the whole of the United Kingdom. “The prime minster has been clear that we will never accept a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. We are also committed to maintaining the integrity of our own internal market. That position will not change. The commission’s proposals did not achieve this, which is why we have put forward our own backstop solutions for customs,” a government spokesperson said.“All parties must recall their commitment in the joint report to protect the Belfast agreement in all its parts. Michel Barnier has confirmed today that discussions will now continue on our proposal.”Mr Barnier rejected of two of the British backstop proposal’s most important elements – extending the backstop to the whole of the UK and making it time-limited. Nigel Dodds, deputy leader of the DUP, on whose 10 votes at Westminster Ms May depends for her majority, said his party could not agree to Mr Barnier’s proposals.“Michel Barnier’s latest comments demonstrate he has no respect for the principle of consent or the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom. This is nothing more than an outrageous attempt to revert to the annexation of Northern Ireland. We will not accept such a proposal,” he said.Irish sources said Mr Barnier’s reaction to the British proposals was more hardline than expected, and attributed this to last minute changes made to the British paper, inserted to satisfy the hard Brexiteers in Theresa May’s cabinet.However, most sources in Dublin and Brussels said they believed that the threat of a collapse of the talks in June had receded, and that the two sides would “muddle through” the next few weeks and through the June summit, leaving most of the key issues to be settled in October.One senior figure in Dublin, however, warned of diminishing patience with Mrs May in key European capitals.There is some concern in Dublin that the question of the backstop, and the broader arrangements for the future relationship that will affect Ireland and the border, will all be settled together in the autumn, raised the prospect of Irish interests being “squeezed” as part of a wider deal.In the North, the DUP reacted with hostility to Mr Barnier’s statement. The DUP leader Arlene Foster said that the the DUP would “not tolerate the annexation of Northern Ireland” while the party’s deputy leader Nigel Dodds said that Mr Barnier “has no respect for the principle of consent or the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom”.Earlier, the prime minister expressed full confidence in foreign secretary Boris Johnson but declined to comment on leaked remarks he made at a dinner this week. In a speech to the Conservative Way Forward group, a recording of which was leaked to BuzzFeed, Mr Johnson said the issue of the Irish Border had taken on too great a significance in Britain’s negotiations with the EU.“It’s so small and there are so few firms that actually use that border regularly, it’s just beyond belief that we’re allowing the tail to wag the dog in this way. We’re allowing the whole of our agenda to be dictated by this folly,” he said.The prime minister’s official spokesperson declined to comment directly on Mr Johnson’s comments but rejected the sentiments expressed about the issue of the Border.“Northern Ireland has been a priority for the prime minister from day one, and will continue to be so,” the spokesperson said.“It is a priority not because the EU has made it one, but because the prime minister is committed to the union and the emergence of a hard border would put that at risk. I’m not going to engage on the wording, but this is our position and why it is so vital to the prime minister.”In the speech, the foreign secretary described the Treasury as “the heart of Remain” and suggested that the aggressive, unpredictable approach Donald Trump might take to Brexit talks would have been more fruitful.During a visit to Germany on Friday, chancellor of the exchequer Philip Hammond said his experience told him that a collaborative approach was generally more productive than a confrontational one.“Finding a mutually beneficial outcome is the only way forward. That is the firm intention of my government. Theresa May, the prime minister, has said so very clearly,” Mr Hammond said.Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, called on Ms May to sack her foreign secretary, saying his remarks at the dinner offered further evidence that he was not fit to occupy one of the great offices of state.“Any prime minister that had any semblance of authority would have got rid of Boris Johnson a long time ago, not just because of comments like this,” she said.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"city highlights fromnational geographic travel photographer","story":"This is a selection of images from the National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year Contest which is open for entries until May 31, 2018.The Scenic Suitcase taken by Stephanie MillerThe colorful streets of Bo Kaap weren\u0027t always this way.

After further study of the field at New York’s Bellevue Hospital, she returned to Columbia as director of its new anaesthesia ision, its first female head of department.Building the unit from the ground up in partnership with her old mentor Dr Allen Whipple\u0026nbsp(who had steered her away from surgery), Dr Apgar\u0026nbspworked tireless as both a practising physician and administrator, no easy task when America’s entry into the Second World War in 1941 created significant staffing shortages.Dr Apgar\u0026nbspdeveloped her five-point score for assessing\u0026nbspnewborn health\u0026nbspin 1952. The test grades babies on scores of zero to two on five key criteria: the colour of their skin, their pulse rate, their reflex ability, their responsiveness to limb flexion and their respiratory rate. The resulting scores are totted up to give a total out of 10 indicating the health or otherwise of the infant in question.The criteria can be remembered by the acronym\u0026nbsp”Apgar”, standing for Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, Respiration.In 1959, by which point her test had been rolled out across US maternity\u0026nbsphospitals, Dr Apgar\u0026nbspleft the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center to\u0026nbspearn\u0026nbspa Master of Public Health degree from the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health and served as vice president for medical affairs at the March of Dimes Foundation to advance the study of birth defects.She was an outspoken advocate for universal vaccinations\u0026nbspto prevent mother-to-child transmission of rubella during the pandemic that struck 12.5m people in the US between 1964-65 and contributed more than 60 articles to newspapers, magazines and academic journals, publishing her book Is My Baby All Right? with Joan Beck\u0026nbspin 1973.Dr Apgar\u0026nbspwas known throughout her career for her warm bedside manner and forthright optimism. In her personal life, she played the violin, enjoyed a range of hobbies from fly-fishing and stamp collecting\u0026nbspand took flying lessons, dreaming of swooping under the George Washington Bridge.Although\u0026nbspshe rarely campaigned against or spoke publicly about gender inequalities, Dr Virginia Apgar\u0026nbspglided past\u0026nbspthe sexism of her period with ease, preferring instead to lead by example and allow her professional excellence and commitment to her work speak for itself.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

New research suggests a vital link between our ability to sense our physical bodies and knowing how we feelStephen has been married twice. Two wedding days. Two “I do”s. Yet Stephen has no happy memories from either – or, in fact, from the marriages or any of his relationships.\u0026nbspHe met his first wife on a pre-nursing course when he was just 16. Six years later, they were married. Three years after that, they got orced she was never really the right one for him, he says.Almost two decades on, in 2009, he met his second wife through a dating site. He threw himself into the relationship and, the following year, with his father and her two adult siblings present, they married at the registrar’s office in Sheffield, where they both live.\u0026nbspHe put on smiles for the wedding photos because he recognised that they were expected but, as he explains: “From an inner feeling point of view, anything I do that requires an emotional response feels like a fake.“Most of my responses are learned responses. In an environment where everyone is being jolly and happy, it feels like I’m lying. Acting. Which I am. So it is a lie.”\u0026nbspHappiness isn’t the only emotion that Stephen struggles with. Excitement, shame, disgust, anticipation, even love… he doesn’t feel these, either. “I feel something but I’m unable to distinguish in any real way what that feeling is.” The only emotions he is familiar with are fear and anger.\u0026nbspSuch profound problems with emotion are sometimes associated with autism, which Stephen does not have, or with psychopathy, which he doesn’t have, either.Last year, at the age of 51, he finally learned what he does have: a little-known condition called alexithymia, a word made from Greek parts meaning, roughly, “no words for emotion”.Despite the name, the real problem for people with alexithymia isn’t so much that they have no words for their emotions, but that they lack the emotions themselves. Still, not everyone with the condition has the same experiences. Some have gaps and distortions in the typical emotional repertoire.Some realise they’re feeling an emotion, but don’t know which, while others confuse signs of certain emotions for something else – perhaps interpreting butterflies in the stomach as hunger pangs.\u0026nbspSurprisingly, given how generally unrecognised it is, studies show that about one in 10 people fall on the alexithymia spectrum. New research is now revealing what’s going wrong – and this work holds the promise not only of novel treatments for disorders of emotion, but of revealing just how the rest of us feel anything at all.\u0026nbspAfter working as a nurse for 10 years, Stephen decided he wanted to do something different. A two-year Access to University course led to a degree in astronomy and physics, and then to a job testing computer games.He built a successful career for himself, working for various companies in their computer testing departments, managing teams, and travelling around the world to speak at conferences. He had no problem conveying facts to colleagues.It was in the context of more personal relationships – or any other scenario that would typically involve expressions of emotion – that he felt things were “wrong”.\u0026nbsp“At the beginning of a relationship, I’m totally into who that person is,” he explains. “I’ve been told I’m very good at maintaining a honeymoon period for ‘longer than expected’. But after a year it takes a massive turn. It all falls apart. I’ve put myself on a pedestal to be this person which I’m really not. I react mostly cognitively, rather than it being emotions making me react. Obviously, that is not valid. It’s not real. It seems fake. Because it is fake. And you can only pretend for so long.”\u0026nbspHe and his current wife stopped living together in 2012. He saw a GP and was prescribed antidepressants. Though he was still in contact with his wife, it was clear that the relationship was no longer working. In June 2015, he attempted suicide.“I had actually been posting on Facebook and Twitter regarding killing myself and someone – I’ve never found out who – contacted the police. I was taken to hospital and treated.”\u0026nbspA psychiatrist referred Stephen for a series of counselling sessions and then a course of psychodynamic psychotherapy, a type of Freudian-based therapy that, in trying to uncover unconscious drivers of thoughts and behaviour, is similar to psychoanalysis.\u0026nbspIt was in a book called Why Love Matters by Sue Gerhardt, which his therapist recommended, that he first came across the concept of alexithymia.“I brought it up in therapy, and that’s when we started talking about how I was very alexithymic. Obviously, I’ve got a vocabulary. I’ve got words for emotions. But whether they’re the right words for the right emotion is a different point altogether… I just thought that I wasn’t good at talking about how I feel and emotions and stuff like that. But after a year of therapy, it became apparent that when I talk about emotions I don’t actually know what I’m talking about.”The term “alexithymic” dates from a book published in 1972 and has its origins in Freudian psychodynamic literature.Freudian ideas are now out of favour with most academic psychologists, as Geoff Bird, a professor of psychology at the University of Oxford explains. “Not to disrespect those traditions, but in the cognitive, neuro, experimental field, not so many people are really very interested in anything associated with Freud any more.”But when Bird read about alexithymia, he found the descriptions intriguing. “Actually, it’s really quite amazing.” For most people, “at a low level of emotion, you might be a bit unsure about exactly what you’re feeling, but if you have a strong emotion, you know what it is”. And yet somehow, here were people who simply did not know.\u0026nbspBird started his academic career studying autism spectrum disorder, empathy and emotional awareness, which led to his interest in alexithymia.In one of his first studies in this field, he linked alexithymia, as measured with a 20-item checklist developed at the University of Toronto, with a lack of empathy. If you can’t feel your own emotions in the typical way, it makes sense that you can’t identify with those of others, either.\u0026nbspBut what really drew Bird into alexithymia research were his interactions with people with autism. “There has been this perception that people with autism don’t have empathy. And that’s rubbish. And you can see that immediately as soon as you meet some autistic people.”In a series of studies, Bird has found that about half of people with autism have alexithymia – it’s these people who struggle with emotion and empathy, while the rest do not. In other words, emotion-related difficulties are intrinsic to the alexithymia, not to the autism.Bird is passionate about spreading this message. He talks with feeling about one particular autistic study volunteer who did not have alexithymia: “A lovely guy with an IQ we couldn’t measure, it’s that good. He couldn’t hold down a job. But he volunteered to work at a care home because he wanted to do something productive with his time.“They said, ‘Oh because you’ve got a diagnosis of autism you can’t do empathy, therefore you can’t look after our elderly people.’ Which is just ridiculous.”\u0026nbspBird has since run a series of studies exploring alexithymia outside the context of autism. He has found, for example, that people with the condition have no trouble recognising faces, or distinguishing pictures of people smiling and frowning.“But for a few of our really alexithymic people, while they can tell a smile and a frown apart, they have no idea what they are. That is really quite strange.”\u0026nbspMany of the people with the condition who Bird has met talk about being told by other people that they’re different, though some do recognise it in themselves early on.“I guess it’s a bit like not being able to see colour, and everybody’s always banging on about how red this is or how blue, and you come to realise there’s an aspect of human experience that you’re just not participating in.”As well as better characterising alexithymia, Bird and his colleagues have also dug into what explains it, taking what could seem to be a circular argument – Stephen has problems with emotion because he has alexithymia, which is characterised by problems with emotion – and blowing it right apart.In situations that Stephen recognises as being in theory highly emotional – like telling someone “I love you” – he experiences changes inside his body. “I feel my heart race and this rush of adrenaline, but to me that feeling is always scary. I don’t know how to react. It makes me want to either run away or react verbally aggressively.”\u0026nbspFear and anger – and confusion – he understands. “Everything else just feels all the same… it’s this feeling of, ‘Errrr, I’m not quite comfortable with this – it’s not quite right’.”\u0026nbsp“Similarly with anxiety, it might be that someone experiences an emotional response associated with a fast heartbeat – which might be excitement – but they don’t know how to interpret that, and they could panic about what’s happening in their body.”\u0026nbspThe ability to detect changes inside the body – everything from a racing heart to a ersion of blood flow, from a full bladder to a distension of the lungs – is known as interoception. It’s your perception of your own internal state.\u0026nbspDifferent emotions are associated with different physical changes. In anger, for example, the heart rate rises, blood rushes to the face, and fists clench. In fear, the heart rate also rises but blood drains from the face.It’s generally thought that these changes are not entirely specific to inidual emotions, and so context is also important: if you feel your heart racing and you’re looking at a spider, you know it’s fear that you’re feeling, not sexual arousal.\u0026nbspWhat Bird, Brewer and others have found in people with alexithymia is a reduced ability, sometimes a complete inability, to produce, detect or interpret these internal bodily changes. People with the condition have normal-range IQs.They can understand as well as anyone else that they’re seeing a spider, rather than an attractive potential partner. But either their brains aren’t triggering the physical changes that it seems are needed for the experience of an emotion, or other regions of their brains aren’t reading these signals properly.\u0026nbspIn 2016, Bird and Brewer, along with Richard Cook at City University in London, published a research paper that characterised alexithymia as a “generalised deficit of interoception”.Here, then, was an explanation for these people’s problems with emotion – but also, in effect, a manifesto stating that the perception of a range of bodily signals is important for the experience of emotion in the rest of us.\u0026nbspIt’s an idea that we already express in everyday language: in English, for an apology to mean anything, it has to be “heartfelt”. If you truly love someone, it’s with “all your heart”.When you’re really angry, your “blood boils”. Instead of saying that you’re anxious, you might talk about having “butterflies in your stomach” (thought to be caused by a ersion of blood flow away from the digestive system).While most people may not be familiar with alexithymia, there is a different disorder involving flat emotions and poor empathy that seems to fascinate us, even more than it repels us: psychopathy. Can we learn more about how we feel by understanding psychopaths?Lieke Nentjes is in her early thirties. She’s slender and softly spoken it’s hard to picture her spending countless hours in small rooms with incarcerated, unshackled psychopaths, including serially violent men who have committed murder.\u0026nbsp“Then he explained that he was at the end of his therapy and was ‘resocialising’ and no one would hire him because they were intimidated by him. He wasn’t really angry. He was frustrated.”While the nature of psychopathy is still debated, psychologists generally agree that it entails, among other things, a lack of empathy or guilt, shallow emotions, and antisocial behaviour – treating other people badly and, in some cases, engaging in criminal acts.\u0026nbspIt has certainly been suggested that the reason some psychopaths are able to torture or murder people is that they don’t process emotions properly – they don’t feel fear, for example, and they don’t recognise it in others.\u0026nbspNentjes is based at the University of Amsterdam. Here in the Netherlands, if a criminal is found to have a psychological condition that relates to the crime, he or she is deemed to be only partially responsible.Such criminals might spend a few years in a regular jail before being sent to a secure treatment centre, or they may be sent straight for treatment.\u0026nbspNentjes decided to assess a range of criminals from these centres and from jails to find out just how psychopathic they were (with particular attention to different aspects of psychopathy), to learn about their lives – their upbringing, and their criminal behaviour – and also to measure their interoceptive ability.\u0026nbsp“Emotion is very central when you look at psychopathy – or rather, lack of emotion,” she says. So could it be that psychopathic offenders just aren’t very in touch with their bodies?\u0026nbspIn the course of the interviews, Nentjes asked questions to probe their levels of empathy, and how much remorse they felt about what they had done to their victims. “Some were just completely honest, and would say, ‘I don’t care,’” she says.“Others who were psychopathic would say, ‘Oh, but I’m very empathic.’ They had learned the lingo to describe feelings very accurately and they could talk about compassionate, empathic feelings towards others – but then when you look at the crimes they have committed…” Her sentence trails off.\u0026nbsp“There is research finding that psychopathic offenders can describe emotions in terms of words, but they lack the inner experience of the emotion,” she adds.\u0026nbspSince assessing a person’s ability to detect a range of bodily signals is tricky, the most commonly used measures of interoceptive sensitivity are based on judgements of heart rate. One test involves asking participants to count their heartbeats over varying periods – 25 or 50 seconds, perhaps – multiple times.About 10 per cent of us are good at counting heartbeats, 5 to 10 per cent are very bad, and the rest fall somewhere in between.In another test, volunteers are played a series of beeps that are either in sync or out of sync with their heartbeat, and asked which it is. On this type of task, about 10 per cent of the general population can do it really well, and 80 per cent can’t do it at all.\u0026nbspNentjes brought the necessary equipment for the heartbeat synch task with her into the interview rooms, and took measures for 75 offenders. She found a clear link: the higher an offender’s score on the antisocial aspect of psychopathy, the poorer their performance on the heart-rate task.This does at least suggest that psychopaths who are poorer at detecting bodily signals feel less emotion and therefore less empathy for others.Psychopathic criminals are sometimes ided into the “white-collar” type, who tend to commit non-violent crimes such as fraud, and the violent type. In her interviews with this violent group, Nentjes was struck by one similarity, in particular, compared with the white-collar group.“That was their upbringing. Or rather lack of it. Emotional abuse. Sexual abuse. Neglect. A lot of physical abuse. I’ve heard people literally say that emotion is not of use to them. All they felt during their upbringing was fear.”\u0026nbspAs a child, Stephen suffered extreme emotional neglect. When he was six, his mother intentionally set fire to their home in Nottingham while she, Stephen, his younger brother and even younger sister were all inside. Fortunately, the children’s father, who had left for work, realised that he’d forgotten his packed lunch and came home.\u0026nbspLooking back, Stephen says it’s clear that his mother was suffering from post-natal depression. But she received no treatment, “and all I knew was anxiety and being worried”. After the fire, his mother went to prison. His father was a steelworker, who worked all kinds of shifts.“A neighbour contacted social services and Dad was told to sort it out or they’d take us away. None of my dad’s brothers or sisters wanted me or my brother because we were little shits. We were always in trouble. Robbing shops. All kinds of stuff. So we went into care.”\u0026nbspFor the rest of his childhood, Stephen was in and out of care homes. The only emotions he remembers feeling, even then, are fear, anger and confusion. “Christmas, birthdays, people out of the blue at care homes being nice to me… I never really got used to it. I always felt uncomfortable. There’s just a mess of feelings inside me that I don’t interpret properly, or respond to properly.”\u0026nbspAlexithymia is often associated with trauma and neglect from a young age, explains Geoff Bird. Twin studies have suggested a genetic component, too. And it’s also linked to certain types of brain damage, particularly to the insula, the region that receives interoceptive signals.\u0026nbspAs Rebecca Brewer notes, the kind of anxiety that Stephen experiences is common in people with poor interoception. At the University of Sussex, Hugo Critchley and Sarah Garfinkel, who have expertise in psychiatry and neuroscience, are looking at ways to alter interoception, to bring anxiety down.\u0026nbspGarfinkel has put forward a three-dimensional model of interoception that has been well received by others in the field. First, objective accuracy at perceiving interoceptive signals – how good you are at counting heartbeats, for example.Second, subjective report – how good you think you are. And third, metacognitive accuracy – how good you are at knowing how good you actually are.\u0026nbspThe third dimension is important because various studies have found that the gap between how good someone thinks they are at counting heartbeats, for example, and how good they actually are predicts their levels of anxiety.Lisa Quadt, a research fellow with the Sussex group, is now running a clinical trial with the aim of testing whether reducing this gap for people with autism can reduce their anxiety.In a pilot study, Critchley, Garfinkel and MSc student Abigail McLanachan recruited a group of students who came into the lab for six training sessions. In each session, they first did the heartbeat-counting task.The volunteer sat at rest, with a loose rubber pulse oximeter on their forefingers, and reported how many beats they’d counted. Then McLanachan told them how they’d done so that they got a better sense of how accurate they were.McLanachan then got them to do a few minutes of jumping jacks or walking fast up the steep hill outside the building – whatever was necessary to raise their heart rate, to make it easier to detect. (“Because some people really can’t feel their heartbeat at all. I can’t,” Quadt explains.)Then they went back into the lab, did the tasks again and, as before, were given feedback each time.\u0026nbspThis was just a pilot study on a general student population. But after three weeks, not only had the students’ accuracy improved on all three dimensions of interoception, but they also reported reductions in anxiety of around 10 per cent.\u0026nbspFor the main trial, volunteers diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder will complete the same tasks as in the pilot, but once at the start and once at the end they’ll do them inside an MRI scanner.This will allow the team to monitor activity in the insula, which receives heart-rate data, and look at how changes in that activity may correspond to connections between the amygdala, which detects threats, and the prefrontal cortex, which can work out whether a potential threat really is or is not dangerous and so whether anxiety is warranted.The hope, Critchley explains, is to see improved connectivity between these two regions, which previous studies have linked to reduced anxiety.\u0026nbspIn Oxford, meanwhile, Geoff Bird wants to look at the idea that there are two different types of alexithymia. People with one type don’t produce enough of the bodily signals necessary for the experience of an emotion, so would be unlikely to benefit from the Sussex group’s kind of training.People with the other type produce all kinds of bodily sensations but their brains don’t process these signals in the typical way. This second group, which includes Stephen, might benefit more.\u0026nbspBird stresses that, although people with alexithymia struggle to understand emotion, that doesn’t mean they don’t care about other people. “For the most part, iniduals with alexithymia can recognise that others are in a negative state, and this makes them distressed.“The problem is that they can’t work out what the other person is feeling, and what they are feeling, and therefore how to make the other person feel better or how to reduce their own distress. I think that’s important because alexithymia is different from psychopathy in that respect.”Stephen says that for him, this is certainly true. And in theory, an emotional training technique is something he would welcome. “I’ve got several books about emotions and feelings and they don’t make a jot of difference because they’re not talking specifically enough about what you actually feel within your body is which emotion.”\u0026nbspFor now, given the absence of available treatments for alexithymia, Stephen plans to use his newfound understanding of himself, gained through therapy, to try to move forwards. At first, he says, he hoped that therapy would fix everything.“I thought every day would be perfect, brilliant… and I’ve come to realise that’s not going to happen. I’m always going to have problems, always going to have issues.”\u0026nbspHe’s learned valuable lessons, he says. Though he and his wife are still separated, they talk regularly and now he tries not to reject her views on his anxiety. “Rather than go, ‘No,’ I will listen. I think, ‘Well, you know what emotions are about and I don’t, so I’m going to listen to you and I’ll either take it on board or I’ll find a way to deal with it’.”He’s also thinking about moving to work with people who are struggling with substance abuse, because he’d like to be back in a career where he can help people.\u0026nbspMost of all, he’s determined to use his diagnosis of alexithymia. “For me, it empowers me – now I know about it, I can read about it. I can find out more about it. And I can develop certain tools that enable me to combat it.”People without alexithymia could probably use such tools as well. Bird has led work showing that people who are more aware of their own heartbeat are better able to recognise others’ emotions, a crucial first step in being empathetic.He’s planning studies to investigate whether heartbeat training might therefore increase empathy.\u0026nbspThose who want to reduce feelings of stress and anxiety in daily life, but who either can’t or don’t want to change the sources of stress, could focus on changing the signals coming from their bodies instead.Regular physical exercise should dampen down the kinds of bodily signals (from the heart and circulation, for example) that the brain could interpret as being anxious – so it should dampen down feelings of anxiety, too.\u0026nbspKnowing that signals from our bodies underpin our emotions could be empowering for all of us.

Andy Martin on the man who’ll be guiding ITV viewers through a month of World Cup hyperboleEverybody is a commentator these days. @Chasepacheco1, for example, who tweeted after last month’s Uefa Champions League final:\u0026nbsp“My Liverpool team fought hard and I’m proud of them. Except for Karius, he can die in a hole.” Loris Karius, Liverpool’s German goalkeeeper, let in three goals (one of them, to be fair, a moment of sheer brilliance by Gareth Bale). Which means that online he finds himself denounced as a “Nazi”. And, according to one theory, paid handsomely for his “howlers” by Real Madrid. We can assume that the World Cup in Russia this month will be the occasion of a deluge of similar wildly overheated rhetoric, hyperbole and death threats.But you won’t be hearing any of it from ITV’s chief football commentator Clive Tyldesley. Winner many times over of the Royal Television Society Sports Commentator of the Year award, he is the voice of moderation, the calm centre at the eye of the storm. Occasionally the target of Twitter rage himself, he expects to encounter not just a lot of verbals but also racism, hooliganism, and misogyny on top. Football, he says, is “warts and all. It reflects life. It corrupts. That is part of its fascination.” But, from the heights of the commentary box, he tries to provide something like a counterpoint to all the frenzy, the agony and the ecstasy.He is a fit-looking 63 and described himself as “a respecter of vocabulary” when I went to see him shortly before the Champions League final. “I would never say it’s a ‘disaster’ or a ‘tragedy’ if the ball goes through the goalkeeper’s legs,” he said. “You only use words like that if somebody dies.” He thought he might stretch to “calamity”.\u0026nbspHis words were strangely prophetic. As it turned out that is exactly the word he selected to describe Liverpool’s “goalkeeping calamity” when Karius bowled the ball right onto the toe of Benzema. But it struck me that there was also a kind of poetry, of a restrained, austere kind, in his summary of Real Madrid’s first goal, perhaps something like an instant haiku:And Real Madrid are in front.His “an evening that had started so promisingly for Liverpool” sounded a poignantly elegiac note. I also had to admire the comment, after Karius lets a tame one by Bale slip through his hands and into the net: “His reputation would do well to survive that moment.” Note the use of the conditional tense. Tyldesley appreciates that the keeper’s reputation is already in tatters, but that – perhaps in an ideal world – it could still recover.David Hume said that you cannot get an “ought” from an “is”. Somehow Clive Tyldesley manages to pull that off. He is only describing a game of football but there is an implicit ethics in his commentary. Tyldesley agrees with Bill Shankly that football is not a matter of life and death, but omits the punchline, “it’s more important than that.” Still, it is “a huge emotional investment by all the people who turn on. They choose to watch.” Therefore, as a commentator, “You have to be careful with your use of words.”The Playstation Schools Cup U15 final, between Thomas Telford School and Carshalton Boys Sports College, held at Reading’s Madejski stadium, was as fraught and intense as any Champions League final. Some of the players even had agents already. “Maybe overdid it a bit, Hodnett,” commented Tyldesley, in his simultaneous schools broadcast, as he skyed the ball over the bar. He prepared for this game as scrupulously as he is now preparing for the opening game of the World Cup between Russia and Saudi Arabia, and had a foolscap file in front of him containing assorted facts about the players.There was a goalmouth melee, which saw both the Carshalton goalkeeper and the Telford player red-carded. And a penalty shootout after the much fancied Telford came back from 2-0 down only to blow it on the last kick of the game. “Now that is absolutely out of order,” said Tyldesley, as the hulking No 10 wrapped a menacing paw around the referee. “He’d have done well to keep his opinions to himself.” It’s advice he has tried to follow.But in a sense all of his commentary implies an opinion. Presumably he would have disapproved of Zinedine Zidane’s farewell headbutt on Marco Materazzi in 2006 and David Beckham’s retaliation on Diego Simeone that got him sent off in 1998. Tyldesley himself doesn’t get flustered. He is unflappable. He has – and admires – grace under pressure. “His control wasn’t the best,” as he said in one of his critical remarks about the U15 final. The ability to take and keep control is all important, whether you’re on the pitch or off it.This might have something to do with having been subjected to the furious “hairdryer” treatment from Sir Alex Ferguson when still manager of Manchester United, not just once but twice. “You really can feel your hair blowing backwards.” He thought that the boot that hit David Beckham in the face in the dressing room was “probably an accident”.Whether it’s broadcasting to schools or to 10 million people on ITV, Tyldesley always feels a sense of “responsibility”. “Balance” is a key word. He points out that the dying words of Pheidippedes, the messenger who ran all the way from Marathon to Athens to report on the outcome of the battle back in 490BC, “We won!”, only caused confusion, because people were bound to ask, “Who is ‘we’?” “He wasn’t a good journalist,” says Tyldesley. “What he should have said is ‘Athens won’.” Greece 1, Persia 0.He was once commentating on an England-Scotland game with Ron Atkinson when Atkinson insisted on saying “we”. Tyldesley said to him, “You should say ‘England’ not ‘we’.” Although he accepts that there perhaps he was being “correct beyond reason”. He allows that the occasional we “might slip out” at the World Cup. “I’m English but I’m still objective. You don’t choose to support England. It would be odd to switch to supporting Chile.”Tyldesley disapproves of those who get too fancy. “A straightforward pass would have done,” is a classic line of his, which happened to be addressed to schools. So too when it comes to commentary. He argues that cricket and golf have passages of inaction which permit – or even demand – “colour”, the kind of lyrical and expansive discourse, infinitely digressive, forever associated with John Arlott and Brian Johnston in cricket or Peter Alliss in golf. Steve Bunce likewise in boxing, and I can get similarly carried away when it comes to describing surfing, perhaps because there are often long lulls between the epic and the awesome.Tyldesley is more a fan of plain speaking. He says the best ad slogan of all time is Ronseal’s “Does exactly what it says on the tin”. That’s how he thinks commentary should be. You observe, you analyse, you try not to hype it up. You keep it “succinct”. “There’s no point trying to be Wordsworth or Browning. As Barry Davis once said, “One man’s commentator is another man’s pain in the arse.”Everything is mediated and mediatised. There are no exceptions. The old Zen koan, “If a tree fell over in the forest and no one was there to witness it would you still hear it?” now has a clear answer. Yes, because it would be captured by a passing drone or on satellite TV, blazed all over Instagram, tweeted about furiously, the tree’s friends on Facebook would start a crowdfunding campaign, and it would shortly thereafter be the subject of a controversial Channel 4 documentary. Nothing happens any more without commentary. But this is and always has been especially true of football. “They think it’s all over… it is now”, Kenneth Wolstenholme’s line, is as memorable as the 1966 World Cup final itself. Whether or not the ball crossed the line is less significant now than the fact that there was so much debate about whether or not it had. And new technology is not making the debate go away, rather the opposite.I can’t play football without also hearing something like this in my head:\u0026nbsp “Martin comes on, scores with his first touch, and the crowd goes wild.” As Simon Critchley, philosopher and (currently distraught) Liverpool fan comments in his book, What We Think About When We Think About Football, “We usually know football through commentary, through largely, and hugely, inane commentary.”Tyldesley doesn’t think of it as inane. “Sometimes,” he says, “‘a game of two halves’ is exactly what it is. You can’t improve on it.” If he were to write a book about it, it would be something like the opposite of Nick Hornby’s Fever Pitch. Hornby is all about irrational fandom, ritual, intensity of feeling. Tyldesley is more of a phlegmatic “keep calm and carry on” sort of guy. “We don’t need to see that!” he exclaimed at the sight of an overflow of emotions on the sidelines with even teachers getting hot under the collar.Albert Camus said, “I learned everything I know about morality from football.” Which is to say, when it comes to the “beautiful game”, the good, the bad, and the ugly are all on display. There are undoubtedly heroes and villains in Tyldesley’s narrative. But he does it subtly. “You try not to sound too much like a Methodist preacher,” as he puts it. When it comes to making criticism of the play – you could call it a judo throw – by Sergio Ramos, the Real Madrid captain, that resulted in Mo Salah going off in agony with a dislocated shoulder, Tyldesley is judicious but still uncompromising in his remarks. There is “a coming together with Ramos that only he can fully explain”. As he goes up to collect the cup, Ramos is described as “not everyone’s idea of a model professional – maybe nobody’s”.There is even an implicit politics in his commentary. Tyldesley has no objection to big money in football. “It’s labour intensive, they’re entitled to be paid. You can’t do without inidual players.” But still “the collective should be stronger than the inidual”. And this is where we went so badly wrong in the Brexit campaign, and the adjacent media coverage, he argues. “We turned it into a personality competition. Instead of providing the relevant information, we focused on the impact it would have on the lives of politicians.”He says that “the most popular team in this country is not Manchester United or Liverpool, it’s England. It’s a great democracy.” And he has to be “inclusive”. He would never use the word “esoteric” for example, he says, because he doesn’t “want anyone to have to get up and look for a dictionary”.When I saw him, Tyldesley was prepping Arabic and Russian names. He says, “I will try to get it correct, but I will not make sounds we don’t make in the English language.” When identifying James Rodriguez of Chile in the past, he wanted to say “James”.\u0026nbspEventually he bowed to pressure from Twitter to say “Ham-es”, in the Spanish manner. “But later I learned that his father,\u0026nbspa 007 fan,\u0026nbsphad named him after James Bond.”\u0026nbspHe felt vindicated, because in Spanish-speaking countries it’s always James, never Ham-es, Bond.\u0026nbspHe is not, he reckons, “responsible for the teaching of Spanish” or Arabic or Russian.In an extremist, Dionysian world, Tyldesley is an Apollonian voice of reason. He holds the mirror up to football with minimum distortion, minimum fuss. Sound without the fury. A degree zero of poetry. Let’s hope he doesn’t have to repeat a line he first used of England versus Iceland in 2016, “This is the most abject failure that I can recall.”Andy Martin is the author of ‘Reacher Said Nothing: Lee Child and the Making of Make Me’.

One of the three is exactly the same size as our own world, and the others are only ever so slightly bigger.Otherwise, the planets are probably inhospitable: they are very close to their star and therefore very warm. But as yet another discovery of rocket planets that seem to show they are common throughout the universe, they are another sign that it could be more hospitable than we\u0027d thought.The other system has two much larger planets. Those worlds – which like the first system, orbit a red dwarf – are known as super Earths.Red dwarfs are old and relatively small, and the two stars are much less hot than our Sun. But the newly discovered worlds are much closer, meaning that the temperature is probably too hot for life.The five planets were found by the K2 mission of Nasa\u0027s Kepler satellite. That looks for the brief dips of light that happen when a planet passes in front of its star, and allows scientists to use the details of those dips to work out what they might be like.Scientists now hope to use further observations – from the new James Webb Space Telescope – to understand more about the planets\u0027 atmospheres.

They also examined players’ facial expressions and body language, for example how closely team members stood together and whether they put their arms around one another.“We found that the level of passion displayed by players predicted their team’s success or failure in the subsequent match,” said lead researcher Matthew Slater.“Results showed that teams that sang national anthems with greater passion went on to concede fewer goals.”The research, published in the European Journal of Sport Science, also found that the impact of passion on the likelihood of winning a game depended on the stage of the competition: greater passion was linked with a greater likelihood of victory in the knockout stage - but not the group stage.Switzerland and Spain both sang with low levels of passion, and neither made it through to the quarter-finals. In contrast, Wales, which made it to the semi-finals, and Italy, which made it to the quarter finals both sang with great passion. The winners, Portugal, also scored highly on pre-match intensity.“Passionate renditions may be a catalyst for ‘us, and detrimental to ‘them’ – intimidating the opposition. New Zealand rugby players, who perform a posture dance known as ‘haka’ before games, may benefit from a similar effect,” said Mr Slater.At the last World Cup, in Brazil in 2014, it was widely reported that Roy Hodgson, the then England manager, ordered his team to sing the national anthem.But for this year’s World Cup, Mr Slater warned that instructing players to display more passion during national anthems may not be the best strategy.“It is what passionate renditions represent that is crucial – the strength of connection with and enthusiasm for the group,” he said.“If players are genuinely passionate because they identify strongly with their nation and its team, it is likely to increase collective effort and performance – but if players only show passion because they have been instructed to do so then this is unlikely to be a recipe for success.“You do not just have to sing like you mean it, you actually have to mean it.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The UK’s plan tries to get around introducing checks by keeping the whole UK aligned with those rules, and also introduces a time-limit on the backstop.\u0026nbspBut while Mr\u0026nbspBarnier\u0026nbspsaid he was continuing the study the UK proposals, he warned that applying the backstop plan to the whole UK was not an option.“Let me be very clear: our backstop cannot be extended to the whole UK. Why? Because it has been designed for the specific situation of Northern Ireland,” he said.“What does it do? On customs, Northern Ireland would form part of our customs territory. What is feasible with a territory the size of Northern Ireland is not necessarily feasible with the whole UK.\u0026nbsp“On regulatory alignment we have been pragmatic and developed the least disruptive system for citizens and businesses on both sides. Let’s go to pragmatism. Checks carried out on ferries are less disruptive than along a\u0026nbsp500km\u0026nbspland border.”He also suggested the backstop could not be time-limited or temporary, as the UK has requested,\u0026nbspwarning: “Backstop means backstop.”\u0026nbspThe chief negotiator said he would continue looking at the UK’s proposals, despite highlighting what he said were a series of problems with them. He said the plan needed to address “full regulatory alignment” rather than only customs, that it needed to respect the integrity of the single market, and that the arrangement should be “all-weather” and prevent a hard border in all circumstances.\u0026nbspAsked why he was continuing to look at the British proposal if he had raised such fatal flaws with it, he said: “Because I look at all British proposals in an objective manner.”Mr\u0026nbspBarnier\u0026nbsprepeated his familiar refrain that Britain’s negotiators appeared to want to keep the benefits of the EU without accepting the obligations of membership.\u0026nbspBut\u0026nbsphe added: “When we tell our British counterparts that these benefits are not accessible outside the system created by the European Union… some parties in the United Kingdom are responsible for the consequences of that decision.\u0026nbsp“Let me say the following: we’re not going to be intimidated by this form of blame game. The United Kingdom has decided to leave the European Union we respect that democratic decision\u0026nbspand we are implementing it.”He said there had been some progress on other issues but that sticking points included data protection, geographical indications for products, and some matters relating to state aid. Theresa May is set to attend a summit in Brussels later this month that the EU has characterised as a staging-post to a final deal, which it wants signed by October.A British government spokesperson said: “The Prime Minster has been clear that we will never accept a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. We are also committed to maintaining the integrity of our own internal market. That position will not change. The commission’s proposals did not achieve this, which is why we have put forward our own backstop solutions for customs.“All parties must recall their commitment in the Joint Report to protect the Belfast Agreement in all its parts. Michel Barnier has confirmed today that discussions will now continue on our proposal.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

If he fires at us, we will destroy his forces\u0027​Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has threatened to carry out direct military strikes targeting President Bashar al-Assad’s regime unless all Iranian forces are withdrawn from Syria.\u0026nbspThe aggressive ultimatum to Damascus is a significant escalation in the confrontation in Syria between Israel and Iran.The Syrian leader was “no longer immune, his regime is no longer immune. If he fires at us, we will destroy his forces,”\u0026nbspMr Netanyahu declared during a visit to London, speaking at a question and answer session at the Policy Exchange think tank.Israel has carried out a number of air strikes on Iranian bases in Syria and has repeatedly demanded that Iran, which it considers “an existential threat”, must remove its forces and weapons from Syria.But this was the first time that it had been stated that the Assad regime would be punished for the presence of Iranian forces, which have been fighting Isis\u0026nbspand Islamist rebels.Mr Netanyahu said: “I think there is a new calculus that has to take place and Syria has to understand that Israel will not tolerate the Iranian military entrenchment in Syria against Israel.“The consequences are not merely to the Iranian forces there but to the Assad regime as well, I think it’s something that he should consider very seriously.”The Israeli prime minister blamed Assad personally for the presence of Tehran’s forces in Syria as he warned of possible Israeli intervention.“Assad has to consider this: when they waged this horrific civil war, Israel did not intervene. Now the war is nearly over, he invites Iran in to entrench itself?” \u0026nbspThe Syrian leader was accused of facilitating Tehran “to move its army a thousand miles so it can threaten Israel. They want to bring in precision guided rockets with half a ton warheads and submarines to the Mediterranean… Iran does not believe in a master race, it believes in a master faith,” and is bent on conquest, Mr Netanyahu charged.The prime minister is on a tour of Western Europe to try to drum up support for further action against Iran, after US President Donald Trump reneged on an agreement between international powers and Tehran over its nuclear programme.The other signatories to the deal – Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China – as well as the United Nations have all stressed that it was working and the Iranian government was abiding by its commitment.Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel and Theresa May have told Mr Netanyahu that they are\u0026nbspdetermined not to abandon the agreement, the scrapping of which could lead to nuclear proliferation in the region and beyond, they warned.That, he boasted, had been effectively destroyed by him and Mr Trump.He warned European businesses of the punitive fines they would face under American sanctions if they continued trading with Iran.Mr Netanyahu stated that his aim on the trip, instead, was to “expose” how “Iran is devouring one nation after another” and ask Western European governments to do more “about reversing Iran’s aggression in the region and getting them out of Syria”.The French, German and British leaders have all raised their concerns with Mr Netanyahu about the recent brutal violence at the Gaza border in which dozens of Palestinians were shot dead by Israeli troops.The UK foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, urged the Israeli government to open an independent inquiry into the deaths and injuries suffered during the protests.Asked at the London meeting why non-lethal methods, such as water cannons and rubber bullets, were not used, or even a policy of shooting at legs, rather than shoot to kill, not pursued, Mr Netanyahu insisted: “We have tried all these methods, they don’t work. These were not non-violent protests, quite the contrary.“We are doing everything we can to both minimise casualties and, at the same time, protect Israeli lives.”Referring to Israel’s success in technological innovations, Mr Netanyahu added “given our record, we probably will figure something out, but we haven’t got there yet. The last thing we want is violence or confrontation.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The remainder were undecided.And those aged under 45 showed an even higher level of support for a united Ireland. Those aged 18-45 were 49 percent in favour of a united Ireland, 38 percent in favour of remaining in the UK and 13 percent undecided.Brexit could lead to a united Ireland with support growingThe number of Northern Irish citizens in favour of a united Ireland appears far higher than a poll released last month, which saw the same proposal receive just 21 per cent support.However May\u0026rsquos Ipsos Mori poll was conducted face-to-face while the Lucid Talk poll was conducted online and over the phone, with pollsters believing this could help better represent the \u0026ldquoshy united Ireland voters.The BBC commissioned the most recent LucidTalk poll of 1,686 people, who were interviewed between May 4 and May 10.Support was even higher in Belfast, where a majority of 50.2 per cent said they would support a united Ireland - an \u0026ldquoincredible showing given the city\u0027s history, one expert said.Northern Irish political commentator David McCann said the result in Belfast was particularly notable given it hosted the signing of the Ulster Covenant- a document signed by 500,000 people in 1912 in protest at the growing autonomy from Britain given to\u0026nbspIreland. Many signed using their own blood with the creation of the unionist militia the Ulster Volunteers following three months later.Mr McCann of current affairs website Slugger O\u0026rsquoToole tweeted: \u0026ldquoA majority of Belfast would support a UI in the city of the Ulster Covenant. Incredible showing.Support for a united Ireland has surged since the June 2016 Brexit voteMore than a quarter of respondents said they had recently changed their mind in favour of a united Ireland due to Brexit. Ironically the ultra-unionist DUP were the only major political party in Northern Ireland to campaign in favour of Brexit.Twenty-eight percent of respondents said they \u0026ldquoused to support NI staying in the UK but I would now support NI joining the ROI in response to a question on whether Brexit had changed their mind.This could be attributed to the ongoing chaos over the future of the Irish border and the fact Northern Irish citizens voted by a hefty majority of 56 percent to remain in the EU, despite the UK as a whole narrowly voting to leave.\u0026nbspIt comes as Irish taoiseach (prime minister) Leo Varadkar travelled across the border for an historic visit to the Orange Order HQ - the first such visit by a ruling leader of the Republic.Mr Varadkar said he was a \u0026ldquoneighbour not an invader as he spoke outside the Grand Lodge, which is the base for the pro-union and pro-Protestant order.Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland could unite as support for a border poll growsThe taoiseach visited a memorial to Orange Order members killed during the Troubles and was welcomed by the Grand Master of Ireland Edward Stevenson.Mr Stevenson said: \u0026ldquoWe acknowledge this is a significant moment as it is the first time a serving leader of the Republic of Ireland government has visited the headquarters of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland.\u0026ldquoAs a cross-border organisation, we welcome the Taoiseach\u0026rsquos direct engagement with our members based in the border counties of the Republic and in so doing, recognising the longstanding cultural identity of the Orange family in the south.\u0026ldquoIt is also important to acknowledge the importance of the Taoiseach paying his respects to those members of our Institution, many of whom served in the security forces, who were murdered by terrorists.\u0026ldquoSuch a gesture should not be underestimated and will, I believe, be deeply appreciated by many relatives of the deceased, and the Orange membership as a whole."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/139/590x/secondary/david-davis-brexit-resignation-1374897.jpg","title":"david davis brexit theresa may resignation pact","story":"Had Mr Davis, Mr Baker and Ms Braverman resigned, the result would have been catastrophic The furious Brexit Secretary agreed with Steve Baker and Suella Braverman that should Mrs May go ahead with her plan to dodge a hard border with Northern Ireland, all three would quit on Thursday.Sources dubbed the atmosphere a \u0026ldquotinderbox and referring to the government, told the  \u0026ldquoit felt, for the first time, as if it could all have toppled.The pact was fuelled by Boris Johnson\u0026rsquos leaked remarks about wanting a more \u0026ldquomacho leadership on Brexit, which saw the Home Secretary lock horns with Mrs May when he told her to show more \u0026ldquoguts.Had Mr Davis, Mr Baker and Ms Braverman resigned, the result could have been one of Mrs May\u0026rsquos most vulnerable moments in power.The furious Brexit Secretary agreed with Steve Baker and Suella Braverman to form a pactThe storm could not have come at a worse time for Mrs May.She has a matter of days to defeat 15 House of Lords amendments to the Bill after they suggested she keep the UK in the EU customs union.The result of which would shackle Britain to the bloc forever.Mrs May also infuriated Brexit-backers by giving her remain-supporting cabinet ministers the first glimpse of her revised plan for avoiding a hard border with Northern Ireland in an attempt to keep them on side.

The multiple referendum tactic is one favoured by the EU who hold referendum after referendum until Brussels gets the result it wants.As a country we need to be looking ahead to the economic benefits Brexit offers Britain. This negative, patronising campaign from Best for Britain is the epitome of what is worst for Britain.Meanwhile, Best for Britain is lining up MPs to back an amendment to Brexit legislation in the autumn, to require a referendum, probably in early 2019.Theresa May has said there will be no second referendum.Number 10 insisted yesterday: There isn\u0027t going to be a second referendum.Jeremy Corbyn says Labour is not advocating one but his and his colleagues\u0027 statements have not ruled it out.Best for Britain chief executive Eloise Todd told a news conference in Westminster that it was wrong to say the result of the 2016 vote should not be challenged once people saw the detail of what Brexit actually meant.The will of the people is changing. The 48 per cent (who voted Remain in 2016) is now over 50 per cent and rising, she said.People are changing their minds. Isn\u0027t it a dereliction of duty not to check again with them on an issue of such historic importance?Chairman Lord Malloch-Brown - a former Labour minister - admitted it was possible his group would lose a vote but promised to accept such a result.He said Mrs May must now take charge and produce a detailed agreement in the autumn, not just a piece of paper to be waved at us from a plane, for Parliament and then the people to take a view on.Muddle has become the new normal. She must be sent to Brussels to get answers, he said.The former United Nations diplomat insisted he was not embarrassed for the group to take money from Mr Soros, a friend of 30 years who\u0026nbsp like him had spent a career trying to promote democracy round the world.Best for Britain had also taken careful legal advice on how it could use money from the non-British donor.In an open letter to voters, Best For Britain warned the political establishment was at risk of sleepwalking the country over the Brexit finish line next March without any clarity over whether the deal will be good for the UK.It says a new referendum can be fought in a less isive way than 2016 to start \u0026ldquohealing the splits the first vote exposed and caused.But Lord Malloch-Brown had a bad-tempered spat during a telephone interview with TalkRadio host Julia Hartley-Brewer.Britain\u0027s most senior judges ruled that Prime Minister Theresa May does not have the power to trigger the formal process Article 50 for the UK\u0027s exit from the European Union without Parliament having a say.

I don\u0027t think you\u0027re a democrat.Abruptly cutting off the call, the peer replied: With that Julia, a pleasure to talk to you. Thank you very much.Ahead of the Best for Britain launch, former Labour MP Gisela Stuart, chairman of pro-Brexit group Change Britain, told a BBC discussion on Cabinet Brexit isions that people were too focused on what ministers said and did.They have forgotten that the sentiments that led to the vote to leave the EU have not changed, she said.The public is still settled in its view and what we found in our polling is that even among those who voted Remain, there is an increased desire for the Government now to implement this."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/590x/Brexit-news-latest-today-referendum-Ireland-Norway-971905.jpg","title":"Brexit news UK EU European Union Norway EEA Theresa May","story":"Lord Christopher Francis Patten, a former minister, said the country is heading for a soft Brexit in which Britain stays closely aligned to the EU\u0026rsquos customs union and single market.Speaking to LBC, he said: \u0026ldquoI think that likelier is that we fetch up with something nearer to Norway, with us remaining in the customs union, with us continuing to be aligned with many of the regulations in the European Union.Norway is a member of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), meaning Oslo pays for access to the single market.

This is not your fault. Ask Daddy!”Can you imagine how that little girl must be feeling?She’s lost her mother and some have surmised the note appears to point the finger at her dad.It’s obviously not at all clear if that was really Kate’s intention, or whether she just wanted her daughter to seek answers and comfort from her father.That’s the trouble with suicide. Those left behind have to deal with so many unanswered questions.Look at little Ariane, who has just lost her beloved dad and will also be left with feelings of confusion and anger, as well as searing grief.Anthony, 61, was an award-winning chef and TV presenter.He was in France filming an episode of his successful CNN series, Parts Unknown, when he was found unresponsive in his hotel room.He was a larger-than-life, passionate character who championed the underdog and supported his girlfriend Asia Argento, one of the first actresses to accuse Harvey Weinstein of rape.Both Kate and Anthony were successful and, as far as the rest of the world was concerned, were living the dream.But no one really knows what goes on behind closed doors.Kate, who was 55, met husband Andy 35 years ago.They were married for 24 years but had been living apart for the past ten months, while sharing parental duties.They hadn’t discussed divorce and Andy said they still loved each other very much.He went on to say there was no indication that Kate was going to kill herself and his priority now is to protect and comfort his daughter.He will not only be grieving but inevitably feel he should have been able to somehow prevent this tragedy.People have asked “Who in their right mind would leave their own child to grow up motherless?”, but that’s the point.Kate wasn’t “in her right mind” and it seems neither was Anthony.People who kill themselves are suffering mental distress that no one can understand unless they have walked a mile in their shoes.On the surface, Kate had it all. Many thought she was still happily married. The couple had a healthy daughter, her designer label was a massive success.Kate was also good looking, funny and always seemed happy in interviews and photos. But now we know the poor woman was in agony.According to members of her family she had suffered from mental health problems for many years, and there has been speculation she was reluctant to seek help.If this was the case, then the reasons put forward for Kate trying to cope on her own are heartbreaking.She was apparently worried that her business, based on her cheerful handbags, would be affected if it was known she suffered from anxiety and depression. That really is desperately sad.Not only was Kate trying to cope with her demons but her marriage was going through a rocky patch and all the while she felt as though she had to paint on a smile and pretend everything was fine.Her life became so unbearable that she believed her only escape was to end it all.Her husband has said she was undergoing treatment and taking medication, yet Kate’s death shows that despite a change in attitudes towards those unfortunate enough to suffer from mental health problems, there is still a very long way to go.There are still people who will tell sufferers who are clearly very unwell to man up, or pull themselves together, which is just about the worst thing you could do.Suicide is a growing problem and each death is a tragedy. It is the biggest killer of men aged 20 to 49 in the UK. At least 84 men will have taken their own lives this week.If so many people were being lost to a virus there would be a national outcry and funds would be made available to find the cause and cure.Mental illness is still a Cinderella disease, and that cannot continue.But there are glimmers of hope.On TV we’ve seen the effect of Aidan Connor’s suicide on his friends and family in Coronation Street. It was tough to watch but raised awareness on a massive scale.We have seen raw grief but also deep anger and Aidan was branded selfish by his distraught sister.Those closest to him have experienced guilt because they didn’t realise how much pain he was in and have suffered sleepless nights and have been torturing themselves for not knowing how bad it was and for not offering help.Corrie shone a light in a dark place and I believe this storyline and the tragedy of Kate Spade and the apparent suicide of Anthony Bourdain will make people think.None of us knows what private battles are being fought against the dark demons of mental illness, even among our family and close friends.We all need to be watchful and unafraid to ask if everything really is OK. We need to be prepared to be rebuffed but to gently persist if we feel there is a real problem.The black despair that it seems Anthony Bourdain and Kate Spade succumbed to could happen to any one of us.If you feel depressed, please, I beg you, be brave and ask for help. And let’s all be prepared to reach out to that person in despair.I FIND it utterly ludicrous that in the eyes of the law a criminal who steals your pet is treated in exactly the same way as if they stole your TV or sofa.There’s no consideration for the fact that your dog or cat is a living, breathing animal and a much beloved member of the family.If the thieves are caught, although unlikely in these days of police cuts, the monetary value of the pet is the only consideration when it comes to sentencing.This is bonkers. You simply cannot put a price on your pet.So I am delighted that a campaign to change the law is gaining momentum.What all concerned dog and cat lovers want is higher sentencing for the theft of our animals and to reclassify stealing a pet as a crime in its own right.Hopefully this would act as a deterrent to pet theft, something alarmingly on the increase.One of those who passionately wants the law to change is Sir Bruce Forsyth’s daughter Debbie Matthews.Back in 2006, both her dogs were stolen from her car.She appeared on GMTV with her dad to make a heartfelt plea begging for the return of Yorkshire terriers Gizmo and Widget.Thankfully, within hours of appearing on the show, people who had bought the dogs in good faith at a market realised they were stolen from Debbie and she was emotionally reunited with them.It was a traumatic time for the whole family and Debbie knows she was incredibly lucky her story had a happy ending.So many owners never see their pets again and are left with endless worries about their fate.If you want to help change the law, do sign the pet theft petition at petition.parliament.uk/petitions/212174 and make your voice heard.IT was impossible to take the p*** out of Peter Stringfellow, because he would be first to make fun of himself.He knew his habit of wearing tiny thongs made him look daft, and was well aware that his mullet haircut was old-fashioned and silly and that people considered him to be a bit naff.When he was pilloried, he just gave one of his big guffaws and carried on enjoying himself.Peter was funny, kind-hearted and generous to a fault.He bore his illness with great stoicism and bravery and will be sadly missed.POLDARK returns to our screens tomorrow night amid a row over what many in Scotland refer to as “taps aff”.This occurs on those wonderful, albeit rare, occasions when the sunshine beams warmly north of the border and allows chaps to remove their cagoules, sweatshirts, woolly jumpers and tops.Aidan Turner, who plays Captain Poldark, is probably one of the most famous exponents of “taps aff” in recent times, ever since those sweaty scything scenes in his first series.It turns out that it was Aidan’s idea to take off his cambric shirt and scythe away in those tight breeches.But it’s caused the mother of all rows, with admiring women being accused of “objectifying” the bold captain.I have thoughtfully reproduced an image of a topless Aidan so you can make up your own minds.You will either think this photograph adds to the joy of a Saturday or be horrified by the sexualisation of the poor, unfortunate man.Frankly, I’m happy to wallow in this fantastic view and look forward to tomorrow, BBC1, 9pm, when I can enjoy some cracking writing, proper acting and top production values.Those “taps aff” scenes only enhance the pleasure of Poldark and, don’t forget, no one forced Aidan to show his pert nipples.He knows full well he’s a handsome fella and it was all his choice, for which we are truly grateful.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But he realised it wasnt there, so he started yelling at me.“I was hysterical covered in shards of broken glass.”Noralyn managed to escape and sprinted down the street, only for the robbers to flee the scene empty handed.Luckily a road sweeper saw the attack and called the police.Hampstead is an affluent area, home to celebrities like Harry Styles, Rita Ora and Michael McIntrye who was recently targeted by a moped gang who stole his £15,000 watch.Noralyn is frustrated that the Met Police are not putting more officers on the beat, especially as Hampstead is a “prime target” for muggers.She said: “I feel angry: angry that the criminals are getting more brazen and violent. You think you are safe inside your car youre not any more.”Statistics show how the police have lost control of large parts of the capital, with ultra-violent youths running riot.The easy availability of knives and acid, and the speed and manoeuvrability of scooters, has combined to see London gang warfare reach terrifying new levels.The most recent official figures recorded 19,385 moped crimes in just nine months - a rate of around sixty a day.This is a 1,000 per cent rise in just three years.As well as moped gang attacks, the capital has also seen a sharp rise in the number of stabbings and shootings.The new Met Police statistics  showed a five per cent rise in violent crime in the past year.Statistics showed 35 youth homicides in the last 12 months, which was up 25 per cent, a surge in the rate of muggings of 30 per cent, and an 18 per cent rise in knife crime offences.Since the turn of the year more than 60 people have been murdered on the streets of London - which has seen the capital overtake New York.Moped gangs have fuelled Britain’s biggest crime rise in a decade.London alone saw 16,000 last year — up from just 1,053 in 2014.They have been used in crimes such as phone snatches and gem store raids, while two moped muggers were convicted of murder last month after knifing charity worker Abdul Samad, 28, in Maida Vale, West London.Last year a ten-strong £1million London moped raid gang got 110 years’ jail.Thugs also tried to rob West Ham’s Andy Carroll of a £22,000 watch and targeted ex-Chancellor George Osborne."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/nintchdbpict000289788959.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"hartlepool council county durham runs out parking tickets","story":"Drivers in Hartlepool were let off scot-free when the council’s usual ticket supplier went into liquidation.Offenders in the seaside town have avoided fines for over a week and been issued with warnings instead.The council manages more than 2,000 parking spaces and, based on previously published figures, it is estimated around £100,000 a year is collected in fines – an average of about £2,000 a week.A Hartlepool Borough Council spokesman said: “Our regular supplier of printed Penalty Charge Notice tickets has gone into liquidation, something officers were not aware of until they tried to place a repeat order.“Officers found a new company and placed an order on Thursday, May 17, and were told delivery would be made within ten days.“Unfortunately, this did not happen and we ran out on May 30.”The issue came to light when a visitor to a car park at Seaton Carew was given a warning, rather than a ticket, by an enforcement officer.Councillor James Black, who represents Seaton, said: “Unfortunately these things do happen when reliance is placed on a single company to provide a service.“It doesn’t happen often, but it does happen.

Colours, or flags, were carried, or trooped, down the rank so that they could be seen and recognised by the soldiers.In the 18th century, guards from the royal palaces assembled daily on Horse Guards to troop the colours and in 1748 it was announced that the parade would also mark the Sovereigns official birthday.This year the ceremony saw the Colour of the 1st Battalion the Coldstream Guards being trooped.Guardsman Charanpreet Singh Lall, 22, a Sikh from Leicester, became the first to wear a turban during the parade.His turban features a ceremonial cap star to match the bearskin hats worn by the other soldiers.Im quite proud and I know that a lot of other people are proud of me as well, he said.For myself, being the first turban-wearing Sikh to troop the colour and to be part of the escort it is a really high honour for myself, and hopefully for everyone else as well.My mum was crying on the day I passed out so I wonder what is going to happen to her when she sees me in this.Trooping the Colour has commemorated the birthday of the sovereign for more than 250 years and also functions as a display of army drills, music and horsemanship.Among the guests was Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson, the Prime Minister Theresa May normally attends but is at a G7 meeting of world leaders in Canada.The massed bands of the Household Division and the Mounted Band of the Household Calvary provided the musical backing for the ceremony.While also taking part was the Kings Troop Royal Horse Artillery, who fired a 41-gun salute in Green Park to mark the Queens official birthday.The Queens actual birthday was on April 21 when she turned 92.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Theresa May lives under the dark cloud of that rejection, her authority still irrecoverable.But the wider political consequences have been as equally profound. The purpose of this ostensibly unnecessary election was to liberate the prime minister\u0027s hands from her errant backbenchers, marginalise the House of Commons from the Brexit process and provide her with the flexibility she so craved.On all three counts it had the opposite effect. Far from freeing Mrs May, it has bound her to the shackles of the Commons\u0027 portcullis.As next week\u0027s parliamentary votes will demonstrate, she will find herself beholden to the benches to her front and behind.Every single member of parliament matters and will do so even more when and if a vote on the final deal takes place in the autumn.The election served to diffuse, not concentrate political power, especially with regards to Brexit.Ever since election night, Brussels hasn\u0027t just been dealing with Number 10 but in effect, the House of Commons too.Within that, power is further dispersed: the Tory Remain camp, the Tory Leave camp, the Labour frontbench, the Labour backbench, some to Edinburgh and SNP HQ, some to Belfast and the DUP.One of the clarion calls of the referendum was that parliamentary sovereignty must be restored.It is an irony that that restoration should come not as a result of the referendum, but from an election which left the executive denuded and a legislature enhanced. That legislature has since done all it can to soften many of the consequences of the referendum which prompted its election in the first place. Such are the odd ironies of political life and history.The election also muddled the political imperatives behind Brexit.It had been argued that the people\u0027s will had been expressed clearly and absolutely on 23 June 2016, and that that mandate was clear.But the 2017 general election confused that narrative. A government had gone to the people on a prospectus of a hard Brexit and specifically asked for a super-majority for its execution.The prime minister stood on the steps of Downing Street and said parliament was thwarting her and by extension the people\u0027s will and argued only total parliamentary dominance would nullify the problem.The electorate did not oblige, indeed, they reduced the prime minister\u0027s power. The House of Commons became more, not less, Remainer in composition.There were now two dual wills, expressed by the same people at different times, with apparently contradictory impulses and instructions. The electorate, it seemed, was confused. The Brexit process, accordingly, became as equally chaotic.It also put pay to any distinctly Mayite domestic political agenda.Think back to those salad days of the early May premiership. Grammar schools, a new interventionist industrial policy, talk of a vote on fox hunting - all have vanished.There is no majority for any of it, even with the DUP. Instead the tumbleweeds blow through the corridors of parliament and the order paper is covered with little ink.However, when the history books are finally written (and heaven help the historians who have to make sense of our era), perhaps they will focus less on the direct political consequences of the election inside the Commons but rather as an important signal and harbinger of the enormous changes taking place outside the chamber.The 2017 election threw up the playing board of traditional British party politics.As I sat there on election night, bizarre results came through. Kensington and Canterbury had gone Labour. Mansfield and Stoke South had gone Tory.At first we wondered if there was a glitch in the system. Rather, we soon realised, the glitch was in our own imperfect understanding of what was happening to the political world outside.In courting those voters, in casting a hard Brexit as the only one possible, she incurred the wrath of liberal Conservative Remain voters and the young.It cost her seats such as Bath, Warwick, Canterbury and her majority.On the day after the night before, as election geeks like me surveyed the new political landscape, what we saw was, for traditional students of British politics, a confusing sight.Old cast-iron rules of British political life seemed to have crumbled.Most strikingly, the class centres of gravity for both parties had shifted - 2017 showed that neither Labour\u0027s grip on the working class nor the Conservatives\u0027 grip on the professional middle class remained strong.Labour lost a huge number of working-class voters to the Tories and vice versa with the Conservatives losing lots of professionals to Labour.Some commentators suggested that that would prove a blip, that given it was a Brexit election, when that issue is settled, traditional voting behaviour will reassert itself.It is possible, but I am far from convinced.First, it\u0027s unlikely Brexit will, in some senses, ever be \"over\" as an electoral issue.Secondly, Brexit turbocharged party political class crossdressing but it had been happening for a while anyway, since at least 2010. The process appears to be speeding up, not slowing: the electoral data we have since 2017 has confirmed that hypothesis, not least the local election results.YouGov data published only this week shows the continued bleeding of Labour\u0027s working class support. Whisper it: Labour is getting posher and the Tories are going the other way.A realignment is taking place, not in one fell swoop as Mrs May had intended but instead, slowly, over time, in fits and starts.A wise man once said that every trend is a trend until it bends.However, the forces driving this trend, this rewriting of the parties\u0027 DNA are profound: the rise of the graduate class, technological changes, distaste with globalisation and the rise of identity politics.These politically flammable materials just needed a flame, provided by Brexit and the general election which flowed from it.Historians may well then look back to 2017 as a defining moment in the respective voter bases of both major political parties in the 21st century.In the meantime though, overall polling shows both parties more or less stuck on where they were in 2017. To coin a phrase, nothing has changed.That\u0027s despite the fact that the Conservatives have had a combination of Brexit civil war, Cabinet resignations roughly every six weeks, sex scandals, a minister negotiating her own foreign policy, a cough, a P45 and a dodgy set, Grenfell, Windrush and more besides, none of it has made any difference.If there were another election tomorrow, all the indications, including the local election results, indicate the result would be much the same.Blame has been attached to both Mrs May and especially Jeremy Corbyn for this failure to break through.Perhaps, however, that isn\u0027t fair. The pool of swing voters is just too small. Brexit has bound us in our respective party political boxes. It has helped create a British culture war.In these circumstances, it is increasingly difficult to persuade voters from the other party\u0027s bloc to come to your side.The result? Two zombie parties, lurching, ambling, groping towards the finish line, without success. We may therefore be stuck with a variant of the 2017 election and the contours it set on British politics for some considerable time to come.Someone, not long ago, asked me which was my favourite election of all time. After a moment\u0027s thought, I smiled and said: \"Easy, 2017.\""},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/06/2048x1152/skynews-taylor-swift-reputation-stadium-tour_4331454.jpg?20180609022929 ","title":"taylor swift praises manchesters incredible resilience after bombing","story":"She added: \"I just wanted to say, Manchester, it\u0027s such an honour to be playing for you tonight.\"Swift also explained why she wanted to play her first UK stadium gig in the city.Swift, 28, delivered her heartfelt comments while talking with fans between performing her songs.She is playing the Etihad Stadium again on Saturday before moving to Dublin and then Wembley Stadium later this month."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/06/2048x1152/skynews-unicorn-generic_4331160.jpg?20180608182731 ","title":"unicorns and pigeons five things we learned about brexit this week","story":"Critics claimed Labour\u0027s new stance was representative of a \"cake and eat it\" attitude towards Brexit, with the party accused of misleading voters and \"peddling snake oil\".It was also suggested the party\u0027s position would mean the UK continuing to accept the EU\u0027s free movement rules on immigration after Brexit, despite Labour\u0027s manifesto stating free movement will end when Britain departs the EU.Henry Newman, director of the Open Europe think tank and a former adviser to Michael Gove, said: \"Because it\u0027s opposition politics they can promise unicorns without worrying about having to deliver them.\"2) The PM won\u0027t reveal when her Brexit plan will be published - but is happy to talk about pigeonsAt Prime Minister\u0027s Questions on Wednesday, Theresa May failed to answer Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s questions on when a promised white paper on the government\u0027s negotiating position for a future EU-UK relationship will be published. She also dodged the Labour leader\u0027s questions on when the government would reveal its preferred model for new customs arrangements with the EU.However, the prime minister did tell Tory backbencher Chris Davies she would be \"happy\" to sponsor a pigeon in the House of Commons versus House of Lords pigeon race.3) Brexit is always three years awayOn Thursday, the government published a new proposal for a backstop solution to the Irish border issue, in the event a wider EU-UK agreement does not prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland.Brexit Secretary David Davis claimed victory, following crisis talks with the prime minister, when the plan was amended to include a time limit on the proposal, which the document revealed would see the UK remain in temporary customs arrangement with the EU until December 2021 \"at the latest\".4) David Davis is an angry, angry, angry manAfter his battle with the prime minister over the backstop proposal, which prompted speculation he was on the verge of quitting the government, friends of Mr Davis told Sky News he is frustrated with Mrs May.

Unless your child is taller than 135cm or over the age of 12 then they legally need to be in a car seat. And quite apart from the law, kids\u0027 car seats save lives and prevent serious injuries. When riding a bike it\u0027s important to have the right safety gear too. Although there is no legal requirement to wear a helmet, recent research shows that wearing one significantly reduces the risk of sustaining a head injury. Child Safety Week is designed to help parents and carers understand how best to keep kids safe and Halfords has an amazing range of bike and car equipment that will help. From car seats to bike lights there\u0027s lots of gear to keep your little ones safe on the road and lots of in-store expert advice to help you fit what you buy. Car safety: Babies and toddlers    Very small children need additional protection and modern car seats offer a lot of features to keep your baby as safe as possible – for example, extra neck and head supports mean that they are protected in an impact. The Joie Spin 360 is versatile. It can be rear-facing for infants up to 9kg and switched to forward-facing for kids between 9 and 18kg. It rotates so you can get your baby out of the car easily and it has five recline settings for both forward and rear-facing modes. ISOFIX compliance means it mounts to hard anchors in your car for maximum safety. Car safety: Older kids  Once your kids weigh more than 15kg they need a group 2-3 booster seat. These are adjustable to allow your children to use them up until 12 years or a weight of 36kg. After that weight, they can rely on normal car seatbelts. The Joie Trilo Inkewell has washable seat covers (crucial, given the amount of time they\u0027re used for and how messy little ones can be) and offer side impact protection and an adjustable headrest. There\u0027s even a cupholder! If you don\u0027t have ISOFIX mounts in your car then the Halfords Highback Booster Seat offers excellent protection and are secured by the car\u0027s seatbelt. There\u0027s an included cupholder, washable cover and adjustable headrest. It also has side impact protection too, as you\u0027d expect.  Halfords also has an in-store car seat demo and fitting service too, which will help you learn how the seats need to be fitted and ensure they’re compatible with your car. Car safety: High-backed or backless boosters There are two different kinds of booster seat on the market. High-backed tend to have more advantages which include supporting a child’s head, allowing them to sleep and protecting them in an accident. High-backed seats also help to keep the seatbelt correctly positioned on children, especially smaller kids. Backless booster seats are, on the whole, cheaper though and may suit older and larger children slightly more than those with backs. Bike safety: helmets    The first thing any young cyclist needs is a helmet. Young kids might like to choose a fun design and Halfords has Polka Dots , princesses , stars or even an absolutely awesome skull design, along with a range of fun colours. Prices start at \u0026pound10. Older kids might like the Mongoose Urban Helmet, which looks cool and offers excellent protection. It\u0027s also available in either black and white, to suit their style. Halfords has a great range of helmets and in-store experts can help you find the right helmet for your little one.

The former Liverpool striker and manager, 67, is knighted for services to football, charity and the City of Liverpool. Also honoured are screen stars Emma Thompson and Keira Knightley, ex-University Challenge host Bamber Gascoigne and rapper Ms Dynamite. The list is full of hundreds of unsung heroes, from counsellors and a Holocaust survivor to Britain\u0027s longest-serving poppy seller. But there are also fatcat bosses of Royal Mail and Network Rail whose gongs are likely to prompt accusations of rewards for failure. Here is the 2018 Queen\u0027s Birthday Honours List in full. Honours in numbers  In total, 1,057 people have received an award. Of the total number recognised in the Queen’s Birthday Honours list this year, 210 have been made an OBE, 392 an MBE, and 318 awarded a BEM. There are always rows over gongs for cronies and the establishment, but 71% of honours went to everyday community heroes. Meanwhile 11% work in education, 12% in health, 13% in industry, 3% in science and technology and 5% in sport. Just under half the recipients (49%) are women, while 10% of all those on the list are from ethnic minorities. The biggest names Kenny Dalglish  Liverpool football legend Kenny Dalglish heads a host of the great and the good receiving gongs in the Queen’s birthday honours. The former striker and manager, 67, who was at Hillsborough when 96 fans were killed in 1989, becomes a knight. The 67-year-old Glaswegian and his wife Marina have helped raise millions of pounds for charity after she successfully battled breast cancer. Sir Kenny joked he thought the letter was from the taxman - and told the Mirror he will still be very much the same person after the honour. “It doesn’t feel right. It doesn’t feel comfortable. No-one will be calling me that anyway,” he smiled.  Jermain Defoe celebrated an OBE by paying tribute to best friend Bradley Lowery, his six-year-old “best friend” who died last year. The former England striker struck up a moving relationship with little Bradley during his time at Sunderland as the lad battled a rare type of cancer. The Premier league star, whose award recognises the work of the Jermain Defoe Foundation in St Lucia, told the Mirror: “It was a special relationship. Over the years playing football, being lucky enough, being blessed and realising you are role models, there are a lot of kids who look up to you.”  Keira Knightley will receive an OBE for her services to drama and charity. The royal honour comes more than 15 years after the twice Oscar-nominated film star scored her breakthrough role as a football-loving teenager in Bend It Like Beckham. Since then, Knightley, 33, has gone on to star in Pirates of the Caribbean, Love Actually and Pride \u0026amp Prejudice.  One of Britain\u0027s most acclaimed actresses, Emma Thompson, is made a Dame for services to drama after winning Oscars, Baftas, Golden Globes and Emmys. The 59-year-old has been a star since the 1980s in The Remains Of The Day, Howards End, Harry Potter films and the Nanny McPhee films. Born in 1959 to an acting parents, she studied English at Cambridge and joined comedy troupe Footlights alongside Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie. A human rights activist, Greenpeace and Labour supporter, she lives with husband Greg Wise, daughter Gaia, 18, and a son, Tindyebwa Agaba, a Rwandan orphan they informally adopted in 2003 when he was 14. Anthony Joshua  World heavyweight champion boxer Anthony Joshua is made an OBE for services to sport. It is the second honour for the star, who is just 28, after he led a team of Olympic gold medallists receiving MBEs in 2013.  Tom Hardy, who receives a CBE for services to drama, made his name on the big screen with a series of hard man roles. The 40-year-old actor is known for Inception, Mad Max: Fury Road, Bronson and The Revenant. But the privately-educated star has a hard-bitted back story in real life too. He has spoken about how he went off the rails with alcohol addiction, checking himself into rehab in 2003. He\u0027s been clean ever since. I went in thinking I\u0027d do it for a little bit until I can go out and drink and people forgive me. But I did my 28 days, and after listening to people who had been through similar circumstances I realised I did have a problem, he previously told the Mirror. Mark Carne  Network Rail boss Mark Carne – blamed for bungling new timetables which have left passengers stranded and delayed – collects a CBE for services to the rail industry. Meanwhile the number of trains either cancelled or more than 30 minutes late on Northern and Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) routes averaged 11% and 13% respectively in the first two weeks of the new timetables. Mr Carne said in a statement last week that timetables were finalised “significantly later than normal for reasons that were both within and without our control”. He continued: “It has not been good enough and we know it.” Moya Greene  Another corporate boss accused of being rewarded for failure is Royal Mail chief Moya Greene, who becomes a Dame. The Canadian dubbed “Moneybags Moya” oversaw the 2013 privatisation of the service. In the same year, she was forced to hand back a shocking \u0026pound120,000 housing perk. She was given the money to help her buy a home as part of a lavish \u0026pound1.5million pay and perks package last year. She steps down later this year with almost \u0026pound1million - a cash payment equivalent to 12 months’ base salary, which was \u0026pound547,800 last year, as well as a payment equivalent to her expected annual bonus of \u0026pound367,000. Kazuo Ishiguro Author Kazuo Ishiguro said he is proud of Britain, its open, democratic traditions and literary culture after being awarded a knighthood for services to literature - less than a year after winning the Nobel Prize. His acclaimed works include The Remains Of The Day for which he won the Man Booker Prize. The 63-year-old said: I\u0027m deeply touched to receive this honour from the nation that welcomed me as a small foreign boy, that educated me and nurtured me. At this uncertain moment around our globe, I remain proud of Britain, its open, democratic traditions - and its wonderful literary culture in which I\u0027ve been allowed to participate. Ms Dynamite  Rapper and singer Ms Dynamite is honoured with an MBE - under her real name Niomi McLean-Daley. The 37-year-old who burst onto the scene with earworm hit Dy-na-mi-tee in 2002 is recognised for services to music. She retreated from the spotlight in 2006 after being arrested outside a London nightclub and sentenced to community service. Since then she has featured on TV, guest-hosted on BBC radio and appeared on Katy B\u0027s Lights On track. Mark Rowley Following a wave of terror attacks which struck the UK in 2017, former assistant commissioner of the politan Police Mark Rowley, who led the national response, is honoured with a knighthood. On his retirement in March after 31 years in policing Mr Rowley was praised by Prime Minister Theresa May for his dedication to protecting public safety and tackling the evils of terrorism. Politicians  Among the politicians honoured are Conservative deputy Commons speaker Eleanor Laing and Tory Brexiteer Bernard Jenkin, awarded a damehood and a knighthood respectively for their political and public service. Labour\u0027s Louise Ellman has also been made a dame for parliamentary and political services. Britain\u0027s richest billionaire  Britain\u0027s richest billionaire Jim Ratcliffe, the boss of chemical company Ineos who is worth \u0026pound21.05 billion, receives a knighthood for services to business and investment. The firm’s Grangemouth refinery was at the centre of the most bitter industrial disputes in recent years when it was threatened with closure in 2013, triggering a major rift with the unions.  Alpine skier Menna Fitzpatrick is the youngest on this year\u0027s list, picking up an MBE for services to Paralympic winter Olympic sport. The Welsh star is just 20 but she\u0027s already Britain\u0027s most successful winter paralympian after learning to ski aged five. She gained slalom gold, super combined silver, giant slalom silver and super-G bronze at this year\u0027s Winter Paralympics. The oldest - Britain\u0027s longest-serving poppy seller  Former Second World War nurse Rosemary Powell, who at 103 is the oldest on the list, is made an MBE for voluntary service. She has spent an astonishing 97 years collecting for the Royal British Legion Poppy Appeal, and announced she will hang up her collecting tin just days ago because she feels she is “getting old”. Rosemary was just six when she began selling the Royal British Legion poppies on Remembrance Day in 1921 – the year the appeal was first held. She said: We did it in memory of those men who were killed – for their sacrifice. Sadly war has had a significant impact on my life.”  Best of the rest Renowned war correspondent Kate Adie is made a CBE for services to media, while Stacey Dooley, known for her BBC Three investigative series covering topics ranging from the fight against Isis to the abortion debate, receives an MBE for services to broadcasting. Thriller writer Ken Follett gets a CBE and TV presenter and Britain’s best-known classicist Professor Mary Beard collects a Damehood. Waterstones founder Tim Waterstone is now a Sir. Holocaust survivor Ber Helfgott, also known as Ben, is knighted for services to Holocaust remembrance and education. Chief Scientific Officer for NHS England Professor Susan Hill is made a dame for services to the 100,000 Genome Project and to NHS Genomic Medicine, while surgeon Nadine Hachach-Haram is awarded a BEM for services to surgery and innovation, having co-founded a company pioneering virtual access to surgery for people in remote areas. Judy Naake, who made millions selling St Tropez self-tanning products, initially from the back of her car, receives an MBE for services to entrepreneurship, the community and philanthropy. Jo Malone, creator of the self-titled luxury perfumery brand who has since started the fragrance-centred Jo Loves business, is awarded a CBE for services to the British economy and the GREAT Britain campaign. But no Grenfell honours this time While there are no honours for local heroes involved in the response to the Grenfell Tower fire, the Cabinet has said it expects acts of bravery and extraordinary community spirit which emerged from the tragedy to feature on future lists, adding that its approach will be time-appropriate.

She first helped her mother sell poppies for the Royal British Legion’s inaugural Poppy Appeal in 1921 aged only six.

Mike Haines dedicated the honour, for voluntary service to tolerance and education in the UK and abroad, to his younger sibling, who was beheaded by Islamic State extremists in 2014 after being taken hostage in Syria. Haines, of Dundee, said: “It means a great deal to me and my family. “Nonetheless, I want to be clear that this award is not about me, but for all those who have supported the Global Acts of Unity campaign and the values it stands for. “Like many of those receiving awards today, I stand on the shoulders of those who support me.

You devoted your life to helping others, and in this I hope you see your mission lives on.”  A nun who has spent almost a decade leading an anti-human trafficking network across Europe hopes her inclusion on the honours list will draw attention to the “terrible crime”. Sister Imelda Poole, president of Religious in Europe Networking Against Trafficking and Exploitation, is made an MBE for services to combating modern slavery. The nun previously spent many years helping vulnerable people in the UK including in Manchester, Glasgow and Middlesbrough. Sister Imelda said: “This is an honour which I accept on behalf of the female religious and co-workers who are contributing, through the mission of many international networks such as RENATE, to combating modern day slavery and on behalf of the dedicated staff of Mary Ward Loreto in Albania who are passionate in this same cause. “May this award expose even further the terrible crime of human trafficking which, as Pope Francis has declared, is a crime against humanity itself.”  A Muslim woman hopes her MBE “silences the haters” who contribute to Islamophobia. Mum-of-three Akeela Ahmed, 39, said last year’s terror attacks fuelled Islamophobia. She added: “I really do hope ... me getting this award will really help women understand that not everybody views Muslim women in that way and actually we’re as much part of this country as anybody else and our achievements are recognised and validated as well and also hope it just kind of silences the haters a bit as well.”  Football legend “King” Kenny Dalglish becomes Sir Kenny as he leads a host of public figures receiving gongs in the Queen’s birthday honours. The former Liverpool striker and manager, 67, is knighted for services to football, charity and the City of Liverpool. Jermain Defoe is awarded an OBE for his foundation\u0027s work in the Caribbean, and paid tribute to “best friend” Bradley Lowery, who died last year aged six. Heavyweight world champion boxer Anthony Joshua gets an OBE Dunkirk actor Tom Hardy receives a CBE for services to drama ex-University Challenge presenter Bamber Gascoigne becomes a CBE for services to the arts and skeleton gold medallist Lizzie Yarnold gets an OBE for services to Winter Olympic sport.  Oscar-winning actress Emma Thompson, who starred in Howards End, Love Actually and the Nanny McPhee films, becomes a Dame, while Pirates of the Caribbean’s Keira Knightley gets an OBE. Elsewhere in the arts world, rapper Ms Dynamite becomes an MBE, thriller writer Ken Follett gets a CBE and TV presenter and Britain’s best-known classicist Professor Mary Beard collects a Damehood.  Sir Kenny, who managed Liverpool at the time of the Hillsborough disaster in which 96 of the team’s fans died, said he was “hugely proud to have accepted the accolade”. The Glaswegian and his wife Marina have also helped raise millions of pounds for cancer treatment through the Marina Dalglish Appeal after she successfully battled breast cancer. It has raised more than \u0026pound10million to set up an oncology centre at University Hospital, Aintree. Joking that he thought the letter informing him of the knighthood had been from the taxman, he added of the achievement: “We only set out to do the best we possibly could, even through all the other stuff - the charity or Hillsborough, it was to help people because somebody helped us.”  Newly-knighted Sir Kenny Dalglish saw crown-headed letter land on doormat - and thought it was from the taxman   The citation for the honour specifically referred to his inspirational work in supporting the families of the bereaved Hillsborough victims, and his work in support of the quest for justice, which culminated in a judgement of unlawful killings of the victims. Sir Kenny told of his pride at the recognition for his family, and the people in Liverpool and Scotland who have always supported him. “When I was a young boy in Glasgow I wouldn’t have had the words to give this honour due testimony, but we are hugely proud to have got this and for the people who have worked so hard to get here,” he said. “We are immensely proud as a whole family to have got it but everyone should feel proud because they have all played a very important role in what we’ve done and where we have got to.”  He insisted he will still be very much the same person after the honour, and admitted he will feel strange being addressed as Sir Kenny. “It doesn’t feel right. It doesn’t feel comfortable. No-one will be calling me that anyway,” he smiles. “I don’t think it makes me any different. It’s for yourself and for everyone who has been associated with you through the years, from your parents to your professional career.  “Obviously a lot of people must have pushed my name forward for the accolade, which is hugely humbling but also very gratifying as well.” He also spoke of the pride his mum Cathy and dad Bill would have felt about his incredible journey from Glasgow’s East End where he was born, to Buckingham Palace and a knight of the realm. “As a parent myself if one of my kids went that far you would be hugely proud of them, wouldn’t you? I don’t think they would be any different to anyone else,” he said. “Your parents are the ones who set you off in the world.  “They put you in the right direction or the wrong direction, and thankfully for myself and Marina we got pushed in the right direction. “We met great people from then on in. It doesn’t do you any harm when you meet good people. “It’s just lucky, it’s life’s journey. We’ve been lucky.” Veteran war correspondent Kate Adie is made a CBE for services to media.  Businesswoman Jo Malone, famed for her fragrant candles, is awarded a CBE for services to the British economy and a campaign encouraging people to visit and invest in the UK. Japan-born Nobel prize-winning author Kazuo Ishiguro, knighted for his services to literature, said he was “deeply touched to receive this honour from the nation that welcomed me as a small foreign boy”. Controversially, Britain’s richest man Jim Ratcliffe, the boss of chemical company Ineos who this year topped the Sunday Times rich list with \u0026pound21.05 billion, receives a knighthood for services to business and investment.  The firm’s Grangemouth refinery was at the centre of the most bitter industrial disputes in recent years when it was threatened with closure in 2013, triggering a major rift with the unions. A CBE for Network Rail chief Mark Carne will cause fury after the recent train timetable fiasco.

The royal couple, who have just returned from their honeymoon in Canada, have reportedly leased the former cowshed. Situated in the Cotswolds, the barn has been given a 21st century makeover. Fifteen years ago it was used to house cattle on a vast 4,000 acre estate as part of a set of decaying farm buildings. Now each of the buildings have been radically revamped into a spectacular countryside residence.   The abode is believed to contain a split-level kitchen as well as a spacious dining room, according to the Daily Mail .  The bedroom, which boasts views of the surrounding valley, has a dressing room as well as an en-suite bathroom. The Duke and Duchess\u0027 reported getaway, which has not been identified for privacy reasons, is said to be on the huge Great Tew Estate.  The estate is also close to posh private members’ club Soho Farmhouse, which has been visited by many of Meghan’s friends. The grounds, which were once a Roman farm, possess an impressive history. It was given by William I to his half-brother Odo, bishop of Bayaeux, following the 11th century Norman conquests.  It is now owned by multi-millionaire Nicholas Johnson, an Old Etonian who has sough to revitalise its fortunes by refurbishing many of the building on its land. The estate is situated near the affluent Oxfordshire town of Chipping Norton which counts former Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson and former Blur bassist Alex James as residents.

The new Duchess of Sussex, 36, wore her dark hair in loose ringlets as she joined Prince Harry at the traditional summer spectacle. Meghan experienced the pomp and pageantry of the event for the first time when she arrived on Horse Guards Parade with Harry in a carriage, along with the Queen\u0027s cousin the Duke of Kent. The couple were greeted by the sight of hundreds of Guardsmen in their scarlet tunics and bearskins lined up on the parade ground - Henry VIII\u0027s former jousting yard - as the event began. Harry, 33, did not travel on horseback alongside his brother William because he is not a Regimental Colonel. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who married three weeks today, travelled from Buckingham Palace along The Mall to cheers from royal fans gathered in the famous London thoroughfare. The Duchess of Cornwall and Duchess of Cambridge were in another carriage while a third carried Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, the Countess of Wessex and her daughter Lady Louise.  The Duchess of Sussex wore a dress by Carolina Herrera and a hat by Philip Treacy, while Kate wore a dress by Alexander McQueen and a hat by Juliette Botterill. Camilla wore a pale blue silk dress and coat by Bruce Oldfield and a hat by Philip Treacy. Trooping the Colour is a ceremonial spectacle that brings together prestigious regiments and the families of the serving men and women in celebration of the monarch\u0027s official birthday. Stands lining Horse Guards were filled with the wives, girlfriends and parents of the servicemen who when not performing ceremonial duties are fighting soldiers.  Meghan, Harry and the other members of the royal family took their place in Wellington\u0027s former office which overlooks the parade ground. Later this afternoon, the couple will join other members of the royal family on Buckingham Palace\u0027s balcony to watch the RAF flypast and acknowledge the crowds. The Queen, who recently had a successful eye operation to remove a cataract, will watch the Trooping ceremony from a dais in Horse Guards and later inspect the lines of guardsmen in their scarlet tunics and bearskins.  More than 1,000 soldiers are taking part in the annual event with traditional display of pomp and pageantry. The colour being paraded this year is the flag of the 1st Battalion Coldstream Guards. The Duke of Edinburgh, who celebrates his 97th birthday on Sunday, has retired from official public duties and is not in attendance. The royal colonels, all on horseback, will accompany the Queen. They include the Prince of Wales, Colonel of the Welsh Guards, the Princess Royal, Colonel of the Blues and Royals, and the Duke of Cambridge, Colonel of the Irish Guards. Riding in the ceremony for the first time is the Duke of York in his new role as Colonel of the Grenadier Guards.  As with previous years, the Duchess of Cambridge and the Duchess of Cornwall sat together in a carriage. The procession is accompanied by a Sovereign\u0027s Escort of the Household Cavalry, made up of Life Guards and Blues and Royals, in their silver and gold breastplates and plumed helmets. After the ceremony the royal family will head back to Buckingham Palace and gather on the balcony to watch the RAF flypast. Among the 23 aircraft taking part are modern jets and historic aircraft, while the Red Arrows will be the finale.

To mark turning 92, she will attend a concert at the Royal Albert Hall in her honour. With a line-up of every great grandmother\u0027s dreams (or nightmares), she will be entertained by performers from Sir Tom Jones to Shaggy and Sting to Kylie Minogue, Craig David, Anne Marie and Shawn Mendes - plus the BBC Concert Orchestra. And it will all be shown live on BBC One. But as you might have heard, the Queen actually celebrates two special days - and what is traditionally the bigger deal is actually still to come. The monarch having two birthdays is a measure that was introduced 250 years ago, and it\u0027s still going strong. Here\u0027s all you need to know about why the Queen gets two days to mark her birthday every year instead of one. When are the Queen\u0027s birthdays?   The Queen was born at 2.40am on April 21 at her maternal grandfather\u0027s London house, 17 Bruton Street .  But she also has an official birthday in June - usually on the second Saturday. This year it falls on Saturday June 9.  No. It is all down to the British weather. Since 1748, the monarch\u0027s official birthday has been marked by the parade known as Trooping the Colour - usually held on the king or queen\u0027s actual birthday. But Edward VII, who reigned from 1901 to 1910, was born in November. He celebrated officially in May or June because there was less chance of it being cold and drizzly during the outdoor event. The monarch after Edward VII - George V - helpfully had a birthday in June, but the Queen\u0027s father, George VI, whose birthday was in December, reintroduced the tradition of an official birthday, which Elizabeth II has continued. Is her official birthday always on a Saturday?  It is now. George VI had his official birthday on the second Thursday of June. In 1959, after several years on the throne, the Queen changed it to the second Saturday for convenience. It can now be on either the first or the second, and sometimes the third Saturday of the month and is marked by Trooping the Colour carriage and horse procession in central London and a fly-past over Buckingham Palace. The Queen\u0027s Birthday Honours List is also announced, the Union flag flown from Government buildings and gun salutes at noon. What does she usually do on her actual birthday?  She usually spends it privately - except when duty beckons or it is a milestone celebration. On her 90th, she carried out a birthday walkabout in Windsor and in the evening lit a beacon before joining her family for a lavish black-tie dinner in Windsor Castle. Aides do try to give the Queen a break on her birthday from the famous red boxes containing state papers. And on her official birthday?  It is a busy affair with the Trooping the Colour ceremony, which ends with key royals appearing on the Buckingham Palace balcony.

From children\u0027s author Roald Dahl to film director Alfred Hitchcock, 277 people declined the Queen\u0027s Honours in the New Year or Birthday Honours lists from 1951 to 1999, the Cabinet Office confirmed in 2012. Since that official list of those who had declined honours were first published, it has become increasingly common for celebs to reveal their refusal. Before that, it had been relatively rare to do so. While people have explained their decision to turn down honours in many different ways, a number have cited the honours system’s links to empire. How do you refuse an honour? Nominees are asked by Downing Street if they will accept well in advance, and are usually able to reject the offer without going public. Several personalities said a polite ‘no’ to the Queen on more than one occasion. So who exactly has turned down the Birthday Honours, here we take a look at the big names who have rejected the award. Who has refused Birthday Honours? Back in 2003, a list of living celebs who had refused gongs had been leaked, including David Bowie and Helen Mirren (though she later accepted a damehood). French and Saunders  The comedy pairing turned down OBEs for services to comedy drama in 2001. It was only later they explained. Saunders said: “If I felt I deserved a Damehood I’d accept it,” she told Source magazine. “At the time, we felt that we were being paid very well to have a lot of fun. It didn’t seem right somehow. “We didn’t deserve a pat on the back. It felt a bit fake to stand alongside people who devoted their lives to truly worthy causes.” David Bowie  Bowie himself later explained his decision not to join the list of musical knights including Sir Mick Jagger, Sir Paul McCartney and Sir Elton John. He said: “I would never have any intention of accepting anything like that. I seriously don’t know what it’s for. It’s not what I spent my life working for.” When asked about Jagger accepting the honour, he said: “It’s not my place to make a judgment on Jagger, it’s his decision. But it’s just not for me.” Nigella Lawson  The celeb chef turned down the offer of an OBE in 2001, though it\u0027s not known why. Benjamin Zephaniah Poet Benjamin Zephaniah explained his public refusal in 2003. He wrote: “OBE, me? Up yours, I thought. I get angry when I hear that word ‘empire’: it reminds me of slavery, thousands of years of brutality.” “I am not one of those who are obsessed with their roots, and I’m certainly not suffering from a crisis of identity my obsession is about the future and the political rights of all people. “Benjamin Zephaniah OBE - no way Mr Blair, no way Mrs Queen. I am profoundly anti-empire.” Stephen Hawking  In 2008 Hawking said he had been approached with an offer of a knighthood in the late 1990s, but had turned it down. It was later said it was down to the government\u0027s dealing with science funding and cuts. Paul Weller The musician rejected his CBE in 2006. In a statement his spokesperson said: “Paul was surprised and flattered, but it wasn’t really for him.” Lynn Faulds Wood In 2016, former BBC watchdog presenter Lynn Faulds Wood turned down an MBE and suggested that the honours system needs updating to reflect the modern world. She said: “I would love an honour if it didn’t have the word ‘empire’ at the end of it. We don’t have an empire.” John Cleese  The Monty Python star was offered a CBE in 1996 but said they were silly. He was offered a peerage by Lib Dem leader Paddy Ashdown in 1999 - he declined because he felt staying in England during the winter months to fulfil his role as a working peer was too much of a price to pay. George Harrison The former Beatle turned an OBE down in 2000 - after Paul McCartnery was awarded a knighthood. Every Beatles member was awarded an MBE in 1965, though Lennon returned him. It\u0027s thought he was put forward for his contribution to music, but there was speculation that Harrison would have been insulted that McCartney got his knighthood three years before. “Whoever it was who decided to offer him the OBE and not the knighthood was extraordinarily insensitive,” friend Roy Connolly told the Independent. “George would have felt insulted – and with very good reason.” Ken Loach Ken Loach turned down an OBE in 1977. His films focus on social issues such as poverty and homlessness. He told the Radio Times in 2001. “It’s all the things I think are despicable: patronage, deferring to the monarchy and the name of the British Empire, which is a monument of exploitation and conquest. “I turned down the OBE because it’s not a club you want to join when you look at the villains who’ve got it.” Howard Gayle  Howard Gayle, Liverpool FC’s first black player, also turned down an MBE, saying it would be a \u0027betrayal’ of Africans who suffered as a result of the empire and that his “ancestors would be turning in their graves.” He was nominated for his work with Show Racism the Red Card. Taking to Facebook he said: “This is a decision that I have had to make and there will be others who may feel different and would enjoy the attraction of being a Member of the British Empire and those 3 letters after their name, but I feel that It would be a betrayal to all of the Africans who have lost their lives, or who have suffered as a result of Empire.” Jon Snow  Having declined an OBE in 2000, Channel 4 News presenter Jon Snow went on to make a documentary in 2002 entitled ‘Secrets of the Honours System’. He remains critical of the use of ‘Empire’ in our honours system. “I tried to find out why I’d been given it and was unable to get a clear answer or, indeed, to find out who had proposed me, he said afterwards. Alan Bennett Alan turned down the offer of a CBE in 1988 and rejected a knighthood in 1996. The author and playwright said the reason was he couldn\u0027t carry off being a knight. “I felt that, in my case, it just wouldn’t suit me, that’s all. It would be like wearing a suit every day of your life.” Jim Broadbent Jim Broadbent was offered an OBE but he turned it down as he felt it should go to those who help others. In 2012 he said: “I was offered an OBE a couple of years ago, but I said, ‘no’, and turned it down.” “I’m not that comfortable with actors receiving honours, partly because I think they ought to go to those who really help others, he told the . “Besides, I like the idea of actors not being part of the Establishment. “We’re vagabonds and rogues, and we’re not a part of the authorities and Establishment, really. If you mix the two together, things get blurry.” LS Lowry  Lowry declined five honours – an OBE in 1955, CBE in 61, knighthood in 68 and invitations to be a Companion of Honour in 1972 and 76. Friend and fellow artist Harold Riley said when the list was revealed in 2012 that the painter did not have “anything against the system”. He said: “He indicated he didn’t wish to change his situation by something being latched on to him.” Riley said Lowry was a “very private person” and may have wanted to protect his privacy. Danny Boyle Danny Boyle, director and man behind the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony, turned down an honour because he thought it was was wrong. It\u0027s just not me, he said. He added thousands were involved in executing the ceremony. “You can make these speeches about ‘this is everybody’s work, blah blah blah’, he said. “And you’ve got to mean it, and I did mean it, and it is true, and it’s the only way you can carry on something like that: through the efforts of all the people. “I don’t know whether I’ll ever get invited back to the Palace.” Aldous Huxley Aldous Huxley, author of classic novel Brave New World, snubbed a knighthood in 1959. Evelyn Waugh Evelyn Waugh, who wrote Brideshead Revisited among other famous titles, refused a CBE in the same year. Roald Dahl  Charlie and the Chocolate Factory author Roald Dahl rejected an OBE in the 1986 New Year’s Honours. Trevor Howard The actor Trevor Howard, star of romance Brief Encounter, would not accept a CBE in 1982. In 1979 the Labour Prime Minister Jim Callaghan’s wife Audrey refused to be made a Dame. It was the year Mr Callaghan led Labour to defeat against Margaret Thatcher’s Tories. However, Mrs Callaghan later acquired a title when her husband became a peer in 1987. Hughie Green The Opportunity Knocks star Hughie Green refused an OBE in the 1960 New Year’s Honours, when he was at the height of his fame as presenter of Double Your Money. Michael Frayn Author and playwright Michael Frayn turned down a knighthood in 2003, and a CBE in 1999, for a simple reason. He said: “I haven’t done this for reasons of modesty. I like the name Michael Frayn it’s a nice little name to run around with. I’ve spent 70 years getting used to it and I don’t want to change it now.” Ian McDiarmid Ian, known for playing Palpatine in Star Wars, turned down an OBE, but it\u0027s not know why. Prime Ministers  Former Prime Ministers Sir John Major, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown have all declined life peerages. Sir Winston Churchill reportedly declined being created Duke of London because he wished to remain in the House of Commons. Stars who refused an award - but later accepted them  Psycho and The Birds director Hitchcock turned down a CBE in 1962, but accepted a knighthood just before he died. Sculptor Henry Moore, the son of a coal miner, refused a knighthood in 1951, but became a Companion of Honour in 1955. Conversely actor Robert Morley, who accepted an OBE in 1957, rejected a knighthood in the 1975 Birthday Honours list. And Hugh Cudlipp, who edited The Daily Mirror in the 50s and 60s turned down a knighthood in 1966, although he had accepted an OBE in 1945. Artist Lucian Freud declined a CBE in 1977 but went to Downing Street to paint the Queen’s portrait.  Poet Philip Larkin refused an OBE in 1968. Nobel Prize winner Francis Crick turned down a CBE in 1963, before accepting the Order of Merit in 1991. Lenny Henry accepted a CBE from Tony Blair but refused an honour from John Major.

And millions of fans — a few of them men — will tune in tomorrow to BBC One for the return of the hit period piece. Series four promises more close encounters, with even the new doctor stripping to rival the captain’s charms. But Cornish culture buffs, and fans of the books on which the drama is based, will be focusing on the history.  Many will ask: “Who was the real Ross Poldark?” Author Winston Graham, who died 15 years ago at 95, was inspired by real events and characters as he wrote his 12 romantic novels, starting in 1945. He admitted Poldark’s facial scar and “physical characteristics” were based on a injured flying officer he met on a train during the Second World War — but he claimed there was never one real Ross.  Yet there is a historic Cornish character whose life bears striking similarities to the tricorn hat-wearing hero.  And rather worryingly for Aidan Turner fans, his selfless fate would be a dream storyline for TV scriptwriters looking for a shock finale. His name was Thomas Hawkins, a wealthy 18th-cen\u0026shy\u0026shytury mine-owner who cared for workers’ wel\u0026shy\u0026shyfare, just like Poldark. He married for love before he and wife Anne lost two children in tragic circumstances — while Ross and Demelza saw their baby Julia, die from diphtheria. He was also an MP — and viewers will remember that our hero has promised to go into politics to fight for justice. Thomas’s descendant, Michael Galsworthy, who lives on the family’s 300-year-old estate near Truro, cer\u0026shy\u0026shytainly sees the similarities.  And the author told him his characters were based on Cornish “gentry” akin to his ancestors. Michael said: “I met Winston during a lunch. “We were discussing his novels and he explained that he used people like Thomas and Anne Hawkins when creating his characters.” Thomas was born in 1724, son of a leading barrister and public official. He went to Pembroke College, Cambridge and, at 23, became MP for the Grampound constituency. He inherited the Trewithen estate from his uncle Phillip, also a barrister. Thomas owned lucrative tin mines which employed hundreds of people and took great interest in their welfare. He fell in love with Anne Heywood — a brunette not a redhead like Demelza — whose father agreed they could marry so long as his architect got the job of doing up their mansion. The couple went on to have four sons and one daughter. But tragedy struck when their eldest son John, 13, drowned in the Thames while at Eton.  Thom\u0026shy\u0026shy\u0026shy\u0026shyas and Anne brought his body home preserved in a barrel of brandy. Their anguish must have matched that portrayed by Turner and co-star Eleanor Tomlinson in harrowing scenes as Ross and Demelza’s daughter died from “putrid throat” in series one. Tragedy struck the Hawkins family a second time when another son died of “a fever in consequence of eating an ice-cream after dancing”. And Thomas’ sense of responsibility for the people who worked for him resulted in his own premature death in 1766 at the age of 42.  At that time, smallpox was a killer but treatment was being developed. Thomas volunteered to have an early form of vaccination as an example to his tenants. Tragically, he contracted the disease and died. His second son Christopher, inherited the estate when just eight years old. He went on to become High Sheriff of Cornwall, an MP and in 1791 was made a baronet by William Pitt the Younger.  Fascinatingly, Sir Christopher became a recurring character in the Poldark novels, depicted as corrupt and cynical but generous to his friends. All Graham’s books were inspired by stories he uncovered in 18th-century newspapers, letters, diaries and autobiographies. He said: “In all classes of historical novels, one has to have a degree of historical truth as well as a truth to human nature.” And he added about his Poldark books: “I do not know how near the truth of life in the 18th century these novels are. All I know is that they are as near to the truth as I can make them.”  Ross links to Battle of Waterloo officer Some fans believe another real-life hero may have influenced the character of Poldark. Ross is a British Army officer and American Revolutionary war veteran who returns to his native Cornwall and becomes an MP. Author Winston Graham’s notes reveal that he researched the life of Lieut Gen Sir Richard Hussey Vivian, a Cornishman, Battle of Waterloo veteran and politician.

After France takes decisive action, the debate rages on in UKIs banning phones a smart move or a step back?

(Image: Iconica)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTry speaking to any young person these days and you’ll usually find them engrossed on their smartphone. Fearing children were losing their ability to socialise, French politicians have passed a “detox” law. It means pupils under the age of 15 will not be able to use mobile phones anywhere on school grounds from September. But will it achieve anything? Or could it harm children’s development? Here a parent and an academic debate whether we could learn lessons from across the Channel. Would banning phones from schools in this country be a miracle for attention spans in the classroom or a backwards step?  YES says Mirror writer and mum Eva Simpson Mobile phones have no place in schools and I applaud the ban on French students using them on school grounds. Many UK headteachers have imposed an unofficial ban since they were given the right to confiscate items from pupils in 2007. But I would be happy to see the law changed so they were forbidden in all schools here. Children need to be able to disconnect from the digital world that is such a big part of their lives. From the moment they wake up – for many it is the first thing they see as they use them as alarm clocks – to the time they go to bed, children are connected to social media, games and YouTube and many don’t have the maturity to switch off. Let’s face it, most adults don’t know when to switch off. I reluctantly gave my 12-year-old son my old smartphone. It’s a \u0026shydecision I regret. It is the cause of so many arguments in our house. There are regular rows about why he can’t have an Instagram or \u0026shySnapchat account when “all of his friends have it”. I’m made to feel guilty that he is missing out, but so far, I have stood my ground. I caved into his request to \u0026shydownload the video game Fortnite, the latest online craze – and every spare minute he gets is spent playing the game with his friends, virtually. I’d rather he read a good book. Evenings can be stressful, and I usually end up switching off the broadband.  If he could, he’d play “just one more game” for hours. And why wouldn’t he? These games encourage users to keep playing. These days children hang out with their friends in the digital world rather than in the real world. No wonder childhood obesity is rising. Mobile phones have made our lives easier, but they’ve also caused issues for young people. Scientists at the University of Korea in Seoul found children addicted to their phones were more likely to have mental disorders such as depression and anxiety. A study by the London School of Economics in 2015 found that a ban on mobiles in schools had the effect of giving pupils an extra week’s education over a year. Test scores rose 6%. With so much evidence about the negative impact of phones on children, banning them in schools is the only sensible thing to do.  NO says Peter Twining, Professor of Education at the Open University and former teacher Before we rush to follow the French government’s decision, we need to ask a really simple question: what are schools for? If we think they are about teaching our children to deal with the world and make the best of it, then banning smartphones makes little sense. We’d never dream of not teaching road safety, stranger danger or healthy eating in school. As so many parents know, the internet is where children spend so much time interacting with the outside world – for good and evil.

Now at the age of 101, the legendary Dame Vera Lynn is about to fulfil her next ambition – to get her very first Brit Award. After her last album out-sold the likes of Katy Perry and Lana Del Rey last year, Dame Vera is nominated in two categories for next Wednesday’s Classic Brit Awards, and is already guaranteed a statuette – as she will be presented with the Lifetime Achievement honour. But while she is being recognised for lifting the nation’s morale during the Second World War, Dame Vera fears today’s youngsters do not know or appreciate the depths of horror endured by Allied troops and those at home. “With all that we have today, I think it has become difficult for young people to fully appreciate the hardships we endured during the War,” she says. And in a time when the country is so divided, many may also never understand the genuine feeling of camaraderie that prevailed.  “It was hard, but it was also fulfilling,” Dame Vera says.  “Everyone was there to help their neighbours and anyone else who needed it. We were fighting shoulder to shoulder, here and abroad.” It may have been seven decades and several generations since VE Day, but Dame Vera is still top of her field. Her album, Vera Lynn 100, sold more than 100,000 copies last year. But she will not be going to the Classic Brits ceremony at Royal Albert Hall in London herself.  Instead her daughter Virginia, known as Ginny, will collect the award on her behalf.   She is also up against Sheridan Smith for Female Artist of the Year and Bradley Walsh and Andre Rieu for Classic FM Album of The Year, so could end up with three awards to put on her mantelpiece. “It’s humbling,” she says. “I’m delighted people still enjoy my music all these years later.  “I never really considered what I’d be doing at this stage of my life. However, it was definitely a wonderful surprise to be honoured.” Dame Vera still keeps up with the industry, saying of Katy Perry: “I am aware there are a lot of talented performers out there today. I wish them all every success in their careers.”   And talking about newer acts, she says: “As for any advice, I’d say the most important thing is to stay true to yourself, persevere and remember to enjoy performing.” Her own career resonates way beyond music.  Brought up in East Ham, East London, her dressmaker mum and plumber dad encouraged her to sing in working men’s clubs in London’s East End from the age of seven. She left school at 14 for a short stint of factory work, but her singing proved far more lucrative and soon eclipsed her parents’ earnings. Dame Vera’s first record, Up the Wooden Hill to Bedfordshire, was released when she was 18 and became a radio hit with troops and their families during the dark war times.   Knowing the public looked to her to uplift the nation during its war effort, Dame Vera worked tirelessly visiting troops on the frontline and in military hospitals. Her biggest hits, We’ll Meet Again and White Cliffs of Dover, moved listeners to tears then and still do now. Dame Vera says: “I was aware my music had made an impact, particularly as the words spoke to the nation’s \u0026shysentiments during that time. “I mainly felt honoured to be able to do my bit for the War effort. “I never felt under any pressure from anyone. I only did what I wanted to do. And I wanted to go where no one else went. Where it was most needed.” It is a mark of Dame Vera’s inner steel that she insisted management let her go where no other women, or singers, dared.  She sang for the troops in Egypt, India and Burma when she was 27.   Burma holds very precious memories for Dame Vera, who considers her performances there her greatest achievement. “Entertaining the boys in Burma was something that I will never forget and will remain a highlight of my life,” she says. “I was very proud to have the opportunity to visit the boys who listened to the programmes.  “It was a chance to see them in their own environment and take them a little bit of home. Although I was visiting the frontline, I never felt like I was in any danger as the boys looked after me so well.”  After peace in Europe, Dame Vera travelled to Germany to sing for troops who had liberated the concentration camps.  She said: “They took me around the ovens. I saw the gas chambers. They were like a row of garages with steel doors. No birds were flying.

constantly people coming around the house, other people from the opera would all come around, drink some wine and sing some songs,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220It was mainly classical music that I was interested in when I was very very young.\u0026#8220If there was ever any children\u0026#8217s parts, me and my sister would get dressed up and thrown on stage, I sure to enjoy that.\u0026#8220There was never much singing involved, it was mostly just being children running around on stage.\u0026#8221Tristan said he started playing the cornet when he was four or five, and then moved on to the baritone horn while he was a student at Grange Primary School in Monifieth.\u0026#8220But I always wanted to play the trombone and they didn\u0026#8217t have one in the music

told that a charity studio run by his friend\u0026#8217s dad near the Marketgait was up for sale, and Tristan decided to take the chance.\u0026#8220It was quite a big thing for me, a bit of a massive thing for me actually but at that point in my life it was a risk I was willing to take,\u0026#8221 he said.He launched the studio, a band booked one of his rooms full time and the business began to slowly grow, but it wasn\u0026#8217t until about a year and a half after opening that it began to turn profitable.\u0026#8220I remember six months into it being really really worried about things,

He’ll take some shifting for Jack.“What it will do is push Parish to be as good as he can because he knows Jack will be breathing down his neck.”After a steady first season at the now renamed Kilmac Stadium, Parish will feel he’s the current No 1 at the club but the arrival of another senior goalie can spur both to excel – and that’s good news for the Dark Blues.Hamilton has represented Scotland at every age level from U/15 to U/21 and was called up to a squad by Gordon Strachan in May 2016.He didn’t get a first senior cap but Soutar reckons he can push his way back into the national set-up by impressing for Dundee.He added: “Not so long ago he was in the Scotland squad.“He maybe lost a bit of confidence last season at Hearts and being on the bench.“He’s very professional and will push himself to the max to make sure he’s ready for pre-season at Dundee.“He’s very level-headed, he’s not one for the big-time if you know what I mean, he’s not a flashy kind of guy.“I know the kind of level Jack can play at, I’ve worked with him and I think he could get himself back in the Scotland set-up while at Dundee.“Whatever fee was paid, he’ll definitely justify it.“Further down the line, he could even get Dundee a fee if he moves on so, for that reason, I think it’s a great piece of business.“Working with (goalkeeping coach) Rab Geddes every week, too, can only bring the best out in Jack.“A three-year deal gives him security and playing for a manager who wants him in Neil McCann will help no end.”The former Dundee and Aberdeen goalie, meanwhile, is still going strong with his Derek Soutar Goalkeeping Academy.“It’s still going really well,” he added. “That’s us had 38 goalies over seven years go on to play pro-youth and we’ve had one recently go out to the US for a scholarship.”Any budding young goalies can find out more on the academy’s Facebook page.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b17b6e6b90a2.jpg ","title":"manchester united boss jose mourinho watches dundees former arsenal midfielder glen kamara amid transfer speculation","story":"\t\t\t\t\tJose Mourinho was watching as Dundee’s Glen Kamara picked up his fourth international cap in Finland’s friendly defeat in Romania.The 22-year-old has drawn plenty of interest in his time at the Dark Blues – Mourinho, however, was only there as a guest of Romanian agent Ioan Becali and stressed in an ad-hoc TV interview he wasn’t looking at players, just enjoying his time off.Kamara, meanwhile, despite only joining up with the Finnish national squad on Monday, played the majority of the second half in Ploiesti.The Finns, ranked 62nd in the world and not at this year’s World Cup, started the friendly match well but fell behind in the first half to Cristean Manea’s 37th-minute strike.In the second period, Kamara made his entrance after 57 minutes for Nottingham Forest’s Thomas Lam but almost immediately the team fell further behind.On 61 minutes, winger Ciprian Deac finished from close range to give the Romanians a home victory.Finland boss Markku Kanerva said: “The start was challenging but we looked good. We fought well and did not give up.“Of course, we should not be satisfied with this result but we did not have a full squad.“At the end, we got a little bit to attack more.“I had to think a little about the team when Pyry Soiri and Glen Kamara were only involved on Monday for the first time so they only played the second period.“There was little to be done in the last third.

In other words, we are going to reward success – and reward it quite handsomely.“However, we’re not going to reward failure. We have been very clear to the players still here, and those joining, that we expect success and are happy to pay for that success. We will not continue to pay for mediocrity.”Martin has also put in a place a rule that harks back to the Jim McLean days as he wants every player to be living within 25 miles of the city.He added: “What we are saying to these professionals is we want them to live in the Dundee area.“We don’t just want them to be part of the team but also part of the club and part of the community.“We have put

We\u0026rsquove got the most roads and schools and most of them in the poorest condition.

It will also incorporate the North tower, which has been open to the public as a viewing platform for more than a year and Inverness Museum and Art Gallery.Locals and tourists can also look forward to new galleries which will host national and international exhibitions, displays celebrating the creativity and beauty of the Highlands as well as \"retail and catering\" which showcase the best of what the region has to offer.\u0026nbspA new hotel could also be created as part of the makeover.The project is to be part-funded by \u0026pound1.5 million from the \u0026pound15 million Scottish Government contribution to the Inverness-Highland City-Region Deal.The remainder will involve hefty borrowing by the council although it said it would benefit from the rents of the various businesses in the existing buildings.Speaking at the castle Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing, co-chairman of the steering group overseeing the castle redevelopment, said the investment would support economic growth and create a \"sustainable, viable and must-see attraction to celebrate the spirit of the Highlands\".He added: \"It will create a once in a generation opportunity for future redevelopment for the city and the Highlands to create something of high architectural value \u0026ndash precisely the opposite of the existing buildings.\"Equally thrilled council leader Margaret Davidson said: \"This has been a long-held ambition.\"It will help us achieve our vision for this iconic site and Inverness Castle\u0027 place as part of a range of tourism assets this region has to offer.\"Highland planning director Stuart Black confirmed the purchase price was \"over \u0026pound5 million\", adding: \"We\u0026rsquore still in final discussions with the owner but it will be agreed by the end of June and then we\u0026rsquoll release the purchase price.\"He said the options for the site were to renovate, to redevelop partially \u0026ndash perhaps by removing the upper deck \u0026ndash or what he termed \"comprehensive redevelopment\".Project manager Graham Watson, of High Life Highland, said: \"It\u0027 a one-off opportunity for Inverness to really look at how it see its future for Castlehill.\"The attraction envisaged for the castle will promote the Highlands\u0027 \"creativity, wellbeing, culture, heritage and natural environment\".Saturday 9 Jun 2018 5:42 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04043000/04043681.jpg","title":"Yellow peril told to look the other way","story":"\u0026nbspTRAFFIC wardens have been ordered not to slap fines on motorists in an Inverness\u0026nbspstreet \u0026ndash because the parking signs are invalid and council workers are too busy fixing potholes to find time to take them down.The \"yellow peril\" has been instructed to turn a blind eye on Greig Street until a maintenance team can get round to putting up correct signage.The move has left B\u0026ampB owners scratching their heads wondering how they can convince their guests to ignore the signs and assure them they will not get a ticket.\"Surely the council can do better than that,\" said Acer Glen Guest House owner Stephen Bowsher.\"I can quite believe they\u0026rsquore busy fixing potholes but are they really expecting me to turn around to a guest and say \u0026lsquoI know what the signs say but that\u0027 OK, you can just ignore it?

I think that says it all.“He was such a competitor. That’s what always struck you about him.“The ceremony is a brilliant way to commemorate his life.

That’s exactly what he was like. He was a wonderful person.”Tributes, which included football shirts, scarves and banners, as well as numerous flowers, were lined up in the ground as well as flower displays carrying the messages“Stand Free” and “RIP” Tattie.Amid the sadness were plenty of smiles as fans heard tales from the former Dons star’s life, with many speakers greeted with cheers and prolonged applause.The event also included videos of Neale, and included his recent appearance at the Gothenburg Greats night on May 11, as well as excerpts from interviews and press calls over the years.Images spanned his entire career, including his famous goal against Rangers in the 1982 Scottish Cup final, and his time as manager for Ross County.A book of condolence was set up in the lower concourse of the Richard Donald Stand for anyone who wanted to leave their thoughts and well-wishes following the ceremony.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"new 30mph sign proposed to remove speed limit confusion","story":"\t\t\t\t\tOne of two speed signs is to be replaced after concerns they might cause “confusion” for drivers.Two speed signs found back-to-back on Charleston Road North in Cove have been giving drivers mixed signals about how fast they should be travelling.At the north end of the road, the sign displays the speed limit is 20mph “When lights flash” as opposed to the sign behind it which tells drivers “Twenty’s Plenty” – an advisory to drive at 20mph in built-up areas.However, the speed limit on the stretch of road is 30mph and the city council is now looking to make this clear.Both signs are located outside Charleston Primary School and near two playing fields.Councillor Stephen Flynn, who represents the Cove/Kincorth/Nigg ward, said:“I can certainly understand why residents may find the signage confusing and I have asked council officers to clarify the situation.“Due to the current layout of the road, I am often contacted by constituents who are concerned by speeding cars, so the last thing we need is signs causing any confusion.”The local authority has looked into the problem and has proposed replacing the advisory speed limit sign with a 30mph sign in order to remove any confusion.An Aberdeen City Council spokeswoman said: “The speed limit in the area is 30mph, apart from when the ‘When lights flash’ sign is flashing during school start and finish times.

I don’t do it for the praise.“I haven’t actually told anyone I had been given the honour as the letter told me not to.

It took a few minutes for it to sink in.“I am a bit shocked to be given the honour, but I am delighted at the same time.”Among those awarded the Queen’s Fire Service Medal was David Rout, an area manager for the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service.He retired earlier this year after 33 years service.On retirement, David, who joined Grampian Fire Brigade in 1988, was an area manager in the post of local senior officer for the Aberdeenshire and Moray area, a role he held from its inception on the creation of the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) in April 2013.He said: “As a young boy I used to visit the local fire station and enjoy a cup of tea with the firefighters and I never imagined I would be receiving such recognition for a vocation I have been absolutely committed to over the years. I have thoroughly enjoyed it and it has provided me with some fantastic opportunities in life.“It goes without saying I couldn’t have achieved so much without the great support of family, friends and colleagues.”Also being recognised with an MBE was Mairi Chrystal, head of nurse and therapist services at Chest Heart \u0026amp Stroke Scotland.Mairi started with the charity as a stroke nurse in Grampian in 1996 and in her current role she has unified the level of service across Scotland, and inspired her team of Stroke Nurses across the country.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"crews called to blaze near aberdeenshire farm","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFirefighters were called to tackle a blaze beside a north-east farm.Crews were called to the incident on the B999 Pitmedden to Aberdeen road, just before the junction to Cultercullen shortly after 11am.The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said an agricultural cart and tanker were ablaze in a field.Thick black smoke could be seen in the area as firefighters worked to douse the flames.She added: \u0026#8220We had one crew on scene and the stop message came back at 11.47am.\u0026#8221\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dons great harper urges folk to think of star of the north neale","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDons legend Joe Harper gave an emotional eulogy to his best friend, who had known since a child.Calling him “the star of the north” he described the many laughs he shared with Neale – as well as his heartache in the wake of his untimely death.Joe said: “Last week I went up to see Neale’s mother Anne, and it was me and two of her pals in the house, and I had the best hug I’ve had in my life for five minutes.“Both of us just cried and cried.

At times when the builders are working the gulls understandably leave the site but then return during the evenings and at weekends. Several birds were again sitting on apparent nests as recently as May 4, however it looks like many others may have moved elsewhere.Measures have since been taken by the builders to encourage the birds to leave the area prior to laying their eggs and to give them a chance of nesting elsewhere soon. Recently I had a meeting with SNH (Scottish Natural Heritage) and the RSPB and both were sympathetic and understanding of the situation.I also plan to meet with the Scottish Canals environmental scientist soon in the hope that perhaps provision can be made, within the scope of the hub project, to allow for a nesting area for the Common Gulls in future years at the site.This could give rise to an exciting opportunity enabling the public and visitors to the new heritage centre to view these gulls raise their chicks, for which is effectively the rarest colony of nesting birds in the Crinan Canal corridor.Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,This week Allt Dearg Wind Farm distributed over £135,000 to the Ardrishaig Community Trust, which holds the village\u0026#8217s share in this locally owned wind farm.Combined with the recent payments to the Tighnabruaich and Tarbert Trusts which hold similar shares in the neighbouring Sròndoire Wind Farm, together with the wind farms\u0026#8217 contributions to the local educational trust, this brings the total direct community benefit payments from these projects to well over £ 1 million.This is a significant milestone for the projects, and highlights the socio-economic advantages of local ownership in wind power. Despite its relatively small capacity Allt Dearg is the single largest contributor of community benefit payments in Argyll.This week the UK Government published the results of its latest tracking survey of public attitudes to energy and climate change. This shows continued growth in support for on-shore wind, and eight in ten agreed that renewable energy developments should provide direct benefits to the communities in which they are located.Some objections to wind farms remain, and our turbines remain visible in the distance. We hope that the views of Allt Dearg and Sròndoire might remind such objectors that we are economically dependent on what we can produce from the limited options available to us in remote rural areas. That our particular wind farms are able to make a significant contribution to local employment and deliver funding direct to our neighbouring communities, whilst supplying around 20 per cent of Argyll and Bute’s annual domestic electricity requirements from a clean renewable resource, is very satisfying.We would like to thank all those who have made these projects the successes they are, and in particular thank those local community councillors and trust members who have given so much of their time in recent years to make this all happen. For our part, we will continue our efforts to grow the industry and economic activity that provides secure employment and opportunity for our local community.We look forward to our community partners being able to invest the fruits of these wind farms into exciting local projects.Mary Broadfoot of Stronachullin and James F Lithgow of OrmsarySir,Loneliness is a major issue in society and affects everyone from all walks of life, regardless of age or ability.That’s why we’re pleased the Scottish Government is looking at the development of a new approach to tackling the issues of loneliness and social isolation – something we have first-hand experience of and how it affects many of the people we support in Scotland.Following a recent survey of over 150 service users of our homecare services in Stirling, Falkirk, Perth and Kinross, and Angus which focused solely on loneliness and social isolation, it was revealed that loneliest people receive far fewer visitors each week. While this is hardly surprising, we did find that those who either lived with family or had family close by were less at risk of loneliness and the negative health impacts associated. Our research also highlighted that respondents, in most cases, simply wanted a chat over a cuppa with someone their own age.Social interactions are something the vast majority of us take for granted as we all lead such busy lives, but for someone who is alone, watching time go by very slowly, it’s incredibly painful for them to sit at home day after day with no communication from the outside world.Charities such as Sue Ryder regularly arrange social events for our service users and their families.But if, as a nation, we’re serious about tackling loneliness as a public health issue then we need to be resourcing our local authorities to put in place services or to commission them from the third sector to ensure that no one feels alone and isolated in Scotland.Pamela Mackenzie, director of neurological services and Scotland, Sue Ryder, StirlingSir,This spring we hope your readers will celebrate the royal wedding with their very own Right Royal Tea Party in aid of Meningitis Now.Putting on a spread fit for a royal wedding is a piece of cake with our free fundraising pack and, as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have requested charity donations rather than wedding presents, you can fulfil their wishes whilst helping families affected by this devastating disease.A royal-themed Time4Tea can be held anytime, not just on Saturday May 19, the date of the Royal Wedding. And it can take place anywhere – at home, at work, at school.Just pop the kettle on, slice up a cake or two, homemade or bought (you have to have cake at a wedding) and invite friends, relatives and colleagues to enjoy a cuppa or perhaps even a glass of champagne.The serious point is that you’ll be helping to fight meningitis and move us one step closer to our vision of a future where no one in the UK dies from meningitis \u0026#8211 and everyone affected gets the support they need to rebuild their life.Sadly, despite developments in vaccines, meningitis and septicaemia continue to affect thousands every year and kill more under-fives than any other infectious disease.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest.

If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer. This can be anything from yoga, walking in the sunshine (I walk everywhere) or taking your favourite class at the gym.While you’re getting fitter and feeling healthier, you’ll be raising money to fund the highest quality research and essential information and support services that will save lives from bowel cancer.Take on the challenge and sign up at bowelcanceruk.org.uk/stepupfor30.Gaby Roslin, TV and radio presenterPICS:The common gull has been seen nesting at the disused oil depot. no_a21Gleanergull01Gulls at the former Gleaner site. no_a21Gleanergull02\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead kids get kitted out","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/05/18, 5:11 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowLochgilphead Soccer Centre is delighted to have taken delivery of a quality rain jacket for each of the kids associated with the centre and Red Star YFC.That’s 120 rain jackets in total.As well as making sure the kids look smart and feel part of the club they will also help keep them dry and warm when the weather is a bit wet and windy.The rain jackets have been sponsored by Mid Argyll Youth Development Services (MAYDS) and the Soccer Centre would like to say a huge thank you to MAYDS for this sponsorship and ongoing support.Five teams from Lochgilphead travelled to the Oban Football Festival on a Saturday April 28.

After a pit stop in the Royal Burgh it was on to Fort William, then Inverness and back home again- all to raise money for Cancer Research UK and Target Ovarian Cancer.Spokesperson for Breast Way Round, Laura White, said: ‘This year was full of fun, laughter, meeting new family members and although the daily miles are hard going, the weather and the beauty of the Scottish scenery made it that little bit easier.’As well as the sponsored trek, the bikers raised money in more traditional ways, such as bucket shaking (the men wearing bras) and hosting a raffle and auction in Caol Community Centre. The most coveted item, a patchwork quilt made by rider Cathy Anderson, went for a whopping £700.The annual trip was started in 2008 by Shirley-Ann McKnight as a last tour of Scotland for fellow biker and close friend, Alyson Porter, who was suffering from cancer. Sadly, Alyson never made it to her trip and now each year the journey is retraced in celebration of her life and all those affected by cancer.Since 2008, more than 600 riders have participated, each clad with a pink mohawk courtesy of Hairy-RS, and the team has raised £347,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.

The ‘Highway Services’ would be located at Bogend Toll near Symington and could create 30 jobs. A Shell petrol station and Londis shop are part of the vision for the site. A raft of documents have been lodged with South Ayrshire Council as part of a planning application. London-based Grove Garages is behind the proposal, which would see two buildings erected.   The company has an agreement with Shell and Londis but is still in talks to sign-up a coffee firm.  The plan includes eight fuel pumps, 11 parking spaces, two car wash bays and pumps for HGVs.  The coffee shop would have a floor space of 260sqm with 29 car spaces and a drive through at the back. A supporting statement said: “The location of the site represents an ideal opportunity for a roadside servies area to cater for the frequent tourist, haulage and commuter traffic using the A77. It said the development would ensure the “reuse of a visually and environmentally poor site in a prominent location alongside one of Scotland’s main tourist routes, the A77.”  The site used to be a field belonging to Dyke Farm. Access to the site would be from the B730 adjoining the A77 north bound carriageway. Cars could enter from the southbound carriageway through the existing flyover. Chargers would also be available for electric cars. A design and access statement said: “The proposals give back purpose to an unused site, which has potential to provide an important service to the local area and indeed the wider area. The design proposals are considered to be respectful to the local environment and are in line with local policy and guidelines. No decision has been made on the application yet.

Following a long battle with neuroblastoma, the 17-year-old died peacefully surrounded by dad Chris, mum Connie, and sister Olivia. It was a fight that captured not just the hearts and minds of Ayrshire, but the world beyond. Vanessa, who displayed courage which belied her condition, would rarely be seen without a smile on her face. For almost a decade, her name became synonymous with the fight against the aggressive cancer. Almost \u0026pound1million was raised with the aim of sending Vanessa abroad for life-saving treatment. That dream was realised and in January 2013, the family received the news they longed for – that the cancer was in remission.  Vanessa would return to school and rejoin classmates as a hugely popular figure at Marr College. Life, as normal as it could ever be, was good again for this inspirational girl. But the cancer would return and spread to Vanessa’s brain, with her family receiving the crushing news that her condition was terminal. As ever, Vanessa fought bravely until the last before she passed away just days short of her 18th birthday. Now her family are vowing that her fight will live on in her legacy. Dad Chris told the Post: “We are devastated at our loss.  “Vanessa was a huge inspiration to Connie, Olivia and I and so many more. “She achieved lots during her short but fulfilled life, she did everything she wanted to do and lived life to the full. “She never complained about anything, even though her situation was dire and she knew it. “We are privileged to have had such an inspirational and beautiful daughter.”  Vanessa’s funeral will take place on Friday, June 22 at 11.30am at Dreghorn Crematorium and then on to Troon Town Hall for a Celebration of Life. Chris added: “We’d like to ask that people wear bright colours and for the gents not to wear black ties. “That is what Vanessa would have wanted.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12539593.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/14478946.jpg","title":"lawrence shankland agrees new deal","story":"NewsLawrence Shankland agrees new deal to stay at Ayr United for Championship pushThe 29-goal striker has put pen to paper on a new deal at Somerset Park.\u0026nbspShareByStuart WilsonLochlin Highet13:14, 15 MAY 2018Updated13:18, 15 MAY 2018NewsShankland is staying on at Somerset (Image: Daily Record)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLawrence Shankland insists money can’t buy happiness after he sensationally spurned a host of lucrative offers to pen a new deal at Ayr United.

Shankland, 22, told the Ayrshire Post: “It’s a great club to be a part of. The main thing for this decision is that I am enjoying my football. The gaffer has been great with me and that’s why I came here. He gave me a chance to get back into football. I am happy and I don’t think there’s any amount of money that beats happiness. The fans have taken to me and that gives you confidence going into every game you play. Shankland smashed 29 goals en route to being named League One\u0027s player of the year as Ayr won the title.  Boss Ian McCall said: Lawrence could have doubled his money elsewhere and had offers from the Premiership up here and League One down in England. But the affection he has had from our supporters has played a huge part in his decision. It’s a huge piece of business for this club. Be in no doubt that Lawrence could easily have gone, but he has made a footballing decision.

Dominic was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome, which is on the autism spectrum, at a young age and is part of the Great Britain Learning Disability tennis team. After three years in the sport, he is number one in the world for his doubles category and number three in the world for singles. He competes in the mainstream tennis ranks and is in the top 10 for the South/West Scotland overall.

Since then we haven’t looked back and he has became a fantastic kid.  “You would never know he had this syndrome and that’s credit to the hard work done.” Dominic decided to give something back to the charities that have helped him over the years. He climbed Goat Fell with a group of friends and raised \u0026pound810 for Bibic and South Ayrshire Autistic Society. Anthony said: “We are very proud of him. “A lot of people now do fundraising for national charities but the local ones don’t get as much exposure or sponsors.

But they’ve been caught out by golfers incensed South Ayrshire Council has not passed on any benefit of a government zero VAT ruling on leisure. In February HMRC announced there was to be no VAT on council provided leisure activities. And that will include swimming, gym use and bowling at Northfield. But South Ayrshire Council has not let any of its customers know. If effectively means golf charges have soared 24% on last year, rather than the 2.7% the council have boasted about. It means that golfers paying the \u0026pound429 season ticket price would be expecting a \u0026pound71.50 reduction for VAT.  Tory councillor Peter Convery is blasting the move as “sleekit.” And he said: “Surely people are entitled to get some money paid back to them? “This is about principle and this is sleekit. “This is peoples’ money and should never have been included in the original ticket charge. “It is very unfortunate the council cannot see this to any great extent.” In East Ayrshire, where leisure is provided by an arm’s length trust, VAT is necessary on charges. Details of the VAT grab emerged in an email between a golfer and Councillor Brian McGinley.  The golfer, who preferred to remain anonymous, said: “I do not think the majority of season ticket holders will be enamoured to discover that a significant element of their season ticket fee is actually related to a cost that SAC no longer have to bear.” Ayr East councillor McGinley said in the email: “I have ascertained that VAT has been included within the price of a season ticket up until February 18 this year. “Following a court ruling against HMRC whereby sports services provided by local authorities are now classed as exempt for VAT purposes, VAT is no longer remitted to HMRC when income is received for season tickets etc.” A council spokesman would not explain why they had not revealed the VAT windfall, if players can expect a refund or whether is was just being used to mask a huge leap in prices.  He would only say: “We work hard to ensure our golf and leisure provision continues to offer great value for local people and visitors and this is reflected in our current charging structure. “The funding from entry fees and season tickets only makes a partial contribution to our overall operating costs – with the remainder coming directly from Council subsidy – and the 2.7% price increase on last year’s fees reflects the Consumer Price Index. “Reducing inequalities within our communities is a key commitment for the Council and we have extended the concessions available under the Access to Leisure card scheme – which includes a 15% discount for all South Ayrshire residents. The change in VAT application for Council leisure services contributes towards the costs of that important scheme, which will help improve health and wellbeing across South Ayrshire, as well as helping reduce the net deficit cost of running Council leisure services, which was almost \u0026pound11 million in 2016/17.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"troon church help build new","story":"NewsTroon church to help build new school for hurricane victimsThe Troon church has raised £170,000 to help transform people’s lives in Haiti.\u0026nbspShareBySarah Hilley14:28, 7 JUN 2018NewsPastor Richard Woods with Minister Rolex visiting Muirhead Primary (Image: Copyright unknown)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Building a school for hurricane victims was once a dream for Seagate Church.

Hundreds set off on the annual pilgrimage from Ayr Racecourse, which this year celebrated its tenth gig on the spin. Graham Strawhorn, the hospice’s fundraising officer, said: “We were once again very lucky with the weather and initial feedback from our walkers has been fabulous. “It will take time to receive sponsor money from all our walkers, however, I anticipate we will have raised in excess of \u0026pound50,000, which is an amazing amount for the Hospice. “It’s always a fantastic moment when all our walkers, supporters and sponsors finally congregate pre-walk in the Ayrshire Suite at the racecourse for this unique event, supporting the hospice in their own special way.  “Whether it is in support of a relative, friend or colleague who suffers from life limiting illness or in celebration/in memory of a loved one, events like the Starlight Walk always show us how amazing our community support is. “When we look around the Ayrshire Suite each year, we are reminded of how many people are touched by our cause and we are, as always, deeply grateful for their support and their fantastic fundraising efforts.” Graham added: “As always, funds raised from events like the Starlight Walk will be used to help improve the quality of each day for our patients, helping them to live as actively as they can to the end of their lives – however long that may be and wherever that may be.” The hospice requires to raise \u0026pound4.3 million each year to continue funding its critical service.

This must have been a favoured site well-placed beside a coaching inn on the main road North.\nThe 1860s saw the further development of the railways begun five years previously.\nBefore this Peebles lived up to its reputation of being, \u0026ldquoAs quiet as the grave or as Peebles. With the railways came industry and people and money.\nCommercial Peebles began to develop and the Northgate was no exception. Up until then the Northgate was little more than the road out of town with several pastoral tofts strung out along it. Laird Girdwood, was a larger-than-life character and also one of the prominent proprietors. He was also a member of the Peeblesshire Rifle Volunteers.\nThen as now, such organisations accommodate a little social networking.\nIt is not surprising then that Charles Ker, also a Volunteer and his sister acquired one of these tofts from a comrade. Meanwhile James Ker lived with his wife at Red Lion House in Biggiesknowe. Their toft was more than half an acre in size with a barn whose gable end faced the street and a single-storey cottage attached. Parts of the barn were rebuilt\ninto a new dwelling house.\nThe barn itself is not without interest being the one scene of Laird Girdwood\u0026rsquos Venison Feast to which all the residents of the Northgate were invited everyone, however, to bring his own beverage.\nIt was a resounding success\u0026mdash\u0026ldquoNever before did the rafters ring with such glee. was the reported account of the event.\nA traditional forge and a modern purpose-built engineering workshop were built as well as a \u0026lsquospec\u0026rsquo tenement of four dwellings.\nWrought iron work was much in evidence, with a large garden behind and a rustic rockery at the front of the property. It was then given the name \u0026lsquoKer Place\u0026rsquo after the fashion of the time for such businessmen of which there are several examples in Peebles.\nThe cottage (pre 1823), which is still in place, became part of the enterprise and judging by the size of the lathe bed and fire-scorched rafters some serious work went on there.\nIt also incorporated James Ker\u0026rsquos dispensary for his veterinary work. James had been a student of William Dick at his Edinburgh Veterinary College which he had established at his father\u0026rsquos forge in Clyde Street in Edinburgh where the bus station now stands.\nHe obtained his diploma to practice as a veterinary surgeon and was also made a Fellow of the Edinburgh Medical Veterinary Society for his \u0026ldquovaluable contribution to veterinary science. This may have been in connection with a product he sold commercially as \u0026lsquoKer\u0026rsquos Alterative Sheep Pill\u0026rsquo.\nIt must have been effective since it was still being sold in the 1930s by his son, John Ker. He, also a blacksmith, had qualified as a veterinary surgeon nearly forty years after his father at what was by then called the Royal \u0026ldquoDick Veterinary College.\nJames and his wife died at a young age and his brother and sister, Charles and Elizabeth, carried on the business successfully as well as raising James\u0026rsquos family of two boys.\nJohn Ker, as said, served his apprenticeship as a blacksmith and also qualified as a veterinary surgeon. About 1916 the smiddy closed when the farriers went to war.\nJohn Ker served as a captain with the Royal Army Veterinary Corps and on his return practiced locally as a veterinary surgeon until he died after a short illness towards the end of 1938. The smiddy, itself, \u0026ldquodid its bit during hostilities, by billeting troops.\nIt did not reopen after the war and operate at its former level of business as blacksmiths and engineers. It did, however, remain in general use and is currently a joiner\u0026rsquos workshop.\nJohn Ker was also the last \u0026ldquoBoxmaster (minute secretary) of the Peebles Incorporation of Hammermen\u0026mdashthe blacksmiths\u0026rsquo once exclusive and powerful guild.\nIt fell to him to record in the minutes, rather regretfully, \u0026ldquoThere was no meeting and no dinner held in 1927\u0026mdashfitting, his forebear had been one of the founding signatories we believe. Times had changed, the calling had lost its prosperous and confident ambience, and that was a fact.\nThese events resonate with the story of Black Beauty\u0026rsquos life over a hundred years ago in Victorian England.\nSome of his memories were happy and some were very sad, none less so than those when he meets his old friend Ginger . . .\n"},{"url":null,"title":"40 week one-way system introduced in Jedburgh","story":"A TEMPORARY one-way system has been in introduced in Jedburgh to allow work to be carried out to a privately-owned dangerous building.\nThe new arrangement, which began on Monday (June 4), has seen a section of the High Street become one-way southbound from Jewellers Wynd to Canongate southbound, and a section of Exchange Street one-way northbound from High Street to Friarsgate.\nThis one-way system is required to extend scaffolding onto the road to allow for repairs to be carried out to the building, which has significant structural issues and needs extensive work to make it safe.\nThe disruption is expected to last 40 weeks, and a temporary walkway has also been introduced around the scaffolding to allow pedestrians to still use High Street and Exchange Street.\nSignage is in place to make people aware of the temporary arrangement.\nA joint statement by Jedburgh and District councillors Jim Brown, Scott Hamilton, Sandy Scott said: \u0026ldquoThe High Street dangerous building is a complex and long running issue, but the council is making progress and needs to introduce this temporary one-way system to carry out further repairs.\n\u0026ldquoThe council is looking at various options for the future of the building, and a report is expected to be discussed later this year.\n\u0026ldquoWe thank townsfolk for their patience so far, and would ask they comply with the temporary one-way system.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Borders parking issues working group calls for evidence from public","story":"A CALL for evidence on parking issues in Borders town centres has been issued by Scottish Borders Council\u0026rsquos Parking Issues Working Group.\nThe working group is currently gathering evidence and researching what happens in other local authority areas and will report back to the Executive Committee later this year with recommendations.\nAn online survey has now been launched to give local people and businesses the opportunity to provide evidence of any issues faced in their communities.\nCouncillor Gordon Edgar, Executive Member for Roads and Infrastructure and chair of the working group, said: \u0026ldquoAs part of our evidence gathering we want to hear from people on specific places, days and times when parking is a problem.

It had no underlying message.  It had no sociological content.  It was not of the variety that allowed people to feel wise, nod wisely, and say something wise, like: \u0026#8216Very wise…\u0026#8217The mistakes of the past – of my past – included trying to make people lose control and laugh aloud, rather than just being able to smirk knowingly at my cleverness, if I ever was.We live in a much more buttoned-up, uptight and insecure society than we used to (do you feel my sociological message approaching?) and it has affected the sort of things we feel we are permitted to laugh at, or not permitted to laugh at.Scorn and ridicule can no longer be directed at certain people with impunity – the dishonourable exception being bankers and politicians, of course, who are still fair game, and rightly so, even if out on bail and technically innocent because they haven’t been charged yet.But when did you last hear a blitz of jokes from a television comedian about a small, ethnic, obese, female bishop, even if she was his mother-in-law?Don’t worry, the news isn’t all bad, and I can report that sometimes outbreaks of laughter can occur in the most unusual places – Dundee, for example – and at the most unexpected times.Not long ago I saw a funeral procession led by a slow-marching, black-suited chaplain who was laughing his head off as he walked along in front of the hearse.As I watched in amazement, his happy demeanour began to affect his slow progress, which became a sprightly strut, and it seemed at any moment he might twirl his top hat in his hands, or even produce a rabbit from it.Only when I caught sight of the wireless device attached to his ear did I guess he was probably listening to dance music on a radio earbud. Death is no respecter of parsons.Let’s hope the worst extremes of political correctness will gradually fade away, as common sense brings a return to humorous nonsense, and seriousness wilts in the face of jocularity.A life without laughter?You must be joking.David Aitken,Dundee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"flags fly as putting green opens","story":"There are 18 holes on the seaside green next to the children\u0026#8217s play park and staff also have three play tents, mats for younger children and a small selection of safe toys.South Kintyre Development Trust (SKDT) which manages the attraction has putters to suit all heights and a scorecard is provided.At the end of May SKDT was awarded £75,000 from the Big Lottery Fund (BLF).A BLF press release stated: \u0026#8216This funding will enable the organisation to not only continue but develop their activities at Campbeltown village hall.\u0026#8217At the opening were South Kintyre Development Trust\u0026#8217s Shaun Brown,  putting green staff Tina Chestnut and Peter Lusher with Morag McMillan. 25_c23puttinggreen01Baby Julia Skibinska, 11 months, was happy to play by the putting green. 25_c23puttinggreen02Cate McMillan, 11 months, chewed on some plastic ice cream. 25_c23puttinggreen03\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter mok run thankyou","story":"The continued outstanding success of Mok Run race weekend is a reflection of the ever-increasing dedication and commitment its hard working committee, community volunteers, local businesses, enthusiastic runners and crowd supporter’s display year after year.On behalf of myself and the Mok Run committee I would like to say a massive thank you to those who contributed their free time and energy to make this happen for the 13th consecutive year.Each year we are given tremendous support from many individuals and organisations listed here and this is very much appreciated.Sincere thanks to: Campbeltown Co-op, Wee Toon Sports , McFadyens, Mach Dunes, Tunnocks, AM Transport, Argyll Bakeries, Seafield Hotel, Campbeltown Pottery, Kintyre Agricultural Society,  Jim Martin Supplies, Killegruer Caravan Site, Machrihanish Holiday Park, Glen Scotia, Spring Bank, Beinn An Tuirc, Live Argyll,  Stewart Balfour and Sutherland, Campbeltown Running Club, Jogscotland and Wee Toon Warriors.By supporting this event, you have made a concrete contribution to the greater community.I would also like to extend my grateful thanks to: all the MOK Run committee members who work tirelessly behind the scenes our race marshals \u0026#8211 without whom this event would not happen race sweepers  race day commentator Councillor John Armour Gavin Reid Johnny Durnan David McMillan Willie Ralston Barrs Clochkeil Councillor Donald Kelly Argyll and Bute Council amenities team Campbeltown Police Office Southend Scouts Campbeltown\u0026#8217s: Young Fire Fighters Coastguard Sea Cadets Police Scotland Youth Volunteers massage therapists Brass Band Kintyre Schools Pipe Band West Coast EMT Jamie G  South Kintyre Sports Council \u0026#8211 for making our legendary post race ceilidh such a success Dalintober primary pupils for their motivational posters to our photographers: John McFadyen Campbeltown Courier\u0026#8217s Mark Davey Kenny Craig and Greg and Norma Grogan for capturing the spirit of the weekend Fiona and Donna Robertson and all the Junior MOK Run volunteers and to many of our other volunteers who took the time to help on race day.Apologies if I have missed anyone.A special thank you once again goes to the residents of Limecraigs, for taking the time to decorate the street, provide well received ‘showers’ along with the local fire brigade ‘shower’ who came out in full force to cheer the runners on in the final leg of the 10K route.As one runner summed it up on our facebook page: \u0026#8216Fantastic day !\u0026#8216Thanking all the organisers, marshals, water-givers, water-hosers, sweety-givers, pipers, drummers, sandwich and pastry makers, and everyone else involved.

Momentum has since picked-up.Last year 30 newcomers were trained to sail dinghies and a new stand-up paddle-boarding (SUP) group was formed local volunteers are now completing their training as SUP instructors.A first ever community regatta is planned for August 4 to open up participation in a range of marine sports.Two community organisations and three local sports clubs \u0026#8211 sailing, kayaking and diving \u0026#8211 have joined the SCIO as corporate members, with the approval of their national governing bodies.Others are likely to follow.\u0026#8216We didn’t start out to break new ground,\u0026#8217 added Mr Fox, \u0026#8216But the feedback we are getting suggests that our approach is both unusual and attractive to funders, because we have combined community- and sports groups in a single, inclusive organisation.\u0026#8216But we still have to make the case, and objective cost/benefit analysis of the options is essential. \u0026#8216The options appraisal will look at potential locations for the proposed new building, taking account of community interest as well as planning and technical issues.Jennifer Nicoll, Argyll and the Islands area manager for HIE, said: \u0026#8216Kintyre Seasports is an ambitious project involving a large scale redevelopment and therefore requires a full options appraisal of possible sites.\u0026#8216I am pleased we are able to support this early stage of the project and look forward to the findings of the appraisal.\u0026#8217Kintyre Seasports Project member and the Kintyre Canoe Club coach, Sid Gallagher, ran an well supported introduction to canoeing session last Saturday.Young canoeists trying out the sport are from left: Riley Suddes, 10, Sean West, 10, Flint-Phoenix Barrett, 10, Bradley Suddes, 12 and coach Sid Gallagher. 25_c23canoeing03Morag McLean and her grand-daughter Hollie McLean, 5, try canoeing. 25_c23canoeing02\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"makeover resurrects st kierans hall","story":"The sale of Campbeltown\u0026#8217s Red Cross hall has spurred the refurbishment of St Kieran\u0026#8217s own premises next door.In common with many town charities, St Kieran\u0026#8217s had held its own church coffee mornings in the Red Cross hall which the national charity is attempting to sell.St Kieran\u0026#8217s hall, which has upstairs and downstairs rooms and a serviceable kitchen, was once the town\u0026#8217s Roman Catholic primary school but since closing had fallen into a state of disrepair.Pensioner Archie Wilson, who helped in the six week refurbishment, said: \u0026#8216I remember the classrooms  from those odd occasions when I went to school.\u0026#8217The church\u0026#8217s priest, Father Tony Wood said: \u0026#8216I am very grateful for all the work that has been done and how it has been completed.\u0026#8216The plaster was falling off the walls and the windows were black.

The minimum owners\u0026#8217 contribution for each unit was £5,000. After a lengthy period he sold all of his flats.\u0026#8216Council officers, due to their breadth of experience of historic building repair, have gone way beyond their nominal roles to help the association and stop the project falling to pieces.\u0026#8217HES approved the council’s CARS bid in January 2015.  During the next three years, the association came up with £101,000 between them.The association was awarded a CARS grant of £383,000, which included £306,000 from HES and a private sector housing grant £141,000 making a total project value of £625,000.A council spokesperson said: \u0026#8216CARS money was ring-fenced for the scheme but had to be committed by March 2018.\u0026#8217Shortly after the cash was guaranteed,  the association appointed  a firm of Glasgow conservation architects, ZM Architecture Ltd., to lead a consultation team to scope, survey and cost the scheme.The repair project has three parts: high level repairs including roofing, leadwork and rainwater goods, extensive stone repairs and the replacement of the rear walkways and failing amenity deck.A council spokesperson added: \u0026#8216Although the building is not covered by statutory listing it is considered of historical importance and occupies a key location in the town centre.\u0026#8217After 12 months of development work the works were put out to tender and five quotes were obtained.Glasgow conservation specialists John Fulton  (Plumbers) Ltd was appointed. The firm is expected to use a number of Kintyre sub-contractors.An incident in July 2015, when a teenager narrowly escaped death, illustrated the urgent need for repairs.The 12-year-old boy fell, about 20 feet into the shop below through the rotten decking skylight, while taking part in the latest craze \u0026#8211 free running \u0026#8211 popularised in films such as Casino Royale.For more on the regeneration of Campbeltown see an Argyll and Bute Council feature on pages 14 and 15.George McMillan looks into the hole in his roof in 2015. 25_c30roof01The timber rooflight structure, on the leaky deck, after the 2015 incident.  25_c30roof03Scaffolding is erected at 22 to 30 Main Street.  NO_c23cars10_scaffold_erectionLast week scaffolding was erected through the deck area.  NO_c23cars11_scaffold_through_deckThe full deck area.

Six-year-old Maisie, who plays the main character, Libby, in the film, in what was her first ever acting role, was accompanied to the glitzy ceremony in Los Angeles by her mother Elizabeth, co-star and writer Rachel Shenton, and the short film\u0026rsquos director Chris Overton.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre.

Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard MSP last week met East Lothian Labour Party campaigners at Holyrood as they delivered a petition signed by more than 1,000 people to Kevin Stewart MSP.  While Councillor Lachlan Bruce, ward member for Preston, Seton, Gosford was joined by South of Scotland MSP Michelle Ballantyne, both Conservative, as they sent letters to Mr Stewart calling for the same action (see image inset).  The campaign comes after the minister called in a planning application by Inch Cape Offshore Ltd (ICOL) to build a substation \u0026ndash which would bring energy ashore from a planned offshore wind farm \u0026ndash on a large section of the site, which was recently purchased by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower.  That sparked cross-party condemnation from county politicians, who fear it could jeopardise local plans to create jobs and boost the economy on the site.  Mr Leonard added his signature to the Hands Off Cockenzie petition before it was submitted.  Iain Gray (Lab), East Lothian MSP said: \u0026ldquoMinisters claim the call-in is because the site is of national importance, but even the leader of the SNP Group on East Lothian Council has condemned the decision as unnecessary.  \u0026ldquoBy signing our petition in such large numbers, local people have sent a clear message they want East Lothian to decide on decisions about the future of the site.  Meanwhile, Mr Bruce said he had asked Mr Stewart to send the decision back to the council. He said: \u0026ldquoI think it is only right that this decision is made locally by the council on behalf of local residents. The people who are affected most are local residents and it is the people they elected, not a Government minister from Aberdeen, who should be making the decision.

Persimmon Homes is hoping to get the go-ahead \u0026ldquoin principle from East Lothian Council for the mixed-use development, which includes a commercial hub with hotel, retail facilities and cafe/restaurant.  Community facilities such as a residential neighbourhood centre, playing fields, changing facilities and public parks are proposed.  Also planned is the construction of a grade-separated junction on the A1, roads and foot/cycle paths, as well as improvement to the Musselburgh rail halt.  Submission of the planning application in principle follows a Proposal of Application Notice and public consultation exercise for the major scheme, which included an exhibition on the draft masterplan at The Brunton last year.  A planning statement from Holder Planning, acting for Persimmon, read: \u0026ldquoThe application site is allocated for the mixed use development proposed in the soon-to-be adopted East Lothian Local Development Plan.  \u0026ldquoThe proposed development will deliver 1,500 homes across the site. These homes will comprise a range of housing types. Twenty-five per cent of the housing provision will be affordable as defined by the council.  \u0026ldquoA primary school is proposed that will accommodate the requirements arising from residential development on the wider site. It is located centrally in the application site within walking distance of new homes via a network of paths that offer safe and convenient links. The detailed design will be in accordance with the requirements of the education authority, East Lothian Council.  \u0026ldquoThe masterplan proposes enhancing a pedestrian link under the A1 that will link the site areas together, allowing new neighbourhoods and services to the west, identified in the wider masterplan, to gain access to Musselburgh Station and services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThe proposal incorporates a significant network of multi-functional open spaces and semi-natural landscape areas, including allotments/community growing space, natural play areas, sports pitches and outdoor gym facilities, and seating. This framework of green space will contribute to the legibility of the neighbourhood\u0026rsquos spatial pattern, establishing distinct areas of new housing linked together via a network of green foot and cycle routes.  A new research and innovation quarter for East Lothian offering more than 20 hectares of new commercial space is proposed.  The planning statement added: \u0026ldquoWith strong links to the adjacent Queen Margaret University, the site offers the potential to build upon the reputation of Edinburgh and the Lothians for its research and innovation.  Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, said: \u0026ldquoThe issue at Craighall is that major development here will be very close to major development in Edinburgh at Newcraighall and in Midlothian at Shawfair, turning the whole area into a cross-boundary urban sprawl and effectively an extension to Edinburgh\u0026rsquos built-up area.  Predicting that the plan for 1,500 houses would be approved, given that was the number in the Local Development Plan, he added: \u0026ldquoAll that we can hope for is that conditions will be put in place to make this amount of housing as acceptable as possible in terms of layout, design, amenities and access to walking and cycling routes and to public transport.  \u0026ldquoOf note is that the secondary-age children here will have to get to Musselburgh Grammar School, which is some distance away and not an easy walk, certainly not from the other side of the A1.  \u0026ldquoThe recently promoted Active Travel Network shows no cycle link to Musselburgh Grammar School. We are worried about the prospect of increased car usage to get kids to and from school thus adding to the gradually worsening traffic problems in the town.  Jim Kirkpatrick, managing director of Persimmon Homes East Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoWe have had extensive engagement with East Lothian Council and the local community prior to the application being lodged and have generally been encouraged by the positive response to our masterplan.  \u0026ldquoThe comments of Musselburgh Conservation Society are noted and we believe the issues raised are addressed in the suite of information provided to the council.  \u0026ldquoThe application is fully compliant with the proposals contained within the emerging East Lothian Local Development Plan and we look forward to working with officers and other stakeholders during the determination process."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7864264.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"SEPA water quality report  how clean is the water at your beach ","story":"              A MUSSELBURGH beach has been branded \u0026lsquopoor\u0026rsquo for its water quality in a report by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA).

Plans put forward by Dears Pharmacy were turned down by Lothian Health Board at a meeting last month.  A three-person Pharmacy Practices Committee (PPC) panel, chaired by East Lothian councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, unanimously refused the application.  The decision notice, published on NHS Lothian\u0026rsquos website, said that there were \u0026ldquono gaps in the existing provision of services within the neighbourhood as the other pharmacies in the area could provide the full range of pharmaceutical services.  For village residents, that means a trip to Gullane or Haddington.  The report adds: \u0026ldquoThe committee also noted that consultations by telephone were offered by one of the pharmacies in the area.  \u0026ldquoIt was also noted that extended hours provision was offered by Asda at The Jewel on the east side of Edinburgh, a distance of only 13 miles.  It also stated that there was a \u0026ldquohigh level of car ownership in the village and that public transport links were \u0026ldquogood, meaning residents could travel to other pharmacies.  However, the decision has been criticised by Dears Pharmacy and East Lothian MSP Iain Gray.  He said: \u0026ldquoI supported the application for a pharmacy, both because there is none in the village and because it could help keep the Post Office.  \u0026ldquoI was very disappointed with the decision to refuse it. I understand that there are laid-down criteria to be followed but in my view they must be wrong because they led to the wrong decision in this case.  \u0026ldquoI remain convinced that the people of Aberlady would benefit from a pharmacy without having to travel to Gullane, and have promised to support the application again if there is an appeal.  \u0026ldquoI will also be writing to the chief pharmacist and NHS Lothian about my concerns that the process is flawed.  Mahyar Nickkho-Amiry, operations director at Dears, confirmed to the Courier they would appeal the decision.  He described the decision as \u0026ldquoactive discrimination against village residents, adding: \u0026ldquoIt is a slap to the people of Aberlady. Because this is an affluent area, people are being forced to drive to Gullane or Haddington, whereas if the village was less affluent they would have stood more of a chance.  He said that had the proposals been approved, the pharmacy would have brought jobs to the village.  Donald Hay, chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, also criticised the decision.  He said: \u0026ldquoCommunity responses were not taken into account and the net result is the village could end up with no banking facilities, no Post Office and no pharmacy.  \u0026ldquoIt makes bleak reading for the village for the future.

Those who sign are also asked to give reasons online and Gary Hitchen wrote: \u0026ldquoI find it impossible to understand how this can have been refused.  \u0026ldquoThe provision of a pharmacy in Aberlady can only be a good thing and if it also ensures the future of the Post Office that is an added bonus.  \u0026ldquoVillages are being destroyed and turned into commuter satellites by local businesses closing \u0026ndash please don\u0026rsquot let Aberlady be next.

Between April 1 last year and the end of March 2018, 2,006 three-day emergency food supplies were given to local people.  Excluding holidays and weekends, it means that, on average, between eight and 10 food parcels are handed out Monday to Friday by the charity.  The number of three-day emergency food supplies distributed rose by 12 per cent from the previous year.  The figure mirrors what is happening across the UK, which has shown a 13 per cent increase in food parcels given out.  In 2017-2018 benefit changes/delays accounted for 757 East Lothian cases with 1,666 people affected, including 617 children. In addition, 595 cases were referred for emergency food due to being refused a crisis grant, affecting 937 people, of which 253 were under the age of 16.  A total of 31,604 kilos of food was given out last year by the county\u0026rsquos foodbank, with 50,292kgs donated.  Peter Dicker, foodbank manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll continue to provide vital support when it matters most \u0026ndash we\u0026rsquore dedicated to ensuring that people in our community with no money for food are able to access emergency support, and that has only been possible in the last year because of the incredible generosity shown by local people in donating food, time and funds.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray condemned the figures, saying: \u0026ldquoThese shocking figures underline the fact that problems with changes to the benefits system have made a significant contribution to the rise in foodbank referrals.  \u0026ldquoGovernments at Holyrood and Westminster can no longer sit back and accept the ever increasing number of people being forced to use foodbanks.

As many as 1,600 homes \u0026ndash as well as business units, a supermarket, primary school and various green spaces \u0026ndash are planned for the former opencast mine site at Blindwells.  The first housebuilder is expected to be announced this summer, with work on housing getting under way potentially by the end of the year.  In the meantime, preparatory work has been carried out on the site, which is sandwiched between the A1 north of Tranent and the A198 south of Cockenzie and Port Seton.  Now Hargreaves, which is behind the proposals, is looking to create an access to the site off the roundabout to the north of the A1 at Bankton Junction.  Iain Slater, development and estates director, said the new exit would be permanent, although it would initially be limited to construction traffic.  Other works are planned for the junction, which links the A1 with the A198.  Mr Slater said: \u0026ldquoAs part of the permission the road layout will be altered to allow for the additional cars generated from the Blindwells development.  \u0026ldquoThese works include widening of the A198 approaching the roundabout to increase capacity [as well as] the installation of a filter lane to allow cars leaving the A1 heading east to go round to Tranent without stopping at the roundabout. There are also plans for traffic lights to assist with traffic flows should the need arise.  As many as 350 jobs could be created during the lengthy building period at the site.  Construction work on the 1,600 homes could take 12-15 years, with early plans already drawn up for a second phase further to the east which could see another 1,600 homes, as well as leisure space and a cemetery."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7870497.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Tranent singer Caitlyn Vanbeck  39 s first single takes charts by storm","story":"              TRANENT singer Caitlyn Vanbeck\u0026rsquos first single flew up the charts when it was released on Monday.

It read: \u0026ldquoThe result will be a modern, bright, accessible and customer-friendly store with a focus on quality.

Plain clothes police officers joined colleagues in uniform and members of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos community warden team at John Muir Park and Lochend Woods.  John Muir Park has regularly been used by teenagers who are celebrating the end of their exams.

Police have patrolled the area after concerns at public meetings regarding underage drinking and the flouting of local bylaws involving drinking in a public place.  On Friday and Saturday, police and community wardens seized the alcohol from youngsters aged 14 to 21, with a variety of lager, cider and spirits, including 12 litres of vodka, taken.  Inspector Andrew Harborow said: \u0026ldquoEvery year around this time we are aware of youths congregating at Bullet Hill. Whilst this started out as an end-of-school celebration involving those mainly in S6, the ages of those taking part has clearly widened.  \u0026ldquoIn order to reduce the risk to those involved, we have taken action over the weekend and seized alcohol to prevent harm being caused and will be making follow-up enquiries with parents, carers and local shops as to where the alcohol came from.

Jess Mackie\u0026rsquos family created the fund in her name after the Gullane youngster, who loved to sing and help others, passed away suddenly on January 2 this year.  The North Berwick High School pupil was a member of the National Youth Choir of Scotland and sang with Aberlady and Gullane Parish Churches, at care homes and for charities, and at school concerts.  Despite her young age, she had a sense of how music could help people in need.  And now the Jess Mackie Memorial Fund will \u0026ldquohelp her to keep helping others, as she had always done, and would have continued to do if she was still with us, said parents Michael and Jackie.  \u0026ldquoWe cannot let our beautiful daughter\u0026rsquos name and character be forgotten, they said. \u0026ldquoShe had so much to offer.  All monies raised will be used to provide support and comfort through music therapy at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh.  Dad Michael, long-standing chairman of Gullane Sports Development Trust, said: \u0026ldquoWhen Jess passed away, we had a memorial service for her and decided to use it to donate to the Edinburgh Children\u0026rsquos Hospital Charity. Quickly thereafter, we learnt about an initiative involving music therapy they were running with Tinderbox Orchestra in the hospital. We met with one of the trustees initially and we decided to put in place something that would allow Jess to help other kids.  The memorial service, which was held at Aberlady Parish Church, raised more than \u0026pound2,000, with money continuing to be donated by members of the public and through organised events.  Michael, 52, said: \u0026ldquoWe were approached by Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches and they asked if they could run an event in Jess\u0026rsquo memory, which they did last Sunday.  \u0026ldquoFrom the family point of view, it was another show of overwhelming support by the village and the community. We have raised a substantial amount of money. Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches posted on Facebook that it had raised about \u0026pound1,800 for the fund and Gullane Athletic [FC] are running an event in August in support of the fund.  Twelve members of staff at North Berwick High School also took part in the recent Edinburgh Marathon Relay.  Split into three teams, they raised more than \u0026pound1,500 for The Royal Hospital for Sick Children Jess Mackie Memorial Fund, Richmond\u0026rsquos Hope and Leuchie House.  Jess, who was in S3 at the secondary school, was, like her twin sister Lauren, a keen singer.  Her dad told the Courier Jess \u0026ldquoloved singing and tried to help people and raise their spirits through her voice.  That love of singing and trying to help people has been mirrored through the success of the memorial fund, which sits at about \u0026pound9,800.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoI think that the fund reflects Jess completely. It reflects the impact she had while only 14 years old.  \u0026ldquoIt reflects the impact she had on people that she met and what she did in terms of her church singing, singing in local care homes, school concerts, helping out at various events like for the Bethany Christian Trust and Leuchie House. I think that reflects what she did while she was here.  The project aims to ensure children and young people who are feeling vulnerable in hospital are given the chance to enjoy music, which can have an enormous and positive impact, helping ignite a spark in them and giving them back a sense of control.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoMusic is a great comforter at times and what Tinderbox do is amazing for the kids.  \u0026ldquoWe had no hesitation in supporting what they do.  Janet Anderson, who is involved with the choirs at the two villages\u0026rsquo churches, also paid tribute to the talented teenager.  She said: \u0026ldquoI could not speak more highly of Jess.  \u0026ldquoShe did not think she had a special talent, she was just the most unassuming, normal girl you would ever meet.  \u0026ldquoShe was so pretty, so kind and so thoughtful and generous and she never thought she was anything special.

Chester, from Dunbar, is one of 13 pets, including cats, dogs and even a rat, taking part in the PDSA Pet Fit Club.  Together they weigh more than 200 kilogrammes and need to shed 75kg to reach their ideal weights.  Ten-year-old Chester, who lives with the Gilmour family on Newhouse Avenue, is looking to shift 2.6kg \u0026ndash or six pounds \u0026ndash to reach his ideal weight.  Chester, who tips the scales at 7.6kg, was gaining so much weight that his owners thought he must have an underlying medical condition. But when tests came back negative, it was clear Chester\u0026rsquos appetite and lazy ways were the root of the problem.  Owner Lisa said: \u0026ldquoWe realised everyone in the house was feeding him without knowing he\u0026rsquod already being fed, so he was getting fed by all four of us every day!  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove tried to help him lose weight, even putting a collar on him that says \u0026lsquoDo not feed me!\u0026rsquo for the neighbours, but that hasn\u0026rsquot worked.  \u0026ldquoHe eats whatever he can find including crisps left on the floor by the kids. He even stole my dad\u0026rsquos cheesecake that was on the kitchen counter! Another time my son woke up to the sound of rattling and he was trying to claw his way into a box of chocolates.  Lisa, along with partner Lindsay and sons Rhys and Ryan, got Chester when he was just a kitten.  Now they are determined to do what they can to help their pet lose some weight and be happier.  Lisa, who works in the family newsagent, added: \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos getting older now and his weight will play on his joints if we don\u0026rsquot do something to help him. He can\u0026rsquot be comfortable carrying all that weight around and we want him to be happier and healthier as he ages.  Chester\u0026rsquos six-month Pet Fit Club diet and exercise programme will be specially tailored and overseen by the vets and nurses at Edinburgh PDSA Pet Hospital.

Education Scotland visited Knox Academy in Haddington at the end of 2016 and told parents that the school needed to \u0026ldquorevisit its \u0026ldquovision and values.  The inspection report, which was released in March last year, highlighted a number of areas in which the school could improve. \u0026lsquoLeadership of change\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquolearning, teaching and assessment\u0026rsquo were ranked as \u0026lsquosatisfactory\u0026rsquo, while \u0026lsquoensuring wellbeing, equality and inclusion\u0026rsquo was described as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo.  Inspectors returned to the school 12 months on from the original report for a follow-up inspection, which led to a new report being published on Tuesday.  The inspection team talked to young people at the school and worked closely with the interim headteacher Lauren Rodger, who is returning to North Berwick High School after the summer holidays.  She will be replaced by Susan Cook, currently acting headteacher at Trinity Academy, Edinburgh  Other members of staff were also spoken to, to hear about the steps the school had taken to improve on areas previously identified in the original inspection.  Education Scotland noted the following key improvements:  - The interim headteacher has provided effective leadership in taking forward work to secure improvements, including a review of the school values  - Staff have developed a range of policies to improve practice in equalities and inclusion, including a new safeguarding policy  - The recently created Pupil Support Faculty is now better placed to address the needs of young people, and those with social, emotional and behavioural needs in particular  - The school has made progress in establishing a more positive learning environment for all.  The report did note that there were still some improvements to be made.  Issues highlighted included using evidence from self-evaluation activities to ensure consistency in learning and teaching across the school reviewing the purpose of the pupil support base to ensure there was a greater focus on learning for the young people using it and ensuring there was a whole school approach to equalities and inclusion.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, praised staff at the school for their efforts.  She said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that Education Scotland acknowledges that Knox Academy has made important progress since the last inspection, and I would like to thank all the staff and pupils for their hard work and commitment in making these improvements.  \u0026ldquoIt is really encouraging that the positive relationships between pupils and teachers, and the fact that almost all young people recognise the value of learning in their lives, was noted.  \u0026ldquoThis is a strong basis for ensuring that the school continues to be a positive learning environment for staff and pupils alike.  And she added: \u0026ldquoWe will continue to work with the school and Education Scotland to make further improvements, and to working with Susan Cook, our new headteacher, who joins the school in August.  Education Scotland will continue to work with East Lothian Council regarding the school\u0026rsquos capacity to improve and will return to carry out another inspection within 18 months."},{"url":null,"title":"Port Seton Lottery winner climbs Ben Nevis for highest champagne spray","story":"              LOTTERY millionaire John Edmond has undertaken a suitably large-scale celebration to mark the creation of the National Lottery\u0026rsquos 5,000th millionaire. . . by climbing Ben Nevis to conduct the UK\u0026rsquos highest Lottery champagne spray!  John, 35, from Port Seton, won \u0026pound1 million in the EuroMillions draw on June 26, 2015, but he remained in his job as a roofer, insisting he wanted to keep working.

The annual list used readings taken from 2013 and named Prestonpans as the worst offender in Scotland.

And this week, the WHO confirmed that this was indeed the case.  In an email to senior environmental health officials at the local authority, representatives of WHO confirmed that they had confused the two communities due to a computer mapping error.

Or rather, bubbles within bubbles. A small pocket of members of a club which is itself a fraction of society at large. But like all bubbles, they\u0026rsquore still liable to go pop.  The SNP conference in Aberdeen this weekend isn\u0026rsquot especially susceptible to this phenomenon. But some in the leadership seem to have forgotten it still applies to them. The cause of the cocky attitude, ironically, is what has been promoted as a healthy injection of realism.  It\u0026rsquos not the fault of the Sustainable Growth Commission chaired by former MSP and current corporate lobbyist Andrew Wilson. Its 354-page report was intended to sketch out a blueprint for independence and stimulate discussion, and it has achieved both.  The problem is that, having taken 20 months to arrive, it has assumed a semi-mythic status. It is unhelpful to be seen as the answer to many prayers. But it comes with no guarantee of salvation, and those who regard it as the game changer the independence movement has been waiting for should take a deep breath. It offers as many problems as solutions.  Nevertheless, Nicola Sturgeon and her ministers have welcomed it enthusiastically. The general impression they give is that the report is a turning point for the cause. Not a new beginning, as much is familiar, but certainly a more appealing modernisation.  It is has infuriated many on the left of the Yes movement, but Ms Sturgeon is coping well with their agony, reasonably assuming they will vote Yes again when it comes to the crunch. The report is there to reassure and cajole the 55 per cent, not thank the 45 per cent. Indeed, one of the first things Keith Brown said when he was elected the new SNP depute leader yesterday was that he wanted to debate the report beyond the party walls, reaching out to business groups and civic Scotland. The SNP\u0026rsquos boardroom charm offensive, run in the old days of devolution by John Swinney and Jim Mather, is evidently undergoing a revival.  But I suspect the SNP leadership is falling prey to its own hype. It has assumed the report will be readily accepted in the party \u0026ndash Ms Sturgeon has predicted a \u0026ldquovery positive reception \u0026ndash and, equally prematurely, assumed it will go down pretty well in the country at large.  Even in the inner bubble of conference, there were some clues that\u0026rsquos not so. One of the busiest fringe events on the first day in Aberdeen was a meeting to discuss the economics of independence. There were some interesting contributions from MSP Joan McAlpine and MP Kirsty Blackman. Ms McAlpine reflected that the party\u0026rsquos past advocacy of corporation tax cuts needed more subtly, while Ms Blackman talked about aping the Do it for Denmark campaign to grow the population, coyly suggesting \"Shag for Scotland\".  But the panel member getting the loudest applause was the one with the toughest criticisms of the Growth Commission. Former MP George Kerevan said the \u0026ldquoconservative plan to keep the pound would leave a newly independent Scotland \u0026ldquoat the mercy of the banks, while tight public spending to cut the deficit risked independence offering nothing for the poor. The audience looked a fairly typical slice of the SNP. There was a lot of grey hair and earnestness. Yet a great many appeared to share Mr Kerevan\u0026rsquos concerns.  But the starkest reminder that turning out a report is not the same as turning a corner came when Ms Sturgeon was interviewed by Channel 4 News. It was not her finest hour. Despite being at the apex of the Yes movement, she was unable to say how much it would cost to set up an independent state. This is no small detail. After trying to dance around the question, she finally admitted she couldn\u0026rsquot remember the figure in the Growth Commission report.  It resurrected all those memories of the 2014 referendum, when the Yes side was peppered with questions about the bill for leaving the UK. The Commission\u0026rsquos number \u0026ndash a bargain \u0026pound450m over five years \u0026ndash also echoed the naive optimism of many of the figures put around four years ago. As the Channel 4 journalist pointed out, it\u0026rsquos costing Scots taxpayers \u0026pound200m to set up a part-devolved social security system. So \u0026pound450m for a new country?  Amid a choking raft of poor statistics in education and health, and with the grassroots Yes movement agitating for a swift referendum, it is understandable that the SNP leadership is trying to shift the focus on to independence through the Growth Commission.  But, as Ms Sturgeon\u0026rsquos interview showed, it is dangerous to use the report as a campaign tool without the discipline of a campaign to back it up. Talking about independence as if her autumn decision on a referendum is already made simply invites questions of the kind that kept the Yes campaign on the back foot in 2014. The SNP is running ahead of itself. The Growth Commission is only one bubble in the national tide required to secure its goal."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/1004268.jpg?type=article-full","title":"Every Harry Potter film to be screened outdoors in Glencoe drive-in marathon","story":"              EVERY Harry Potter film is to be screened outside at one of the key locations of the famous film series.

Perhaps we have become de-sensitised to the slew of research and numbers that assault us several times a year each revealing a segment of deprivation.  One month it will be the numbers of people using foodbanks in another it will be the number of children living in poverty in yet another it will be mortality rates in our most disadvantaged neighbourhoods. Perhaps, too, we have become so impervious to the callousness of assorted Tory responses to these human catastrophes that we simply switch off. Not this time though. There was something chilling about this one.  The report, Destitution in the UK 2018, was produced by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and identified the number of people who were pushed into destitution during 2017 while looking at causes, solutions and context in the UK. Its top line revealed that one and a half million people were destitute last year, including 365,000 children. The UK Government\u0026rsquos response was this: \u0026ldquoThe Government believes that work is the best way out of poverty.  This time it seemed they had simply given up pretending to be concerned that any attempt at displaying humanity in the face of evil was pointless. Previously there would have been a pledge to do more or a vow to meet with agencies in the field and perhaps even a half-hearted nod to some money they had invested in a skills redevelopment scheme in Camden. Now it was just a shrug as if to say: \u0026ldquoSo, what do you expect us to do about it?  It carried echoes of 1834 when the Poor Law was introduced as a response to growing resentment among the ruling classes that the indolent poor were getting too many handouts. Workhouses would instead be introduced and these would soon sort out the wheat from the chaff. So inhumane were the conditions inside these places that it was felt workshy loafers everywhere would be forced to find meaningful employment. This single scrap of legislation spurred Charles Dickens into a frenzy of creativity that produced works such as Oliver Twist and Little Dorrit.  In 21st century Britain we can easily process words and phrases such as unemployment or inequality or the poverty gap but \"destitution\" seems to belong to another era. In the time of Dickens when squalor and infant death and poverty-related disease constantly stalked the existences of society\u0026rsquos most wretched people destitution was a familiar term it was all of the above and seemed to signify a state of utter hopelessness. It is not a word you would commonly expect to find in 21st century Britain, one of the richest and best-educated nations on earth and one that last year spent more than \u0026pound2bn maintaining Trident.  In its report the Joseph Rowntree Foundation describes destitution as being unable to afford the bare essentials that we all need to eat, stay warm and dry, and keep clean. \u0026ldquoPeople experiencing long-term poverty, it points out \u0026ldquowere typically tipped into destitution by harsh debt recovery practices (mainly by public authorities and utilities companies) benefit delays, gaps and sanctions financial and other pressures associated with poor health and disability high costs of housing, fuel and other essentials and, for some migrants, extremely low levels of benefits or no eligibility for benefits at all. It\u0026rsquos reasonable to suggest that Dickens might have expected most of these evils to have disappeared in the course of two centuries, not least because two years earlier the Great Reform Act had set the UK on a long course towards universal suffrage.  The figure of 1.5m destitute is down from 1.7m two years previously but if you think the numbers are heading in the right direction think again: the consequences of Universal Credit have yet to be measured. As we have seen, the Tory response to this was essentially: \u0026ldquoGet a job. This ignores the reality of unpaid carers being forced to give up work to care for sick relatives. It also fails to take account of the numbers of households suffering from the effects of in-work poverty. Last year research conducted by Cardiff University found that a record 60% of people in poverty live in a household where someone is in work. Families in the woefully under-regulated private rental sector were deemed most at risk. The refusal of the great majority of firms to pay the Living Wage is also a contributory factor after two decades where real wages have constantly lagged behind inflation.  Underlying the callousness of the Hard Right towards the poor is the view that benefits are handouts, free money that it pains them to disburse. They are nothing of the sort. Benefits have mainly been bought and paid for by those who receive them when they were in work or by previous generations of their families. They have been earned. In contrast, the UK loses billions each year because the hardest work ever undertaken by rich Tory donors is in finding ways to avoid paying taxes.  The Rowntree report came at the end of a week in which the taxpayer took a \u0026pound2bn hit with the sell-off of part of the Royal Bank of Scotland. When the sell-off is complete we will have lost close to the \u0026pound27bn we were assured we would gain by taking control of RBS. This was Alistair Darling\u0026rsquos great \u0026lsquotriumph\u0026rsquo. His former boss Gordon Brown was also wheeled out this week, channelling his inner Nigel Farage by railing against the migrants as he reprised his desperate British jobs for British workers theme from 2007.  In this exchange in Dickens\u0026rsquo Christmas Carol, published in 1843, Ebenezer Scrooge encounters a group of charity collectors in the company of the Spirit of Christmas Present.  Ebenezer: But have they no refuge, no resource?  Spirit of Christmas Present: [quoting Scrooge] Are there no prisons? Are there no workhouses?  First Collector: At this festive time of year, Mr. Scrooge, it is more than usually desirable that we should make some slight provision for the poor and destitute.  Not long ago we would have dismissed the notion of food banks let alone mass destitution in 21st century Britain. How long before an enterprising Tory proposes a return of the Poor Law, secure in the knowledge that food banks and destitution flourish and no one lifts a finger in protest?"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7899748.jpg?type=article-full","title":"King Kenny becomes a knight as more than 100 Scots get Queen s Birthday honours","story":"              He thought it was a demand from the taxman.  But the letter that arrived for Scotland\u0027s most-capped footballer Kenny Dalglish was in fact an invitation to hear the words: \"Arise Sir Kenny\".  Kenny Dalglish leads the Scots honoured in the Queen\u0026rsquos Birthday Honours list after being knighted for his role in helping the families of the Hillsborough disaster.    The football legend dedicated his knighthood to his family and everyone involved in his career after admitting it \u0026ldquodoesn\u0026rsquot feel right receiving the personal accolade.  The former player, manager and tireless charity campaigner joined more than 100 \"exceptional\" Scots from fields including science, sport, education and business have been recognised in the Queen\u0027s Birthday Honours List.  University of Glasgow graduate Professor James Hough, who helped detect gravitational waves, is among those to be given knighthoods along with Glasgow-born book shop founder Tim Waterstone.    There was an OBE for Scots horse trainer Lucinda Russell, who trained the 2017 Grand National winner One for Arthur and Aberdonian oil industry tycoon Sir Ian Wood, who was given a knighthood in 1994, added to his honours by being made chancellor of the Order of the Thistle by the Queen.  Sir Craig Reedie, president of the World Anti-Doping Agency, receives a Knight Grand Cross for services to sport while Glasgow banker Douglas Flint is knighted for services to the finance industry.    And a lifeboat volunteer involved in 634 rescues has been honoured with an MBE along with long-serving emergency service workers. Bill Deans, 68, started volunteering with Aberdeen\u0027s Inshore Lifeboat team in 1976 when he was working as a police officer.  Sir Kenny who was manager at Anfield at the time of the disaster when 96 Liverpool fans were crushed to death at an FA Cup semi-final on 15 April 1989, said he was \"hugely proud to have accepted the accolade\" for services to football, charity and the City of Liverpool.  The 67-year-old former Celtic star and his wife Marina have also helped raise millions of pounds for cancer treatment through the Marina Dalglish Appeal after she successfully battled breast cancer. and his wife Marina have also helped raise millions of pounds for cancer treatment through the Marina Dalglish Appeal after she successfully battled breast cancer.    Joking that he thought the letter informing him of the knighthood had been from the taxman, he added of the achievement: \"We only set out to do the best we possibly could, even through all the other stuff - the charity or Hillsborough, it was to help people because somebody helped us.\"  He added: \"Obviously it takes everything you have done in your life into consideration.  \"Football was part of it and a very important part of it. So is the charity that we have in Marina\u0027s name and obviously Hillsborough must have been part of it as well.  \"Someone in their wisdom has thought it was deserving of some recognition. I am hugely proud to have accepted the accolade.    \"You start off in your life just hoping to be a footballer. You become a footballer and have a bit of success and that seems to give you a platform to go on to other things.  \"We only set out to do the best we possibly could, even through all the other stuff.  \"The charity or Hillsborough it was to help people because somebody helped us.\"  Relatives of Liverpool fans who died in the Hillsborough disaster called for the former Liverpool manager to be knighted for his \"extraordinary\" response to the tragic events seven years ago.  Former Lord Mayor of Liverpool Steve Rotherham MP told fans at an Anfield memorial service in 2011 that the families had asked him to table an Early Day Motion to make the request.    He helped ensure the club was represented at all of the fans\u0027 funerals and attended many of them in person.  Mr Rotherham, who is now  Mayor for the Liverpool City Region, said at the time: \"People are commemorated for their services to national sport, Sir Bobby Robson for instance, charitable causes, and Kenny and Marina [his wife)] have had a very successful charity \u0026ndash the Marina Dalglish Breast Cancer Appeal \u0026ndash which has opened a new radiotherapy centre in Fazakerley hospital. Then there is the support he has given to the families \u0026ndash and therefore the community \u0026ndash from day one. So he has done all three.  \"It would definitely be of benefit to the Hillsborough families. While it is recognition for Kenny Dalglish himself, the families are quite clear that any individual award to him would reflect on the 96 as well and the work he has done on their behalf.  \"It nearly broke him. He and Marina went to five funerals in one day. Whilst they were counselling people there might, in hindsight, perhaps have been someone to counsel Kenny and Marina and that didn\u0027t happen.\"    In talking about the award Dalglish, made an MBE in 1984 for services to football, used \u0027we\u0027 throughout - specifically referring to himself and his wife but also the wider family.  His team won the highly-emotional all-Merseyside final in the year of Hillsborough - a day Dalglish identifies as the stand-out moment of his career.  \"For me, that is the most important memory,\" he said.      Sir Kenny Dalglish    A man of fantastic dignity who held Liverpool football club together through some dark days    RESPECT  \"Not because of the game itself but because of what it meant to the people of Liverpool.  \"All right, we lost the league to Arsenal but I think the cup was the most important trophy that year for everybody - and that\u0027s not to undervalue anything else.  \"I look back and think \u0027I\u0027m really pleased we won that one\u0027.\"      Thrilled to see that Kenny Dalglish has been knighted. No one in football is more deserving. A truly great footballer and wonderfully empathetic human being. Arise Sir King Kenny.      \"It is extremely humbling to have people who think of you in this way.\"    - Sir Kenny Dalglish pic.twitter/lXLbI4mvaC"},{"url":null,"title":"Sturgeon left floundering after forgetting cost of independence during interview","story":"              NICOLA Sturgeon was left floundering after appearing to forget how much setting up an independent Scotland would cost \u0026ndash just two weeks after her own report placed the figure at \u0026pound450 million.  The First Minister repeatedly failed to answer when quizzed during a television interview on the first day of the SNP\u0027s conference in Aberdeen.\u0026nbsp  After being asked about the issue six times, she eventually conceded: \"I can\u0027t recall the exact figure in the report.\"  It comes as Ms Sturgeon will today contrast the \u0026ldquoshambolic Conservative government with the SNP\u0027s record in Scotland.\u0026nbsp  She will argue the Tories\u0027 hostile migration policy is having a disastrous impact on public services and the economy \u0026ndash and ramp up calls for powers over migration to be devolved to Holyrood.  Addressing delegates, she is expected to say: \u0026ldquoScotland is a welcoming country \u0026ndash our prosperity and our public services depend on it.  \u0026ldquoIf Westminster cannot or will not act in our best interests, it is time that our own parliament was able to do so. It\u0026rsquos time for powers over migration to come to Scotland.\u0026nbsp  The SNP\u0027s Growth Commission report, which was launched at the end of last month, said the total set-up costs to establish government departments and agencies after independence would be \"around \u0026pound450 million over five years\".\u0026nbsp  It cited analysis by Professor Patrick Dunleavy of the London School of Economics, and argued most of these costs would be associated with establishing four new bodies \u0026ndash a defence force, a foreign affairs and trade department, a security agency and a central bank and regulator.  But in an interview with Channel 4 News, Ms Sturgeon was repeatedly unable to remember this figure, insisting: \"We haven\u0027t gone through the process of analysing the report and coming to a recommendation\".\u0026nbsp  Despite this, she argued it was \"realistic\". The First Minister was also unable to recall the \u0026pound200m cost of setting up a Scottish social security agency.  She told Channel 4\u0027s reporter: \"I don\u0027t have all of those figures right at the tip of my fingers right now.\"  A Scottish Conservative spokesman branded the interview an \"embarrassment\".\u0026nbsp  He said: \u0026ldquoThis is where the SNP\u0027s broken case for independence lies: with Nicola Sturgeon unable to remember fantasy figures for set up costs from a report she still insists is credible. What an embarrassment.  \"No wonder pro-independence supporters as well as pro-Union backers are running a mile from her independence blueprint. Everyone can see it doesn\u0027t add up.  Scottish Labour\u0027s deputy leader Lesley Laird accused Ms Sturgeon of being \"unable to answer even the simplest of questions on her report\".\u0026nbsp  The First Minister will use her speech at the SNP conference today to announce that the flagship \u0026pound150m Building Scotland Fund \u0026ndash the precursor to the Scottish National Investment Bank which was unveiled as part of this year\u0026rsquos budget \u0026ndash is \u0026ldquoopen for business.  She will reveal \u0026pound70m is to be invested in the coming year, including \u0026pound25m to support at least 3000 new homes.\u0026nbsp  Ms Sturgeon will say: \u0026ldquoSetting up a Scottish National Investment Bank is one of the most important steps that the Scottish Government is taking \u0026ndash it has the potential to put Scotland at the forefront of technological and environmental innovation and create jobs.  \u0026ldquoOf course, it will take a couple of years to get the bank up and running - so to bridge the gap, we have announced \u0026pound150m over the next two years for a new Building Scotland Fund.  \u0026ldquoI can announce today that this Fund is now open for business.\""},{"url":null,"title":"The Scots that were the winners in the Queen s Birthday Honours","story":"              The Scots in the Queen\u0027s Birthday Honours List.

Yet this week, a creative team from the National Theatre of Scotland have constructed a complex structure on the three acre site off Queen Margaret Drive in the city\u0026rsquos west end.

The playfields were established in the 1930s, eventually falling out of use 60 years later. Slowly reclaimed by nature, they were gradually adopted by the community around Maryhill and North Kelvinside as an ad-hoc woodland surrounded by tenements.  Community connection grew as red blaise gave way to nature, with harvest festivals, bonfires, outdoor cinema, reindeer visits, Halloween light shows and choir performances taking place on the site. Bats, orchids and butterflies pointed to a rich ecosystem, and children enjoyed a natural play environment.  But in 2012 the land came under the scope of builders New City Vision in response to a 2009 council consultation process on the plot\u0026rsquos future.  Locals mounted a robust resistance which eventually saw the case called in by the Scottish Government for investigation.  In late 2016, the Scottish Reporter found in favour of the meadow ruling that no building was permitted on the site.  Until now. This week, setmakers from the National Theatre of Scotland have assembled a rangey structure for a new production based on a book written by an autistic Japanese teenager.  The Reason I Jump has been adapted from the book of the same name, and will be performed by a cast of actors with autism for two weeks from next Monday.  Emily said: \u0026ldquoI couldn\u0026rsquot imagine this happening back then. I knew this place was important for people, and that some parents brought their children here because it was the only place some autistic children would come and play because it was wild, and not structured.  \u0026ldquoWe always hoped that people would use the space in more creative ways. But the idea that the National Theatre of Scotland would be here would have been radical.  Since winning their David v Goliath tussle, the North Kelvin Meadow and Children\u0026rsquos Wood has established regular groups including a Five Ways To Wellbeing project for people with mental ill-health, as well as facilitating forest skills classes for schools and nurseries.  Five part time members of staff are in place, and locals youths have been engaged to take care of plants.  But the current synergy of natural and creative expression is the most precise representation of the vision campaigners had for the land.  Emily said: \u0026ldquoThe message in this play is highlighting something really important for people in every community, that restrictions on opportunities to be outside and play outside impact on mental health, and that includes people with autism.  For director Graham Eatough, the Meadow was the obvious choice once the project began its two-year development at NTS.  He said: \u0026ldquoOne of the main themes in the book is about Naoki\u0026rsquos powerful relationship with nature. In a world he finds difficult to interact with, the natural environment is affirming for him.  \u0026ldquoAs we were working with autistic actors, we realised they also felt nature was a place of respite, rejuvenation and positivity. So we decided to set the show outdoors, and started working with the people here.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a brilliant coming together with a place which already had that philosophy for a theatre show which is telling people a story about that relationship with nature.  The cast of children and adults are all on the autistic spectrum, with pupils from Glasgow\u0026rsquos Abercorn School, the Isobel Mair School in Renfrewshire, and Edinburgh\u0026rsquos St Crispin\u0026rsquos. Like the author of the book, some of the performers are non-verbal.  The set comprises a wooden maze and a central labyrinth built from old cobblestones reclaimed from a Maryhill street. The maze will be dismantled, but the labyrinth will become a permanent part of the wood.  Actor Nicky Tuxworth, 28, from West Calder, has Asperger\u0026rsquos. A gold medal winner in judo and bowls at the special olympics, she is incorporating elements of her sporting background into her performance.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos humbling for us to take parts of Naoki\u0026rsquos book and add our own individual experiences. I love working outside, rather than being confined to a darkened stage because it brings out a lot more skills. It\u0026rsquos such a release to be around nature. It makes you feel really connected.  \u0026ldquoAnd as well as the audience getting that from it, I hope they get a better understanding of the different types of autism, and special needs, that some people have. We hope this opens more eyes and hearts to the idea that being different isn\u0026rsquot a bad thing.  Emily added: \u0026ldquoSome people thought it was all about the campaign. But we can do so much more. It was always about alternative ways of thinking for a community."},{"url":null,"title":"Close all the schools if you want 10  pay rise  EIS members told","story":"              TEACHERS have been told they can secure a pay rise of more than 10 per cent if they \u0026ldquoclose every school in Scotland as part of a campaign of strike action.  The Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS) teaching union is demanding the 10 per cent rise after a decade of salary erosion.  Members have repeatedly threatened strike action and the union intends to intensify the campaign following the summer holidays.  Helen Connor, convener of the EIS salaries committee, told the union\u0026rsquos annual general meeting in Dundee that concerted action across Scotland could see members securing an even higher pay-out.  But she also warned members they may have to consider an offer that was lower than 10 per cent.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe need to be realistic. I am absolutely committed to the 10 per cent pay claim, but this is a negotiation and sometimes negotiations take you down a different road in terms of numbers.  \u0026ldquoIf you are offered eight per cent what are you going to do? We have a responsibility that if we are offered something we have to consult with members.  \u0026ldquoIf we can close every school in Scotland in October or November of this year then we would get well beyond ten per cent, but we need to make sure we engage the membership in whatever deal we are offered.  Desmond Kenny, from the EIS ruling council, said: \u0026ldquoWe deserve at least 20 per cent to 24 per cent. The money has been stolen from us over the past ten years.  Michael Dolan, a member of the EIS salaries committee, said the union would continue to negotiate in good faith, but a ballot on industrial action was \u0026ldquoalmost inevitable.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is strike action that keeps management awake at night and focuses their mind on a solution and it is strike action that will win this campaign.  \u0026ldquoIt is our experience that a day of action causes discomfort, but they get over that and for that reason we must embark on a well designed plan of action beyond one day.  Earlier, Larry Flanagan, general secretary of the EIS, used his address to the AGM to call on members to back strikes if needed saying they were \u0026ldquoin it to win it.  Earlier this year, teachers rejected an offer of up to three per cent, which is in line with the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos public pay policy.  Mr Flanagan said 10 per cent was needed to address teacher recruitment and retention.  A Scottish Government spokesman said: \u0026ldquoWe welcome the commitment from EIS to playing its part in discussions."},{"url":null,"title":"Teachers  Overhaul homework and stop parents creating    masterpieces   ","story":"              TEACHERS have called for a radical overhaul of homework amid fears pushy parents are spending too much time creating \u0026ldquomasterpieces on behalf of their children that have no educational value.  The annual general meeting of the Educational Institute of Scotland heard a variety of examples of tasks that often resulted in too much parental help including building a Viking longship, an item of Charles Rennie Mackintosh furniture and \u0026ldquothe Arctic Circle in a box.  More serious concerns were raised about the impact on children from homes where parents gave little or no help.  And delegates also suggested the explosion in homework in recent years was because the curriculum was so crowded core learning talks were being dumped on parents.  Carolyn Ritchie, from the Glasgow branch of the EIS, said: \u0026ldquoPupils, parents and teachers are pulling their hair out over homework and we need to ask why.  \u0026ldquoThere are huge pressures on parents and it is simply wrong to assume that a child\u0026rsquos home is a calm place kitted out with an abundance of Blue Peter materials and that there are always willing assistants waiting in the wings.  \u0026ldquoHow can it be right to ask pupils to make a Viking ship or a motte and bailey castle at home in such circumstances and to praise only the few who can find the means and support to complete such a task?  She asked: \u0026ldquoAre pupils even doing it by themselves? I think not. Why did we ever buy into that myth?  Ms Ritchie said the problem was exacerbated for families living in poverty who were unable to access a computer at home or whose families were unlikely to take them to a library or museum.  She went on to suggest that an \u0026ldquoexplosion in homework in recent years was because there was no longer enough time in the school day to fit everything in.  \u0026ldquoIn the worst instances it is done to compensate for an over-crowded curriculum which is just wrong, she said.  \u0026ldquoPerhaps it is just an excuse to push some of the work that we can\u0026rsquot get through in the day on to parents in addition to the spelling and sums.  \u0026ldquoCore learning should happen in the school where you have the very best resource of a teacher to help you.  Andrene Bamford, from East Dunbartonshire, said: \u0026ldquoAt best parents are scouring craft shops and staying up to all hours helping their children create their masterpieces and at worst parents don\u0026rsquot have the time or the resources to help and this in turn helps to widen the poverty gap.  \u0026ldquoWhat do teachers do? Do they mark the \u0026ldquopupil work, do they cease giving out homework at the risk of parents saying it isn\u0026rsquot enough? We need a sensible policy to give teachers and headteachers a credible sensible policy.

Susan Quinn, from Glasgow, argued that initiatives to help poorer pupils\u0026rsquo complete additional work, such as homework clubs after school, were actually counterproductive.  She said: \u0026ldquoTeachers\u0026rsquo days can get off to a bad start if homework is not handed in on time and that can have an impact on the school day.  \u0026ldquoThere is something very wrong with a system that relies on homework."},{"url":null,"title":"Pupils being    discriminated against    because of the National 4 exam","story":"              PUPILS are being \u0026ldquodiscriminated against by Scotland\u0026rsquos system of qualifications, it has been claimed.  Teachers said pupils who sat National 4 subjects did not value it because there was no final exam.  When National 4s were introduced in 2014 as part of the scrapping of Standard Grade examiners said they would be seen as the equal of other qualifications \u0026ndash despite being internally assessed.  However, teachers and parents have warned the qualification had led to groups of pupils viewing themselves as \u0026ldquosecond class citizens compared to the more advanced National 5 which has an exam.  Figures published last summer showed the number of pupils sitting National 4 qualifications is in freefall.  The annual general meeting of the EIS teaching union heard calls for a final exam to be introduced to restore the reputation of National 4.  Gordon Black, from the EIS Dundee branch, said National 4 candidates felt marginalised at times of the school year when other pupils were preparing for exams.  \u0026ldquoNational 4 lacks sufficient demand, fails to sufficiently differentiate between candidates of different abilities and marginalises candidates at different times of the year.  John Swinburne, from the Edinburgh branch, said \u0026ldquooverwhelmingly teachers and pupils did not value National 4.  \u0026ldquoThey think it is discriminatory as a method of assessment, they feel undervalued and they want it to change, he said.  Alan Crosby, also from Edinburgh, said National 4 had to be reformed, adding: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom no fan of exams, but we have to move to a position where we are reforming National 4.  David Baxter, from the Dundee branch, said: \u0026ldquoThere is a lack of recognition of the value of the National 4 qualification and that is partly to do with the way it is structured and assessed.  However, Sonia Kordiak, from the Edinburgh branch, defended the current position.  She said: \u0026ldquoMy own experience as an English teacher is that National 4 pupils do value it. It meets the needs of particular pupils in my school in an area of multiple deprivation.  \u0026ldquoNational 4 is valued by parents, pupils and teachers. It would be illogical for us as a union to seek to have an exam type assessment when we are being critical of standardised national assessments."},{"url":null,"title":"Vital isles ferry returns to service five days ahead of schedule","story":"              A VITAL ferry, whose extended repairs caused massive travel disruption along the west coast, is to return to service today, five days ahead of schedule.  Complications during repairs to the Caledonian MacBrayne ferry meant the boat was out of action for longer than expected.  Parts of the MV Clansman\u0026rsquos propulsion system have had to be sent to Denmark for specialist repair.  The repairs had knock-on effects for other services as CalMac re-shuffled its fleet.  Within days the company handled more than 12,500 calls from worried customers.  The vessel was due back in service on Wednesday, but will now be back in service today on the scheduled Oban-Coll-Tiree route.  The vessel\u0026rsquos return allowed MV Lord of the Isles to deliver an additional Oban to Lochboisdale sailing yesterday and will restart the postponed Lochboisdale-Mallaig service today as well as delivering the Mallaig-Armadale route as scheduled.

Harry and Meghan are expected to ride in a carriage to the event, staged on Whitehall\u0026rsquos Horse Guards Parade, and later join members of the monarchy on Buckingham Palace\u0026rsquos balcony to watch the RAF flypast and acknowledge the crowds.  The Queen, who recently had a successful eye operation to remove a cataract, will watch the Trooping ceremony from a dais in Horse Guards and later inspect the lines of guardsmen in their scarlet tunics and bearskins.  The annual event will see more than 1,000 soldiers taking part in the traditional display\u0026nbspof pomp and pageantry. The colour being paraded this year is the flag of the 1st Battalion Coldstream Guards.  The Duke of Edinburgh, who celebrates his 97th birthday on Sunday, has retired from official public duties and is not expected to attend.  The royal colonels, all on horseback, will accompany the Queen: Prince of Wales, Colonel of the Welsh Guards, the Princess Royal, Colonel of the Blues and Royals, and the Duke of Cambridge, Colonel of the Irish Guards.  Riding in the ceremony for the first time will be the Duke of York in his new role as Colonel of the Grenadier Guards.

After the ceremony the royal family will head back to Buckingham Palace and gather on the balcony to watch the RAF flypast.  Among the 23 aircraft taking part are modern jets and historic aircraft, while the Red Arrows will be the finale.  Trooping the Colour originated from traditional preparations for battle. Colours, or flags, were carried, or trooped, down the rank so that they could be seen and recognised by the soldiers.  In the 18th century, guards from the royal palaces assembled daily on Horse Guards to troop the colours and in 1748 it was announced that the parade would also mark the Sovereign\u0026rsquos official birthday.

The results reportedly showed traces of pork DNA in Sainsbury\u0026rsquos own brand Meat Free Meatballs 380g, which retail at \u0026pound1.50.  It also allegedly found traces of turkey DNA in Tesco\u0026rsquos Wicked Kitchen BBQ Butternut Mac 385g ready meal, which is labelled as being vegan and retails at \u0026pound4.  The presence of whole animal DNA indicates that a dish contains meat or animal skin, the laboratory told the newspaper.

A Tesco spokesman said: \u0026ldquoWe take the quality and integrity of our products extremely seriously and understand that our vegan and vegetarian products should be exactly that.  \u0026ldquoOur initial DNA tests have found no traces of animal DNA in the BBQ Butternut Mac product available in stores today.  \u0026ldquoWe would urge the  to share full details of their testing, including the lab used as we continue to investigate."},{"url":null,"title":"UK lift-off for Ryan Gosling   s Neil Armstrong biopic trailer","story":"              The trailer for First Man, the biopic that tells the story of the first man to walk on the Moon, Neil Armstrong, has landed in the UK.  Film fans got their first look at actor Ryan Gosling playing the astronaut during the two-and-a-half-minute clip, which studio Universal Pictures released in the early hours of Saturday morning.  The trailer for First Man begins with a shot of Gosling starring wistfully at a rocket as it blasts off from a launchpad.  He is then heard saying \u0026ldquoAre you sure? before viewers see him link hands with on-screen wife Claire Foy.  The star of Netfilx series The Crown, who portrays Armstrong\u0026rsquos first wife, Janet Shearon, replies: \u0026ldquoYeah. (It\u0026rsquoll) be an adventure.  Other scenes in the trailer show Gosling as Armstrong training for the 1969 mission.  At one point he is seen catching a floating pen that is suspended in zero-gravity as he flies a plane to the outer reaches of the Earth\u0026rsquos atmosphere.  Gosling and Foy are also captured in scenes in the Armstrong household which see them comforting their on-screen children as they voice their fears about their father taking part in the dangerous mission.  Captions in the clip invite viewers to \u0026ldquoexperience the improbable journey of the most dangerous mission in history.  The final scenes of the clip tease the moments of the famous landing and space walk. Brief shots see the spacecraft hurtling towards the surface of the Moon.

Edward Mills, from Dunnet, Caithness, completed the challenging climb to raise money for charity Climbers Against Cancer as his mother, Bekki Christian, has terminal breast cancer.  The family, who are originally from Stoud, Gloucestershire, had believed Bekki, 38, might not live long enough to see her son take on the sea stack off the coast of Orkney.  But she watched from a boat as he reached the top on Friday.  She said: \u0026ldquoI am so proud of him. Proud of the way that he focused on just getting his head down and doing it.  \u0026ldquoFull of admiration for him as I know he will look around and take in the view, he loves the sensation of being up high.  \u0026ldquoHe will be able to treasure the memory forever. And I am grateful to him, wanting to see him do this has given me purpose over the last few months as my health has declined and I was told in February that I wouldn\u0026rsquot be here to see it.  \u0026ldquoI know that he is doing it for me. That feels really so very special.  Edward takes the title of youngest climber to scale the stack from Ollie Buckle of Flax Bourton near Bristol, who was 10 when he made it to the top in 2016.  The eight-year-old had raised more than \u0026pound12,000 by Saturday afternoon, beating his original target of \u0026pound10,000.  He said: \u0026ldquoMy mum taught us to love the outdoors, so she will be with us wherever we go.  \u0026ldquoWhen I climb I don\u0026rsquot think about anything else.  \u0026ldquoWhen my arms ache and my fingers are red I like to eat fish and chips to fill me up after climbing.  \u0026ldquoI feel very pleased with what I have achieved. I think my mum is very proud.  Edward did the climb alongside Ben West and Cailean Harker, elite climbers from Bristol."}]
