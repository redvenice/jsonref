Among the tweets were ones that pictured Jarrett next to a character from Planet of the Apes, and a doctored image of Whoopie Goldberg wearing a t-shirt that shows Trump shooting himself in the head      Despite apologizing for her previous comments about George Soros and Valerie Jarrett, Barr retweeted a stream of content that backed her remarks while wading into other right-wing causes and conspiracies      Barr also said she thought former Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett was white when she penned the racist tweet that got her show pulled from television          Barr said she though Jarrett \u0027was Jewish and Persian\u0027 amid a bizarre flurry tweets penned late on Tuesday night          Valerie Jarrett was born in Iran but both of her parents are African American, and her great-grandfather was the first credited African American architect. She appeared on MSNBC on Tuesday (pictured) to lay blame for Barr\u0027s rhetoric at the feet of President Trump, saying: \u0027The tone comes from the top\u0027          The shamed star also blamed her racist rant on sleeping pill Ambien. Users have previously reported going into blackouts and performing complex actions such as driving and making food without recalling it           Roseanne\u0027s show was the most viewed program on ABC before it was cancelled over a tweet in which she said Jarrett was the lovechild of the \u0027Muslim Brotherhood and Planet of the Apes\u0027          Actor John Goodman, 65, stepped out to walk his dog in New Orleans on Tuesday soon after news broke that his show \u0027Roseanne\u0027 had been canceled because of his castmate Roseanne Barr\u0027s racist tweets          She then went on to rant about what she described as a Soros plot to overthrow America \u0027by buyingbacking candidates 4 local district attorney races who will ignore US law \u0026amp favor \u0027feelings\u0027 instead-and call everyone who is alarmed by that \u0027racist\u0027.\u0027Following on from that, she called on Americans to unite against his narrative while throwing a reference to MK Ultra, a discontinued CIA program that right-wing conspiracy theorists believe is still ongoing, into the mix           It was during this rant that Barr made the comment \u0027muslim brotherhood and planet of the apes had a babyvj\u0027, using Valerie Jarrett\u0027s initials, that would see her show axed.Barr subsequently deleted the tweet but not before it had been copied and shared across social media, leading to swift calls for her show to be pulled from the air.          After Barr\u0027s now-infamous Planet of the Apes tweet had been sent, Clinton replied around 9am to say that she was not in fact married to a Soros, though she admired the work his foundation does.Barr subsequently sent a Tweet apologizing to Clinton for the mistake, though launched another broadside at Soros by claiming he was a \u0027Nazi\u0027 who betrayed Jews during the holocaust.The actress also launched a salvo at Clinton\u0027s actual husband, Marc Mezvinsky, saying: \u0027HER HUSBAND IS THE SON OF A CORRUPT SENATOR.\u0027Clinton\u0027s father-in-law is a former congressman and convicted felon who in March of 2001 plead guilty to 31 of 69 felony charges of mail, bank and wire fraud.            But as the Clinton saga wound to a close Barr\u0027s tweet about Jarrett was catching a massive amount of attention, forcing the actress to brand her remark \u0027a joke\u0027.She also defended herself against allegations of racism by countering that Islam \u0027is not a race\u0027.The remarks were not enough, however, and around an hour later she offered a full apology to Jarrett and announced that she would be leaving Twitter.           Shortly after midday Wanda Sykes, an African-American comedian and writer working on the Roseanne reboot, announced that she was walking away from the program.Around an hour later ABC broke its silence over the controversy to say that Roseanne was being cancelled.We now know that the network spent this time contacting Jarrett to apologize and inform her of the cancellation.Barr later said that the network had bowed to pressure amid calls for a boycott of Roseanne\u0027s advertisers, though ABC did not immediately respond to her remark.In its statement, ABC said Roseanne\u0027s remark was \u0027abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values\u0027.       Soon after the news broke, Goodman, who played Barr\u0027s husband Dan on the TV show, was spotted looking very glum as he walked his dog          Goodman, 65, is yet to offer any comment on Barr\u0027s tweets or their show being axed          Gilbert, who played Darlene Conner on the series, had earlier slammed Barr\u0027s tweets as \u0027abhorrent\u0027  Barr also lashed out at former costar Sara Gilbert for her reaction to the racism row, in which Gilbert called her comments \u0027abhorrent\u0027 and \u0027disappointing\u0027, by saying \u0027wow! unreal\u0027  Bar clapped back at Michael Fishman, who played DJ Conner for the entirety of the series and was featured in the revival with a biracial daughter, accusing him of throwing her under a bus      Barr was widely condemned after she tweeted that Jarrett looked like \u0027Muslim brotherhood \u0026amp planet of the apes had a baby\u0027.Jarrett responded to the ordeal when she spoke at a town hall on MSNBC called \u0027Everyday Racism in America\u0027 later on Tuesday. She revealed that Disney CEO Bob Iger had called her to apologize.\u0027He wanted me to know before he made it public that he was canceling the show,\u0027 she said. \u0027First of all, I think we have to turn it into a teaching moment. I\u0027m fine. I\u0027m worried about all the people out there who don\u0027t have a circle of friends and followers coming to their defense. \u0027The person walking down the street minding their own business and they see someone clinging to their purse or walk across the street... or every black parent I know who has a boy who has to sit down and have a conversation, the talk as we call it.\u0027Those ordinary examples of racism that happen every single day.\u0027     ABC has decided to cancel Roseanne Barr\u0027s television show just hours after the comedian posted a racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett          \u0027We have decided to cancel her show,\u0027 Channing Dungey, President of ABC Entertainment, announced on Tuesday afternoon           Disney CEO Bob Iger  tweeted about ABC\u0027s decision, saying: \u0027There was only one thing to do here, and that was the right thing.\u0027 Disney owns ABC Television Group   Barr came under fire for a racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett during an unhinged rant on Tuesday morning          Many on Twitter were appalled by Barr\u0027s tweet, which was in response to an article from a conspiracy website The Disney CEO also tweeted about the decision to terminate the show, saying: \u0027There was only one thing to do here, and that was the right thing.\u0027Shortly after Barr\u0027s show was cancelled, talent agency ICM Partners revealed they were dropping her as a client. \u0027We are all greatly distressed by the disgraceful and unacceptable tweet from Roseanne Barr this morning,\u0027 ICM said in an internal note to employees that was obtained by the Hollywood Reporter. \u0027What she wrote is antithetical to our core values, both as iniduals and as an agency.\u0027 \u0027Consequently, we have notified her that we will not represent her. Effective immediately, Roseanne Barr is no longer a client.\u0027 It appears the cancellation of the show will also affect the cast\u0027s Emmy prospects, as ABC revealed it is suspending the show\u0027s FYC (For Your Consideration) campaign. Other networks including Viacom also dropped reruns of the original Roseanne as the industry turned its back on the show and its star performer. The swift fallout from the tweet began when Wanda Sykes  quit her role as the show\u0027s consulting producer and celebrities condemned Barr\u0027s words.   Emma Kenney, who played Sara Gilbert\u0027s daughter on the show, also revealed on Twitter that she planned to quit before finding out the show had been cancelled. \u0027I am hurt, embarrassed, and disappointed. The racist and distasteful comments from Roseanne are inexcusable,\u0027 the 18-year-old wrote. \u0027As I called my manager to quit working on Roseanne, I was told it was cancelled. I feel so empowered by @iamwandasykes , Channing Dungey and anyone at ABC standing up for morals and abuse of power. Bullies will NEVER win.\u0027Tom Arnold, who co-starred on the show from 1989 to 1993 and was married to Barr from 1990 to 1994, praised the decision to cancel the show.   \u0027Ton of respect for Bob Iger. Tough decision with financial consequences for his company but right for America,\u0027 he wrote. Michael Fishman, who played DJ Conner for the entirety of the series and was featured in the revival with a biracial daughter, said he was \u0027devastated\u0027. \u0027Today is one of the hardest days of my life. I feel devastated, not for the end of the Roseanne show, but for all those who poured their hearts and souls into our jobs, and the audience that welcomed us into their home,\u0027 he wrote on Twitter. Comedian Wanda Sykes had earlier revealed she would not return to the show following the comedian\u0027s racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett (Pictured L-R: Sykes, Russell Peters, Barr, JB Smoove, Keenen Ivory Wayans in 2014)          Sykes, a consulting producer for Barr\u0027s eponymous show on ABC, revealed the news on Twitter          Emma Kenney, who played Sara Gilbert\u0027s daughter on the show, revealed on Twitter that she planned to quit before finding out the show had been cancelled           Tom Arnold, who co-starred on the show from 1989 to 1993 and was married to Barr from 1990 to 1994, praised the decision to cancel the showFishman said he condemned Roseanne\u0027s statement \u0027vehemently\u0027, saying they were \u0027reprehensible and intolerable\u0027 and \u0027truly offensive\u0027.  \u0027My character was designed to represent the inclusive nature of my views. To represent potions of society often marginalized,\u0027 he wrote. \u0027In this moment it is important to be clear. We must stand up against bias, hatred, bigotry, and ignorance to make society a better place for all.\u0027  Many called on ABC to fire Barr or drop the show as others criticized the broadcast network for its enduring silence amid recent controversies with the comedian.Others were skeptical that ABC would dare touch the hit series, which is the third highest-rated show this year following Sunday Night Football and This Is Us.The revival of Roseanne was a ratings juggernaut when it premiered on ABC to a whopping 25 million viewers in April.It\u0027s surprising success even elicited a congratulatory phone call and tweet from President Donald Trump. Ratings dropped steadily thereafter, with last week\u0027s season finale garnering 10.33 million viewers.ABC  initially ordered 13 episodes for the second season and said the show would move away from its controversial politics and focus on family.    Roseanne\u0027s mention of the \u0027Muslim brotherhood\u0027 seems to be due to the long-running conspiracy theory that Jarrett is Muslim, despite there being no supporting evidence           She also retweeted an article with the headline: \u0027Valerie Jarrett...was her mommy a Commie?\u0027The show most recently came under fire for featuring an episode in which Barr\u0027s character believes her new Muslim neighbors are terrorists. Roseanne\u0027s mention of the \u0027Muslim brotherhood\u0027 in her Tuesday tweet seems to be due to the long-running conspiracy theory that Jarrett is Muslim. Jarrett, who was Obama\u0027s senior adviser during his presidency, was born in Iran to American parents and lived in Shiraz for six years. The family had moved to Iran because her father was part of a program that sent American physicians to help developing countries. He ran a children\u0027s hospital.There has never been any indication that Jarrett or her parents are Muslim.  Barr later claimed the comment was a \u0027joke\u0027 when she was called out on Twitter by CNN reporter Andrew Kaczynski. \u0027ABC is doing their best to ignore some of these statements from Roseanne and she is making it really hard for them by taking it to the next level here,\u0027 he wrote. After Roseanne responds, Kaczynski replied: \u0027understand it\u0027s a joke, but can you see why some people think comparing a black woman to Planet of the Apes might be racist and find the Muslim Brotherhood reference to be conspiratorial and Islamophobic?\u0027  Hilarious moment cheeky kangaroo farts and wafts away smellYoung boy tries multiple times to give President Trump a hugMoment paedophile hunters Guardians of the North snare man in stingHow to survive a knife attack: Chinese police\u0027s 12 second advice goes viralNavy Seal Ranger gives hilarious advice on tackling a knife man\u0027I\u0027m not buying her book\u0027: Emily Hunt on Greer\u0027s rape comments\u0027She can\u0027t handle whiskey at all\u0027: Lyndsey on fight with Black JuicyWomen throw mugs of tea and council bins at each other in street brawlMan headbutts thug who is beating his ex-wife in Turkish streetPolice officers attend stabbing crime scene in Chelsea, London    A number of stars have since condemned Barr for the tweet, including Patricia Arquette and Julianne Moore. Rev Al Sharpton used ABC to fire Barr, while Rosie O\u0027Donnell defended her          Not everyone was happy with ABC\u0027s decision to cancel the show. Some stood by in their support for Barr, while others said the network should have continued without her A number of celebrities  also condemned Barr for the tweet, with some urging ABC to fire her from the show completely.\u0027I am repulsed that Valerie Jarret had that racist and bigoted \u0027joke\u0027 made at her expense and I am sickened that any Black or Muslim person has to keep hearing this sickness in 2018,\u0027 Patricia Arquette tweeted. \u0027You can take @RoseanneOnABC out of racism but you can\u0027t take the racism out of @therealroseanne,\u0027 Don Cheadle wrote. \u0027I told y\u0027all about Roseanne. I told you. So,\u0027 author Roxane Gay added, to which Julianne Moore replied: \u0027Yes you did. #FireRoseanne.\u0027 Reverend Al Sharpton also criticized the comedian and called on ABC to \u0027take action now\u0027. \u0027The comparison by Rosanne Barr on ABC of Former Obama aide, Valerie Jarrett to an APE is racist and inexcusable,\u0027 he tweeted. Tomi Lahren was a rare prominent conservative voice to hit out at Roseanne. \u0027What Roseanne said was wrong,\u0027 she tweeted. \u0027I\u0027m sure she knows that. She made a mistake.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know why fellow conservatives are playing mental gymnastics trying to justify it. Come on. Wrong is wrong.\u0027 Only Rosie O\u0027Donnell appeared to lend some support to Roseanne, writing that she loved her \u0027quite a bit\u0027. \u0027The comment Roseanne tweeted was racist and childish and beneath her best self,\u0027 O\u0027Donnell wrote. \u0027She has apologized.

I disagree on some things, but give him benefit of doubt-4 now,\u0027 she added. The tweet was similar to when, in 2015, Barr revealed that she believed the Pizzagate conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton was running a child sex-ring in a pizza shop. \u0027Americans! The reason #DEMOCRATS aren\u0027t approving #Sessions is bc he will prosecure #HRC – and make arrests over PedoGate RT THIS!! WAKE UP!!\u0027Barr was slammed and derided for the tweets. She later apologized for mentioning child trafficking and said Twitter was \u0027not the place for it\u0027. In 2015 Barr made headlines after tweeting she \u0027hope all the jews leave UC Davis and then it gets nuked!\u0027 after the student body voted to est from companies that have ties to Israel           In 2012 the comedian came under fire after she spoke out against transgender bathroom rightsIn 2012 the comedian came under fire after she spoke out against transgender bathroom rights. \u0027Women do not want your penises forced in their faces or in private bathrooms. Respect that,\u0027 she wrote.  After the comedian\u0027s most recent Twitter controversies came to light, Walt Disney President Ben Sherwood responded that \u0027you can\u0027t control Roseanne Barr\u0027.\u0027Many who have tried have failed. She\u0027s the one and only,\u0027 he added. But as Tuesday\u0027s news has proved, you can still cancel here.                         \u0027You\u0027re a racist pig \u0026amp ABC should be ashamed that they give you a platform,\u0027 another added. Roseanne later tweeted, in an attempt to defend herself, that \u0027Islam is not a race\u0027. \u0027Islam includes EVERY RACE of people,\u0027 she added, still without acknowledging the fact that there is no evidence Jarrett has ties to the Islamic faith. She also retweeted an article whose headline read: \u0027Valerie Jarrett...was her mommy a Commie?\u0027 About an hour later, Roseanne apologized and said she was leaving Twitter.     \u0027I apologize to Valerie Jarrett and to all Americans,\u0027 she wrote in a separate tweet. \u0027I am truly sorry for making a bad joke about her politics and her looks. I should have known better.

One stupid joke in a lifetime of fighting 4 civil rights 4 all minorities, against networks, studios, at the expense of my nervous systemfamilywealth will NEVER b taken from me.\u0027That comment came hours after Barr retweeted an outlandish statement suggesting that Michelle Obama played a role in her firing.       She suggested Michelle Obama was behind her firing by retweeting two unsourced claims alleging that the former first lady conspired with Channing Dungey ahead of ABC\u0027s decision          \u0027According to sources ABC President Channing Dungey had a long conversation via phone with former First Lady Michelle Obama before deciding to cancel the Roseanne show,\u0027 read the tweet. \u0027Michelle Obama was reportedly enraged and insisted an apology was inadequate.\u0027Barr also retweeted a post that further suggested this was an attempt by the Obamas to get revenge after she mocked the couple\u0027s Netflix deal with a hashtag last week that became a trending topic.\u0027Interesting. A few days after the popular #ObmasNetflixShows was all over the place making people giggle. Not surprised and I would not doubt it being very true,\u0027 read the post that Barr shared with her followers.These were just two of the conspiracy theories retweeted by Barr in the wake of the show\u0027s cancellation.    ABC decided to cancel Roseanne Barr\u0027s television show \u0027Roseanne\u0027 on Tuesday just hours after the comedian posted a racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett          Valerie Jarrett has spoken out on the controversy surrounding Roseanne Barr\u0027s racist tweets, saying the ABC made the right decision to cancel her show          Roseanne caused outrage when she compared ex-Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett to an ape on Twitter           Keeping above the fray: Barr also retweeted an inidual who suggested the Obamas, who employed and are close friends with Valerie Jarrett, did this as revenge because Barr mocked their $50 million Netflix deal (l to r: Jarrett, Michelle and Barack in 2014)It comes after her ex-husband Tom Arnold told CNN\u0027s Anderson Cooper that he wasn\u0027t surprised and it was only a matter of time before all hell broke loose. Arnold - who was a writer on the original Rosanne series - claimed that Barr\u0027s politics and social media showed that she was obsessed with the conspiracy theories that Donald Trump has been feeding to the masses.  \u0027This monkey thing is something that she tweeted before about black people, its a meme that she and thousands of her alt-right fans do. They love to call black people monkeys, it\u0027s not a one time joke,\u0027 Arnold said. \u0027They can do this because we have a white trash racist president. That\u0027s a fact!\u0027Arnold shared his disgust with how Trump was only concerned with how the media had treated him when news of Barr\u0027s tweets made their way to him.        Meanwhile, Barr\u0027s son Jake shared text exchanges with his mother on Wednesday to seemingly prove she was not racist.\u0027Her and her dad, I thought they were white,\u0027 Barr wrote in a text message she purportedly sent her son.She followed that up by saying: \u0027I would never have called a black woman an ape I\u0027m not stupid!\u0027 That is a lie however, with Barr having called former national security advisor Susan Rice just that in a 2014 tweet. The third text stated: \u0027I thought she was Jewish of Iranian.\u0027 Her son captioned the image by writing: \u0027Mom and I are too dumb for the internet lol.           On Wednesday, actor Tom Arnold appeared on AC360 to share that he wasn\u0027t surprised when ABC pulled the plug on the \u0027Roseanne\u0027 reboot  Contextual: Her son also shared text messages that he and his mother purportedly exchanged in which Barr writes that she thought Jarrett was \u0027white\u0027 and \u0027Iranian,\u0027 posted eight hours after the show was cancelled            Commander-in-chief: President Trump complained that ABC president Bob Iger \u0027never ... apologized for the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC\u0027Barr had previously blasted two of her co-stars for speaking out against her in tweets posted around midnight.Hours after claiming she was quitting Twitter, Barr began to rail against her critics while also posting an occasional apology.Michael Fishman, who played D.J. Conner on the show and started working with Barr when he was just six, was the first to feel the wrath of the show\u0027s creator after he released a statement criticizing her racist tweet saying Jarrett looks like the lovechild of the \u0027Muslim Brotherhood and Planet of the Apes\u0027.\u0027I condemn these statements vehemently,\u0027 wrote Fishman, who is the father of a black daughter in the reboot. \u0027They are reprehensible and intolerable, contradicting my beliefs and outlook on life and society. I have always lived and taught my children to be inclusive. I believe our show strived to embrace different backgrounds and opinions, through open dialogue.\u0027Barr was none too happy with that statement and fired back on Twitter. \u0027I created the platform for that inclusivity and you know it. ME. You throw me under the bus. nice!\u0027, she wrote.Fishman responded, stating: \u0027You fought, built, and designed Roseanne for inclusiveness. That is why yesterday was so out of character with the last 30 years. It was in your hands from the beginning to the end. No one can deny that.\u0027Barr fired back: \u0027Please leave me alone, thanks.\u0027             Michael Fishman, who played D.J. Conner on the show, released a statement criticizing Barr\u0027s racist tweet  Weighing in: Gilbert, who is a producer on the reboot, let her disgust be known on TuesdayBut Fishman was not the only original cast member to take a stand, with Sara Gilbert, who played Roseanne\u0027s daughter Darlene, also releasing a statement that very much echoed the one released shortly after by ABC cancelling the show.\u0027Roseanne’s recent comments about Valerie Jarrett, and so much more, are abhorrent and do not reflect the beliefs of our cast and crew or anyone associated with our show. I am disappointed in her actions to say the least,\u0027 wrote Gilbert, who was a producer on the reboot and largely responsible for reuniting the cast.\u0027This is incredibly sad and difficult for all of us, as we’ve created a show that we believe in, are proud of, and that audiences love— one that is separate and apart from the opinions and words of one cast member.\u0027\u0027Wow! unreal,\u0027 wrote Barr, who had confessed in earlier interviews to the difficult job Gilbert had of trying to rein in her impulse to tweet offensive comments.However, she later followed up, tweeting: \u0027No, I understand her position and why she said what she said. i forgive her. It just shocked me a bit, but I indeed f***ed up.\u0027She reiterated this soon after when a follower criticized Gilbert, saying: \u0027She\u0027s distancing herself from me and my tweet-she has to.\u0027A downcast Gilbert was photographed on her phone outside an LA restaurant yesterday as John Goodman, who played Barr\u0027s husband Dan on the show, looked similarly bereft as he walked his dog in New Orleans.   "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/30/15/4CC1DAEB00000578-0-image-m-21_1527689211545.jpg","title":"The Queen placed handbag chair meeting George Brandis means","story":"    A handbag (circled) on a side chair at Buckingham Palace could be a good omen for Australia\u0027s relations with the QueenRoyal historian Hugo Vickers has previously spoken of how the monarch uses her bag to send secret signals to her staff to indicate when she\u0027s ready to move on from a conversation.Granny\u0027s pride and joy!

Extremely disappointed @ChukaUmunna.\u0027Serge Valene responded: \u0027Someone living in London with their wealthy parents. Aside for that can\u0027t think who it\u0027ll be.\u0027George Bower demonstrated that not all internships have to be unpaid, tweeting: \u0027Ouch.\u0027That\u0027s not on.

Extremely disappointed @ChukaUmunna.\u0027          Emerson added that he was disappointed that a job opportunity that he \u0027would have loved to apply to was only feasible for rich, London-based students\u0027The news come as the government steps up efforts to stamp out unpaid internships.HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has written to more than 500 firms in recent months reminding them that interns classed as workers must be paid the minimum wage.It isn\u0027t the first time Mr Umunna has faced criticism over the issue.He was again branded a hypocrite in 2013 for campaigning for the living wage while advertising for an unpaid internship.On Twitter, Mr Umunna, who is from Streatham, posted a statement defending the advert.He said: \u0027The Leeds University placement is a structured part of politics sandwich-course degrees at the university, and takes place on the strict condition that students receive Student Finance throughout.\u0027The scheme, and others like it, are run collaboratively by MPs and universities, and gives students supported work experience as part of their university degree.          The advert, which was circulated to students at the University of Leeds (pictured) says: \u0027Chuka Umunna is seeking an enthusiastic placement student to join his London-based office\u0027          On Twitter, Mr Umunna, who is from Streatham, posted a statement defending the advert saying that the Leeds University placement is a structured part of politics sandwich-course degrees at the university\u0027In addition to the Student Finance students receive while undertaking a placement, as detailed in the advert, my office will reimburse travel expenses for a student travel card to minimise expenses.\u0027I do not and would not offer a long-term placement where a student is not supported and left financially penalised.\u0027Unfortunately, IPSA do not provide additional resources for MPs to recruit interns on a paid basis, though the Parliamentary Labour Party has always argued strongly for them to do so.\u0027I strongly believe that interns should be paid and, for that reason, I do not have any unsupported interns working in the office despite the many requests received.\u0027For many years, my office has only accepted students undertaking work experience as part of supported university schemes, or short work experience placements from the schools in my constituency.\u0027Mr Umunna withdrew from the Labour party leadership contest in 2015, just days after entering the contest.The rising star of the Labour said that he could not handle the level of pressure and scrutiny that came with being a leadership candidate.Sir Peter Lampl, founder and chairman of the Sutton Trust, and chairman of the Education Endowment Foundation, said \u0027Around 40 per cent of young people who have carried out an internship have done so unpaid.\u0027All internships over four weeks should be paid at least the minimum wage of £7.50 per hour.\u0027Failure to do so prevents young people from low and moderate-income backgrounds from accessing jobs in some of the most desirable sectors such as journalism, fashion, the arts and politics.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/31/23/4CCC037100000578-5792695-image-a-12_1527805952710.jpg","title":"Italy advances swiftly populist government","story":"    Giuseppe Conte presented a list of ministers to the president and the new government will be sworn in at 2pm on Friday, a government official announced          Italy\u0027s Prime Minister-designate Giuseppe Conte talks with Italian President Sergio MattarellaThe announcement came after Italy\u0027s populist parties on Thursday reached a last-ditch deal to form a coalition government after overcoming the president\u0027s objections. Di Maio and Salvini came up with a compromise earlier on Thursday that led the president to postpone trying to install a technical government until a new election could be held. Mattarella then called a meeting with Conte, the populist\u0027s pick for prime minister - a law professor whose attempt to form a government failed four days ago.Could Italy\u0027s populist coalition be back on the table?

I am convinced that Abramovich made this decision with the approval and possibly the explicit instructions of Putin.As we all know, Putin is cold-blooded and cut-throat when dealing with those who have offended him.He came to power 18 years ago through his unswerving commitment to crush Chechnya’s separatists. He went on to seize Crimea from Ukraine, is held responsible for the 2014 downing of a Malaysia Airlines passenger jet carrying 298 people and his secret police goons have been accused of assassinating enemies such as tycoon Boris Berezovsky and former KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko.In other words, Putin does not take kindly to being snubbed.The same applies to Abramovich, who learned the ways of the world at Putin’s feet.The friendship between the two men goes back nearly a quarter of a century.One persistent, though unconfirmed, rumour, is that when the ailing Russian leader Boris Yeltsin was looking for a successor in 1999, Abramovich – then a young man with powerful business allies – suggested that Putin should be made prime minister. Yeltsin did just that.  Roman Abramovich (left with ex-wife Dasha Zhukova), who was last pictured at Chelsea with Guus Hiddink in December (right), is said to have personally pulled the plug on the £1billion stadium plan after his visa row Abramovich, who started life in Moscow as a mechanic, selling retreaded tyres as a sideline, acquired substantial stakes in the oil and gas industries as the Communist state broke apart.If mystery surrounds some of his early business deals, there is no mystery about how he hangs on to his wealth: he maintains a tungsten-strength friendship with Putin.Putin never lets old enmities die, and Abramovich is the same. When Abramovich fell out spectacularly with his business associate Berezovsky, the pair faced each other in court in 2012.Berezovsky claimed £3billion in damages from Abramovich for intimidating him into selling shares in Russian oil giant Sibneft.The Chelsea owner won the case, in which legal costs were estimated to be £100million. Asked if he felt Putin would be happy with the ruling, Berezovsky replied: ‘Sometimes I have the impression that Putin himself wrote this judgment.’Roman Abramovich\u0027s new Israeli passport WON\u0027T guarantee him...Roman Abramovich SCRAPS plans for Chelsea\u0027s new £1bn stadium...Share this articleOf course, Abramovich’s difficulties in obtaining a UK visa must be set in the context of the Salisbury poisonings and the subsequent major row between London and Moscow with the UK expelling 23 Russian diplomats.His decision to halt development plans at Chelsea fit a pattern and chime with Moscow’s bitterness over what it calls ‘insinuations’ from the British authorities around the Skripal case.While most of the Western world is convinced that Moscow orchestrated the attack on British soil, the Russian government refutes the allegations as groundless.All this strongly suggests that a message is being sent from Moscow to London – and that Abramovich is the messenger.Chelsea fans may be upset about not getting a bigger stadium but this is becoming a much wider and more dangerous game. That said, Putin understands how powerful a weapon sport can be.          Mr Abramovich is a known ally of Vladimir Putin and has found his visa application at the centre of a row between Theresa May and the Russian President over the Salisbury poisoningHe cynically turned the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, on the Black Sea coast, into a gigantic ego-trip for himself. He will do exactly the same with this month’s football World Cup which he is hosting in Russia.But he is offended by criticism of Russia’s human rights record and can’t be happy that Prince William and British politicians will not attend the tournament – a decision made following the Salisbury poisonings.To some extent, Abramovich’s behaviour is blatant retaliation on behalf of his buddy in the Kremlin.I believe this might be just the start of Abramovich’s cold-shouldering of Britain.If Britain doesn’t want him, he doesn’t want Britain.Asked once where he considered home, he said: ‘I live on a plane. I like to visit London. If I had to think where I could live if not Moscow, London would be my first choice and second would be New York. In Moscow, I feel most comfortable.’That love of London has died.Just before Christmas, amid claims that the Russian government had meddled in the Brexit referendum, Putin’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov admitted: ‘It’s no secret that our relations are at a low point.’Without doubt, after the Salisbury poisonings and Abramovich’s eruption yesterday, it’s clear that relations have got much lower.Mark Almond is the director of the Crisis Research Institute, Oxford"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/31/23/4CCC5B3300000578-5793155-image-a-19_1527805570168.jpg","title":"George Osborne faces backlash cash editorial claims London Evening Standard","story":"     George Osborne was embroiled in a row over claims that London\u0027s Evening Standard promised \u0027money-can\u0027t-buy\u0027 coverage to big businesses for £3millionFormer Chancellor George Osborne was  embroiled in a row on Thursday over claims that London\u0027s Evening Standard promised \u0027money-can\u0027t-buy\u0027 coverage to big businesses for £3million.The newspaper faced accusations it had effectively sold positive news coverage to brands including Google and the controversial taxi app Uber, in return for sponsorship of a planned campaign.The two were among six firms to each pay £500,000 to be part of the paper\u0027s \u0027London 2020\u0027 project which will highlight issues including air pollution and housing.The Evening Standard said it had agreed partnerships to support its campaign but denied the deals threatened its editorial integrity and independence.

Ken Livingstone wanted London to look like Manhattan. Boris Johnson loved towers so much that in 2014 he went to Malaysia and tried to promote the gigantic Battersea power station development as some sort of \u0027inward investment\u0027. He seemed to equate an empty tower block to a machine-tool factory.In the same cause, Liverpool, ten years ago, planned 50 towers, some of them sporting huge wind turbines. Leeds sought two 54-storey towers to signify \u0027civic spirit and economic zest\u0027. Birmingham wanted ten towers, Croydon five.A pillar of luxury flats seemed to embody the new glitzy, glamorous urban machismo. It made your city look like a capital.These structures have nothing to do with housing need or land shortage. Almost all are \u0027luxury residential\u0027 and, at least in London, are investments with few permanent residents.They are at best pied-á-terres. Most estimates are that 60 per cent of prime London sales go to foreign buyers, most of these as so-called \u0027buy-to-leave\u0027.           London will look like a field of giant stubble. It is the planning philosophy of the Wild West, writes Simon Jenkins This means they are not intended for occupation and are often traded \u0027off plan\u0027 before even being built.Yet so dumb is British planning that they are still classed as \u0027meeting housing need\u0027. A tower is a property developer\u0027s \u0027signature\u0027, easy to sell at the investment auctions in hotels in Kuala Lumpur, Singapore and Hong Kong. The Battersea site carries street names such as Malaysia Square to make investors feel comfortable. The towers\u0027 virtue to investors is precisely why they are death to city vitality.They are locked, gated, anonymous and family-hostile. No one is about to care if they are empty or blight their communities.The former City of London planner, Peter Rees, told me he pleaded for new City towers to be offices, \u0027because at least they would be occupied during the day\u0027.In his own Heron Tower, a quarter of the flat keys had never been collected. The 50-storey Vauxhall tower — which even London\u0027s planners rejected until mysteriously over-ruled by then deputy prime minister John Prescott — was recently shown to have just ten per cent of its occupants on the electoral register.No one can tell what may happen to these investments when the current slump in London property prices really bites.Thousands of flats valued at over £1 million must exceed any plausible residential demand.Previous London property bubbles — as in Victorian North Kensington — saw whole neighbourhoods slide rapidly downhill into multi-occupancy and squalor. The view of the property industry is that high service charges will stop this happening.More likely to happen is that, like the palazzi of Venice, the blocks will simply sit decaying as nest eggs for laundered cash.          Many tower blocks in London are not intended for occupation and are often traded \u0027off plan\u0027 before even being built. Pictured: London\u0027s City Hall There is no doubt that smart urban renewal requires higher densities, so as to use existing infrastructure and not spread car-based settlements over surrounding countryside.London boasts the lowest housing densities in Europe, just a quarter of central Paris. But that is because so much of its housing is just three or four storeys, rather than the eight to ten-storey apartment buildings of most cities.Britain\u0027s urban housing is profligate in its use of space. Britons have 2.5 rooms each, as against 1.5 in the Seventies.In London, according to the 2011 census, there were more bedrooms in London than people, a surplus that is accelerating.The reason is high stamp duty and the Eighties abolition of steeply graduated rates. Stamp duty is a tax on transactions of any sort, and discourages older people from downsizing.The way to galvanise London\u0027s housing market is to tax property and end stamp duty — rather than subsidise inefficiency. To this argument, towers are irrelevant.Even if they are full, they rarely offer higher densities than traditional Victorian terraces. Westminster\u0027s absurd, and mercifully aborted, 72-storey \u0027Paddington pole\u0027 had fewer housing units than a rival street-based plan. As for alternatives to towers, there is no mystery. Anyone seeking \u0027high-density, low-rise\u0027 need go no further than to London\u0027s King\u0027s Cross.Here, smart planning has delivered a fusion of old and new, work space and play space, nature and community — at some of the highest densities in London.An American friend gazing at the London horizon from Waterloo Bridge asked me if the mess was all down to corruption.I had to explain that in London planning was so bad it had no need of corruption. Some developers offer \u0027planning bribes\u0027 such as a dribble of cash for a local primary school or a few \u0027affordable\u0027 flats.The reality is that planners and councillors simply lack the guts to stand up to developers, and mayors and ministers give them no incentive to do so.          Yet so dumb is British planning that they are still classed as \u0027meeting housing need\u0027, writes Simon Jenkins. Pictured: Hong Kong-owned Walkie Talkie No other city in Europe would have permitted London\u0027s top-heavy Walkie-Talkie or the \u0027pregnant\u0027 One Blackfriars.Their bulging upper storeys are not meant to be beautiful. They are purely to maximise rents.Tall buildings are conspicuous features of any city and should fit into some coherent urban design.This would be second nature in France, Italy or Germany. Rome is the most corrupt place I know, but even Romans would never do to the Tiber what London has done to the Thames.Londoners entrusted their rulers with a skyline that would have been recognisable to the 18th century Venetian-born painter Canaletto. They will be given back one recognisable only to the American abstract impressionist Jackson Pollock.Some people may like towers as a form of urban sculpture. So be it, but that is no reason for their preference to be imposed on everyone else in perpetuity.Towers are bland if not ugly, and are the enemies of social vitality. They are the opposite of street life, silent stakes driven through a city\u0027s sense of community.They are mere memorials to Britain\u0027s greed for foreign cash in the 21st century, and to a newly philistine public realm.Simon Jenkins writes for the Guardian, in which a version of this article appeared."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/31/10/4CAB980000000578-0-image-m-16_1527758863393.jpg","title":"David Davis draws plan Ulster joint EU UK status","story":"    David Davis (pictured) has drawn up a new plan to break the Brexit deadlock by handing Northern Ireland joint EU and UK statusDavid Davis has drawn up a bold new plan to break the Brexit deadlock by handing Northern Ireland joint EU and UK status.The Brexit Secretary is hoping the province can operate under both European and British regulations so that it can trade freely with both.Mr Davis is also proposing a ten mile-wide buffer zone the length of Northern Ireland\u0027s 310-mile border with the Republic, The Sun reported.The \u0027special economic zone\u0027 will mean traders, who constitute 90 per cent of cross-border traffic, can operate under the same rules as those south of the border.Mr Davis hopes the two-pronged solution will eradicate the need for border checkpoints, which has been a major sticking point in negotiations with the EU.But both ideas risk enraging the DUP, whose ten MPs are propping up Theresa May\u0027s minority government.The plans represent a major revamp of the Maximum Facilitation option, one of two alternatives under consideration for a post-Brexit customs arrangement.Brussels should copy the Swiss border in Ireland to make...Remainer ex-Cabinet ministers visit No 10 to plead with May...Share this articleMr Davis demanded a fresh strategy after he was persuaded to shelve his preferred technology-based solution to the Irish border question.Ulster police had warned him that any border infrastructure, including camera towers or swipe points, would be targeted by the IRA and breach the Good Friday peace agreement.

I am convinced that Abramovich made this decision with the approval and possibly the explicit instructions of Putin.As we all know, Putin is cold-blooded and cut-throat when dealing with those who have offended him.He came to power 18 years ago through his unswerving commitment to crush Chechnya’s separatists. He went on to seize Crimea from Ukraine, is held responsible for the 2014 downing of a Malaysia Airlines passenger jet carrying 298 people and his secret police goons have been accused of assassinating enemies such as tycoon Boris Berezovsky and former KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko.In other words, Putin does not take kindly to being snubbed.The same applies to Abramovich, who learned the ways of the world at Putin’s feet.The friendship between the two men goes back nearly a quarter of a century.One persistent, though unconfirmed, rumour, is that when the ailing Russian leader Boris Yeltsin was looking for a successor in 1999, Abramovich – then a young man with powerful business allies – suggested that Putin should be made prime minister. Yeltsin did just that.  Roman Abramovich (left with ex-wife Dasha Zhukova), who was last pictured at Chelsea with Guus Hiddink in December (right), is said to have personally pulled the plug on the £1billion stadium plan after his visa row Abramovich, who started life in Moscow as a mechanic, selling retreaded tyres as a sideline, acquired substantial stakes in the oil and gas industries as the Communist state broke apart.If mystery surrounds some of his early business deals, there is no mystery about how he hangs on to his wealth: he maintains a tungsten-strength friendship with Putin.Putin never lets old enmities die, and Abramovich is the same. When Abramovich fell out spectacularly with his business associate Berezovsky, the pair faced each other in court in 2012.Berezovsky claimed £3billion in damages from Abramovich for intimidating him into selling shares in Russian oil giant Sibneft.The Chelsea owner won the case, in which legal costs were estimated to be £100million. Asked if he felt Putin would be happy with the ruling, Berezovsky replied: ‘Sometimes I have the impression that Putin himself wrote this judgment.’Roman Abramovich\u0027s new Israeli passport WON\u0027T guarantee him...Roman Abramovich SCRAPS plans for Chelsea\u0027s new £1bn stadium...Share this articleOf course, Abramovich’s difficulties in obtaining a UK visa must be set in the context of the Salisbury poisonings and the subsequent major row between London and Moscow with the UK expelling 23 Russian diplomats.His decision to halt development plans at Chelsea fit a pattern and chime with Moscow’s bitterness over what it calls ‘insinuations’ from the British authorities around the Skripal case.While most of the Western world is convinced that Moscow orchestrated the attack on British soil, the Russian government refutes the allegations as groundless.All this strongly suggests that a message is being sent from Moscow to London – and that Abramovich is the messenger.Chelsea fans may be upset about not getting a bigger stadium but this is becoming a much wider and more dangerous game. That said, Putin understands how powerful a weapon sport can be.          Mr Abramovich is a known ally of Vladimir Putin and has found his visa application at the centre of a row between Theresa May and the Russian President over the Salisbury poisoningHe cynically turned the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, on the Black Sea coast, into a gigantic ego-trip for himself. He will do exactly the same with this month’s football World Cup which he is hosting in Russia.But he is offended by criticism of Russia’s human rights record and can’t be happy that Prince William and British politicians will not attend the tournament – a decision made following the Salisbury poisonings.To some extent, Abramovich’s behaviour is blatant retaliation on behalf of his buddy in the Kremlin.I believe this might be just the start of Abramovich’s cold-shouldering of Britain.If Britain doesn’t want him, he doesn’t want Britain.Asked once where he considered home, he said: ‘I live on a plane. I like to visit London. If I had to think where I could live if not Moscow, London would be my first choice and second would be New York. In Moscow, I feel most comfortable.’That love of London has died.Just before Christmas, amid claims that the Russian government had meddled in the Brexit referendum, Putin’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov admitted: ‘It’s no secret that our relations are at a low point.’Without doubt, after the Salisbury poisonings and Abramovich’s eruption yesterday, it’s clear that relations have got much lower.Mark Almond is the director of the Crisis Research Institute, Oxford"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/31/09/4CC59E6700000578-0-image-m-26_1527755912399.jpg","title":"The trend beefed 4x4s SUVs means vehicles posts bollards","story":"    The trend for beefed up 4x4s and SUVs mean an increasing number of vehicles, like the pictured Land Rover, are now so wide they cannot squeeze through typical restrictions On the plus side, it does mean fewer giant Chelsea Tractors in quiet residential streets and potentially less of them on the school run.But it also means no entry for cheaper but equally musclebound models too, such as the Kia Sedona.The typical width restrictions on British roads are 6’6” and signposted as such on the approach, but many driver yet to experience them may not be aware exactly how wide their own car is.The widest of the lot is the Land Rover Discovery Sport, which s a huge 6’9”, a full two inches wider than the next biggest motor, the Mercedes GLE Coupe. Other cars too wide for the barriers include the BMW X6 and Audi Q7s made before 2015 which are both a fraction above 6’6” and so cannot get through the gap.Oblivious driver commutes to work with a 12-foot python in...Range Rover driver, 37, lands record 172 POINTS on his...Share this articleThose which can pass but only just - leaving half an inch or less of clearance on either side - include the trendy Tesla Model S, Range Rovers in general and even the less fashionable Renault Trafic Passenger.And those which are tight, with a width of around 6’4” to 6’5” include models from Chrysler, Jeep, VW and Porsche, said the Which? report.It added: ‘Many UK roads have width restrictions to prevent large vans and commercial vehicles from using them.With the increasing popularity of SUVs and crossovers, many cars are getting larger.

Two years ago, 115 were planned or under construction. Now it is to be more than 500.London will look like a field of giant stubble. It is the planning philosophy of the Wild West. I have seen no plan published for this proliferation. I suspect there is none. London must accept a tower wherever a developer happens to want one, and can bribe a local council with a few \u0027affordable housing units\u0027 on or near the site.The only bizarre rule is that towers cannot get in the way of selected views of St Paul\u0027s Cathedral, as from Hampstead, the Thames or Richmond Park.Former policies, such as no towers round royal parks, towers clustered only in one or two places and none forming a \u0027cliff\u0027 behind St Paul\u0027s, have all been abandoned. Nor is London alone in England.Manchester is facing a 40-storey slab devoid of any quality beyond monstrosity, backed by the ex-footballers Gary Neville and Ryan Giggs. It will loom over the city centre like something from outer space, while acres of inner suburb lie derelict.          At the turn of the century, there were 30. Two years ago, 115 were planned or under construction. Now it is to be more than 500. Pictured: The Shard next to the River Thames In Bristol, a 26-storey tower is being allowed next to Castle Park, defying a policy of no building higher than nine storeys.A 25-storey tower is proposed for the heart of historic Norwich, as if the city fathers were desperate to outdo William the Conqueror\u0027s famous castle.Since the turn of the 21st century, these towers have been \u0027iconic\u0027 to local politicians. They are viewed as harbingers of wealth, even if much of the wealth is funk money from foreign dictatorships.They are loved by London mayors sated on vanity and virility. Ken Livingstone wanted London to look like Manhattan. Boris Johnson loved towers so much that in 2014 he went to Malaysia and tried to promote the gigantic Battersea power station development as some sort of \u0027inward investment\u0027. He seemed to equate an empty tower block to a machine-tool factory.In the same cause, Liverpool, ten years ago, planned 50 towers, some of them sporting huge wind turbines. Leeds sought two 54-storey towers to signify \u0027civic spirit and economic zest\u0027. Birmingham wanted ten towers, Croydon five.A pillar of luxury flats seemed to embody the new glitzy, glamorous urban machismo. It made your city look like a capital.These structures have nothing to do with housing need or land shortage. Almost all are \u0027luxury residential\u0027 and, at least in London, are investments with few permanent residents.They are at best pied-á-terres. Most estimates are that 60 per cent of prime London sales go to foreign buyers, most of these as so-called \u0027buy-to-leave\u0027.           London will look like a field of giant stubble. It is the planning philosophy of the Wild West, writes Simon Jenkins This means they are not intended for occupation and are often traded \u0027off plan\u0027 before even being built.Yet so dumb is British planning that they are still classed as \u0027meeting housing need\u0027. A tower is a property developer\u0027s \u0027signature\u0027, easy to sell at the investment auctions in hotels in Kuala Lumpur, Singapore and Hong Kong. The Battersea site carries street names such as Malaysia Square to make investors feel comfortable. The towers\u0027 virtue to investors is precisely why they are death to city vitality.They are locked, gated, anonymous and family-hostile. No one is about to care if they are empty or blight their communities.The former City of London planner, Peter Rees, told me he pleaded for new City towers to be offices, \u0027because at least they would be occupied during the day\u0027.In his own Heron Tower, a quarter of the flat keys had never been collected. The 50-storey Vauxhall tower — which even London\u0027s planners rejected until mysteriously over-ruled by then deputy prime minister John Prescott — was recently shown to have just ten per cent of its occupants on the electoral register.No one can tell what may happen to these investments when the current slump in London property prices really bites.Thousands of flats valued at over £1 million must exceed any plausible residential demand.Previous London property bubbles — as in Victorian North Kensington — saw whole neighbourhoods slide rapidly downhill into multi-occupancy and squalor. The view of the property industry is that high service charges will stop this happening.More likely to happen is that, like the palazzi of Venice, the blocks will simply sit decaying as nest eggs for laundered cash.          Many tower blocks in London are not intended for occupation and are often traded \u0027off plan\u0027 before even being built. Pictured: London\u0027s City Hall There is no doubt that smart urban renewal requires higher densities, so as to use existing infrastructure and not spread car-based settlements over surrounding countryside.London boasts the lowest housing densities in Europe, just a quarter of central Paris. But that is because so much of its housing is just three or four storeys, rather than the eight to ten-storey apartment buildings of most cities.Britain\u0027s urban housing is profligate in its use of space. Britons have 2.5 rooms each, as against 1.5 in the Seventies.In London, according to the 2011 census, there were more bedrooms in London than people, a surplus that is accelerating.The reason is high stamp duty and the Eighties abolition of steeply graduated rates. Stamp duty is a tax on transactions of any sort, and discourages older people from downsizing.The way to galvanise London\u0027s housing market is to tax property and end stamp duty — rather than subsidise inefficiency. To this argument, towers are irrelevant.Even if they are full, they rarely offer higher densities than traditional Victorian terraces. Westminster\u0027s absurd, and mercifully aborted, 72-storey \u0027Paddington pole\u0027 had fewer housing units than a rival street-based plan. As for alternatives to towers, there is no mystery. Anyone seeking \u0027high-density, low-rise\u0027 need go no further than to London\u0027s King\u0027s Cross.Here, smart planning has delivered a fusion of old and new, work space and play space, nature and community — at some of the highest densities in London.An American friend gazing at the London horizon from Waterloo Bridge asked me if the mess was all down to corruption.I had to explain that in London planning was so bad it had no need of corruption. Some developers offer \u0027planning bribes\u0027 such as a dribble of cash for a local primary school or a few \u0027affordable\u0027 flats.The reality is that planners and councillors simply lack the guts to stand up to developers, and mayors and ministers give them no incentive to do so.          Yet so dumb is British planning that they are still classed as \u0027meeting housing need\u0027, writes Simon Jenkins. Pictured: Hong Kong-owned Walkie Talkie No other city in Europe would have permitted London\u0027s top-heavy Walkie-Talkie or the \u0027pregnant\u0027 One Blackfriars.Their bulging upper storeys are not meant to be beautiful. They are purely to maximise rents.Tall buildings are conspicuous features of any city and should fit into some coherent urban design.This would be second nature in France, Italy or Germany. Rome is the most corrupt place I know, but even Romans would never do to the Tiber what London has done to the Thames.Londoners entrusted their rulers with a skyline that would have been recognisable to the 18th century Venetian-born painter Canaletto. They will be given back one recognisable only to the American abstract impressionist Jackson Pollock.Some people may like towers as a form of urban sculpture. So be it, but that is no reason for their preference to be imposed on everyone else in perpetuity.Towers are bland if not ugly, and are the enemies of social vitality. They are the opposite of street life, silent stakes driven through a city\u0027s sense of community.They are mere memorials to Britain\u0027s greed for foreign cash in the 21st century, and to a newly philistine public realm.Simon Jenkins writes for the Guardian, in which a version of this article appeared."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/01/01/4CCCE80800000578-5793585-image-m-38_1527814227963.jpg","title":"Campaign build life sized model iconic Lancaster Bomber raises 9 000 target","story":"    The campaign to build a life-sized model of an iconic Lancaster Bomber to honour WWII heroes has raised £10,000 towards the project          The organisation aims to have the memorial ready by Armistice Day this November 2018 and needs around £100,000 to construct the massive work      The bomber that took the fight to Hitler: Fascinating images...The OTHER Battle of Britain: How a \u0027kill team\u0027 trained to...Pictured: Ukrainian arms dealer accused of plotting to...Share this article    The Bomber County Gateway Trust aims to build a full-sized, Lancaster Bomber sculpture on a patch of land next to the A46 on the border of Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire (pictured)          The Bomber County Gateway Trust has been formed with the object of designing, procuring, constructing and installing an iconic landmark art installation on the county border of Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire.

And, you know, his … his sorrows … ” “A white middle-aged American man walking around with his white middle-aged American sorrows?” replies his lesbian friend. “It’s a little hard to feel sorry for a guy like that.” Greer can afford this moment of metafiction because, by this third act of the novel, his hero has won us over, for all that he enjoys most of the blessings of existence.Despite its lampooning of the literary world, Less won this year’s Pulitzer prize for fiction, prompting its publication in Britain. It introduces us to minor novelist Arthur Less as he finds himself abruptly single, having coasted through a studiedly casual not-quite-relationship with a vain younger man for several years. Less is “an author too old to be fresh and too young to be rediscovered, one who never sits\u0026nbspnext to anyone on a plane who has heard of his books”. The younger man, who happens also to be the son of his arch enemy, announces his engagement to someone else.While still not acknowledging to himself that he\u0026nbspwas in love all along and that his heart is cracked, if not quite broken, Less accepts a slew of writerly invitations that conveniently slot together to\u0026nbspprovide a\u0026nbspround-the-world trip. Not only will he thus avoid the wedding, but sidestep the pain of turning 50 in\u0026nbspcompany.The various stages of this journey lend the novel its structure and, as is customary, provide both a parade of colourful characters and a voyage of self-discovery. They also neatly illustrate the scrabble-and-make-do that most freelance writers must resort to in order to survive, all those little jobs that make you feel like an author but that are not quite writing – “the crazy quilt of a writer’s life: warm enough, though it never quite covers the toes”.We first meet him in New York, where he has the humiliation of chairing a huge event for a wildly successful and wildly overrated science fiction writer. His next stop is Mexico, where he must take part in a panel discussion about his former lover’s genius. Then Italy, where an earlier novel of his, apparently brilliant in translation, is up for an obscure but well funded award: a sequence that catches particularly well the artificial camaraderie and false modesty of rivals thrown together for a\u0026nbspprize. And so on to Germany, where he teaches a\u0026nbspwriting course entitled Read Like a Vampire, Write Like Frankenstein. There he has a fling with a\u0026nbspbesotted business student and it is from the intimate details the narrator lets slip about the way Less kisses (“like someone who has just learned a\u0026nbspforeign language and can only use the present tense and only the second person. Only now, only you”) that the reader begins to suspect this story is being told not by some omniscient figure but by a\u0026nbspcharacter in it whom Less has underestimated. And then on to Paris, an ever less romantic journey across the desert in Morocco, a\u0026nbspnightmarish food article he researches in Japan, and\u0026nbspfinally an Indian writing retreat. Here he plans to\u0026nbsppolish the rejected novel to perfection but, as the\u0026nbsppast reaches out to reclaim and challenge him, he\u0026nbspis actually being prepared, we realise, finally to fall\u0026nbspin love.Novels about novelists are always a risk, but Less is about anyone who has allowed their calling to define them at the expense of their humanity.

I read The Hobbit until it fell apart as a child, and have always strived, in my own contributions to the genre, to take even a shred of the care in my world-building that Tolkien did in his. “It is written in my life-blood,” he said of The Lord of the Rings, “such as that is, thick or thin and I can no other.” A rallying cry for anyone who has known what it is to inhabit a world of one’s own.“Tolkien was a genius with a unique approach to literature,” says Richard Ovenden, Bodley’s Librarian at the University of Oxford. “His imagined world was created through a combination of his deep scholarship, his rich imagination and powerful creative talent, and informed by his own lived experiences. We are incredibly proud to hold the Tolkien archive and to be able to share so many previously unseen items in this once-in-a-generation exhibition.”An exhibition, Tolkien: Maker of Middle-earth, is at the Weston Library in Oxford until October. Visiting before it opens, with preparations still ongoing, I must rely a little on my imagination to colour between the lines. We pass the skeleton of what will be the main entrance to the exhibition I am told by its curator, Catherine McIlwaine, that the Doors of Durin will be projected into this dark passageway to welcome visitors.At the heart of the gallery is a model that will chart the routes taken by Tolkien’s characters through the landscape of Middle-earth. As McIlwaine talks me through the items, I find that seeing the exhibition in this liminal state lends an unexpected resonance to the experience. After all, never is a story more alive than when it is in progress. Though many authors have since found great success in his genre, Tolkien, born in 1892, is unrivalled in his reputation as a meticulous creator who knew his world down to the last blade of grass. Today, Tolkien might have come to represent the old guard of fantasy – the “locker room” that the late Ursula K LeGuin once derided. Yet fierce passion for his work endures, and even his harshest critics will concede that few creators have succeeded in building a paracosm that touches the depth of Middle-earth. Every so often, a new offering will stoke the coals of Tolkienmania – Beren and Lúthien was published in 2017, and this August The Fall of Gondolin will expand on another story from The Silmarillion. Meanwhile Amazon has signed a deal for an ambitious TV adaptation of The Lord of the Rings. Throughout my career as a writer, I have found Tolkien to be a source of both self-doubt and inspiration. On the one hand, it can be tempting to give up in the face of his brilliance. He began to invent his first Elvish language when he was a student at Oxford, and eventually built a “Tree of Tongues” – one of the items on display in the exhibition – that charted his constructed languages from source. McIlwaine tells me about a painting Tolkien did when he should have been studying for his finals, of the realm of Valinor. “In 1915, it was all there, already in his head,” she explains. Dwelling on this too deeply could induce an existential crisis. More often, however, the knowledge of how fully Tolkien inhabited his work is a catalyst and a beacon. It fuels me to build larger, to dream weirder and to push harder at the bounds of my imagination.Exhibitions of the Bodleian’s extensive Tolkien collection are rare. Kept in a strongroom with four papyrus scrolls from Herculaneum, the material is tested before and after display and shown in the same womb-like darkness that wraps the Book of Kells in Dublin. Given the importance of preserving the collection, there has been no major exhibition for 26 years. After finishing its run in October, it will travel to New York, then to the Bibliothèque nationale de France. This is the first time the latter will host an exhibition about a foreign author. It is all too easy to believe in the myth of the professor as the one true god of a world he knew in its entirety. The truth, however, is more complex. Tolkien was not always sure of himself. A notebook page reveals that Gandalf once had the Elvish name Bladorthin, meaning grey wanderer. Gandalf, it turns out, was the original name of Thorin Oakenshield. Tolkien flickers between names in the text, as if torn. “He spoke about sub-creation,” McIlwaine says, “and I think this tied into his religious beliefs that all talents and gifts come from God. God is the one creator, and what we do is in imitation of that. Tolkien was a very humble man.” There is abundant evidence of his humility. He was uncertain of his skill as an artist, responsive to criticism, and went out of his way to seek feedback from his friends and children. He could also make the most absent-minded of mistakes – for instance, when he forgot to write his own name on the manuscript title page of The Hobbit.More than 200 items will be on show at the Weston Library, many for the first time – including personal objects donated by the Tolkien family, such as a pipe and a briefcase. Among my favourites is a letter from a fan who has attempted to write a poem in Elvish, which Tolkien has translated and annotated. He was confident enough in his grasp of his world to know when its rules were broken. Rules, after all, are vital in the creation of what he called “secondary belief” in an invented setting – yet he would have been the first to admit that there were uncharted places in Middle-earth.“I don’t desire to go and have afternoons talking Elvish to chaps,” he once said. “Elvish is too complicated. I’ve never finished making it.”Although Tolkien: Maker of Middle-earth will be free to attend, this is the first exhibition at the Bodleian to be ticketed. “I think people are going to be surprised,” McIlwaine tells me. “We don’t know what they will bring with them, but I’d like them to leave with the impression of the whole man and his work – not just Tolkien as the maker of Middle-earth, but as a scholar, a young professor, a father of four children.” In this, I believe McIlwaine has succeeded. I am comforted to have glimpsed the man behind the myth, and I am more inspired than ever by the scope of his creation.The final item I admire is a gathering of patterns in black ink, on the back of a meeting agenda. Its title, written in Quenya, is Parma Mittarion, or “book of enterings”. It was probably intended to be a book cover, but what the book was to contain remains a mystery. Long after I leave the exhibition, my imagination runs wild. I ask myself what Tolkien intended for this book, whether he ever wrote it – either in his mind or on lost pages – and what he could have meant by the phrase “light in the eye”, which he tucked among the decoration. I realise I am beginning to write a story between the lines, and that anyone who looks at the page will perhaps do the same. In this way, Middle-earth will live for ever.• Tolkien: Maker of Middle-earth is at the Weston Library, Oxford, until 28 October. tolkien.bodleian.ox.ac.uk.

They portrayed European countries as morally depraved, harbouring a visceral hatred of Russians. The foreign ministry warned travellers abroad against the risk of being “seized” by vengeful western intelligence agencies.For residents of Russia’s vast heartland – the overwhelming majority of whom have never travelled to Europe – it was a potent and powerful propaganda campaign. Anti-European sentiment rocketed to its highest level since the cold war (the first one, that is). But in Kaliningrad, it was a much harder sell.A little parcel of land smaller than Wales wedged up against the Baltic Sea, Kaliningrad has no common border with Russia, which is almost 300 miles to the east – and unlike most Russians its residents travel frequently to the EU. The city centre is 75 miles from the Lithuanian border, and a mere 30 miles from Poland. At weekends and on public holidays, there are long tailbacks at both border crossings. Gdansk, the nearby Polish port city, is a particularly popular destination.“I travel to Poland a lot and see how people relate to Russians. Everything is fine, there are no problems,” says Alexander, a 35-year-old office worker. “The Poles are people, just like us.” Like many others here, he dismisses the state-run Russian media’s unflattering depictions of European countries as “lies”.Many Kaliningrad residents travel to Poland and Lithuania to stock up on western foodstuffs banned by Putin in 2014 in response to European and US sanctions. Although the quality of Russian-produced cheeses and hams has improved slightly in recent years, there remains a deep hunger for forbidden culinary delights: parmesan, camembert and jamón.“It’s just like when I was a kid in the Soviet Union,” says Alexei Chabounine, the 48-year-old editor of a local news website. “Back then, we used to go to Lithuania all the time to get meat, milk and other things that we couldn’t get hold of in Russia. Of course, there were no borders then.”“They see Europe for themselves and not through a television screen.”That’s not to say that Kaliningrad is a bastion of liberal values. In the compact city centre – a mishmash of Soviet-built flats, public squares and modern shopping centres – it’s not uncommon to see people wearing T-shirts depicting Russian Iskander nuclear missiles, which the Kremlin deployed to the region in February. Local authorities have cracked down on independent media and opposition activists, while NOD, the ultra-nationalist pro-Putin movement that blames westerners for most of Russia’s ills, has a thriving local branch. “Most of these people still go to Poland or Lithuania to do their shopping though,” laughs Chabounine.During the communist era, getting from Kaliningrad to Moscow by land involved nothing more complicated than an overnight train journey through neighbouring Soviet republics. But when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Kaliningrad suddenly found itself cut off from Mother Russia by the newly independent countries of Belarus, Latvia and Lithuania. A decade later, when Latvia, Lithuania and Poland joined the EU, Kaliningrad residents required visas to travel overland to Russia. This sense of geographical isolation is reflected in common expressions: ahead of trips to Moscow, people will routinely say “I’m going to Russia” one local laughed when I pointed out he was already there. On national TV, Kaliningrad is sometimes left off weather maps. The Soviet collapse was the latest twist in Kaliningrad’s strange history. Founded by Teutonic knights in the 13th century, it was previously known as Königsberg, the capital of East Prussia, where Prussian kings were crowned. At the end of the second world war, the city was annexed by the Soviet Union and renamed in honour of Mikhail Kalinin, a Bolshevik revolutionary.After Stalin expelled the ethnic German population, Soviet citizens were shipped in to repopulate it – many were Russian military families who described their move to Kaliningrad as “moving to the west”. Lyudmila Putina, the Russian president’s ex-wife, was born here in 1958. A key outpost for the Soviet military, the entire Kaliningrad region was strictly off-limits to foreigners until 1991.Yet Kaliningrad’s proximity to Europe, and its Baltic port, meant it was exposed to far more western influences than the rest of the USSR. Soviet sailors would bring back clothes, books and vinyl from western Europe and beyond.“People have always likened themselves to Americans – our families all came here from different places across the Soviet Union and created a melting pot with what was practically a new ethos,” says Oleg Kashin, a well-known Russian journalist who was born in Kaliningrad.The defining symbol of that era is the foreboding House of the Soviets, a world-famous example of brutalist architecture. This unfinished 28-storey building, which locals say resembles a robot’s head jutting out of the earth, stands on the former site of the 13th century Königsberg Castle, whose ruins were blown up in 1968 on the orders of Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev. (The area around the House of Soviets will house the fan zone for this summer’s World Cup.)Otherwise, very few of the city’s pre-Soviet buildings survived the twin assaults of an RAF bombing campaign and the Red Army’s three-month operation to capture the city. Today, the most high-profile architectural remains of Kaliningrad’s Prussian past are seven neo-Gothic gates that ring the former city limits, along with the Lutheran cathedral, a redbrick Gothic construction where Immanuel Kant, the German philosopher who died here in 1804, is buried. Souvenir stalls do a roaring trade in fridge magnets reading “Kant touch it” and “Yes, I Kant”. Also for sale: miniature busts of Putin and Stalin decorated with amber, the fossilised tree resin for which the region is famous. As the Soviet past recedes, Kaliningrad is rediscovering its Prussian history: there are calls for the use of alternative Prussian street names and to reconstruct Königsberg Castle.The phenomenon has been condemned by local Kremlin supporters as a sign of “Germanisation”. “It’s infantile,” says a state-media journalist, Nikolay Dolgachev, of the interest in Prussian heritage. “It would be like today’s Americans feeling nostalgic about Native American culture.” Pro-Putin political analysts in Moscow have gone further, suggesting that growing enthusiasm for the city’s Prussian past is a sign of creeping separatism.Critics say the accusations of “Germanisation” are ludicrous. “The term has no basis in reality,” says Dmitry Selin, a former gallery curator. There have been consequences, though. In 2016, the German-Russian House, a local cultural and educational centre, was forced to close down after being declared a “foreign agent”. And earlier this year, an Aeroflot steward was fired after referring to Kaliningrad as Königsberg ahead of a flight from Moscow. “Sometimes,” sighs Selin, “I can’t get help but get the feeling that the authorities want to fence us off from Europe.”For more on life inside the Russian cities hosting the World Cup, visit  Cities or follow on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0fe739585865199faa135c3f9dfdc4c8ca8f5ebf/0_0_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7992304ab2351ccfda3a28844677f6f","title":"revive british city channel 4 north south divide","story":"There is nothing more gauche than Whitehall “being nice” to the provinces. Its attempt to force Channel\u0026nbsp4 to move north from London has felt akin to the Victorian church sending missionaries overseas to civilise the heathen. As austerity descends over museums and theatres across the land, the culture department wants to dispatch a few television executives to live among the natives, to introduce them to kale, quinoa and turmeric lattes. That\u0026nbspshould cheer them up.Whitehall also seems to want to have some fun. No one has instructed Channel 4 where to go. Instead, the provincial cities are told they must line up like children in a workhouse and beg. London will decide who gets the smashed avocado. There will be two consolation “creative hubs” for the runners-up, wherever the judges\u0026nbspcan find something approximating Shoreditch High Street. Whitehall loves these beauty contests. Whether they’re for cities of culture, or the Commonwealth Games, or Michael Heseltine’s “city challenge” handouts, ministers like to bask in the gratitude of the winner, while the losers can slink away to lick their wounds. British regional policy is an\u0026nbspexercise in provincial humiliation.Channel 4 was adamant that it would not move, despite a Tory 2017 manifesto pledge to make it. Now the government has backed down, and less than a third of the staff, just 300, will up sticks. When I heard that Whitehall still wanted a competition, even for what cannot be more than a small office block, I assumed any self-respecting city would tell it to clear off. In the event, Manchester, Birmingham, Bristol, Liverpool, Leeds, Cardiff and Glasgow all formed the usual queue, preening and shouting: “Please, me, me, me.”On one point the government is right. Today’s urban\u0026nbsprenewal is not about manufacturing or traditional\u0026nbspservices but about “creative hubs”. The urbanist Richard\u0026nbspFlorida long ago pointed out that a broad spectrum of creative industries, from education to marketing and design, held the key to bright young people generating wealth in cities. The digital revolution, far from letting them disperse, seemed to require them to congregate, most markedly in older “bohemian” districts. They crammed into San Francisco’s Castro and New York’s Soho, as they gravitated to London’s Shoreditch and Silicon Roundabout. All they needed was\u0026nbspa warehouse, some craft beer and somewhere that day-life fused with nightlife, and every street corner was\u0026nbspa chance encounter. Florida was mocked at the time,\u0026nbspbut he was right.British provincial cities are starting to develop such places. You find them in Manchester’s Northern Quarter, Birmingham’s Gas Street Basin, Sheffield’s Kelham Island and Leeds’s canal-side. They have been underpinned by Britain’s biggest urban growth industry by far: higher education. Today, more people occupy Tyneside’s universities than ever worked in its shipbuilding industry. A graduate school is worth a dozen Channel 4s.Unfortunately, you can bring bright young people to a city, but you cannot make them stay, let alone “create”. Two-thirds of Birmingham’s student population plans to leave on graduation, compared with just a third of London’s. In 2014, economist Jim\u0026nbspO’Neill’s city commission even suggested that graduates who stayed working where they graduated should have their loans repaid. When I met a group of employers in Manchester, their biggest complaint was not a lack of Channel 4, but that all their brightest children wanted to leave for London as soon as possible.The government is right to want to direct some creative energy away from the capital. But Channel\u0026nbsp4 is small fry. Creative hubs are created not by fairy godmothers but by internal combustion. They need to be self-generated economic activity, emerging from a sense of buzz, from contacts creating opportunities. That is why the best thing Channel 4 offered Whitehall was not to move its headquarters but to double its commissioning spend in the provinces. It is not carpet-baggers but contracts that lubricate hubs.And ministers themselves should set an example. They should forget Channel 4 and take themselves out of London while the Palace of Westminster is refurbished. They can commandeer Birmingham city centre or Manchester town hall, bringing with them their aides and acolytes, researchers and journalists. And for the duration they might move the entire Treasury to Stoke-on-Trent. They would suddenly discover there is a Britain out there beyond their ken. I bet the regional imbalance would change overnight."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88ec30010b5fac6aae6a698c1c9fb0120ce388ad/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f945bb3b7ae34c77c7733ec9cd33b09","title":"schools broke class sizes teachers brexit","story":"Soaring class sizes, teaching hours cut, neglected repairs. Brexit has taken attention away from the cost of ideology-driven cutsOsborne primary has an urgent issue: a lack of money. Ofsted rates it as “a good school with outstanding leadership”, and since 2016 its numbers have been expanding: in September 2019 it will take on another new class, but Gay won’t have enough money to pay for a new teacher, so the teaching will be done by existing staff. She says she needs at least 13 classroom assistants to help\u0026nbspchildren who need extra support – not least those who need help with English – but only has 11. The school used to get about £100,000 a year from Birmingham city council and other agencies to pay three staff who work on child protection and supporting parents, as well as counselling children with mental health issues. That money now has to come from the school’s own budgets. So to save £1,500, swimming lessons have been cut back, along with £2,000 worth of music tuition. Gay has explained all this on ITV Evening News and in the pages of the Birmingham Mail, but to no avail.Last year came perhaps the most drastic step of all, when she took the decision to cut the school week by half a day, meaning that most children now go home at 1pm on Fridays. The move still leaves the school meeting its legal requirements for teaching time, but staff now do their planning and preparation work in the hours freed up by children leaving early – which means their classes don’t have to be taken care of and the school saves a precious £35,000 a year. Gay says she took the decision after talking to another headteacher who had done the same now “a couple of other schools in Erdington are doing it and it’s starting to spread across the city”.It says something about life in modern Britain that in response to the change, many parents’ main anxiety was the prospect of their children losing out on a hot meal so it was decided to close the school doors after lunch.In 2014, with his customary revolutionary zeal, the then education secretary, Michael Gove, said he wanted to “see state schools offer a school day nine or 10 hours long”, but that was obviously for the birds. Examples of schools cutting their hours began to surface about a year ago, and have now taken their place in the cacophony of noise about reduced budgets, shrinking staff numbers, and a mess of factors that make things even worse – not least the drive to push local councils out of education and increase the number of academies.At a time when the economy is changing fast and the world of work is being transformed, it would be nice to imagine state schools full of iPads, cutting-edge computer science lessons and coding clubs. But that is not the reality at all. Talking to headteachers over the last week, I have heard about insufficient staff numbers, rising class sizes, rusting minibuses, neglected repairs and curtailed extracurricular activity. It sounds depressingly similar to the experience of those of us unlucky enough to have been educated during the Thatcher years.As with so many things, Brexit has ensured that none of this has acquired nearly enough political traction, even as the picture has become inescapably clear. In late 2016 the National Audit Office said that schools in England would have to make savings of £3bn by 2019-20 in the interests of “financial sustainability”. After the 2017 election it was announced that schools would get an extra £1.3bn over the next two years, though much of the money was taken from their building and repairs budget. Besides, the extra cash only reduces the financial hole identified by the NAO, rather than filling it – and according to the National Education Union, it will leave a total national shortfall of £2.2bn in 2019-20 alone.Meanwhile, as the number of both primary and secondary schools that are running deficits increases, this year the government will take the first step towards a new national funding formula, which redistributes a pot of money – broadly speaking, moving it away from big metropolitan areas and towards smaller cities and shire counties. No one should be celebrating: for many of the schools who nominally benefit, their increases will neither make up for past cuts nor keep pace with rising costs while for those who clearly suffer, it will be another blow. At Osborne primary, it is another source of\u0026nbspuncertainty about the future: right now, all Michelle Gay knows is that in the last year basic per-pupil funding has fallen from £3,071 a year to £2,756.Austerity may have blitzed local authorities, but schools still under their control at least have some kind of financial safety net. However, if a school is one of the 1,600 or so standalone academies, or part of a small chain – or even one of the bigger multi-academy trusts that cannot cope with tight finances – its staff and parents might well find that much-vaunted “independence” actually leaves them in dire trouble. This is part of the reason why academies and free schools have started to hit the wall: an example of one Tory policy threatening to ruin another, which is some measure of the stupidity at work.From any rational perspective, all this looks like the kind of chaos that helps nobody. But, as with austerity in general, there is a clear sense of cuts serving a particular set of rightwing beliefs. What, after all, does an underfunded school system mean in practice?Children with special needs are being pushed out of state schools. The curriculum is being stripped back to its basics. And the stuff that desiccated minds would have you believe is unnecessary guff – art, music, drama – is the first to go. Yet grammar schools will reportedly benefit from a new £50m “expansion fund”.Look closely and you see yet another manifestation of something very familiar: a country with a hacked-back state, where the people in power cling on to a sepia-tinted vision that has nothing to do with the demands of the 21st century, but has a human cost so huge it is becoming almost impossible to measure."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/741429fdc441ac1b33a6747de3c37c3f9b495b89/0_0_650_390/master/650.jpg?w=685\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f11344f1d05afb8ebeecb1c181fd823e 685w","title":"avoiding meat and dairy is single biggest way to reduce your impact on earth","story":"Avoiding meat and dairy products is the single biggest way to reduce your environmental impact on the planet, according to the scientists behind the most comprehensive analysis to date of the damage farming does to the planet.“A vegan diet is probably the single biggest way to reduce your impact on planet Earth, not just greenhouse gases, but global acidification, eutrophication, land use and water use,” said Joseph Poore, at the University of Oxford, UK, who led the research. “It is far bigger than cutting down on your flights or buying an electric car,” he said, as these only cut greenhouse gas emissions.“Agriculture is a sector that s all the multitude of environmental problems,” he said. “Really it is animal products that are responsible for so much of this. Avoiding consumption of animal products delivers far better environmental benefits than trying to purchase sustainable meat and dairy.”The analysis also revealed a huge variability between different ways of producing the same food. For example, beef cattle raised on deforested land result in 12 times more greenhouse gases and use 50 times more land than those grazing rich natural pasture. But the comparison of beef with plant protein such as peas is stark, with even the lowest impact beef responsible for six times more greenhouse gases and 36 times more land. The large variability in environmental impact from different farms does present an opportunity for reducing the harm, Poore said, without needing the global population to become vegan. If the most harmful half of meat and dairy production was replaced by plant-based food, this still delivers about two-thirds of the benefits of getting rid of all meat and dairy production.Labels that reveal the impact of products would be a good start, so consumers could choose the least damaging options, he said, but subsidies for sustainable and healthy foods and taxes on meat and dairy will probably also be necessary. The new research has received strong praise from other food experts. Prof Gidon Eshel, at Bard College, US, said: “I was awestruck. It is really important, sound, ambitious, revealing and beautifully done.” He said previous work on quantifying farming’s impacts, including his own, had taken a top-down approach using national level data, but the new work used a bottom-up approach, with farm-by-farm data. “It is very reassuring to see they yield essentially the same results. But the new work has very many important details that are profoundly revealing.”Prof Tim Benton, at the University of Leeds, UK, said: “This is an immensely useful study. It brings together a huge amount of data and that makes its conclusions much more robust. The way we produce food, consume and waste food is unsustainable from a planetary perspective. Given the global obesity crisis, changing diets – eating less livestock produce and more vegetables and fruit – has the potential to make both us and the planet healthier.”Poore said: “The reason I started this project was to understand if there were sustainable animal producers out there. But I have stopped consuming animal products over the last four years of this project. These impacts are not necessary to sustain our current way of life. The question is how much can we reduce them and the answer is a lot.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f88ca3e300464fcaa1d2b8e283ed3716570c6ca/0_130_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d63b758ec0952db66e69f644f5f3b02","title":"the festival putting edinburgh on the international cycling map","story":"It’s not perfect, but the city has ambitious plans for cycling, and the Festival of Cycling offers a chance to celebrate progressIn theory, Edinburgh might not look like the perfect city for cycling. Apart from the weather there are the (in)famous hills, then there’s the … (add your own excuses here.) But things are changing.The city also hosts the Edinburgh Festival of Cycling, or EdFoC for short, now in its sixth year. A mix of talks, organised rides and workshops, it tries to focus on cycling as everyday transport, as well as sport, a leisure activity and a cultural entity. This year’s edition begins next week.When I first moved to Edinburgh as a mature student, I gave up my car, which at the time felt like a great sacrifice. I thought I’d get another when I graduated. I hadn’t really thought about how I’d get around and had been complaining about getting to morning lectures on time. It was a throwaway comment from my tutor that changed my life – he took his pipe from his mouth (he wasn’t smoking it, the university had just banned that, but still liked to suck it) and said: “Better get yourself a bicycle then.” I have never looked back.Owning a bike opened up the city to me in a way I had never experienced before. Edinburgh is a fairly compact city, with the sea to the north and (even bigger) hills to the south. You soon learn to rely on a range of gears for ascents, and good brakes for heading down again.The city has notoriously fickle and changeable weather, and it is windy. One of my earliest experiences of cycling here was a wind so strong it blew me up a hill, which was fine until I reached a red light. That said, it has about as much sunshine as London, on average, and is one of the driest places in the UK. Plus, in the summer it doesn’t really get dark.Sadly this is a target that Edinburgh currently has no hope of hitting, not least because of the current lack of dedicated cycling infrastructure, limiting access to people of all ages and abilities.Major opportunities to make real improvements have been missed, such as the redevelopment of Leith Walk, one of the city’s primary streets, which is now a mishmash of infrastructure which pleases no one.Will it change? We can only continue to hope and campaign. And until it does, next week’s EdFoC can celebrate all that is great about riding a bike here – or anywhere."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/936ff2c32291263935d784420e37253a82d3c146/90_863_2085_1251/master/2085.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b5df1f78adc62c6caaa5af5d8c8dad7f","title":"the new york pigeon in pictures andrew garn","story":"Andrew Garn is a native New Yorker who grew up surrounded by the city’s ubiquitous pigeons.

Discussions over a two-year deal with an option for a third season are understood to have progressed well, though Chelsea made it clear they would not meet the £7m release clause in Sarri’s contract, which was not terminated when Napoli appointed his successor.That clause expires at midnight on Thursday but, once that deadline passes, the fee to secure Sarri will have to be determined via negotiation. With relations between the Napoli owner, Aurelio De Laurentiis, and Sarri so fractured, the 59-year-old manager has been left in limbo. Napoli are aggressively seeking hefty compensation and his potential new club are far from inclined to pay.In an attempt to shift the impasse Sarri’s lawyers are understood to be scrutinising whether there is a case for constructive dismissal against Napoli and could pursue the issue with Fifa. Chelsea are apparently willing to let them explore that possibility before taking any further action. Conte, meanwhile, has also been left in the dark as to his own future but, if sacked, would be due around £9m in compensation of his own to cover the final year of his contract, if he does not find a new position job in the meantime. His two-year tenure saw the club claim the Premier League title and FA Cup during his two-year tenure only for relations with the hierarchy to become strained over disagreements on transfer policy.Chelsea’s recruitment department, overseen by the director Marina Granovskaia, continue to put in place plans for new players signings which would be green-lighted by the new head coach. There is an interest in Manchester United’s Anthony Martial and Jean Seri at Nice, while and Robert Lewandowski’s apparent desire to leave Bayern Munich has been noted with interest.Just as pressing for the club, however, are the futures of the likes of players such as Thibaut Courtois, who is entering the final 12 months of his contract, and Eden Hazard, together with the record signing, Álvaro Morata on Thursday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92ff421509bcb55dfec357afed08f90a1e2466dc/114_158_1209_725/master/1209.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87a20961247183ee9797d850e57fea24","title":"chelsea shelve stamford bridge investment climate","story":"Roman Abramovich has put a £1bn scheme to redevelop Chelsea’s Stamford Bridge stadium on hold in response to suffering delays in the renewal of his visa to enter the United Kingdom.The club confirmed that plans to transform their home of 113 years into a 60,000-seat arena had been mothballed. A 49-word statement published on their website on Thursday pointed to the “current unfavourable investment climate” as a key factor in their reasoning, yet the Home Office’s delay in renewing Abramovich’s visa, which had expired, is understood to have prompted the owner’s decision to shelve the scheme.Abramovich is apparently reluctant to invest heavily in a major project in the capital of a country where he has been denied a visa. The oligarch, who has been a regular visitor to Britain since buying Chelsea in 2003 but does not hold an employment position at the club, was unable to attend his team’s victory in the FA Cup final at Wembley this month with the process unresolved, and has since secured Israeli citizenship.An Israeli government spokesperson confirmed this week that the 51-year-old was to move to Tel Aviv. Although he would be able to visit the UK visa-free for up to six months at a time on his Israeli passport, Downing Street has confirmed he would not be permitted to work in this country.The Jerusalem Post reported on Thursday that the billionaire had withdrawn his request for a British investor visa, quoting a source close to Abramovich as saying: “He understands and respects that the UK are reviewing their processes and has therefore chosen to withdraw until a new process is in place.” Once a new policy was in place, the source added, Abramovich would “want to clarify any misunderstanding and speculations. He has spent many years in the UK and is a legitimate businessman, nothing has changed.”The issue has flared at a time of heightened tensions between Britain and Russia since the poisoning of the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury in March. Britain has blamed that act on Russia, though the Kremlin denies involvement. Abramovich’s previous tier one visa, which allows anyone who invests more than £2m in the British economy to stay for 40 months, had been granted before tighter regulations were introduced in April 2015. The government has since launched a further crackdown on wealthy investors coming to the UK and, it is believed, would have required some financial disclosures if Abramovich’s UK visa were to be renewed.Chelsea, who finished outside the lucrative Champions League qualification places last season, insist Abramovich remains as committed to the club as ever, and will continue to invest funds for transfers. However, the desire to redevelop Stamford Bridge had been motivated primarily by the prospect of increased match-day revenues, which would allow the Premier League side to be more competitive in the transfer market while complying with Uefa’s Financial Fair Play regulations.The ground’s 41,631 capacity leaves them in the smallest stadium of the current top six given Tottenham Hotspur will return to a redeveloped White Hart Lane next season. In that regard, the decision to put plans on hold would appear to damage the club’s long-term ability to compete financially with the Premier League’s elite.Chelsea had previously explored purchasing the Battersea Power station site and land around Earl’s Court, before opting to transform Stamford Bridge into what the architects, Herzog and de Meuron, described as a “cathedral of football”. Planning approval was received from Hammersmith and Fulham council last year, with the mayor of London Sadiq Khan also giving the green light, and Chelsea had hoped to move to Wembley for up to four years while work was carried out.Costs for the ambitious scheme had escalated wildly, doubling to around £1bn largely because of the time allocated to the build and its complexity. Chelsea had started the process of sounding out banks and blue-chip companies over commercial deals and to seek a potential naming-rights partner, though they would have leant heavily upon Abramovich to fund the project.“Chelsea has put its new stadium project on hold,” the club said. “No further pre-construction design and planning work will occur. The club does not have a time frame set for reconsideration of its decision. The decision was made due to the current unfavourable investment climate.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0e949486c9fa00d16d625d7a98a64a7b836817c/0_114_3424_2055/master/3424.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec84b6c2b6ca7f6b0f56fa0f514fde6e","title":"real madrid mauricio pochettino tottenham","story":"Real Madrid have identified Mauricio Pochettino as the principal candidate to take over as manager after Zinedine Zidane’s surprise decision to walk away.

It is understood the Real president, Florentino Pérez, has anointed Pochettino and has already sought to make contact with the 46-year-old after being caught off-guard by Zidane’s departure.Real are aware Pochettino signed a five-year deal with Spurs six days ago and had believed it contains a clause that allows him to leave. Tottenham insist that is not the case and have also denied the existence of any verbal agreement between the former Eyol and Southampton manager and the Spurs chairman, Daniel Levy, over a potential departure to La Liga.Pochettino’s contract is worth a reported £8m a year, making him the fourth-best paid manager in the Premier League. Before signing, he urged Levy to “be brave and take risks” and it is believed he has been given assurances Tottenham will have money to spend as they prepare to move into their renovated stadium next season.But the lure of moving back to Spain, where he spent eight years as a player before cutting his managerial teeth with Eyol between 2009-2012, may prove too strong to resist."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9bab3e1bfb45be723939577a810760619677e62/187_174_2050_1229/master/2050.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42df209a5c2ff85890c23cf611480975","title":"zinedine zidane real madrid storms","story":"Frenchman did it his way during three seasons in the Bernabéu hot seat and is leaving before his legacy can be spoiled“It might look like a strange moment but it is the right moment,” Zinedine Zidane said. And so, 878 days after taking over as manager and only five since he led them to the European Cup again, he walked away from Real Madrid. During the press conference at which he announced the decision, the president, Florentino Pérez, sitting alongside him wearing a dark suit and a darker look, Zidane was repeatedly asked if things might have been different.Mostly he said “no” and the president too insisted there was no point trying to change his mind. And yet at the very end the Frenchman was asked if he might have stayed had Real lost the Champions League final in Kiev instead of winning it, and that time he smiled.“I don’t know,” he said. “Maybe,” he added, pausing and smiling. “Maybe.” Then he got up, shook the president’s hand and walked through the door at the side of the press room at the Valdebebas training ground. As he went there was applause. Zidane has spent a lot of time there over the last two and a half years, as elegant as he was when he played, and there was something in that smile – familiar, disarming – and in the response.His departure was, Pérez said, “absolutely unexpected” but, while it may sound odd, victory over Liverpool made it easier it helped make it right. “How hard it is to say goodbye to Madrid,” Álvaro Arbeloa commented. “No one ever did it better.”If the question is why did Zidane walk away, the answer is, in part, simple: because he could. This way the decision was his he could control the moment, the way it happened, the feeling as he walked out. He left on his terms and at the top. Remember me like this, a European champion as a manager, just as he was when he played, just as he was when he was the assistant to Carlo Ancelotti. Zidane has never not won the European Cup as manager.“You’re going but your legacy can never be erased,” Sergio Ramos said. The day Zidane took over he was asked what constitutes success. “Winning everything,” he said. Three years on he has. With nine titles in total, one every 16 games on average, this is the most successful period in Real’s modern history. No manager has matched this – even at Real no manager has won three European Cups. It does not get any better.Zidane knew it could have got worse, much worse. He feared it would and he does not like losing. He knows it is remarkable to have reached this point and to have got here with such goodwill, universally admired. Few Real managers have been as well liked by those on the outside.The elegance and the timidity, the grace and the apparently effortless, always hid the fact Zidane saw himself above all as a competitor. When he retired as a player, he later admitted, that he did so earlier than he originally imagined: Real had not won anything for three years, their worst run in half a century, and he felt responsible for that. He was tired of it all, sure, but he might have held on had he not experienced failure from within. “I wanted to transmit serenity, work, commitment,” he said, “but there is a moment when, after three years, it is hard to keep doing what you do. I want to win and, if I don’t see clearly that we’re going to keep on winning, then it is best to change and not do anything stupid.”But there was more to it than that. He knew, too, of the doubts he can never quite shake off, about the precariousness of the manager’s role at the Bernabéu he knew some doubted his weight in all this success – and not just from outside the club. There was something a little pointed when, on the eve of the final, he said: “I’m not the best tactical coach.” He cannot be unaware of the criticisms made of him during a season in which Real finished 17 points behind Barcelona in La Liga and were knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Leganés. That defeat hurt, he admitted it was his “worst moment”.Although he would not reveal the moment in which his mind was made up, he implied the defeat that night was significant. “I felt – I’m not going to say the word, but you know,” Zidane said. “There are complicated moments in the season when you ask: ‘Am I still the right person?’ I don’t forget the hard moments too. There are lovely moments and we ended with a spectacular moment but there are hard moments that make you reflect.” They make others reflect too, he knows.Despite the three Champions League successes he said his finest moment was winning the league title – the closest there is to an objective test. The gap this season was too large. Internally the difficulties were greater than most saw. Zidane talked about the impact Real has on a manager beyond the tranquillity there are difficulties. He was tired but not, he insisted, tired of managing per se. That contradiction felt telling. Perhaps he foresaw difficulties he was gone before any potential storm broke.“I might be wrong,” he conceded, but that is unlikely. There was surprisingly little joy at the end of the European Cup final, a moment marked by Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale saying they wanted to go. Instead it was Zidane who did. Post-game he did not express that, if the decision was already made, which it may well not have been.His resignation came on the morning he was due to talk about planning for the new season. He had resisted signings before, publicly ending the club’s pursuit of the Athletic Bilbao goalkeeper Kepa, and had protected his players, a union built round the dressing room the stability within the squad has been remarkable and has been his but it could not last for ever.This summer would be a significant one, he knew. His voice would be heard but his vote might not be deciding. It was notable the front cover of Marca this week showed four potential signings with the headline: “Do you want them, Zidane?” The wording was not coincidental: if they did not come, it would be his responsibility. Bale and Ronaldo represented another challenge, the chase of Neymar too. The task was significant and not his alone. It is more significant still now.Real were not ready for this Zidane, though, was. “It’s a sad day,” Pérez said. “It’s not a sad day for me,” Zidane said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58dfcfd35bff2e7597d233f9eae0b9f549062190/220_136_1648_989/master/1648.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c61c549fb6014af063d032076d289c5","title":"dark souls remastered review dark fantasy rpg makes glorious return","story":"Playstation 4, Xbox One, PC from SoftwareQ-LOCNamco-BandaiThe action roleplaying game makes a masterful return to LordranDark Souls is such a touchstone for the video game industry that journalists’ constant references to the game have become a meme. Word-of-mouth buzz and a marketing campaign led by the tagline “Prepare to Die” saw Dark Souls become an unlikely hit in 2011. Seven years on, the price is still being paid. There have been two sequels, an endless array of merchandise, an army of writers and video-makers dedicated to dissecting the game’s mysteries and now Remaster.The game is famous for the wrong things. Dark Souls is an inversion of the kind of stories games usually tell. It constructs a meticulous dark fantasy world in which almost everything is trying to kill you. The challenge lies not in conquering it but in surviving it and trying to understand it. It is opaque, even mystical true comprehension always feels just out of reach.For those familiar with the game, playing through again is a stark reminder of just how flabby Dark Souls’ imitators, and even its own sequels, have become. The world of Dark Souls is almost one landmass, with few loading screens, and the way it intricately twists around itself is an architectural feat. The spaces are cramped, the enemies placed like chess pieces. No video game world feels quite so solid, so marvellous to unravel and so plausible as Lordran. A major part of this is the weird and unsettling aesthetic. Lordran is a ruin, an abandoned remnant of what was once the gods’ playground. The bosses can be inscrutable monsters, but more often they are mighty wrecks of eras long gone: a giant wolf guarding her master’s grave two knights standing guard in the throne room of a desiccated reign. Eventually, you’ll meet the greatest minds, the shapers of this world’s history, all mad and feral.Dark Souls’ famed difficulty is improved by the online system, unique to the series, that creates transient connections. You can “summon” fellow adventurers to help you by finding their signs on the ground. When the hurdles seem too much, these companions can heave you over them – and once they have helped you fell a once-terrifying enemy, they too dissipate, wavering in and out. That’s the nice side of online play. On the other, there’s invasions. Most games have multiplayer menus where you choose to pit yourself against others. In Dark Souls, the first you know of an enemy in your world is when they’ve arrived. It is a revolutionary affront. Such enforced fights are the pinnacle of Dark Souls, as other players throw low cunning and every exploitable trick in your face. I’ve stared at someone across a bridge for full five minutes before making a move. I’ve been slaughtered by gangs and I’ve been in that gang. I’ve been invaded by a player called Mr Troll who disguised themselves as a statue and waited by doorway to the boss’ lair for 10 minutes, then instantly killed me and a companion with a spear.This remaster has been handled by Polish studio QLOC rather than the original developer, FromSoftware. It fixes technical issues (the infamous Blighttown seems like a new place), but retains what few gameplay flaws were there in the original. Minor changes to the online system allow more people to play together, and invaders to heal themselves. QLOC has worked assiduously on the sound and visual effects: the audio mix is much clearer than the original, with the ambient noise in Dark Souls’ environments bringing the muttering, encroaching atmosphere to new life. For me, however, the improved visual effects lose some of the ethereal qualities of the originals.Remastered is the version of Dark Souls to get, mainly because it is so active online. This is one of the few video games that saw the medium’s future and tried new things. If you want to visit Lordran and enjoy a straight-up bash-the-baddies quest, then you’ll find no better collection of bosses than this. If a new kind of adventure appeals, however, one in which quick fingers matter less than brains and human cunning, there’s still nothing like Dark Souls. After seven years its mystery has diminished, but it’s still among the best of the best."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b46145bde1595b26a2ef05d1f820f26a09d62622/0_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98fd9eaa0f05550e297ff90e082a7576","title":"myanmar and un announce deal for safe return of rohingya","story":" United Nations says staff will visit Rakhine state in first step towards repatriation of 700,000 refugees camped in BangladeshMyanmar’s government has announced an agreement with two UN agencies for their help in the return of refugees who fled violence in western Rakhine state.About 700,000 ethnic Rohingya Muslims have fled to squalid camps in neighbouring Bangladesh since last August, when Myanmar’s army led a brutal crackdown following insurgent attacks on security posts.Myanmar and Bangladesh agreed in November to begin repatriating the Rohingya, but the refugees expressed concern that they would be forced to return and would face unsafe conditions in Myanmar if the process was not monitored by international aid groups.The government said in a statement that it initialed a memorandum of understanding with the UN refugee and development agencies for their assistance so that verified displaced people “can return voluntarily in safety and dignity”.The UN said in a separate statement that conditions in Myanmar were not yet appropriate for the return but that the agreement would support government efforts to improve the situation. It said the agreement, expected to be formally signed within a week, would provide a framework for the two agencies to be given access to Rakhine state, which has not been allowed since the violence broke out in August. That would allow UN staff to assess the situation and provide information to refugees about the conditions there to help them decide whether to return.Myanmar’s security forces have been accused of rape, killing, torture and the burning of the homes of Rohingya villagers. The UN and the US have described the army crackdown as “ethnic cleansing”.Myanmar has said it will only allow refugees with identity documents — which most Rohingya lack — to return.Rohingya Muslims face official and social discrimination in predominantly Buddhist Myanmar, which denies most of them citizenship and basic rights by not recognising them as one of the country’s indigenous ethnic group."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0426afd25c24c2e0d865a14e2e3c293da8db2d92/0_39_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0df4a8ac83f8523a2e2ac67dd665224","title":"julian assange ecuador president lenin moreno","story":"Assange must follow rules and avoid talking politics on Twitter – otherwise Lenín Moreno says he will ‘take a decision’Lenín Moreno, the president of Ecuador, has said Julian Assange’s asylum status in the country’s London embassy is not under threat – provided he complies with the conditions of his stay and avoids voicing his political opinions on Twitter.“Let’s not forget the conditions of his asylum prevent him from speaking about politics or intervening in the politics of other countries. That’s why we cut his communication,” he said. Ecuador suspended Assange’s communication’s system in March.Moreno’s statements come two weeks after an investigation by the  and Focus Ecuador revealed the country had bankrolled a multimillion-dollar spy operation to protect and support Assange, employing an international security company and undercover agents to monitor his visitors, embassy staff and even the British police.Over more than five years, Ecuador put at least $5m (£3.7m) into a secret intelligence budget that protected him while he had visits from Nigel Farage, members of European nationalist groups and iniduals linked to the Kremlin.Earlier this month, Moreno withdrew additional security assigned to the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where the WikiLeaks founder has remained for almost six years.Moreno has previously described Assange’s situation as “a stone in his shoe” and repeatedly hinted that he wants to remove the Australian from the country’s London embassy.In an interview in Quito, the president said granting Assange Ecuadorian citizenship in December last year had not been his idea but that of the foreign minister, María Fernanda Espinosa. He had delegated all decisions related to the case to her, Moreno told Deutsche Welle.“I told the foreign minister she should, with complete freedom, choose how to solve the problem. And she chose that system. It wasn’t the most suitable, but I respected it,” he said.He denied that external pressure from the United States or any other countries had influenced his government’s treatment of Assange whom he said had “surpassed the limits of freedom of expression”. Assange had tweeted in support of the Catalan independence movement  and challenged the UK’s accusation that Russia was responsible for the poisoning of a Russian former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter.“Liberty must be used with a lot of responsibility,” Moreno said, without confirming whether or not Assange’s access to the internet would be restored.Rafael Correa, Moreno’s predecessor who approved of the operation, defended the security measures as “routine and modest”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/005f17f40e080f04b984b4060ad9f0239e747f02/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f43f40efdba1329350cbb9026163924a","title":"we need to talk aboutveganism","story":"In this monthly podcast,  supporters share their experiences and put questions to a panel of journalists and industry experts.

But his response was ‘This is the UK, sunshine’. It was really patronising – would he have said that to someone not of colour? He was inferring that I wasn’t British.”He then overheard other members talking disparagingly about another candidate of Pakistani heritage in a different ward. Not long after, he heard another party member say “the only good Muslims are Ahmadiyya Muslims”. “That’s like saying the only good Christians are the Coptics,” he says. “It’s insulting to all the others.”While he was not directly racially abused by other party members, seeing Islamophobic comments on local party Facebook groups was common, he says. “It wasn’t a nice experience in the party. Those in the right of the party you felt a sense of being looked down upon, they were patronising you. The whispers weren’t nice at all. But now those same members are very Islamophobic on their Facebook posts, now you see it quite openly.” A party member in the West Midlands says he made a complaint to the Conservatives’ regional headquarters, after an older councillor made a racist remark during a meeting. “It was totally brushed under the carpet they didn’t want to know,” he says. “They just said ‘don’t worry about it, he’s an old man’.”He contacted the Muslim Council of Britain after seeing other complaints about Islamophobia in the party. “When I saw the letter, I thought how refreshing – this is something that all Muslim Conservatives are feeling,” he says. “Only Muslims can feel Islamophobia and only black and ethnic people can feel racism – if you are not black or Asian you are not going to feel it. But they say to you ‘it’s nothing, it’s you, you’re reading too much into it’. But I can feel it, it’s how people look at you when you go to pray, or when you are fasting. It’s in how people talk to you.”When no action was taken over the member who used racist terminology, it made him feel like he was “on the outside”, he says. “My dad has been here for 60 years, but it makes me feel like we are back in the days of Enoch Powell it makes me feel like we haven’t moved on at all.”“It’s a problem throughout the party. It’s rampant because people don’t understand Islam. They think it’s a religion based on terrorism. We don’t think Isis are Muslims. They are a bunch of idiots, we believe they are terrorists like everyone else.”Another councillor did not want to be named because he believed it would be political suicide. “They’d put me under a bus for speaking about it,” he says. He feels his progress in the party has been blocked because of his religion. “It was fine in the local party until I showed some ambition,” he says.After he pushed to advance in the party, barriers suddenly appeared and he was made to feel like his face did not fit, he says. “They use terms like ‘the right sort of candidate’,” he says. “I sometimes wear a skull cap and people came to me and said that the local party leader had said that I looked too Muslim and I wouldn’t be accepted.”He says he has complained about the issue, but feels he cannot push it any further. “You mention Islamophobia and they run for the hills. The problem is too many people have too many friends in high places, so nothing is ever done about it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/728fdf1e21aa5ff94a3716749e4e57ad292d4d96/418_64_3152_1892/master/3152.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc3cf526e924f2f410aad0c94eceb536","title":"england pakistan second test headingley bayliss","story":"The Headingley Test has become a spicier match than was ever anticipated at the start of the summer. England were so dire at Lord’s, so emphatically beaten by the side ranked No 7 in the world, that the calls for upheaval will reach a deafening level if England lose again in Leeds.Suddenly jobs are at stake. Another defeat and there will be more demands for heads to roll. The usual reaction and the one that is familiar whenever a football side are losing is simple: sack the coach. In any case, in this instance, it is Trevor Bayliss’s turn. Joe Root was appointed captain only 15 months ago Ed Smith, the national selector, one month ago. If England slump again, Bayliss is most obviously in the firing line.The fact that cricket operates in a completely different way from football will be ignored as this inconveniently muddies the waters. In football the managercoach makes all the major on-pitch decisions and the results dictate whether he stays or goes. Apply those principles to the current situation with the England cricket team and there is scope for confusion.England are ranked the best side in the world in ODI cricket so coach Bayliss must be brilliant England will be ranked No 7 in the world in Test cricket if they lose at Headingley, so coach Bayliss must be hopeless.Something does not tally. The two forms of the game are not so radically different that a coach can be excellent when there is a white ball and execrable with a red one. In reality England’s plight demonstrates the limitations of the coach in cricket. To a large extent his success is dependent on the quality of the personnel at his disposal. Currently England have discovered some dynamic, confident cricketers, intuitively led on the field by Eoin Morgan in one-day cricket, but their Test team is nowhere near as well endowed.There are pragmatic reasons why ditching Bayliss as the Test coach is fraught with difficulty. For a start, who would sack him? Theoretically that is the job of the cricket director, who is Andrew Strauss, but he is on compassionate leave and has just been replaced by Andy Flower. Can the locum take such a major decision, especially when he would be a candidate to plug the gap in any interregnum?Tom Harrison, the chief executive of the England and Wales Cricket Board, could intervene, though he already has a hundred problems mounting up on his desk.So there would be huge relief at the beleaguered ECB if England could square the series at Headingley but there is no guarantee of that, especially since the fitness of Ben Stokes is in doubt. There is constant talk of his totemic presence within the side, though in blunt figures his contributions in the three Tests he has played since his enforced absence are modest – 150 runs at an average of 25 and three wickets.However, Stokes bowled with vigour at Lord’s and at least he looked as if he was going to score runs. There is the possibility that he could play at Headingley as a batsman only, which would not be good news for Dawid Malan.The call-up of Sam Curran, Surrey’s left-handed all-rounder, as cover for Stokes is another bold selection. He is only 19 but is twice as experienced as Dom Bess since he has played 38 first-class matches as opposed to 17 and, unlike Bess, he has been among the wickets this season, taking 10 at the Oval against Yorkshire, including that of Root. Like his older brother Tom, Sam does not give the impression that he is easily overawed. He has steely eyes. As a bowler he lacks pace and height but he does have the capacity to swing the ball back in to the right-handers, which on his day can deliver lbws.His method recalls that of Mike Smith, the Gloucestershire left-armer, who played his solitary Test at Headingley in 1997 against Australia. A catch was dropped by Graham Thorpe in his third over, Matthew Elliott made 199 and Smith ended up wicketless. It was just about the only day that season that Smith was unable to get the ball to swing. Curran, who is also a promising batsman well beyond Smith’s capabilities, will hope for better luck if he plays.If Stokes is sidelined or unable to bowl and Curran is selected, then the chances of Chris Woakes replacing Mark Wood are enhanced, partly because this would strengthen the batting. The idea of playing Wood ahead of Stuart Broad is eye-catching but highly unlikely to happen. The principle of ensuring that none of the senior players takes his place for granted is sound but in these volatile times this is probably not the case. Everyone is on edge.In fact, for England to prevail it is the batsmen who must start to deliver. The fresh-faced Keaton Jennings is recalled – and perhaps he can go to forward short-leg rather than Root, who has enough to do – to rejoin Alastair Cook, who is playing his 154th consecutive Test, a world record.Meanwhile, Pakistan’s only selection issue is how to replace the unfortunate Babar Azam, who has a broken bone in a forearm. Usman Salahuddin is, therefore, likely to make his Test debut in the middle order."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/638f1512cf89111080622f2b3a99cc7ab202d83f/20_68_2573_1544/master/2573.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c2a71662373d03c9ee1adc2ef9e60f97","title":"typing the1975com into google app weirdest glitch android app bug easter egg reddit","story":"Is this strange Android app bug an Easter egg?

Where, a century earlier, the deluxe Rector’s restaurant once prepared lobster “sixteen different ways at a dollar apiece”, Bubba Gump Shrimp Co now serves its seafood to New York’s visitors with a “boat size bucket of fries” on the side.The Great White Way – nicknamed in the early 1900s for its dazzling electric lights – feels dispiriting here at its epicentre in the raw light of day. Fran Leadon, the author of a new history of the street that tells the story of modern America, almost visibly recoils from a fancy dress Batman as we pick through the aimless herd.Broadway is still global shorthand for bright lights, big city – and even though modern Times Square is underwhelming by day, it is a garish explosion at night. Right now, global stars including Bruce Springsteen, Denzel Washington and Glenda Jackson compete with musical revivals of My Fair Lady, Carousel and Hello Dolly! as well as a newly-arrived Harry Potter extravaganza.The spectacle is gaudy, but sits well in the tradition of the theatre district, which Leadon writes in Broadway A History of New York City in Thirteen Miles always provided a “delirious exaggeration of American culture”. This is the street that drove America forward – the Path of Progress as it expanded north, powered by showmanship and illusion.“There is a mythology about Broadway that we take for granted,” Leadon says. “The Great White Way, the crossroads of the world, the theatres, ticker tape parades, all these public displays. I had always thought that mythology came from the street, from all the things that were there and the things that had happened there.“I think what I have concluded is that it was the opposite – which is much more interesting – this community, especially of business types, kind of invested in this mythology. They wanted the street in New York, in the country, to be powerful, to be magical, to be creative, and everything that followed was fulfilling that desire to have it be this mythical place.”Starting at the southern tip of Manhattan, like the island’s spine, Broadway has held the city together and sometimes been its fault line. It has witnessed riots, police beating crowds of protestors, the symbolic downfall of a colonial monarch and the rise of the first US president.Wild, brawling men and outrageous, over-inflated showmen have been venerated there, office workers have greeted presidents, war heroes, sports stars and astronauts with signature ticker tape parades.“From the beginning, it was the economic engine of the city, it was the thing that was pointing the way towards the city’s development,” Leadon said. “Broadway was always the place where things happened first: the first theatre the first really big hotel all the main churches. It was originally where all the big mansions were, downtown. It was always the big incubator for the city.”The 80-feet wide muddy, early 17th century route to drive livestock through the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam was named Brede Wegh – Broad Way – and when the British took over, it was Anglicised and conjoined to become Broadway.It remained a filthy mess, hogs foraging in the street, Caribbean pirates in the taverns. Less than a mile long, and, from an early stage, a physical expression of inequality – the east side developed by artisans and tradesmen was known as the shilling side, and the west, owned by Trinity Church, was the wealthy dollar side.“Since it was the main gathering place in the city, it was where everything came together, so the wealthiest people in the country, but also the poorest and the native born, old Dutch families, but also the newer immigrants, slave-owner and slave,” Leadon said. “It’s always been representative of this gap between wealth and destitution and as the city developed, it just got wider and wider and wider, but it was there from the very beginning.”The panic of 1837, a financial crisis which triggered recession, led to crowds of destitute men and women lining up for bread and firewood. Today, the midtown stretch is still a haven for homeless people, slumped on sidewalks and public squares.Broadway charts the American story. When General George Washington sailed into New York in 1776, he took over an almost abandoned city after British forces fled. After the first copies of the Declaration of Independence reached New York, on the night of 9 July, Washington read it aloud to his troops, who rushed down Broadway to Bowling Green. “Ropes were thrown around the gilded statue of George III and, following a series of hopeful cracking noises, king and horse hit the ground.” The statue was hacked up and its lead melted down to make bullets to use against the British redcoats.In 1790, as the first president of the United States, Washington briefly moved into 39-41 Broadway, but by the time Government House was finished, in 1791, New York had lost the capital to Philadelphia.Fears of inferiority drove progress and sent Broadway extending north, in spite of the hard-to-tame marshlands, eventually erted underneath modern day Canal Street. Leadon said the idea was: “ ‘If we spruce up the city a little bit, maybe we can look like Philadelphia … we need better architecture to start to compete with Philly and Boston and become the main American metropolis’.”Money and grand homes shifted north, fashionable stores followed, offices and hotels came in behind and pushed the theatres north, too.By the time AT Stewart \u0026amp Co opened a “marble palace” of a dry goods store in the 1840s, Broadway had seized commercial dominance as the place to get the first pick of Paris fashions arriving by ship from Europe. Shopping and promenading became a cultural phenomenon.The visiting Charles Dickens arrived on Broadway and was dazzled, writing: “We have seen more colours in ten minutes, than we should have elsewhere is as many days. What various parasols! What rainbow silks and satins!”The 1850s brought a hotel boom – the St Nicholas was celebrated as the largest and most elegant in the world – but the fashionable advance was also accompanied by prostitution, and violent gangs who fought epic battles. William Poole, immortalised as Bill the Butcher – champion boxer, butcher, rightwing anti-Catholic, anti-immigrant politician – died a lingering death after he was shot in a hotel bar brawl. Broadway drew crowds of 100,000 to see an open hearse drawn by four white horses, cloaked in black, with white plumes on their heads lead a procession of 4,000 people to his Brooklyn burial ground.By the 1870s Central Park was nearing completion – built as a haven from noise and overcrowding, an answer to the great green spaces of European cities, such as London’s Hyde Park. And Broadway took off north again – the sixth and seventh miles up to 106th Street becoming more like a wide European boulevard. “By then,” Leadon said of the expanding metropolis, “they are thinking, ‘we need to look like Paris, we need to compete with the European cities’... Philadelphia was long ago vanquished and they were trying to compete with London and Paris.”Electric light arrived in 1880, and the first electric billboard in 1892, at the site where the Flatiron would spring up a decade later. Probably the most audacious early ad was at 38th Street in 1910 – 72ft high and 90ft wide and “inspired by the long-running Broadway hit Ben-Hur, featured a moving chariot race complete with galloping horses and cracking whips, animated by an ingenious sequencing of 20,000 incandescent bulbs that flashed on and off 2,500 times a minute.”The most enduring, unique landmark to Broadway’s heyday, built in 1902, still stands today, like an ocean-going liner at the narrow point where Broadway meets Fifth Avenue at 23rd Street. The ‘freak building’ as it was described, better known as the Flatiron, was a futuristic skyscraper, built from steel, clad in limestone, brick and terracotta tiles. It was modelled after the giant American Imperialism structures of the Chicago World’s Fair, but madly compromised by its sharply triangular plot. It became known as hurricane corner as winds played havoc with hats and women’s hemlines. Cops arrested men who gathered to gawp, and a magistrate ruled in the case of a French tourist, that “two minutes is a reasonable time ... and you can use your eyes but at the end of that time you must move on”.By miles 12 and 13, Leadon says, “the past is a little closer to the surface”. Farmland was not really developed until the subway got there in the early 20th century Inwood Hill Park at the top of Manhattan still has overgrown foundations of old ‘Gilded Age” mansions in the woods. John F Seaman’s 19th century marble house had 25 rooms, an observatory and a swimming pool. The entry gatehouse was a scaled down Arc de Triomphe. “Today almost nothing is left,” he writes, but “tucked behind an auto body shop on the west side of the street between 215th and 218th streets, Seaman’s Arc de Triomphe still peers out at the street, covered with graffiti and gradually succumbing to the weight of time”.Today, the pattern of flatten and replace goes on. As he walked north from Flatiron, Leadon gasped as he reached 28th Street and saw another building being razed. “That’s the last vestige of the old Broadway of the 70s and 80s, marginal discount stores full of trinkets, wig stores buying and selling human hair. Weird, weird stuff.”He sounds regretful, almost as if a tiny part of his book is already out of date. But as he records, on Broadway it was always this way money drives everything forward. As journalist Junius Henri Brown put it in 1868: “Broadway is always being built, but it is never finished.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c58cff3ff722ff107a67700afd3079da8fcac845/0_89_5275_3165/master/5275.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ffa52028da7ee6eb3bf74ecedbc85b1","title":"pedro sanchez from economics professor political trailblazer","story":"Leader of PSOE party poised to make history by becoming prime minister of SpainBarring any of the last-minute upsets that have come to characterise politics in Madrid and Barcelona lately, Pedro Sánchez will make history on Friday by becoming the first Spanish politician to unseat a prime minister through a motion of no-confidence.That would be remarkable enough in itself, but the socialist leader’s looming victory over his old foe Mariano Rajoy is extraordinary for two other reasons.Not only is the 46-year-old former economics professor no longer an MP, it is also less than two years since he was unceremoniously defenestrated as party leader over his refusal to facilitate Rajoy’s return to office following two inconclusive general elections.Still reeling from a string of awful results and angered by Sánchez’s hardline position on the corruption scandals engulfing Rajoy’s People’s party, half of the PSOE’s executive committee launched a coup that prompted his resignation in October 2016.Sánchez reacted to the rebellion by giving up his seat and announcing a road trip to reconnect with disgruntled socialists across Spain. “I won’t go against my party or against my electoral promises,” he said.“On Monday I’ll get in my car and travel all round Spain to listen to those who haven’t been listened to, to the grassroots members and left-wing voters.”His spell in motorway cafes and the political wilderness paid off. Seven months later, he stood again for the PSOE leadership and cruised to an easy victory over his main rival Susana Díaz, the president of the PSOE stronghold of Andalucía.Sánchez, who was born in Madrid in 1972, joined the PSOE in 1993. After studying economic and business sciences at Madrid’s Complutense university, he picked up the first of three master’s degrees at the Free University of Brussels and worked in the European parliament. In 1999, he served as chief of staff to the UN high representative to Bosnia during the Kosovo conflict. That was followed by stints as a self-employed consultant for foreign businesses, an economic adviser to the PSOE’s federal executive committee, and five years as a Madrid city councillor.He was an MP between 2009 and 2011, when he lost his seat and headed back to academia. In 2013, he returned to parliament and was elected PSOE leader the following year. He is married with two daughters.On Thursday night, Sánchez stood poised to replace Rajoy as prime minister. As luck would have it, the Spanish constitution smiles on the seatless: prospective PMs need only be Spanish and over the age of 18.Less fortunately, his time in office is likely to be turbulent. His government will probably struggle to accommodate the myriad and very different demands of the parties that backed his motion as it prepares to hold the general election he has promised. It will also have to deal with the issue of Catalan independence, a matter routinely described as the worst political crisis to hit Spain since it returned to democracy following the death of Franco four decades ago.Sánchez is a passionate basketball fan and player, and unlike Rajoy he is also a keen linguist who says his time abroad helped him polish up on his English and French.He will need a good turn of speed, as well as phrase, as he becomes only the second prime minister to negotiate Spain’s new political landscape.The emergence of the anti-austerity Podemos and the centre-right Ciudadanos has threatened 40 years of PSOE and PP rule by capitalising on the anger of Spaniards over the economic crisis and the corruption of the political classes.Add to that the secessionist threat from Catalonia and the PP’s anger over being thrown out of government after seven years, and Sánchez’s honeymoon looks likely to be a short one."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48bb70ee0810ef07b41bb2666f279ef9c31cf87c/582_179_3418_2052/master/3418.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6161c42882122364115d38773660e492","title":"us spends 250m upgrade de facto embassy taiwan china","story":"Opening of American Institute in Taipei this month likely to provoke ire of ChinaThe US is preparing to open a new de facto embassy in Taiwan, with speculation over who will represent Washington at the ceremony almost certain to enrage China.The renovated American Institute in Taiwan will open on 12 June, and is likely to be overshadowed by a possible summit between Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore. But the potential for senior US officials, possibly at the cabinet level, attending the ceremony for the $250m facility has raised eyebrows in Beijing.The new compound represents a significant upgrade in US relations with Taiwan, and the opening ceremony comes at a time when Beijing has taken an increasingly hostile stance toward the democratic self-ruled island of 23 million people.China considers Taiwan a breakaway province, despite never having fallen under Communist control, and Beijing has not ruled out using force to unify Taiwan with the mainland. President Xi Jinping has sought to isolate Taiwan on the international stage after elections in 2016, blocking its participation in international bodies such as the World Health Organization and poaching diplomatic allies. “This new, not inexpensive building signifies a strong and enduring American commitment to the island and its people,” Richard Bush, former chairman of the American Institute in Taiwan, wrote recently.The Trump administration should “seize opportunities to signal its opposition to China’s punitive tactics”, Bush wrote. “Sending a senior US official is one of those opportunities.”But the ceremony comes at a complicated time for US foreign policy. While Trump is taking an aggressive stance toward China on trade, he ultimately needs Beijing’s cooperation for any lasting deal to denuclearise North Korea. Under the “One China” policy, the US switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in 1979, but maintains informal relations with Taipei and is required under by law to help provide for the island’s defence.

Trump broke with decades of diplomatic protocol when he spoke directly to Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen, shortly after winning the election.He also signed a law that encouraged high-level delegations from Washington to travel to Taiwan, while also inviting senior politicians from the island to travel to the US.

Though immobilised, the rhino is conscious. So, once it has been moved into the right position by a team on the ground, foam earmuffs and a blindfold are placed on its head to reduce stress levels.After marking the ideal cutting point to avoid damaging the living growth plates at the base of the horns, Toft fires up a chainsaw and slices both of them off.Those magnificent horns, which have helped to protect this species for millions of years, are the reason that more than 7,000 rhinos have been killed in South Africa in the past decade. A persistent human desire for rhino horn – for everything from traditional medicine to hangover cures or status symbols – drives the slaughter of more than 1,000 of the animals each year in the country that has the largest rhino population in the world.News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theWorldwide, the situation is grave. The northern white rhino became functionally extinct after the death of Sudan, the last male, in March, while the black rhino population is down to about 5,200. The situation for Asian rhinos is equally bleak: there are just 3,200 surviving Indian rhinos, about 76 Sumatran rhinos and 60 Javan rhinos. There are fewer than 30,000 rhinos globally, with Africa’s southern white rhino the most populous species at about 20,000.These alarming figures have driven wildlife managers in several South African reserves to take the drastic step of sawing off hundreds of horns every year, before criminal syndicates can get their hands on them. With the poachers’ prize removed, the risk to the hornless animals is greatly reduced.Toft has removed close to 1,800 horns from 900 rhinos in the past three years in KwaZulu-Natal, which has been heavily targeted by poachers. Both Galliers and Toft acknowledge that dehorning is not a permanent or ideal solution to the crisis. “This is not something we want to do. It’s expensive and invasive but we believe it is a necessary evil,” says Galliers, noting that it costs about £580 to safely dehorn a rhino.The cost is based on the hiring of helicopters and skilled vets. Galliers, also head of the anti-poaching initiative Project Rhino, points out that dehorning must be repeated every 18-24 months as the horns regrow naturally.Even then, there have been cases of dehorned animals being shot for their stumps. Toft has developed a method of removing as much horn as possible without causing pain to the rhino or damage to its growth plates. The horn is removed to about three finger widths from the base, then the stump is further trimmed around the edges with an angle grinder, enabling the removal of an extra 2kg of horn on a large bull.The operation is noisy and violent, but there is no blood – and Toft insists it is no more painful than trimming your fingernails if done correctly.Galliers and Toft believe dehorning could help save rhinos under threat elsewhere in Africa and Asia. But the cost means that might only be possible in small and medium-sized reserves. Dehorning only selected bulls is not an option, as those without horns would be more vulnerable in territory fights. In parks where the entire rhino population is dehorned, all bulls are placed at equal disadvantage. But dehorned rhinos can still fend off lions by using their considerable bulk as a weapon, Toft says. For trophy hunters, the aim is to acquire both the head and the horns. Many other horned animals are hunted: elephants are slaughtered for their ivory, but Toft does not think detusking is a solution. Tusks are partially hollow and contain sensitive roots and nerves. Although it would be feasible to remove the solid portion, a large volume of tusk would have to remain intact, which could still attract the attention of poachers. Tusks are also essential tools for elephants to strip tree bark or dig up succulent roots and tubers.For now, dehorning appears to be achieving success as an emergency measure, buying time while the decades-old debate continues about how to end the demand for rhino horn.This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

The relatively unknown law professor met Mattarella late on Thursday night to put forward a list of ministers, which the president has accepted.“All the conditions have been fulfilled for a political, Five Star and League government,” said Luigi Di Maio, the Five Star chief, and Matteo Salvini, the League leader, in a joint statement after a day of talks in Rome.The deal will bring at least temporary calm to a political crisis that has embroiled Italy for weeks. The tumult raised questions – in Brussels and among investors around the world – about whether the rise in Italian populism and the collapse of traditional parties posed a fundamental threat to the country’s future in the eurozone.The formation of the new government will at least temporarily allay those concerns, because it will remove for now the threat that snap elections will be called later this summer, a prospect which worried investors because it could have bolstered support for anti-EU parties.The populist leaders stepped back from their insistence that Paolo Savona, an 81-year-old Eurosceptic, should serve as finance minister. The choice had been vetoed by Mattarella, prompting the M5S and the League to call off their deal. Savona will now serve as EU minister instead.But there are still many unknowns about how the new administration – an uneasy alliance between two former political opponents, both jockeying for power – will govern Italy.Salvini, the bombastic and xenophobic leader of the League , who rose in recent years on the back of incendiary and racist statements about migrants and Roma, will take on the role of interior minister. Salvini has campaigned on the promise of mass deportations of migrants and said a new government would build detention centres around Italy. He is also a fierce critic of Brussels and has called for closer ties to Russia.Di Maio will take on a powerful new post that will combine labour and industry portfolios in a move that could mark big changes to labour and environmental policies, given the M5S’s stated opposition to big industry.Giovanni Tria, a little known economics professor, was named to lead the finance ministry. While Tria has been critical of the EU, he is not been seen as an advocate for an exit from the eurozone.The new deal was blessed by Mattarella, who earlier this week nominated a technocrat, Carlo Cottarelli, to serve as prime minister. Those plans were put on hold after Mattarella opted to give the populists more time to reach a new agreement.The new government is expected to take a far more antagonistic stance against Brussels than the previous government, headed by the centre-left Democratic party. But the alliance between the M5S and the League will have only a relatively narrow majority in the Italian senate, easing concerns among investors and officials in Brussels over the new government’s decision-making. While both parties are populist in nature, and have railed against Brussels and Italian “elites”, they have long been natural opponents in politics.Wolfango Piccoli, the co-president of Teneo Intelligence in London, said: “They are both led by young and ambitious leaders who share prime-ministerial ambitions. Due to mutual distrust, it has taken both parties over 70 days to reach a deal and choose an unknown third figure as prime minister.”Their shared agenda includes plans to cut taxes, scrap a previously agreed pension plan and institute a “universal basic income”.While many officials in Brussels sought to ease tensions with Rome this week, and backed Mattarella after the president took a political risk by defending Italy’s role in the EU, Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, issued a tough critique of Italy on Thursday. He said Italians needed to work harder, be less corrupt and stop looking to the EU to rescue the country’s poor regions.“Italians have to take care of the poor regions of Italy. That means more work, less corruption, seriousness,” Juncker said. “We will help them as we always did. But don’t play this game of loading with responsibility the EU. A country is a country, a nation is a nation. Countries first, Europe second.”Additional reporting by Daniel Boffey in Brussels"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9a299c70aadf48bdb401e78c867a39501d04cb0/858_1114_4458_2675/master/4458.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c46f77dd122a0cea19121da54fb4437","title":"mumbais summer camp for budding athletes in pictures","story":"Each summer, students attend the Shree Samarth Vyayam Mandir physical education institute in Mumbai, a training facility for the athletes of tomorrow"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Minister\u0026rsquos plan is revision of UK\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquomaximum facilitation\u0026rsquo suggestion, source tells \u0026lsquoThe Sun\u0026rsquoGarda\u0026iacute appeal for information on murder of teenager in Dunleer, Co LouthJack Kenneally and Shay Moloney got into difficulty while swimming outside EnnisWarsaw casts doubt on State\u0026rsquos system for appointing judges amid extradition rowThe woman told a hearing her son threw a crutch at her and she is afraid to go homeAppointments delayed by Betty Purcell\u0026rsquos challenge to the selection processState has known about falsification of babies\u0026rsquo records for well over 60 yearsCharleton tribunal investigating alleged smear campaign against Garda whistleblowerCoalition to justify decision not to spend all the money available to it in October\u0026rsquos budgetAgency says it does not have the \u0026lsquoremit\u0026rsquo for such an audit amid birth registration scandalMother of Shane O\u0026rsquoFarrell dismissed Ombudsman\u0026rsquos report as \u0026lsquoinadequate\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquounsatisfactory\u0026rsquoThe agency has advised survivors to make final applications before August 1stThomas J Mace-Archer-Mills opined on Meghan Markle for several media outletsFigures disclosed in parliamentary answer to Fianna F\u0026aacuteil\u0026rsquos Michael McGrathAppeal for witnesses as suspects being held at Ballyfermot and Ronanstown stationsRoyals to take in Liberator\u0026rsquos home at Derrynane during their three-day trip to IrelandOne of the men pretended to be a 16-year-old girl which led to child pornography charges"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3515424.1527793847!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ana kriegel beautiful sometimes cheeky but always loving","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe funeral of Ana Kriegel takes place at Newlands Cross Crematorium. Photograph: Stephen CollinsCollins PhotosAnastasia Kriegel’s death notice was clear in its instruction.“Ana loved sparkle and colour,” it said. “The family wish for the dress code to reflect this.”And so they came on Thursday, to Newlands Cross Crematorium, close to 1,000 family and friends to say their goodbyes to the 14-year-old girl who was adopted from Russia aged two and who sang, danced, laughed and cuddled her way into their hearts.But it was Ana herself who sparkled brighter than anyone throughout the civil funeral service, one that was devoid of the usual religious obsequies but was brimming with love, memories and many, many tears for a life cut cruelly short.“None of us wants to be here this afternoon,” said the celebrant, Padraic Cawley, “none of us wants to say goodbye to Ana for the last time. We are all numb, confused and very angry and bewildered that such a thing has happened to the most beautiful, caring, kind, strong willed, crazy, sometimes cheeky but always a loving princess.”The glittering, bubbling life celebrated in the austere, circular crematorium setting seemed so terribly far removed from the one that ended in an abandoned and derelict Lucan farmhouse on May 14th and in relation to which another child has been charged with murder.The little girl from Russia loved her dancing, her music, her fashion, swimming, dogs, her heritage, her annual holidays in France. What words could anyone use, asked Mr Cawley?“There are no words,” he said in answer.But while the occasion was one of great sadness, it was also an opportunity to celebrate a short but very full and colourful life.The choir of Confey Community College, which Ana attended, sang A Million Dreams, from the musical, The Greatest Showman — “A million dreams is all it’s gonna takeA million dreams for the world we’re gonna make” – and Ana’s dancing friends from Dance LA of Leixlip, red headscarves tied up into bows to hold their hair up, and all wearing silver sequined wristbands, provided a guard of honour.Many were in tears as Ana’s coffin was walked in past them, weeping that for many continued throughout the service of reflection.The Russian ambassador to Ireland,Yuri Filitov, paid his respects to Ana’s grieving parents, Geraldine and Patrick, lingering with them, holding hands and whispering comfort.Young relatives brought symbols of Ana’s life. There was the flag of Russia which they laid open on her dark wood coffin. There was a matryoshka doll, like the one Geraldine and Patrick used to hold a photo of baby Ana which they handed to family friends, the surprise inside announcing an imminent arrival in Leixlip of the then 2½-year-old who later liked to announce proudly that she came from Siberia. There were Ana’s headphones a photo of Eddie, her favourite dog and a model of the Eiffel Tower symbolising her love of France and the annual family holidays spent there with Patrick’s relatives. There was a memory box filled by the students of Confey College and finally, Ana’s outfit from Dance LA.Ana embraced life with both hands, said Mr Cawley. But inside Siberian warrior Anna, as she liked to style herself, was also a little girl who loved to cuddle up in her pyjamas with her Mum on a Sunday “watching some beautiful fairytale princess movie while munching her favourite food, popcorn”.This was what she and Geraldine had done on Sunday, May 13th – the day before everything changed.“Life is so, so fragile,” said Mr Cawley. “It is a privilege and tomorrow is never promised to any of us... So live every day as a blessing, an opportunity and leave nothing behind.”Ana’s aunt Jan remembered Ana’s exuberance as a child, delighting in water – first the family shower, then swimming in the lake. She loved to perform for her family, dancing and singing for them she wanted to be a mermaid and Santa Claus obliged – a photograph on screen showing a pretty girl in an orange mermaid outfit, posing stretched out on a sofa.“She just loved it and as far as she was concerned, it was the most natural thing to be dressed in on Christmas morning,” said Jan.And as the delightful, pretty child blossomed into a beautiful teenager, the love of display took on new forms, the latest being a dalliance with goth sub-culture. Ana mused one day with the notion of getting some piercings, much to the anxiety of her mother who suggested that delaying a little would be a good idea.Ana responded, said Jan: “You’re always tell me to be myself Mam and this is me!”Through further memories from close family friend Catherine Murphy TD and two of her teachers, the theme of “This is me” was never far from the surface. The Ana who emerged from stories of holidays in France, her impact in San Carlo National School and more recently Confey College, was a sparkling, loving, gifted, ever eager and obliging child with a big personality that impacted on all who knew her.A slide show of images showed a pretty and playful child emerge into a beautiful young woman, a dazzling butterfly looking more than the mere 14 years she was. And in the background, the song This Is Me, also from The Greatest Showman, played: “When the sharpest words wanna cut me down I’m gonna send a flood, gonna drown them outI am brave, I am bruised I am who I’m meant to beThis is me...”Looking out from in front of the altar was the now well known photograph of Ana from her recent fashion show – looking out, side on, her hand raised to her lips, blowing a kiss to the photographer, her hair set in high chignon style.But as the celebration drew to a close, it was the final image shown, that of an effortlessly beautiful girl next door, no make-up, no special hair do, no gold lame dress, just a naturally pretty young woman, that drew an ovation and many, many tears."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3516050.1527832501!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit davis plans to give northern ireland joint uk eu status","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union  David Davis. Photograph: Getty Britain’s Brexit secretary David Davis is creating a Brexit plan that would give Northern Ireland joint UK and European Union status so it could trade freely with both, as well as a buffer zone to eliminate the need for border checkpoints with Ireland, The Sun newspaper reported on Thursday.Mr Davis is drawing a proposed 16km-wide trade buffer zone along the border that would be in effect for local traders, like dairy farmers, after Britain leaves the bloc, the newspaper said.The Brexit minister’s plan is a revision of the “max fac” or “maximum facilitation” plan, the report said, citing a source.British prime minister Theresa May previously pledged to take the UK out of the EU customs union by considering two options.One would be “max fac” in which the UK and EU would be entirely separate customs areas but would try to use technology to reduce friction and costs at the border.The other option being considered is a “customs partnership”, according to which the UK would co-operate with the EU more closely and collect tariffs on its behalf with no requirement of declarations of goods crossing the border.The European Union previously criticized Ms May for not setting out how the UK would achieve a frictionless border with the EU without erecting a land border to control goods between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.Britain suggested earlier this month that it would be willing to extend the use of EU tariffs as a backstop if there were delays in ratification of a Brexit deal to avoid a return to a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, adding the government did not want to use that option. - ReutersNegotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3515509.1527798946!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government to defend budget 2019 plans","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Finance Paschal Donohoe is expected to outline how different levels of public spending will affect the budget deficit. Photograph: Getty Images The Government will justify an expected decision not to spend all the money available to it in the October budget by claiming alternatives to its approach will increase the deficit and risk economic growth. Mr Donohoe is expected to outline how different levels of public spending will affect the budget deficit, as well as potentially overheating the economy. He is due to publish the Summer Economic Statement ahead of the Dáil recess in mid-July, which will lay out the amount of money available in the budget, as well as the “economic and fiscal consequences of different levels of expenditure and taxation”, according to his spokeswoman.It is expected that, as the year progresses, Mr Donohoe will choose not to spend all the money available, with one source saying it is then “up to others to show what they will do”. Fianna Fáil figures believe the Government is trying to lay a political trap to accuse the main Opposition party of wanting to spend too much.Fianna Fáil finance spokesman Michael McGrath said he agreed with the “overall principle” of the Government approach. He agreed “with the view that you don’t have to use up all of the fiscal space”. However, decisions on how much should be spent were a “judgment” for later in the year when complete budgetary figures were available. Fianna Fáil, he said, would not be advocating anything that would “expose the country to unnecessary risk”. Mr Donohoe recently restricted the scope for spending in October by €800 million more than had been expected by Fianna Fáil, whose acquiescence is needed to pass the budget.It comes as Fianna Fáil repeated that it would not open negotiations on a successor confidence and supply deal until after the October budget, after Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said he would like to see another deal in place before budget day. Mr Varadkar this week said he would speak to Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin in due course on an extension to the deal, and his spokesman said “any further discussions should take place at the appropriate time”. Fianna Fáil has consistently said, however, that the confidence and supply deal allows for a review after the third budget and not until then. Mr Donohoe recently indicated to the Oireachtas budgetary oversight committee that €1.3 billion would be available on budget day for new tax cuts and spending increases. However, he says these figures are out of date and will be updated later in the year.The Minister will outline what those in Government are casting as the economic consequences of spending more than what Mr Donohoe intends to, an amount he is calling the “budgetary stance”. The Government had previously toyed with the idea of not even outlining how much money would be available in the budget, but is understood to have changed course after recent forceful interventions from Mr McGrath in particular.A spokesman for Mr Donohoe said: “The Summer Economic Statement will identify a fiscal space framework, as has been the case with previous years. “Within this framework it will identify the economic and fiscal consequences of different levels of expenditure and taxation. This will shape the decision being made by Government on what the appropriate budgetary stance for the country is in 2019.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3515594.1527800058!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sinn f%C3%A9in s us arm raises 265 000 in five months","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGerry Adams , Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald,  and Sinn Féin vice-president Michelle O’Neill in Gormanstown, Co Meath.

The bulk of money raised by Friends of Sinn Féin came from the party’s annual fundraising dinner held in New York last November attended by the party’s then leader Gerry Adams, current leader Mary Lou McDonald, the party’s Northern Ireland leader Michelle O’Neill, and about 750 guests.The 54-page filing to the Department of Justice in Washington, a requirement of the US Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) for groups representing overseas political organisations active in the US, showed the New York-based group spent $365,514 in the six-month period.The bulk of this spending went on fundraising event expenses totalling $143,903 primarily relating to the New York dinner. The next biggest sum spent was on travel-related expenses of $98,170 for Sinn Féin representatives and staff travelling to and from the US and for Friends of Sinn Féin staff.The filing contains detail itineraries for the visits of Sinn Féin representatives around St Patrick’s Day including political meetings in Washington held by Ms McDonald and Ms O’Neill. Friends of Sinn Féin president Mark Guilfoyle told The  that the $15,931 spent in Northern Ireland was on “election and event expenses” and that the group stayed within the £500 limit on foreign donations set by the UK Election Commission.“We maintain a separate bank account into which we only deposit donations of stg£500 or less. Monies transferred to Northern Ireland come exclusively from that bank account,” he said. Mr Guilfoyle, a Kentucky lawyer who once served as president of the Friendly Sons of St Patrick in Cincinnati, Ohio, said he has supported Friends of Sinn Féin for the past 20 years and was asked to take over as treasurer and then as president when the former incumbent Jim Cullen died last December. The filing lists political donations made from the personal funds of Mr Guilfoyle and his wife to local politicians and judicial candidates and a local political group in his home area of Kentucky and Ohio.Friends of Sinn Féin raised money in the latest six-month period from many of the same figures in the construction industry, the labour movement, and the restaurant and bar trade who have helped the group raise more than $13 million since it was set up in 1995 to modernise the party’s US fundraising efforts.The largest single donation was made by Eurotech Construction, the New York building company controlled by Tyrone native Fay Devlin, a generous donor to the party over the years. His company donated $15,000 to the party’s US operation in the most recent six-month period.Other long-term donors to feature in the latest filing include New York building firms Henegan Construction ($5,000) and JT Magen \u0026amp Company ($5,000), and Bronx-based Preferred Mechanical ($5,000) and its owner, Belfast-born Sean Mackin ($1,000), a former member of the Irish Republican Socialist Party, the political wing of the Irish National Liberation Army. The second largest donor to Friends of Sinn Féin was Baldor Specialty Foods, also based in The Bronx, which donated $10,000 to the party. The company launched an Irish stout called Heavy Fennel with the Bronx Brewery for St Patrick’s Day this year. Trade unions, the Laborers’ International Union of North America, whose general president Terry O’Sullivan is a long-time Sinn Féin supporter, and the Great Lakes Region Organising Committee in Chicago each donated $5,000."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3515592.1527806800!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tusla says it cannot investigate all of its adoption records","story":"Susan Lohan of the Adoption Rights Alliance believes that as many as 15,000 illegal adoptions could have taken place in Ireland.  \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Children Katherine Zappone holds a press conference on false birth registrations, at Government Buildings in Dublin. Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireTusla, the child and family agency, has 70,000 adoption records and does not have the “remit or capacity” to investigate them, its chief executive has said.Fred McBride told The  that Tusla was “not an investigative body” and it was not its “role” to carry out an audit of all adoption records now in its possession.“We can only hold the records and our only legal remit is to give identification and tracing information to iniduals to whom records refer. If there was to be a full audit, it would have to be done by some outside body. I am sure we would assist them, but it is not our role to investigate adoption records,” he said. Mr McBride’s intervention comes amid calls for an audit of all adoption records dating back to the foundation of the State.However, a spokesman for Minister for Children Katherine Zappone responded that it was always understood the process now planned was a two-phase exercise. The first would be a scoping exercise involving a sample of files which would be carried out by Tusla. The second phase would be a full audit involving all the files and all the agencies. “The Minister has been clear that a full review of files would require additional resources,” the spokesman said.This would allow the full review to be conducted by an outside agency, or specialists in this area.This new trawl follows the announcement by Ms Zappone on Tuesday that 126 births were incorrectly registered by St Patrick’s Guild adoption society between 1946 and 1969.Outlying her first course of action, Ms Zappone said: “We must first judge the likely incidence of cases that can actually be identified, and the scale of them. Then we can judge the next step.”Concerns about irregularities in the St Patrick’s Guild records were first flagged with the department in July 2017.A number of groups working with survivors of mother and baby homes say there is now a “complete breakdown of trust” between them and Ms Zappone, whom they accuse of “sitting on these files” and “doing nothing for two years” despite their repeated calls for a full investigation into adoption practices since the 1920s.The 126 incorrectly registered births were “just the tip of the iceberg”, said Clodagh Malone of Beyond Adoption, while Paul Redmond of the Coalition of Mother and Baby Home Survivors claimed that Ms Zappone had not done anything to come closer to the truth, as those affected got older and some began to die. “She does not deserve the kudos she is now getting for revealing the 126 incorrect registrations. We have been telling her this for years. This is very difficult for us,” he said.Mr McBride said “some discussions” were now under way between Tusla and the Department of Children about a “sampling examination” of records from other adoption societies.

Photograph: Nick BradshawIt took 35 years to build a landslide.Repealing the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution was neither quick nor easy, despite what the margin of difference might say.Sixty-six per cent said “Yes”. Makes it look simple.But that two-thirds majority conceals hard history and hard-fought battles behind a stunning final result.Woman by woman, story by story, year upon year, day after day. The rocks and pebbles of countless unjust ordeals and small personal tragedies piled up after each furtive trip to Liverpool and beyond.Brave campaigners for basic abortion rights did everything they could to increase the pressure, their efforts ignored and condemned by priests and politicians and that tiresome class of pious people who live in terror of the slippery slope.They thought they could hold back a landslide. On Friday, gravity kicked in. The slippery slope did for them in the end.The Eighth Amendment, which guaranteed a foetus the same right to life as the woman carrying it, is gone from the Constitution. Good riddance to it. It brought nothing but difficulty and despair to Irish women in times when they desperately needed proper care and compassion at home.It was a wonderful morning on Saturday in the RDS when the boxes were opened and the votes counted. It was a wonderful afternoon in Dublin Castle when crowds filled the courtyard to hear the official declaration. It was a wonderful day for Irish women.A day made even better in the happy knowledge that the vast majority of Irish men are looking out for them and want only the best for them. By voting in their droves to repeal, they placed the concerns of women far above the fears of ideologically-motivated crusaders who prize saving souls above having a heart.With repeal looking the likely outcome, there were calls from some quarters for a muted and dignified response. Perhaps it was the reason why there was neither screen nor public address system for the huge crowd at the castle.But no. For all the decades of all the women who suffered, and for all the women who fought and agitated for change, we had to celebrate this historic turning-point in modern Irish society.Some never thought they would live to see the day. Some, like Monica Barnes and Mary Holland and Nuala Fennell and many more, didn’t. The celebration was for them too.It was for Ailbhe Smyth, who never stopped fighting. It was for senator Ivana Bacik, Catherine Murphy, Joan Burton, Catherine McGuinness and many more who were there from the start.Political rivalries were cast aside for the day. “Oh, c’mere to me,” said socialist Bríd Smith, giving Fianna Fáil’s Timmy Dooley a hug.Obstetrician Peter Boylan, looking very cool in his shades turned up and it was like George Clooney had just rambled in, such was the clamour which greeted his entrance. The three co-directors of Together4Yes – Ailbhe Smyth, Orla O’Connor and Gráinne Griffin – arrived to rapturous welcome.Senators Lynne Ruane and Alice Mary Higgins were in floods. Ruth Coppinger was hugging for Ireland. Katherine Zappone, who demanded the referendum as her price for supporting the Government, was ecstatic.“Oh God, I told my husband I’d give up the fags if there was a repeal,” said Fine Gael’s Kate O’Connell, one of the party’s most active campaigners, as she ran out for a smoke.Brendan Howlin arrived in just after Mary Lou McDonald’s big entrance. The Labour party was fighting the cause when all the others didn’t want to know. “We never get the credit,” said Howlin, shrugging. “We carry the flag, but then in comes the fresh faced Leo to take all the glory.”Maybe not. Health Minister Simon Harris pretended to be embarrassed by the “I fancy Simon Harris” poster, but he was secretly thrilled. Wherever he went he was mobbed. No wonder Leo stuck close by him.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin maintained a low-key presence, but his early intervention and support for repeal and the proposed legislation was a pivotal point in the campaign.It was a courageous move which now sees him on the right side of history and one half of his parliamentary party stranded on the other.As Micheál walked through the crowd, tearful young women hugged him. A man and woman approached. “We’re one of those couples who had a fatal foetal abnormality,” the women said to him. “Thank you. Just, thank you,” she sobbed.Meanwhile, back in the RDS, the Attorney General was chatting to former Supreme Court Judge Catherine McGuinness.She had had eye surgery the day before but the doctor gave her a special dispensation to attend the count. “Theoretically I should have a patch over my eye today.”At Dublin Castle, Frank Crummy (81), who set up Ireland’s first family planning clinic, was resplendent in his repeal jumper, alongside his wife Evelyn.There was a lot of discussion about why so many politicians and pundits called the campaign so wrong. The Together4Yes team remains amused by the old school, outmoded metric used by some of them to evaluate their very effective efforts. It was as if they were affronted at the idea that people outside the Kildare Street bubble might actually know more than they do about what the electorate really wants these days.Independent TD Clare Daly, a politician hugely deserving of credit for the part she played, decided to stay away from the castle bunfight. Instead, a number of Johnny Come Lately politicians with a weakness for self-publicity preened and waved from the platform.It’s always the same.A third of the electorate voted No. “I feel like I’ve lost my country,” a woman told us amid the celebrations in the RDS. She was very sad. She couldn’t be consoled.Cheers and tears and champagne greeted the announcement. The sky fell in briefly when a few drops of rain fell. Everyone danced.Because it was a monumental day. The day when the intelligent, compassionate citizens of Ireland turned to the Catholic Church and the retreating fundamentalists and firmly said: “Thanks, but no thanks.

Photograph: EPA Italy’s anti-establishment Five Star Movement and the far-right League clinched the approval of Sergio Mattarella, the president, for the launch of a populist government, all but ending the political crisis that has gripped the country and spooked investors.At a meeting at the Quirinal Palace in Rome on Thursday, Giuseppe Conte, the designated prime minister for the alliance, presented to Mr Mattarella with a list of ministers which includes technocratic academics and politicians from both parties in key positions. The selections were accepted by the Italian president, and the new government is expected to be sworn in at 4pm on Friday.Giovanni Tria, a professor of political economy at Tor Vergata University in Rome, will be minister for finance, while Paolo Savona, who had been controversially blocked by Mr Mattarella for the finance job last Sunday, will be minister for EU affairs. Enzo Moavero Milanesi, a former aide to former prime minister Mario Monti, will be foreign minister.Luigi Di Maio, the Five Star leader, will be vice-premier and minister of labour and economic development, including trade policy. Matteo Salvini, the head of the far-right League, will be minister for the interior and in charge of immigration.“An accord has been reached for a political government,” said Matteo Salvini, the League’s leader, and Luigi Di Maio, head of Five Star, in a joint statement.A prior deal between the parties, also with Mr Conte as premier, collapsed in acrimony on Sunday over composition of the cabinet, which was rejected by Mr Mattarella.Officials from both parties had been optimistic that a new pact could be sealed. Although Mr Salvini had been more reluctant to strike a deal, preferring fresh elections.Mr Mattarella gave both men extra time on Wednesday to reach agreement despite the political crisis having lasted nearly three months, the longest in the country’s postwar republican history.Earlier in the week the president had lined up a technocratic government led by former IMF official Carlo Cottarelli to take over if Mr Di Maio and Mr Salvini failed to reach a deal.However Mr Cottarelli met Mr Mattarella on Thursday night and formally relinquished his own mandate to become prime minister.Investors have been anxious for Italy to avoid an even longer political stalemate that could lead to fresh elections which could have turned into a de facto referendum on Italy’s ties with the euro zone.Hopes that Five Star and the League might overcome their differences and avoid a fresh election pushed Italian assets higher for the second straight day.The yield on the country’s two-year bond dropped 95 basis points during the day to 1.04 per cent. It had climbed as high as 2.73 per cent earlier this week in a surge triggered by political worries. Yields fall when prices rise.The last-ditch talks between Mr Salvini and Mr Di Maio addressed the make-up of the cabinet, which remained a big sticking point.Mr Conte, the little-known lawyer and academic originally tapped to be prime minister of the Five Star-League coalition last week, travelled to Rome and joined talks between Mr Di Maio and Mr Salvini.Meanwhile a further complication arose as Brothers of Italy, another far-right party aligned with the League on many issues, moved to join the Five Star-League alliance on Thursday, after having vowed to stay in opposition.While this would reinforce the majority in parliament and strengthen the government, some Five Star politicians balked at the idea because Brothers of Italy was not a party to the common platform it agreed with the League. Ultimately Giorgia Meloni, the Brothers of Italy leader, said her party would support the government on a case-by-case basis but not be part of the executive branch.Powerful forces within Mr Salvini’s base were still arguing against a deal on Thursday. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2018"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3515398.1527790007!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"britain s great greyhound racing advocate faces brexit bind","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGone to the dogs: greyhound racing faces Brexit challengesThe English Greyhound Derby at Towcester on Saturday will, despite its name, be a thoroughly Irish affair, with Droopy’s Verve the 64 favourite taking on five other Irish dogs in greyhound racing’s premier annual fixture. Eighty-five per cent of the dogs running on British greyhound tracks every year are Irish, with British trainers typically sending bitches to Ireland for breeding.The free movement of dogs between the two islands has flourished since at least the late 1860s, when Master McGrath won the Waterloo Cup three times to become the most celebrated dog in the world. Master McGrath was commemorated with a statue in Lurgan and a monument in his home town of Dungarvan, and inspired a ballad that framed his race against an English competitor in terms of British-Irish rivalry:As Rose and the Master they both ran along, ‘Now I wonder,’ says Rose, ‘what took you from your home You should have stayed there in your Irish domain, And not come to gain laurels on Albion’s plain.’ ‘Well, I know,’ says McGrath, ‘we have wild heather bogs But you’ll find in old Ireland there’s good men and dogs. Lead on, bold Britannia, give none of your jaw, Stuff that up your nostrils,’ says Master McGrath.Greyhound racing in Britain has been in decline since the 1950s, with the number of tracks falling from more than 100 to fewer than 30. Unlike horse racing, which benefits from a levy on betting, greyhound racing receives no subsidy from the bookmakers.Live hare coursing, the sport in which Master McGrath won his laurels, is banned in Britain, but accusations of cruelty continue to pursue dog racing, which has also been damaged by scandals around doping after dogs were given cocaine to run faster. At the English Greyhound Derby lunch in London this week, its chairman, Alexander Hesketh, identified animal welfare as the greatest challenge facing the sport.Hesketh, a hereditary peer whose seat in the House of Lords was abolished in 1999, owns Towcester race course and is on a mission to modernise greyhound racing in Britain and around the world. The owners of every dog that runs at his course must pay a fee of £200, which is matched by Towcester to create what he calls a “canine pension fund” to rehome greyhounds when their racing days are over.Greyhound races now publish injury statistics, which show that injuries and deaths are lower than in horse racing, and Hesketh will soon launch a “Towcester standard” guaranteeing high welfare standards for animals.Hesketh was chief whip in the Lords under John Major, but left the Conservatives in 2011 to join Ukip and has been an enthusiastic advocate for Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union. One of his passions is now in conflict with another, however, as Brexit threatens to complicate the free movement of dogs between Ireland and Britain.Liam Dowling, who breeds greyhounds at Ballymac Kennels in\u0026nbspBallymacelligott, Co Kerry, has already seen his business suffer from the 14 per cent depreciation in sterling since the Brexit vote two years ago.“Our kennels are only 10 minutes from Farranfore, Kerry Airport. In that sense we are 90 minutes from London. We’re closer to London than Dublin for many interested buyers. But since the depreciation in Sterling, a lot less buyers are flying in to consider buying a greyhound. After the recession in 2008, our family business thought we were past all of that but the prospect of Brexit means more uncertainty,” he said.Currently, dogs travelling to Britain require a pet passport, a rabies vaccination and a health check by a vet 48 hours prior to travel with a registered transporter.\u0026nbspThat process could become more complicated and time-consuming if Britain leaves the EU without a deal or if the greyhound industry is not protected in a future trade agreement.Gerard Dollard, chief executive of Bord na gCon, is anxious about the impact of Brexit on an industry that involves 12,000 people and generates €300 million in economic activity.“Brexit is a game-changer for the greyhound sector,” he said. “There are thousands of jobs across rural Ireland dependent on a vibrant industry. There are no alternative export markets. As the semi-State body responsible for the commercial development of the sector, engagement has been ongoing between Bord na gCon and the Department of Agriculture. Their officials recognise the economic and social risk that potentially arises from Brexit. Like other sectors we need in as far as possible a frictionless border.”"},{"url":null,"title":"valerie jarrett hopes for teaching moment from roseanne barr s tweet","story":"  May 29, 2018Roseanne Barr compared a former Obama official to an ape in remarks on Twitter   May 30, 2018Actor\u0026rsquos racist Valerie Jarrett tweet came as little surprise to her social media followers   May 30, 2018Shortly after the Roseanne show was cancelled, right-wing commentators were engaged in \u0026lsquomental gymnastics\u0026rsquo "},{"url":null,"title":"hawaiis erupting kilauea volcano pictures","story":"Kilauea volcano has created nearly two dozen lava-shooting fissures on Hawaii\u0027s Big Island since the eruption began, spewing lava and emitting toxic gases.Thousands have been forced to evacuate their homes and experts remain unsure of where more of the hazardous cracks might open up, or when the volcanic activity might stop.The eruption of Kilauea volcano in Hawaii sparked new safety warnings about toxic gas on the Big Island\u0027s southern coastline after lava began flowing into the ocean and setting off a chemical reaction.Manchester hit-and-run: Car knocks down six pedestrians after hitting crowd in Trafford ParkComment: Why young feminists are wrong to snub Sex and the CityGoogle blames Wikipedia for linking California Republicans to NazismComment: The surprising solution to NHS wastage: more managersChildren starting school unable to speak or use toilet, Ofsted head warnsUK weather: Thunderstorms and torrential rain lash Britain on first day of summer -

90 per cent of those at risk - have been vaccinated under a ‘ring vaccination’ programme using an experimental vaccine developed after the last Ebola crisis in west Africa.The WHO has so far identified 900 people in DRC it is following that may be at risk of contracting the disease due to contact with someone who has been infected. The WHO acknowledged however, that identifying all potential contacts remains challenging.  Since the start of the current outbreak earlier this month, 54 cases -  including 35 confirmed instances - of the disease have been reported, mostly in the remote areas of Bikoro and Iboko in the country’s north-west Equateur province. Twenty-five people have died. No new cases have been reported in the past two days. Although only a minority of cases have been reported in Mbandaka, the vaccination effort has to date focused on the densely populated city of 1.2 million due to fears the number of Ebola cases could rise rapidly in an urban environment.Dr. Salama said that take up of the vaccine among people deemed to be at risk of the disease has been high. “The vaccine is proving to be a very acceptable intervention to the community,” said Dr. Salama.He acknowledged however, that the WHO and partner agencies were “still at an early stage in this outbreak response”. He said: “We can’t conclude that we have safeguarded the city of Mbandaka.” Dr Salama did not rule out the possibility of further cases in the city.   The WHO is now expanding the vaccination campaign into the rural areas at the centre of the outbreak. On Monday, WHO began vaccinations in Bikoro, where the outbreak was first declared.  The WHO is also expecting to receive approval in the next few days from the government of the DRC to use five new drugs on patients in Ebola treatment centres. The drugs are all unregistered and will be used as part of a clinical trial.  Dr. Salama said that it was not a simple effort to do this kind of trial in this kind of environment. The WHO hopes that the trial will pave the way for future Ebola treatment efforts. Earlier this month, WHO experts concluded that the current Ebola outbreak did not constitute a “public health emergency of international concern. The health agency is however, continuing to monitor potential locations, including 80 ports on the Congo river in DRC and neighbouring Republic of Congo for new cases of the disease.The current outbreak in the DRC is the worst outbreak of Ebola since the 2014 - 2015 outbreak which killed  11,300 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health SecurityComment: Why young feminists are wrong to snub Sex and the CityGoogle blames Wikipedia for linking California Republicans to NazismComment: The surprising solution to NHS wastage: more managersChildren starting school unable to speak or use toilet, Ofsted head warnsUK weather: Thunderstorms and torrential rain lash Britain on first day of summer - and more on the wayManchester hit-and-run: Car knocks down six pedestrians after hitting crowd in Trafford ParkHawaii man pulls gun on neighbour in lava ravaged communityItaly\u0026#39s populist parties reach new deal to form a governmentPrawns with shy personalities do better in the battle for survivalMorgan Freeman sexual misconduct row heats up as CNN defends storyBritain\u0026#39s longest-serving poppy seller to hang up her collecting tin after 97 yearsInadequate care blamed for 40pc rise in emergency readmissions to hospitalBritain\u0026#39s Got Talent, semi final 4: Too much wackiness, not enough talentRussian journalist Arkady Babchenko defends faking own murder as suspect in plot appears in Kiev courtEngland\u0026#39s £160 World Cup kit is made in Bangladesh by workers on 21p an hour London earthquake risk: Scientists discover two fault lines under capital \u0026#39Holy grail\u0026#39 blood test could detect cancer long before tumours develop  Protesters in Belfast appear to take illegal abortion pillsThe next step for the EU after US plans to impose metal import tariff We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"city highlights fromnational geographic travel photographer","story":"This is a selection of images from the National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year Contest which is open for entries until May 31, 2018.The Scenic Suitcase taken by Stephanie MillerThe colorful streets of Bo Kaap weren\u0027t always this way.

It has always been a very important cause for me, she said. We did it in memory of those men who were killed, for their sacrifice.Rosemary Powell and husband Selwyn on their wedding day in 1952During the Second World War, Mrs Powell trained as a Voluntary Aid Detachment (VAD) nurse providing civilian nursing to the military.She went on to train at St Thomas\u0027 Hospital in London and later worked as a matron at Powderham Castle, then a finishing school, in Devon in the late 1940s.In the 1950s, she lived in Africa for a year and made poppies out of paper to give to local people during Remembrance.From 1975 to the mid-1990s, she lived in France with her Royal Navy officer husband Selwyn and sold blue cornflowers, the French equivalent to British poppies.When she returned to the UK, Mrs Powell sold poppies in London including at the Kings Mall shopping centre in Hammersmith.Rosemary Powell collecting in London, as the former Second World War nurse is planning to retire from selling poppies later this yearIn 2015, she moved to a nursing home in Chiswick but continued collecting for the appeal by selling poppies to fellow residents.Giles Powell, the son of Mrs Powell, said he was incredibly proud of his mother. Mum has led a fascinating life and now it\u0027s time, poignantly during national Volunteers Week, for her to hang up her collecting tin and encourage the public to volunteer their time to the Legion, which is a fantastic cause.Emma Cannings, director of membership and volunteers at the Royal British Legion, described Mrs Powell as an incredible woman.Her volunteering effort has been nothing short of phenomenal, and we are incredibly thankful for her support over the generations, she said.Comment: Why young feminists are wrong to snub Sex and the

salary cash-ins peaked, with 100,000 people a year transferring money away from their defined benefit pensions, after receiving adviceThe number of retirees cashing in their gold-plated pensions has slowed dramatically amid fears that savers are being given bad financial advice.It follows a sustained boom in savers swapping their guaranteed final salary incomes for cash lump sums following the introduction of the Government\u0027s pension freedoms in 2015. Last year final salary cash-ins peaked, with 100,000 people a year transferring money away from their defined benefit pensions, after receiving advice.But this year the recorded number has dropped for the first time and is down by 34 per cent in the first quarter of this year from 32,478 to 21,482, according City watchdog figures requested by Money Management magazine.It comes after MPs on the influential work and pensions select committee raised fears that a pensions mis-selling scandal was erupting as unscrupulous advisers were encouraging savers to transfer their money from guaranteed schemes into rip-off funds.How much can you save into a pension in total?The Financial Conduct Authority has also expressed concerns about the quality of advice people are receiving, and has already banned dozens of firms from accepting fees for such advice. The worry is that savers who have given up valuable guaranteed income for a lump sum could subsequently see it fall in value if stock markets take a turn for the worse.Research by the Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates pension advisers, found that  one in five recommendations given by financial advisers to cash in guaranteed pensions was unsuitable, potentially leaving savers worse off.In addition only half of such advice meets its standards, it said. Final salary pensions, often referred to as gold plated pensions are the most generous form of pension and are now largely unavailable to younger generations because they are so expensive for employers to provide. At a glance | Which DIY investment platform is right for you?But despite this, experts said that in many cases cashing in a final salary pension could still be a worthwhile move.This is because the cash sums savers can swap their guaranteed annual pensions for have risen dramatically since the pension freedoms because of low interest rates.In the most extreme cases savers are being offered in excess of 50 times their annual pension income to leave their employer pension scheme. For example, someone with a guaranteed pension of £20,000 a year might be offered the chance to swap it for £1 million in cash.Under current rules savers are required to pay for professional financial advice before cashing in a final salary pension. Many advisers take a percentage of the cash lump sum as a fee for the advice, meaning it can run into thousands of pounds. Comment: Why young feminists are wrong to snub Sex and the CityGoogle blames

populist parties reach deal form government","story":"Luigi Di Maio of the Five Star Movement and Matteo Salvini of the Lega will both be ministers in the new governmentItaly’s populist parties were finally given the green light to form a coalition government on Thursday evening, after they backed down over their initial selection of a deeply eurosceptic economy minister.After days of intensive negotiations and pressure from the markets, the anti-immigrant, hard-Right League party and the anti-establishment Five Star Movement agreed to a compromise.Both parties had come close to forming a government at the weekend, only for their efforts to be torpedoed by President Sergio Mattarella, who refused to approve their controversial choice of Paolo  Savona as economy minister. Paolo  Savona, 81, has called Italy’s adoption of the euro a “historic error”, describing the single currency as “a German cage” and calling for a “plan B” that would allow the country to exit the eurozone.“An accord has been reached for a Five Star-League government with Giuseppe Conte as prime minister,” the parties said in a joint note on Thursday night, after dropping their insistence on Mr Savona\u0027s position.  Giuseppe Conte, a little-known law professor, is likely to become Italy\u0026#39s next prime ministerMaybe finally we have made it, after so many obstacles, attacks, threats and lies, Matteo Salvini, the head of The League, wrote on Facebook shortly after the deal was announced.Mr Conte, a university law professor with no political experience who was plucked from obscurity by the two parties to be prime minster, was summoned to the presidential palace in Rome on Thursday night, where he was given a mandate for the second time to form a government, expected to be sworn in  on Friday.Mr Savona is now likely to be given the consolation prize of European affairs minister. The economy portfolio could go to Giovanni Tria, a little-known economics professor.President Sergio Mattarella vetoed anti-euro economist Paolo Savona as economy ministerProfessor Tria has been critical of the EU\u0027s economic governance, but unlike Mr Savona he has not advocated a plan to prepare for Italy’s possible exit from the currency bloc.Instead he has called for a change in the EU\u0027s fiscal rules to allow public investments to help growth and, like many mainstream economists, has criticised Germany\u0027s persistently large current account surplus.Mr Salvini of The League is likely to become interior minister – enabling him to start implementing his campaign pledge to expel half a million unauthorised migrants from Italy.He has called for repatriations to be dramatically stepped up.A few hours before the agreement was announced, he set the possible tone of his ministry by tweeting a short video of a man who he claimed was a migrant plucking a pigeon on the side of a road.“Final hours of work to form a government, we\u0027re putting everything into it. Meanwhile the news takes us back to harsh reality, with an immigrant plucking the feathers of pigeons in broad daylight and in the middle of the street...Go home!Could the eurozone be about to lose Italy?Luigi Di Maio, the Five Star leader, could be made minister for industry and labour, a role in which he would push one of the party’s key campaign promises – to introduce a basic monthly minimum wage for Italy’s poor and unemployed.The 88 days that it took to come to an agreement was described as “a Monty Python crisis” by one Italian newspaper.“Only the celebrated English group of comedians could have come up with a saga like this,” La Stampa wrote on Thursday.The new government is likely to clash frequently with the EU, having already struck a deeply adversarial tone with Brussels apparatchiks.The populist parties bridled this week when Guenther Oettinger, the EU’s Budget Commissioner, suggested that turmoil on the financial markets could teach Italians not to be seduced by populists.Such turbulence “could be a possible signal to voters not to choose populists from Left and Right,” Mr Oettinger said.Five Star were outraged by the remarks.“The words of Commissioner Oettinger are absurd,” Mr Di Maio wrote on Twitter.“These people treat Italy as though it is just a summer colony where they spend their holidays.”But there was further provocation on Thursday from Jean-Claude Juncker, the President of the European Commission.Asked about the economic situation in Italy, which has the second highest debt per capita in the EU after Greece, he said: “I’m in deep love with Italy. Bella Italia. But I can no longer accept that everything that is wrong in southern Italy is explained by the fact the EU, the European Commission won’t do enough.“Italians have to take care of the poor regions of Italy. That means more work, less corruption, seriousness.“We will help them as we always did. But don’t play this game of loading with responsibility the EU. A country is a country, a nation is a nation. Countries first, Europe second.”Please review our commenting policyComment: Why young feminists are wrong to snub Sex and the CityGoogle blames Wikipedia for linking California Republicans to NazismComment: The surprising solution to NHS wastage: more managersChildren starting school unable to speak or use toilet, Ofsted head warnsUK weather: Flood warnings as thunderstorms mark start of summerManchester hit-and-run: Man arrested after car runs down six pedestrians in Trafford ParkHawaii man pulls gun on neighbour in lava ravaged communityPrawns with shy personalities do better in the battle for survivalMorgan Freeman sexual misconduct row heats up as CNN defends storyBritain\u0026#39s longest-serving poppy seller to hang up her collecting tin after 97 yearsInadequate care blamed for 40pc rise in emergency readmissions to hospitalBritain\u0026#39s Got Talent, semi final 4: Too much wackiness, not enough talentRussian journalist Arkady Babchenko defends faking own murder as suspect in plot appears in Kiev courtEngland\u0026#39s £160 World Cup kit is made in Bangladesh by workers on 21p an hour London earthquake risk: Scientists discover two fault lines under capital \u0026#39Holy grail\u0026#39 blood test could detect cancer long before tumours develop  Protesters in Belfast appear to take illegal abortion pillsThe next step for the EU after US plans to impose metal import tariff London Victoria station evacuated after steam from Flying Scotsman sets off fire alarmWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"next step eu us plans impose metal import tariff","story":"The US has confirmed plans to impose stiff tariffs on European, Canadian and Mexican steel imports, which sparked fears of a growing trade war.Comment: Why young feminists are wrong to snub Sex and the CityGoogle blames Wikipedia for linking California Republicans to NazismComment: The surprising solution to NHS wastage: more managersChildren starting school unable to speak or use toilet, Ofsted head warnsUK weather: Flood warnings as thunderstorms mark start of summerManchester hit-and-run: Man arrested after car runs down six pedestrians in Trafford Park Hawaii man pulls gun on neighbour in lava ravaged communityItaly\u0026#39s populist parties reach new deal to form a governmentPrawns with shy personalities do better in the battle for survivalMorgan Freeman sexual misconduct row heats up as CNN defends storyBritain\u0026#39s longest-serving poppy seller to hang up her collecting tin after 97 yearsInadequate care blamed for 40pc rise in emergency readmissions to hospitalBritain\u0026#39s Got Talent, semi final 4: Too much wackiness, not enough talentRussian journalist Arkady Babchenko defends faking own murder as suspect in plot appears in Kiev courtEngland\u0026#39s £160 World Cup kit is made in Bangladesh by workers on 21p an hour London earthquake risk: Scientists discover two fault lines under capital \u0026#39Holy grail\u0026#39 blood test could detect cancer long before tumours develop  Protesters in Belfast appear to take illegal abortion pillsLondon Victoria station evacuated after steam from Flying Scotsman sets off fire alarmWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/30/TELEMMGLPICT000164886317_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqek9vKm18v_rkIPH9w2GMNtm3NAjPW-2_OvjCiS6COCU.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"smoking declines around world countries set miss targets report","story":"Many countries look set to miss national and global tobacco reduction targets by 2025Tobacco use has fallen significantly since 2000 but less wealthy countries are lagging behind, a new report from the World Health Organization has found.The report, released to coincide with Global No Tobacco Day, shows that worldwide the number of smokers fell by 29 million from 2000 to 2015 as more countries adopt policies to help their populations kick the habit. Today, some 1.1 billion people - 20 per cent of the population over the age of 15 - smoke.  Yet, although most countries have seen a fall in smoking rates, only a minority of countries look set to meet global and national commitments to cut tobacco use in over 15s by 30 per cent by 2025. The UK is one of a handful of countries on track to meet this goal.Which countries are on track to meet global tobacco reduction targets?The UK, where the first voluntary warnings appeared on cigarette packets in the 1970s and a smoking ban in public places has been in force since 2007, is one of a number of mostly wealthy countries that has led the way in tobacco control. Today just 16 per cent of the British population smokes, compared to 46 per cent in 1974.Across the rest of Europe smoking is also fast falling out of fashion. Last week, a new study revealed that smoking is starting to lose its allure in France as one million daily smokers kicked the habit in the last year thanks to the recent introduction of anti-smoking measures including higher taxes on cigarettes and plain packaging.Even Greece -  the European country where the biggest proportion of the population lights up - has seen a fall in smoking rates by almost two percentage points a year.Where are people stubbing out their cigarettes?The report reveals, however, that there are stark disparities between countries and regions. While 62 million smokers  in high-income countries stubbed out their cigarettes between 2000 and 2015, the number of smokers in low and middle income countries actually increased by 33 million.Less wealthy countries will see an increase in smokersThe report said that efforts to reduce tobacco use in low and middle income countries has likely been impeded by the tobacco industry whose relentless lobbying has stopped governments from introducing stronger policies.Dr Vinayak Prasad, co-lead author of the report and programme manager of  WHO\u0027s Tobacco Control, Prevention of Non Communicable Diseases team said: “It’s easier to get the political will and to explain the problem of tobacco but the tobacco industry is taking strong measures - they use all kinds of arguments such as the argument that controlling tobacco harms people\u0027s livelihoods.  The data however, disproves that controlling tobacco affects livelihoods.”The WHO’s Eastern Mediterranean region - which covers much of the Middle East and North Africa - is one region where overall smoking rates have barely fallen. The actual number of people smoking is expected to rise from 47 million in 2000 to 103 million in 2025 - a more than two-fold increase.Smoking rate are falling in most of the world- except the Middle East and AfricaDr Prasad said that multiple reasons lie behind high smoking rates in the region. “It’s culturally and socially acceptable to use the water pipe in many countries in the Eastern Mediterranean region, there’s been no strong leadership to push tobacco reduction at the highest level and countries have been hesitant to tax,” he said.Some GCC countries such as the UAE which introduced a \u0027sin tax\u0027 on cigarettes last October are starting to take measures but these have so far not been sufficient, according to Dr. Prasad.Some countries are bucking global trends as more people light upWhile the picture in many low and middle income countries is less sanguine, one group that is bucking the trend is women.Globally, women are kicking the habit faster in all regions of the world except Europe. “European women are an outlier globally,” said Dr Prasad. He said that factors including more liberal gender attitudes are contributing to a slower fall in smoking among women.Every year tobacco kills seven million people around the world – more than AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria combined.Tobacco use and second-hand smoke exposure are key causes of cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks and stroke. Cardiovascular diseases kill 18 million people each year - with smoking responsible for some three million of these deaths.“The single biggest killer in the world is cardiovascular disease,” said Dr Prasad. “They are responsible for almost 44 percent of non-communicable disease deaths. If you fix the heart problem, you fix a big proportion of NCDs,” he said. According to the WHO few people are aware of the link between heart disease and tobacco as there is evidence of a serious lack of knowledge of the multiple health risks associated with tobacco.“Most people know that using tobacco causes cancer and lung disease, but many people aren’t aware that tobacco also causes heart disease and stroke – the world’s leading killers,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.In recent years, more countries have adopted tobacco control policies such as plain packaging, taxation and banning smoking in public places.More people are now covered by tobacco control measuresAlthough Dr Prasad acknowledges that the tobacco industry and the continual development of novel products to continue to lure smokers remains an obstacle, he said that tobacco control policies have had a marked impact in many countries - including in low and middle income countries.“Taxation for sure is definitely an instrument - the additional revenue has been used to help the government fund universal health care in places like the Philippines,” said Dr Prasad. “Smoke free policies also cost very little as do warning labels and plain packaging,” he added.   Although the WHO’s current projection shows few countries will meet the 30 per cent target, Dr Prasad pointed to the example of France as evidence of what a country can achieve with political will. “France wasn’t doing anything until 2016 then woke up and introduced plain packaging. Things change.”Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Please review our commenting policyComment: Why young feminists are wrong to snub Sex and the CityGoogle blames Wikipedia for linking California Republicans to NazismComment: The surprising solution to NHS wastage: more managersChildren starting school unable to speak or use toilet, Ofsted head warnsUK weather: Flood warnings as thunderstorms mark start of summerManchester hit-and-run: Man arrested after car runs down six pedestrians in Trafford ParkHawaii man pulls gun on neighbour in lava ravaged communityItaly\u0026#39s populist parties reach new deal to form a governmentPrawns with shy personalities do better in the battle for survivalMorgan Freeman sexual misconduct row heats up as CNN defends storyBritain\u0026#39s longest-serving poppy seller to hang up her collecting tin after 97 yearsInadequate care blamed for 40pc rise in emergency readmissions to hospitalBritain\u0026#39s Got Talent, semi final 4: Too much wackiness, not enough talentRussian journalist Arkady Babchenko defends faking own murder as suspect in plot appears in Kiev courtEngland\u0026#39s £160 World Cup kit is made in Bangladesh by workers on 21p an hour London earthquake risk: Scientists discover two fault lines under capital \u0026#39Holy grail\u0026#39 blood test could detect cancer long before tumours develop  Protesters in Belfast appear to take illegal abortion pillsThe next step for the EU after US plans to impose metal import tariff We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/06/01/TELEMMGLPICT000165069979_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqL2PAfGWOBj0LpZQ6m31qIyomZDKJPGgkfFEN58E09AI.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"children starting school unable speak use toilet ofsted head","story":"There is a rising number of youngsters who lack basic hygiene and language skills by the age of fourMore and more children are starting school without being able to communicate properly or even use the toilet, the head of Ofsted is due to warn.Amanda Spielman will use a speech to nursery leaders in London on Friday to highlight the rising number of youngsters who lack basic hygiene and language skills by the age of four.She will urge nursery staff to play their part in helping children learn these skills - saying they can make a world of difference.Mrs Spielman\u0027s speech is expected to describe some children as lucky - those who are given bedtime stories or taught the alphabet by their families.Others, she will say, are unlucky, and do not get the same help at home.We now have a situation where, aged four, some children have less than a third of the English vocabulary of their peers, she will tell members of the Pre-School Learning Alliance.These children arrive at school without the words they need to communicate properly. Just imagine the disadvantage they face, right from the start.Unable to follow what\u0027s going on. Unable to keep up with their classmates. Unable to reach their potential.Amanda Spielman, head of Ofsted, will urge nursery staff to play their part in helping children learn skills such as speaking and using a toiletShe will encourage daycare staff to spend time teaching pre-school children new language skills - whether through songs, nursery rhymes or time-honoured classics such as Hans Christian Andersen or Dr Seuss.We know that at the most basic level, poor literacy holds a person back at every stage, she will add.As a child, you will do worse at school. As a young adult, you may struggle to find work. And as a parent, you won\u0027t be able to help your own children learn. This is a vicious cycle.Describing this skill as a simple, but necessary, expectation for four-year-olds, she will describe how a lack of toilet training can not only be disruptive for teachers, but can also have a negative effect on a child as they start school.I am not suggesting nurseries are substitute parents, she will stress.Nor do I think children should start reception as perfectly well-turned-out mini adults, who always go to the toilet unaided and never have accidents.But we know that the best nurseries work closely with families, helping to establish simple routines, such as sleep time and potty training, as well as introducing children to foods that they may refuse at home.The Ofsted head will say children starting their first year of school should also be able to sit still and listen, understand the words no and stop, and be able to put on their own shoes and coat.A survey found in September the vast majority of head teachers (83 per cent) said that four-year-olds are not adequately prepared for school, with a similar proportion saying they believe the issue has worsened over the past five years.Please review our commenting policyComment: Why young feminists are wrong to snub Sex and the CityGoogle blames Wikipedia for linking California Republicans to NazismComment: The surprising solution to NHS wastage: more managersUK weather: Flood warnings as thunderstorms mark start of summerManchester hit-and-run: Man arrested after car runs down six pedestrians in Trafford ParkHawaii man pulls gun on neighbour in lava ravaged communityItaly\u0026#39s populist parties reach new deal to form a governmentPrawns with shy personalities do better in the battle for survivalMorgan Freeman sexual misconduct row heats up as CNN defends storyBritain\u0026#39s longest-serving poppy seller to hang up her collecting tin after 97 yearsInadequate care blamed for 40pc rise in emergency readmissions to hospitalBritain\u0026#39s Got Talent, semi final 4: Too much wackiness, not enough talentRussian journalist Arkady Babchenko defends faking own murder as suspect in plot appears in Kiev courtEngland\u0026#39s £160 World Cup kit is made in Bangladesh by workers on 21p an hour London earthquake risk: Scientists discover two fault lines under capital \u0026#39Holy grail\u0026#39 blood test could detect cancer long before tumours develop  Protesters in Belfast appear to take illegal abortion pillsThe next step for the EU after US plans to impose metal import tariff London Victoria station evacuated after steam from Flying Scotsman sets off fire alarmWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"http://www.independent.co.uk/s3/files/styles/readmore_card/public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/10/15/maccari-cicero.jpg","title":"shipwrecks uk hms victoria voc hollandia anniversary","story":"Tragedies that befell sailors decades or even centuries ago still fascinate and move us, showing,\u0026nbspGodfrey Holmes\u0026nbspsays, the enduring power of the oceans over our imaginationTwo ships, two missions, two follies, two groundings, two sinkings and two frightful disasters. One was so long ago that engraving had to do the job of photography the other was recent enough that some people alive today will have heard about it from their parents. In one, a foreign ship came to grief in British waters in the other, a British vessel went down in foreign waters, and down she stayed.First to Texel, safe haven, population 13,500: the largest of the West Frisian Islands off the coast of the Netherlands in the Wadden Sea. Today it is a magnet for Dutch cyclists, walkers, swimmers and riders (the latter an important reminder that Texel is the only known place where an entire navy was defeated by men on horseback, which is another tale altogether).In June 1743, a 700 ton vessel, VOC Hollandia, set sail on her maiden voyage bound for Batavia, the capital of the Dutch East Indies, now known as Jakarta. In any study of trade between Europe and Asia throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, the Dutch East India Company is pivotal, shipping everything from nutmegs and cinnamon to coffee and tobacco, porcelain to rubber. And that is what VOC stands for: Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie.A brief history of democracy: Is it the \u0027will of the people\u0027?Yet on this prestigious occasion, Hollandia, being of brand new and bold design, an impressive 42 metres in length, was carrying a particularly special cargo: not only many VIP passengers but also 130,000 coins. Most were “pillar-dollars”, cut to represent smaller denominations, but among the haul were also highly valuable Mexican and Guatemalan silver coins.Hollandia’s captain must have been nervous therefore, as he headed for Brittany through rough seas. Perhaps he was aware too that just 36 years before, in 1707, at least 1,550 men had perished in the same waters, haplessly drifting towards the Scillies aboard four Royal Navy warships: the Firebrand, the Romney, the Association and the Eagle. (Indeed, square mile for square mile, the treacherous Scillies are probably responsible for more of the world’s estimated 159,000 shipwrecks than anywhere else.)Remember, these were the days before the invention of reliable navigation instruments still before the erection of most lighthouses.Texel is now a popular tourist venueSure enough, like those earlier ships, the Hollandia was blown off course, scarcely six weeks after setting sail, on a blustery 13 July. And it too came to grief off the Isles of Scilly, striking the notorious Gunner Rock, going down just off Annet, an uninhabited nature reserve just 54 acres in size, 20 miles from the Cornish coast.Nobody lived to tell the tale.Miraculously, in 1971 a London attorney called Rex Cowan discovered the Hollandia’s wreck, along with its bronze cannons and some of its treasure. Unusually, he was using a proton magnetometer, allowing him to test the Earth’s field of magnetic resonance, which in the process reveals every slight variation across that field – including ferrous objects embedded in land or sea.However, it is now time to turn to the anniversary of a sinking far further away and to consider the watery grave awaiting an equally emblematic vessel. This was a calamity that was far more preventable.Many boats have come a cropper in the waters around the Scilly Isles (iStock)State of the art flagship and battleship, the HMS Victoria – named in named in honour of the Queen’s impending Golden Jubilee in 1886 – was launched at a cost of £845 from Elswick on the Tyne. When she headed for the Mediterranean in June 1893 for training exercises, she had already endured one major mishap – a grounding at Platea, off the Greek coast, with Captain Maurice Archibald Bourke having permitted members of his crew to misplace the buoys that might have saved him from some very shallow waters.On that first cataclysmic day, 29 January 1892, no full tide – indeed nothing at all – would get the extraordinarily long (100 metres), extraordinarily heavy (11,200 tons) Victoria afloat again. Jettisoning 483 tons of coal, and calling for a tow from three other Royal Navy frigates, somehow the Victoria – its bottom damaged, three of its compartments seriously damaged – resumed its voyage on 4 February, limping into the new Hamilton Dock, Malta, for repairs. Bourke, despite being severely censured, retained his command.  HMS Victoria in dock, prior to completionAt the dawn of a second catastrophic day, 22 June 1893, Bourke and his contemporaries, among them Captain Jenkins on the Collingwood and Captain Markham on the Camperdown, were lined up like tin soldiers ready for an experimental manoeuvre – a very tight one at that. It was their misfortune to be in the hands of Vice Admiral Sir George Tryon, Commander of the British Mediterranean fleet: an obstinate, overbearing man with some very peculiar traits and strategies.Tryon was deliberately taciturn and unapproachable – the better, he thought, to assert the superiority of his rank. The better too to outdo “inferior” French and Italian navies also cruising the vital Mediterranean and the better to force his officers to think on their feet.Inexplicably – and at a time when signalling remained primitive, based as it was on a mixture of flags, semaphores and lamps – Tryon wanted the two columns of his fleet to turn, uniformly, a full 180 degrees, first towards each other then (so the theory went) retracing their prior course. His 11 Captains – with Tryon himself menacingly aboard the Victoria – were to do this whilst positioned a mere 1,100 or 1,200 metres from each other, even though a gap of 1,800-2,200 metres might have been considered a safe bare minimum.Markham hesitated. Surely Tryon had confused radii for diameters? Surely he had issued the sort of order likely to be revoked any minute? Perhaps Tryon really intended the convoy to turn 60 degrees to port, then 60 degrees to starboard, before resuming its original course?Tryon however, was getting impatient. Fearing humiliation – his colleagues also hesitant to defy their esteemed commander – Markham aboard the Camperdown conceded, swinging towards the fated Victoria, despite believing he cannot avoid hitting her.  Even so, the Victoria – built before the installation of automatic bulkhead doors – has many proven stabilisers. Perhaps Bourke is a more gifted captain than he has previously demonstrated?At the last, both lead vessels went straight into reverse thrust. But it was all too late.Vice Admiral Sir George Tryon was a difficult man insofar as his junior colleagues were concernedThe toughened steel ram of the Camperdown tore 9 feet into the side of the Victoria, a full 12 feet below its waterline. After two minutes the two vessels disengage but the Victoria lists, her many gun hatches and portholes taking in floods of swirling water.Three minutes later, her bow dips – but an unrelenting Tryon demands any rescue boats return to their respective ships. Now he commands the leaking Victoria to head straight for the shores of Tripoli, five miles distant. After all, the Victoria’s engines are still running, many men below deck unharmed.Maybe Tryon trusts that the “watertight” doors are still closed, so trapping many hands not already flushed into the ocean. Rapidly though, certainly by collision plus eight minutes, the whole of the Victoria’s bow is submerged, its stern far out of true, propellers turning in open air.At last, but way too late, Tryon yells: “Abandon ship! Everyone for himself!”  Five minutes on, the top deck goes under. Loosened boilers explode. Everything remotely portable bounces into the already hazardous surrounding ocean.Two men on board refuse to jump ship: Reverend SD Morris, the chaplain on duty in the sick bay, who folds his arms across his chest, closes his eyes and says a final prayer and Tryon himself, in time honoured tradition, going down on his watch, muttering: “this is entirely my doing, entirely my fault”.HMS Victoria disappears beneath the Mediterranean’s surfaceBourke – fitter and quicker than his superior – does, with great difficulty, make his escape. A distinguished fellow-escapee is the fevered John Jellicoe, one day himself to be promoted to commander-in-chief of the British Grand Fleet and dispatched to confront a detachment of the German navy off Jutland.Staff Commander Thomas Hawkins-Smith, one of Tryon’s most vocal critics, also survives by clinging on to rigging.\u0027Made in China’ label helps archaeologists solve 800-year-old mysteryIn total, 358 of Victoria’s complement perished, coincidentally the same number as those believed to have been saved. Six bodies only were taken ashore, along with 173 men injured during the tumult. Jenkins on the Collingwood unarguably rescued more people than any other captain on duty – mainly due to his not recalling his lifeboats.The stricken Camperdown, despite taking 90 minutes to effect partial water resistance, partial stability, somehow managed to keep going, battered, but without loss of life.Back in England, reliable news was scarce. Only Markham’s telegram listing 22 surviving officers was to hand and so thousands of anxious friends and relatives milled round the Admiralty.Anger and sorrow rapidly give way to philanthropy. Within three weeks, a remarkable distress fund of £50,000 was raised for Victoria widows and orphans – the equivalent of more than £5m today.John Jellicoe survived HMS Victoria’s sinking and went on to become Commander-in-Chief of the British Grand FleetDebates raged about whether there should be a public inquiry into the disaster some argued that would hand too many secrets of British seamanship to her enemies. A court martial was opened – Bourke’s second – with reporters allowed to witness some of the proceedings. Bourke requested that any captain sistering the Victoria was exempted as a judge.In the dock, Bourke kept referring to navy ships as if they were on a highway, obeying “rules of the road”. But the very concept of obedience troubled the chief investigator, Sir Michael Culme-Seymour – “a safe pair of hands” – throughout his deliberations.It appeared to be common ground that Markham on the Camperdown should have followed his first instinct and aborted the manoeuvre. But then, had there not been a collision, Markham would have been hauled over the coals for insubordination.Tryon actually gave his orders in person ignoring them was extremely difficult, however foolish and foolhardy they were.HMS Camperdown was commissioned at Portsmouth in 1889Culme-Seymour himself had to walk a tightrope: avoiding any hint at a precedent for altering (let alone ignoring) instructions from above. Tryon’s mental health was queried. Perhaps he was suffering from a brain disease, dementia, when he sent the Victoria to its doom?In the end, Bourke came out best, his reputation undiminished. Markham, meanwhile, was censured almost as much as his flag captain, Charles Johnstone. Both could have acted differently at different stages in the unfolding catastrophe. Markham was stripped of his command, his pay halved, and relegated to minor duties. He died early, aged 65, in 1906.Crucially, Tryon’s philosophy of seamanship was abandoned, history not permitted to be kind to his memory. Of the engaged fleet formation only a repaired Camperdown was still being tossed by high seas in 1898.Like the Hollandia, the Victoria’s wreckage lay undiscovered for a long time. Not until 111 years and two months later, on 22 August 2004, was the ship found, by Austrian-Lebanese er Christian Francis, assisted by British explorer Mark Ellyatt. It was positioned almost vertically, 140 metres below their search vessel. They concluded that a full 30 metres of the Victoria’s bow had buried itself in the seabed.Our fascination with the ocean is ceaseless (PA)Three intriguing footnotes to the sinking of the Victoria continue to tantalise. First, it has long been the legend that, at the very moment of inevitable collision between the Victoria and the Camperdown, Mrs Tryon was hosting a party in her London mansion, when Commander Tryon himself, but ghostlike, descended the staircase to join festivities.Second, one of Tryon’s hobbies was collecting memorabilia connected to his hero, Horatio Nelson. In 2012, Ellyat temporarily retrieved Nelson’s sword from Tryon’s cabin but, unsure what to do with this precious artefact, he hid the discovery in a different part of the wreck where it abides till this day.Third, is the very title “Victoria” fated? After all, it was the MV Princess Victoria, a British Railways’ roll-on, roll-off ferry that sank on its passage from Larne to Stranraer, on 31 January 1953, costing 133 lives (at the start of the weekend of the great Lincolnshire floods, which left many people drowned across East Anglia and the Low Countries).How Chad’s killing fields have been turned into an elephants’ havenHow crowdfunding is enabling indie talent to create graphic novelsWhy women in South Africa are carrying the burden of HIVAnd barely six weeks after that terrible storm, a reordered SS Victoria also sank, this time striking rocks – just as the Hollandia did.Why, though, recognise the anniversary of any ship’s demise when there are no living survivors and nothing to add to any inquest? Well, the lure of the sea still captivates and enchants even the most landlocked of the general population.Despite all its dangers – because of all its dangers – the sea is where many of us are most alive.Isles of Scillyor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

We have been focusing on what\u0027s close to us, but there\u0027s a wealth of information in the distant reaches of the solar system too, she added.The research was led by scientists from the University of Plymouth, University of Cologne in\u0026nbspGermany,\u0026nbspand Brigham Young University in\u0026nbspthe US.It was published in the journal Science.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Thanks for a great drive.LeBlanc, 50, will present his fourth and final series of the car programme later this year.The American actor was a surprise addition to the Top Gear presenting line-up along with Chris Evans two years ago, following the departure of previous hosts Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May.He then continued hosting the show after Evans threw in the towel after just one series.Evans said at the time that LeBlanc was the captain and backed him staying on the programme, and viewers praised his efforts when he returned without the BBC Radio 2 DJ.In recent series, LeBlanc, who is also known for his role in sitcom Episodes, has been joined by co-hosts Chris Harris and Rory Reid.Patrick Holland, controller for BBC Two, said: I want to thank the fabulous Matt LeBlanc for being a brilliant co-host on Top Gear.Matt has thrown himself into the show with real passion, revealing his extraordinary car knowledge and a willingness to get down and dirty.We were always going to be borrowing him from his day job as one of the top comic actors in Hollywood so I wish him all the very best.The next series of Top Gear (Matt\u0027s last) promises to be something very special and we have great plans to welcome a new co-host to join the team for 2019 and beyond.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Will it secure a good future for our young people and allow them to thrive? Will it help protect and grow the number of well-paid, highly skilled, jobs that Wales needs?”\u0026nbspIt warned that the promises of £350m\u0026nbspa week for the NHS or the prospect of new trade deals immediately after Brexit were not going to be kept, while important issues such as the Irish border were rarely discussed during the campaign.The letter added: “For all these reasons we are coming together, on a cross-party basis, to speak out for the people of Wales and to demand, for them, and for everybody else in the UK, a people’s vote on the final Brexit deal.”Former Labour leadership hopeful Owen Smith, who was sacked from the shadow cabinet earlier this year for calling for another referendum, also threw his support behind the calls.Shadow international development minister Preet\u0026nbspGill had to delete a tweet earlier this month after setting herself at odds with the leadership by backing a people’s vote on Brexit.Meanwhile, shadow business secretary\u0026nbspBarry Gardiner\u0026nbspavoided getting sacked despite claiming parts of Labour’s approach were\u0026nbsp“b******s”.Several Labour MPs have publicly\u0026nbspbacked a public vote, including Chuka Umunna, Welsh MP Geraint Davis and London MP Gareth Thomas, who put forward a Commons bill calling for a people’s vote\u0026nbspon the deal.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Digital minister Margot James told BBC Radio 5 Live that fans looking to buy tickets from a secondary site should not choose Viagogo, one of four major ticket reselling firms in the UK, because “they are the worst”. Meanwhile, National Trading Standards said on Wednesday that it had been in contact with the Advertising Standards Authority in relation to Viagogo. “As such we have now launched an investigation into Viagogo, which will look at all legal options to bring them into compliance with the law,” a spokesperson for Trading Standards said.Viagogo has previously been censured by the Advertising Standards Authority for “failing to make clear upfront all fees that can be calculated in advance when making price claims”, putting it in breach of the \u0026nbspUK Code of Non-broadcast Advertising and Direct \u0026amp Promotional Marketing, known as the CAP Code.The ASA said it had received complaints about how prices were presented on the Viagogo website, with quoted costs not making clear to consumers that they would be expected to pay additional fees and charges when ordering tickets. The ASA said it contacted Viagogo in March requesting that the company make changes to its website, and the firm said it would make the necessary amendments. However, the ASA added, as of Wednesday, Viagogo’s website “continues to include pricing information that is in breach of the CAP Code and the ASA’s ruling”. As a result, Viagogo has been placed in the ‘non-compliant advertisers’ section of the ASA’s website. Viagogo has been contacted for comment. The company was not the only firm implicated in the ASA’s crackdown earlier this year: StubHub, Seatwave and GetMeIn were also accused of misleading customers about fees and charges when booking tickets.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Human rights organisations criticised the move.\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspin the Scandinavian country approved the bill after it was introduced by the\u0026nbspcentre-right\u0026nbspgoverning coalition, by a majority of 75 to 30, although 74 abstained.\u0026nbspThe government said\u0026nbspthat the new law, which does not ban\u0026nbspheadscarves, turbans or the traditional Jewish skull cap, was not\u0026nbspaimed at any religion.\u0026nbspHowever, many see it as\u0026nbspdirected at the dress worn by some conservative\u0026nbspMuslim\u0026nbspwomen, although full face veils are uncommon in the Scandinavian country.\u0026nbsp Gauri van Gulik, Amnesty International’s Europe director, criticised the move.\u0026nbsp“All women should be free to dress as they please and to wear clothing that expresses their identity or beliefs,” she said. “This ban will have a particularly negative impact on Muslim women who choose to wear the niqab or burqa.\u0026nbsp“Whilst some specific restrictions on the wearing of full-face veils for the purposes of public safety may be legitimate, this blanket ban is neither necessary nor proportionate and violates the rights to freedom of expression and religion.“If the intention of this law was to protect women’s rights, it fails abjectly. Instead, the law criminalises women for their choice of clothing and in so doing flies in the face of those freedoms Denmark purports to uphold.”However, Denmark’s justice minister Soren Pape Poulsen said that it will be up to police officers to use their “common sense” when they see people violating the law after it goes into force on 1 August. The law allows people to cover their face when there is a “recognisable purpose” such as in the event of cold weather or in compliance with other legal requirements, such as wearing motorcycle helmets.First-time offenders risk a fine of 1,000 kroner (£118). Repeat offences could trigger fines of up to 10,000\u0026nbspkroner or a jail sentence of up to six months. Anyone forcing a person to wear garments covering the face by using force or threats can be fined or face up to two years in prison. Austria, France and Belgium have similar laws. The justice ministry and the police now will write more detailed guidelines. Those “should be very concrete” as to what will be banned, said Bjoern Elmquist, a lawyer who has been a prominent opponent of the law. Louise\u0026nbspHolck\u0026nbspof the\u0026nbspDanish Institute for Human Rights told\u0026nbspTV2\u0026nbsptelevision\u0026nbspthat if the law only focused on\u0026nbspwomen in the niqab or burqa\u0026nbspit could amount to discrimination against a minority group and hence be against the law.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But most people won’t actually be able to take advantage of the service.The high quality streams will be limited to a small number of people. They will be allocated on a first-come, first-served basis, and only to people with the right TVs.“We are pleased to announce a new cutting-edge trial which will see all 29 of BBC One’s World Cup matches available in Ultra HD and High Dynamic Range (HDR) on BBC iPlayer – but fans should grab their seats early as there is a limited number of spaces available (tens of thousands) for each game,” the BBC’s website reads.As well as the fact that the number will be kept to a minimum by only allowing a limited number of streams, a range of popular video players are not being given access to the high quality video. A full list of compatible devices can be found on the BBC’s website.The move will ensure that the bandwidth used by the ultra high definition streams – which are viewed over the internet\u0026nbsp– will be limited. 4K streams use up considerably more data than high definition ones, making them more intensive for the BBC and other broadcasters to support.The BBC’s Ultra HD offering is still being tested out – having so far been rolled out on lower profile broadcasts – and so restricting the data needed by limiting the number of people able to watch them will ensure that the streams can run properly.“The combination of the BBC and the World Cup can drive massive audiences, and right now there is limited bandwidth available to deliver live Ultra HD content to such large audiences over the open internet,” a BBC spokesperson said. “We’re making our Ultra HD trial available to as many people as possible within those limitations, while testing our systems on the largest scale yet.“The experience and data we gather from performing these trials will help us to optimise and scale up UHD delivery in the future.”For the same reason, the BBC recommends that anyone using the 4K streams make sure that their TVs or set-top boxes are plugged into the internet rather than connected over WiFi.The World Cup will also be broadcast over a special VR app, which will allow people to watch the game inside a virtual room on a huge, virtual television, the BBC announced.“The BBC has brought major live broadcasting breakthroughs to UK audiences throughout the history of the World Cup,” said\u0026nbspMatthew Postgate, BBC chief\u0026nbsptechnology and product officer.“From the very first tournament on TV in 1954 and England’s finest hour in 1966, to the first colour World Cup in 1970 and full HD in 2006. Now, with these trials we’re giving audiences yet another taste of the future.”In the UK, the rights to broadcast games are split between ITV and the BBC and the final is shown on both channels. All 33 of the BBC’s matches will be part of the 4K and VR trials.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

He advises on company administration and has contributed to dozens of legal publications.Despite being new to politics, he has already survived his first scandal.This is actually the second time that he has been nominated as the prime ministerial candidate, as last week, he quit the role when the president would not accept his anti-euro nomination for finance minister.In the meantime, Carlo Cottarelli was suggested as a replacement, but when he also failed to form a government, Mr Conte was back in with a shot."},{"url":null,"title":"get all our great stories with the suns newsletters","story":"So if youre after the news that always drives the conversation of the nation, the showbiz scoops that will shock you, all the goings-on in football from the clubs to the players to the fans, look no further.Sign up to our newsletters today by clicking here now. Key Features:Sun 10 - Receive the 10 biggest and best stories of the day, as selected by our editors, sent straight to your inbox so you’re always in the know.Money - The best deals and advice for you and your family.Fabulous - All the hottest trends in fashion and beauty, celeb news and juicy real-life stories.Football - The best columnists, unmissable highlights from your favourite players and clubs and more.TV\u0026ampShowbiz - Get all the latest celebrity and TV news directly into your inbox.Bizarre - For all the gossip on your favourite celebs, the stories behind your favourite TV shows and soaps.

The Government has no credible policy and the whole world knows it.“Whitehall’s real preparations are for the continuation of EU law and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.“The State has made no preparations to leave and plans to make no preparations to leave — even after leaving.”Barring a last-minute change of tune, Mrs May is walking into an ambush which will sour relations with Brussels and condemn Britain to a generation of rancorous civil discord.A botched deal will be dressed up in Brussels newspeak as a triumph for all sides.In fact it will almost certainly betray 17.4million British people who explicitly voted OUT in the biggest democratic mandate ever seen in this country.Voters who hoped for clear and unequivocal freedom from EU laws and regulations are unlikely to stay silent for long.They expected Brexit ministers to carve out a prosperous and independent future.Instead, they have watched defeated Remainers mount a ruthless and successful counter-attack.From a position of strength as a major trading nation, Britain has surrendered on all fronts, caved in to Brussels bullies — and handed over a £39BILLION ransom for the privilege.We are likely to remain bound by a version of the EU customs union, the single market and the European Court of Justice for years to come. Meanwhile, mass immigration runs out of control.Perhaps to his own amazement, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has succeeded in his aim to make Britain worse off outside.We will not be allowed to flourish as a free-trading sovereign state.Nobody can be more vividly aware of this than Mrs May as she prepares for her looming summit.Yet she has only herself to blame, starting with the catastrophic snap election which destroyed her Commons majority.She needlessly coughed up that £39billion with nothing in return from Brussels and allowed herself to be derailed by phantom threats of IRA violence if the UK establishes any sort of border with Ireland.The sad truth is that Mrs May is not up to the job as Prime Minister at a momentous point in our history.In an age when words really count, we are lumbered with an ultra-cautious leader who cannot think on her feet or speak without notes.At a time when we should all be doing our best to make Brexit work, we have a Prime Minister who would much prefer to Remain.For the moment, Leavers such as Iain Duncan Smith and Jacob Rees-Mogg are pledging their loyalty.But a bad deal would provoke die-hard Tories into the only honourable action they feel they can take — and put her premiership on the line.They already have the votes needed to trigger a leadership contest.They will not support key Commons votes to dilute Brexit, risking Government defeat by an unholy alliance of Labour opportunists, Lib Dem and SNP wreckers and Tory Remainers.A disastrous combination of weak leadership, cack-handed communication and dismal diplomacy has plunged Britain into a needless constitutional crisis.It says something about Mrs May’s position as leader that her strongest card is the prospect of yet another general election — the third in three years.And the nightmare of political throwback Jeremy Corbyn storming the barricades and leading his Marxist extremists to power.[boxout featured-image=6392734]AS PM, Tony Blair insisted 50 per cent of school leavers must go to university.The result was grade inflation across the board and “Ology” graduates struggling to find a decent job.Now his sensible son Euan, 34, is arguing for tailor-made apprenticeships, giving kids a chance to earn while they learn.His views coincide with new Tory policy – T-levels, technical and trade qualifications which fit pupils to the work they want.They can range from plumbers and computer wizards to City bankers.Many will be driving their own car and buying a home by the time pals leave university with mountains of debt.It is the way forward in skill-hungry Britain.[/boxout] Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Some is also done to shut down anything other than the argument that says “It needs more money”, while other bits are there just because TV executives have noticed it’s the NHS’s 70th birthday and think they’d better do something to look caring.Like, for instance, ITV’s A\u0026ampE Live, “from the frontline”, at Leeds General Infirmary.A self-defeating three-day experiment which, on the one hand gleefully promised us all sorts of carnage: “It’s hotting up here.” But on the other was swift to assure viewers they were operating on a time delay in case patients refused filming consent, thereby ruling out most of the drunks and any possibility of a bloke being wheeled into reception with a Hoover attachment up his fundament.I’d avoid describing LGI as the most sedate-looking A\u0026ampE unit in Britain, though, because ITV had attempted to redress the noise balance by having it hosted by human Tannoy system Davina McCall, who lost little time in telling us: “I had to get hypnotised to do this job, can you believe it?”Yeah, I can, actually.“I saw my granny sever her toes with a lawnmower,” she went on to explain, “and it made me squeamish.” If you thought for one minute, however, it sedated her, you either overestimate the powers of hypnotherapy or you haven’t been watching Davina’s career closely enough.The woman was in full Street Mates mode from the moment she clocked a young couple in the waiting room. “Are you going out?” said Davina, without so much as checking their vital signs.“We were on a date . . . our first date.”“AH-MAY-ZING! THIS IS GREAT. And it’s something to talk about when you have children . . . ”Silence. “I took it too far, didn’t I?”You did rather, Davina, though I get the squeamishness thing and actually flinched when she then told us: “A 23-year-old man, Tommy, is being brought in by ambulance after being rear-ended at high speed.”You’d hope Tommy got some of Davina’s meds as well, ’cos a weird thing happened on Wednesday and Thursday’s broadcasts.She actually calmed down a bit. To the extent I finally noticed the staff, who turned out to be naturals in front of a camera, which really shouldn’t have been a surprise given TV’s insatiable appetite for this sort of show.Among other recent TV offerings, we have: A\u0026ampE Live, A\u0026ampE, 24 Hours In A\u0026ampE, The Real A\u0026ampE, Sun Sea \u0026amp A\u0026ampE, A\u0026ampE On The Road.And that’s just the ones with A\u0026ampE in the title.There’s a whole load more with the words ambulance and emergency, which you may also have watched but entirely forgotten.Why?’Cos an actual visit to A\u0026ampE is a real, vivid, frightening, frustrating, disturbing, impressive and unforgettable experience that can leave you weeping with gratitude for the NHS.TV, by contrast, generally offers a dumb, censored, antiseptic, grovelling, uncritical, cult-like, agenda-ridden version, with this sort of dialogue.Davina (to ambulanceman Gavin): “How important is it you get there early.”“The sooner we get there the more chance the patient has of surviving.”“And that’s so important, isn’t it?”Thank you, live TV. Where would we all be without you?Good Morning Britain’s Piers Morgan: “I leave a lot of phones in my bedroom, ’cos you never know when you’re going to get THE call when your manager says, ‘Got it. Prime-time America. You’re back on’.”And it’s go go go with My 600lb Life.NOTE: In order to avoid Britain’s Got Talent Live, I’m heading south of the border, down Mexico way. Column returns in a fortnight.BBC1’s version of the Jeremy Thorpe murder plot saga, A Very English Scandal, is nuts.It’s very entertaining as well, but it is nuts, with CGI badgers running around in episode one and a couple of Yucca plants shoved in some sand dunes to try and make us think North Devon is actually “California,” on Sunday night.The main issue, however, is that A Very English Scandal can’t quite decide if it’s a comedy or not. So it’s deadly serious whenever Thorpe’s commenting on Europe, immigration or gay rights, but pure Carry On when his ex-lover Norman Scott starts having it off in a caravan with the bird out of Torchwood.It’s more than saved, though, by the incredible storyline and performances of the brilliant Alex Jennings, who totally vanishes into the part of Thorpe’s sidekick, Peter Bessell, Patricia Hodge as Ursula Thorpe, and Ben Whishaw, who’s got the most difficult role of all as the insanely irritating Scott, but does it well enough to make me wish he’d been shot on Exmoor rather than his dog.In that sort of company, of course, it was also incredibly brave to give the lead role to Hugh Grant, who never quite convinces me he’s anyone other than Hugh Grant, yet I will say this for a performance that stands out from anything he’s ever done before.He’s wearing a hat.Courtesy of ITV’s Lee Dixon on England’s World Cup goalies: “You’d be down to one goalkeeper and a nervous one.”“You’d be down to one goalkeeper and a Neville Swan.”INCIDENTALLY, who claimed the following, last week: “People always get excited about cockchafers.”EASIEST gig on the soaps?EastEnders’ Big Mo, who’s just set herself up as Walford’s resident psychic and fortune teller.A job with my name on it, frankly, as I wouldn’t need a crystal ball, money or much encouragement to tell the locals: “This old craphole will be locked in an ever more depressing cycle of baby abductions, love triangles, disrupted weddings, head transplants and escaped animals from now until kingdom come. Get the hell out, while you still can.”Walford CID might also want to put me on a profiling retainer as well, given they’re the only people who haven’t noticed that every single street crime, including – surprise, surprise – last week’s stabbings of Keanu and Shakil, has been carried out by a white, working-class male with a bad stage school Cockney accent.I guess Big Mo’s probably safe in the position for the moment, though, as she seems to have foretold the re-appearance of Shane “Alfie” Richie in The Vic, earlier this month.However, at roughly the same time, she also predicted: “Jean (Slater) will get a job with teeth.”This Morning, “Earth Angel” Sarah Rebecca Vine: “I am a spiritual life coach and healer and, I feel, a messenger to wake people up.” Zzzzz.And First Time Mum, Ferne McCann: “The hypnotherapist session definitely calmed me down and emptied my mind.” Of what?The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “On the flag of South Sudan blue represents the waters of what major river?”Bradley Walsh: “What UK Prime Minister read geography at an all- women’s Oxford college?”Jackie: “Tony Blair.”Bradley Walsh: “In a hospital, the H\u0026ampN unit refers to the head and what other part of the body?”Jackie: “Nose.”And Ben Shephard: “In Australia and New Zealand a ‘long black’ is a variety of which hot beverage?”Teri: “Beer.”The BBC’s Friday night schedule offering us two left-wing panel shows (HIGNFY and New World Order), featuring ’s Mona Chalabi, when one was far too many.The A\u0026ampE Live caption writer responsible for the spelling of “interupt”. Channel 4’s Goggleboxers and all the other people who seem to think The Handmaid’s Tale is a documentary.Car Share lacking either the brains or the balls to make a preview copy of its finale available.And Good Morning Britain without that oaf Piers Morgan, on Thursdays and Fridays. An experience which really is as pointless and empty as Tight Fit performing The Lion Sleeps Tonight, without Steve Grant on lead vocals.Brilliant performances from Alex Jennings, Patricia Hodge and Ben Whishaw, as Peter Bessell, Jeremy Thorpe’s mum and Norman Scott, on A Very English Scandal.BBC1’s Motty: The Man Behind The Sheepskin, revealing an even odder character than I was expecting. Dave’s How The Young Ones Changed Comedy (not entirely for the better).And The Chase offering up my favourite quiz show moment of the year, so far.Bradley Walsh: “Which astrologer published a colouring book called The Art Of Astrology?” John: “Galileo.” Bradley: “Russell Grant.”Gareth Bale: “I haven’t seen the goal back yet, I’ve only watched it again now.”Steve McManaman: “It’s a surprise that Bale’s not playing, but it’s not a surprise that he’s on the bench.”And Rio Ferdinand: “Win the Champions League and it’s chance to be forever mortalised.”(Compiled by Graham Wray)THIS week’s winner is Britain’s Best Home Cook’s Mary Berry and Gary Oldman as Dracula.

In the US — officially the world’s fattest nation — that figure is 18.5 per cent.UK stores now stock plus-size clothes for under-tens, with H\u0026ampM becoming the latest chain to sell a “generous fit” range for kids as young as eight.Obesity is predicted to double in the next 25 years — while tens of millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money has already been thrown at the problem.But a simple — and cheap — solution can already be found on the playgrounds and fields of around 6,000 primary schools where more than a million children take part in the Daily Mile.The exercise regime means that at some point in every school day, pupils leave their classroom, still in their uniform, to run, jog or walk for up to 15 minutes.Youngsters can set their own pace and talk to their friends while they go round.Most of the children complete a mile or more in the quarter of an hour.Teachers all over the country have reported how pupils return to the classroom invigorated and eager to learn after doing what is being called “jography”.Last week, Prime Minister Theresa May praised the Daily Mile and called on schools to take it up — but stopped short of saying it should be compulsory.Now, for all our kids’ sakes, The Sun is calling on Education Secretary Damian Hinds to make the Daily Mile mandatory in all primary schools.The idea began six years ago and has been growing steadily. But only now have scientists been able to prove it really does have an effect.Over the course of an academic year, a team of experts from Stirling University compared nearly 400 children, aged four to 11, from two primaries, with one group doing the Daily Mile and the other not.The Daily Mile kids were put through a series of tests to calculate whether they became fitter and whether they lost fat.IF you are a teacher or parent who would like to get your school doing the Daily Mile check out thedailymile or go to @_thedailymile or on Facebook. There is lots of information showing how easy it is to incorporate the Daily Mile and to support schools who want to get involved. You can also register your interest.The findings, which have just been released, show how they lost an average of four per cent body fat.They were also fitter and more active during the day, while time spent sitting around dropped by an average 18 per cent.Another investigation, conducted at an inner city school in London, found Daily Mile youngsters did much better than expected in SATS tests.Other tests have shown how children also feel less stressed and more confident.Retired head Elaine Wyllie, 62, came up with the idea of the Daily Mile almost by accident when pupils at her St Ninians school in Stirling wanted to get fitter.After just six weeks, not one of the 57 children in her first year was overweight.But to persuade the Government to introduce the Daily Mile into all Britain’s 20,000 primary schools, scientific proof was needed.After reading the latest results from Stirling University, Elaine said: “I knew this research would be the game-changer which would prove what I had believed all along — that the Daily Mile makes children fitter, happier, more active and a healthier weight.“I am delighted and relieved that we now have objective proof.”But education chiefs appear reluctant to make the Daily Mile compulsory for fear of upsetting head teachers, who might see it as an extra burden on their staff.However, Jim Cleaver, head of Westgate Community Primary in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, says: “The beauty of the Daily Mile is its simplicity.“It takes 15 minutes out of the day and for staff it is as easy as opening a door.”At Woodlands, a school for children with special needs in Leatherhead, Surrey, lead nurse Emma Packham has seen children lose weight as a result of the Daily Mile.She says: “We had five children who were clinically obese whose weight was just going up, up, up.“Since we started 18 months ago nobody in the target group has gained weight. Some have lost weight.No other factors in their lives have changed.”It is not just the children’s weight that is changing. Teachers are reporting that behaviour in classroom is improving. And many parents say their children sleep better at night.Former MP Andy Burnham, now the Mayor of Manchester, is a fan and wants his city to become the first where every primary school does the Daily Mile.Unlike some schemes, there would be no costs with introducing it into schools. All associated expenses are currently being paid by Britain’s richest man, Jim Ratcliffe, who has also used some of his £21billion fortune to advertise it during Ant \u0026amp Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway.Sports commentator Jake Humphrey, who runs the Daily Mile with youngsters at Trowse primary school in Norwich, says: “I honestly don’t think parents are aware of how unfit their children are. Why weren’t we doing this 20 years ago?”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That readiness is absolutely vital to securing a genuinely beneficial deal.We know that Civil Service mandarins want Brexit to fail.They’ve set up roadblock after roadblock in the hope we’ll be forced to cave in and change our minds on the whole exercise.That cannot be allowed to happen.Jacob Rees-Mogg is spot on when he says the PM needs to show some iron, and that Brussels won’t get the money they desperately need unless they play ball with Britain. It’s the only way we’ll focus minds across Europe.Without a plan, we’re only planning to fail.THE calls for abortion reform in Northern Ireland are entirely understandable.It looks increasingly odd that its laws are so out of step with both the rest of the UK and now with their southern neighbour.But Ulster’s abortion laws have always been a matter for the people of Northern Ireland.For devolution to work, Westminster needs to acknowledge the right of the Scots, the Welsh and the Northern Irish to set their own rules.It’s not a pick ’n’ mix depending whether or not MPs agree with them.And the way some Labour politicians have suddenly become dedicated activists to drive a wedge between the PM and the DUP is shameless.The Government’s priority in Northern Ireland must be to restore a functioning Assembly, which has been missing for more than 500 days. Then the province can have an abortion debate.But it is for Ulster, not Westminster, to make any decisions.KYLIE Minogue has had us Spinning Around for decades. We wish the Red Blooded Woman a very happy birthday.If only we could all be So Lucky to look that good at 50.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Some Italians told me unelected bankers and institutions in Brussels were being put first. They have a point.The EU and Italy’s President now need to tread incredibly carefully. The 5-Star Movement is already mobilising voters through street protests. The League party is calling on them to vent their frustration at the banks and financial markets.Yesterday, one EU official suggested the financial markets would teach Italian voters a lesson by withdrawing investment from the country. This will only pour gasoline on the populist fire.So, what happens next? The populists will almost certainly sweep to another victory at fresh elections, possibly triggering a new financial crisis and creating another major headache in Brussels. One of the parties might also propose a referendum on Italy’s euro membership.It seems very likely this chaos is not going anywhere anytime soon and the EU will soon be presented with yet another crisis.The events in Italy have clear implications for the Brexit debate. The EU has struggled to make sense of why Leavers opted for Brexit, just as today they are struggling to make sense of the mood in Italy.Many Leavers voted for Brexit because they felt the EU was not able to manage its own affairs, and they will see Italy as further evidence of that.But also many Leavers were anxious that the European Union allows very little room for other political views and they will see that as well in the Italy crisis.While the president was acting in the remit of his constitutional office, the problem is that many Italians and Europeans feel this is an example of Europe’s inability to accept any opposition to the euro single currency.It seems difficult to see how this crisis can be resolved without a more openly Eurosceptic Italy — and without a populist government at the head of the eurozone’s third largest economy.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She feared she would die.Her ex Michael Goodwin, 30, has now been jailed for four years and three months.Martha has courageously spoken out about her ordeal to help raise awareness of domestic violence.She and builder Goodwin had been together 18 months but she grew sick of his ­abusive behaviour.He locked her in his flat in Tooting, South London, after finding a text from her pal urging her to leave him.She told The Sun: “When he saw the text message he was livid. I was terrified so I tried to get my things and go.He told me I couldnt leave and locked both the doors.I went to the window to see if I could jump out safely but suddenly I felt an excruciating pain and remember nothing else.”When she regained consciousness, she was in agony and could hardly move.

I was horrified at what I saw.I sent the picture to my friend so that she would get help. It was only afterwards that I realised he had kicked me in the head.My friend told my parents straight away, and my dad, who doesnt speak very good English, went to the police station with the text.I could have died if left without medical attention for much longer.”Cops began hunting Goodwin, who had left the flat by then.He returned and took Martha, also from South London, to hospital. He ordered her to say she fell down stairs but she later told cops what happened.And the selfie helped convict the thug at Kingston crown court.He was found guilty of ABH, assault by beating and breaching a restraining order.Martha now hopes her story will help other women come forward.She said: After the attack people would say to me hes an animal - but he is not, he is a monster.No matter how educated you are no matter how strong you look it can happen to anyone.I thought because Im smart, have a degree, am independent and see myself as a feminist that I would be able to see it happening.But domestic violence does not chose someone based on those things.Sian Hawkins of Women’s Aid said Martha was “incredibly brave” to speak out. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It will mean that I wont be able to go to school, go to work or go out with my family.But I wont take my niqab off so I have to find another solution.Pape Poulsen, who leads the conservative party in the coalition, has described keeping ones face hidden in public as incompatible with the values of Danish society or respect for the community.But Ibn Hssain rejected suggestions that wearing the veil symbolised the rejection of Danish values or oppression of women.She said: It has nothing to do with integration or that were oppressed. For me it is a war on Islam.Human rights group Amnesty International called the ban a discriminatory violation of womens rights ... All women should be free to dress as they please and to wear clothing that expresses their identity or beliefs.Ibn Hssain, who says she has been yelled at and spat at in public for wearing the niqab, will stay for now in Denmark despite the ban.She said: If I leave Denmark the politicians win.

Giuseppe Conte has accepted the role in a new Italian government and will be sworn in on Friday with ministers. The agreement ends three months of political turmoil that began with an inconclusive election on March 4. After being sworn in, the government will face confidence votes in both houses of parliament, where the coalition allies - the far-right League and the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement -have clear majorities. Italy\u0027s two anti-establishment parties revived their coalition plans today, with a government that aims to ramp up spending, challenge European Union fiscal rules and crack down on immigration. The coalition deal removes the risk of a repeat vote, a prospect that had sparked a big selloff in Italian financial markets this week. The leaders of the right-wing League and the 5-Star Movement patched up their alliance after agreeing to substitute a eurosceptic they had initially proposed as economy minister, a nomination that had been rejected by the head of state.  All the conditions have been fulfilled for a political, 5-Star and League government, 5-Star chief Di Maio and far-right League leader Salvini said in a joint statement after several hours of talks in central Rome. The deal followed an extraordinary few days in which Di Maio called for the head of state to be impeached and two successive prime ministers designate were tasked to form a government, one of whom quit only to be reinstated this evening. Giuseppe Conte, a little-known law professor close to 5-Star, will become prime minister, the leaders said. Rome resident Vincenza Cariano summed up the exasperated mood on the street: I can\u0027t stand it anymore. The country needs certainties, security and equilibrium. The breakthrough came after the League and 5-Star agreed to drop economist Paolo Savona as their choice for economy minister.  Savona, an 81-year-old economist, had said previously that Italy should have a contingency plan to abandon the euro. He will be substituted by economics professor Giovanni Tria, another little-known figure, party sources said. Global financial markets have been recovering over the past two days after tumbling on the spectre of repeat elections dominated by debate over Italy\u0027s future in the euro zone. Italy, with debts totalling 130 percent of its economic output, is the most heavily indebted euro zone nation after Greece and is often described as too big to fail. Though investors were relieved to avoid repeat elections, they are now likely to refocus on the big spending plans of the League and 5-Star, which would add to its debts.  The coalition has also said, in a joint policy manifesto signed during their first attempt at a union, that they will push the European Union to review the bloc\u0027s fiscal rules, which Salvini says have enslaved Italians. The parties\u0027 new economics minister-designate, Tria, has been critical of the EU\u0027s economic governance, but unlike Savona he has not advocated a contingency plan for exiting the euro. In recent articles, he has called for a change in the EU\u0027s fiscal rules to allow public investments to help growth and, like many mainstream economists, has criticised Germany\u0027s persistently large current account surplus. Maybe finally we have made it, after so many obstacles, attacks, threats and lies, Salvini said on Facebook shortly after the deal was announced.

Martha Dolak was trapped after her controlling partner Michael Goodwin locked the doors to his flat before beating her to a pulp - causing her to suffer facial and skull fractures as well as permanent damage to her optical nerves. But in a clever escape bid, the 31-year-old snapped a selfie of her horrific injuries and sent it to a friend, who immediately alerted Martha\u0027s parents and the police. The brutal attack, which took place in October last year whilst Michael\u0027s two young children were in the next room, escalated after the manipulative builder checked through Martha\u0027s phone.   Multiple casualties after car hits crowd in Greater Manchester hit and run as \u0027people flung everywhere\u0027  He saw a text from a friend she\u0027d confided in about his controlling ways, urging her to leave him. She said: When Michael saw the message he was livid. I was terrified so I tried to get my things and go. He told me I couldn\u0027t leave and both the doors were locked. I went to the window to see if I could jump out safely - but suddenly I felt an excruciating pain and remember nothing else.  I woke up in bed. I knew he must have put me there but I couldn\u0027t move. I couldn\u0027t feel my legs and I had the most painful headache, I couldn\u0027t lift my head up at all. My eye wouldn\u0027t open and my face felt thick with dry blood. I took a selfie - I wanted to see what was wrong with me. I was horrified at what I saw. I sent the picture to my friend so that she would get help. It was only afterwards that I realised he had kicked me in the head.  My friend told my parents straight away, and my dad, who doesn\u0027t speak very good English, went to the police station with the text. The police went to an old address for Michael first and spoke to his sister.  She told the police I had fallen down the stairs, and then came to Michael\u0027s  new house to warn him they were on to him.  After she came they reluctantly decided to take me to the hospital. I could have died if I was left without medical attention for much longer.  After the attack Martha left Michael, 30, for good and took out an injunction against him. Martha, from London and who had been in a relationship for 18 months, added: After the attack people would say to me he\u0027s an animal - but he is not, he is a monster. I want to raise awareness and show to people that no matter how educated you are no matter how strong you look it can happen to anyone. I never expected this to happen to someone like me, I thought because I\u0027m smart, have a degree, am independent and see myself as a feminist that I would be able to see it happening.  But domestic violence does not choose someone based on those things. It\u0027s been the most horrific experience of my life but it made me stronger. I am not looking for sympathy, I just want to raise awareness of him so that other girls know what he is like. I have left Michael for good and I will never get into a another violent relationship ever again.

Dashcam video captured the terrifying incident as it unfolded in a busy south London street. Dramatic footage shows a a blue Volkswagen pulling out from a queue of traffic and appearing to almost hit the cyclist.  The Volkswagen hits an oncoming vehicle and the cyclist pulls out a massive blade, using it to try and smash the car\u0027s front window, the Croydon Advertiser reports.  The driver runs off and ditches his car after the cyclist tries to open a locked door.  Police were alerted and are now trying to trace the man who was wielding the knife. Stunned rush hour commuters looked on as the cyclist attacked the car in London Road in Croydon at about 5pm on Wednesday. In the footage a man on a bicycle can be seen to stop next to the stationary Volkswagen.  The car pulls out from a queue of traffic and appears to almost hit the cyclist, forcing him to jump out of the way. The Volkswagen then hits an oncoming vehicle. The man on the bicycle then pulls out a huge knife and uses it to try and smash the driver\u0027s front window.  He then attempts to get into the vehicle via one of the passenger doors, but finds it is locked. The knife-wielding man then makes his way over to the other side of the car.

The Financial Conduct Authority also yesterday vowed to tackle overdraft charges in a war on high-cost credit, following a two-year investigation. Proposals include a cap at rent-to-own stores, which typically spread the cost of appliances over three years. They charge small weekly payments but with high interest. The FCA found cases where people paid five times more for basic households goods. So a cooker priced \u0026pound300 would, in some cases, end up costing \u0026pound1,500.  The watchdog warned some 400,000 people have debt with such firms and the amount owed has soared since 2014 from a typical \u0026pound2,000 to \u0026pound4,300. Examples of this type of shop include BrightHouse. The FCA also targeted overdraft charges. Banks, which rake in \u0026pound2.3billion from them, would have to alert account holders to potential charges and would be barred from including overdrafts in “available funds”. The FCA is also considering a ban on fixed fees. But critics said it must go further. In 2015 it capped payday loan interest and fees at 0.8% a day. Firms such as Wonga were charging up to 5,853% annually.

Brett John Cunningham shared the video online after the parcel was taken from his doorstep in Dudley, West Midlands, on Sunday. Surveillance footage shows the drenched delivery driver walk to the front door in heavy rain, wait momentarily, before leaving the brown parcel and sprinting back to his van. Half an hour later, the same camera captures an opportunistic crook walk up, grab the parcel and make a run for it. Brett ordered the fan from eBay but later received a delivery receipt from Amazon Shipping. Posting the video on Amazon\u0027s Facebook page, Brett wrote: “Thank you Amazon for leaving my parcel on the doorstep, perfect place for the low life thief to steal it.” Brett said the only consolation is that the thief would have been dejected to open a \u0026pound16 USB desk fan.  Speaking today, he said: “The parcel itself wasn\u0027t of any great value, it was only a \u0026pound16 desk fan. I guess he was disappointed when he open it, but it was more the principle than anything else, it could have been something worth much more. “Even if I was in, I don\u0027t think I would have had time to answer the door to him anyway for how quick he gave up after knocking the door. “We were away on holiday in Somerset from Saturday to Tuesday and the delivery attempt was on the Sunday, so I would have been really lucky if it was still to be sitting there on Tuesday when we got back. If that man didn\u0027t steal it I\u0027m sure someone else would.

Fans have been counting down the minutes and this series is expected to make an even bigger splash than last year. The finale on ITV2 was watched by 3.1 million people but, as this series takes place around the football World Cup, many more could check it out this time. It sounds like an unlikely TV smash, watching singletons looking for love in the sun while you sit in your PJs on the couch, but bosses are pouring money into it. “It is easily our number one show,” controller of ITV digital channels Paul Mortimer says, “so we are investing in it a bit more heavily.” With versions launched in other countries, and fans including Liam Gallagher and Stormzy, here’s what all the fuss is about...  Love Island starts with a 95-minute special at 9pm on Monday on ITV2.   The presenters Caroline Flack will welcome a new generation of islanders and speak to the evicted contestants packing their suitcases and heading home. But Caroline, below, flies in and out of the island throughout the series and arguably the biggest star of the show isn’t even seen on screen. Comedian Iain Stirling is the commentator – think the voice of Big Brother with sass and humour if you’ve not watched before – and he tells us what is going on in each episode with his tongue in his cheek. Iain only sees the footage for each episode at around 2pm and then has just a few hours to write a script filled with trademark gags – and then record it. He’s rightly become a huge star since he started to voice the show. “I’ve tried to see as little as possible,” he said, when asked what he thought of the line-up. “I try and watch as a viewer.”  How it works Every few days the islanders have to couple up, with those not in a couple at risk of being dumped from the island. But it is not just a case of 11 contestants going in and a winning couple at the end – that would be far too simple. Bosses say the path to true love is “littered with surprise bombshell arrivals” meaning by the end of the eight-week run there will have been more than 20 contestants. There will also be unexpected twists and turns like shock evictions, games, dates and bosses meddling. Most of this news is delivered to contestants via text message on one of their phones, often leading to screams of: “I’ve got a text!” And if two people fancy the same person? Bring on battles for affection and lots of gossiping in the garden.  Sex on TV Parents of contestants will want to look away and invest in ear plugs when their precious ones are doing the deed. While the footage of sex is not graphic – most couples go under a duvet - what you hear is often worse. Couples are also given the chance to spend a night in The Hideaway, a private bedroom where they can have some alone time... with the cameras still on. Bosses insist they don’t show anything graphic. “For the record, we don’t show sex on television” said ITV Studios MD Angela Jain. “We show the reaction to sex happening in the villa. “The way we cut it and treat it is part of a normal relationship. We don’t do it for any kind of salacious outcome.”  The contestants A total of 11 contestants will enter the show to begin with, all single and looking to mingle. They will then “couple up”, leaving one person the odd one out. The line-up includes a West End performer, personal trainer Adam Collard, model Hayley Hughes, an A\u0026ampE doctor and the daughter of EastEnders hardman Danny Dyer. The majority of the five women entering have had their hearts broken in the past 12 months and all of them hope they will finally find “the one” on the TV show where they have up to eight weeks to date. More than 100,000 people applied to go on the show this year but many of the contestants are offered up by agents or scouted from their social media profiles.  Bosses started with a “shortlist” of 1,000 and execs saw most of these themselves after casting agents narrowed it down. Love Island 2017 was won by Amber Davies and Kem Cetinay, although the couple split months after winning a \u0026pound50,000 prize. Kem and his co-star Chris Hughes, who came third with Olivia Attwood, went on to land a spin-off series and released a top 20 single, earning big money off the back of the success of last summer’s show.  The villa The villa is less than an hour’s drive from Palma airport in Majorca. It is the same one used last year. Camera runs in the garden are hidden in huts either side of an infinity pool and LEDs which can change colour are all around the garden floor. Executive producer Tom Gould said: “The sun deck is different and has changed in a new re-imagined space and there is a swing seat. “It makes it more attractive for them and it’s better for us to film. The hideaway has had its annual makeover. And the bedroom. “There is an inside-out theme, too. We have grass on the walls inside. And that new design has been picked up in the bedroom and lounge, to tie the whole thing as one. “On the walls and by the beds there are phrases and stuff that have been said before like ‘You OK, Hun?’ and now have a life of their own...” A smoking area has also had to be created after there were complaints last year.  Paul Mortimer says: “Because they’re a very sexy cast in a  sexy environment on a sexy channel then it made smoking look glamorous.  “Ofcom took a view that it was unacceptable. It’s not against the law to smoke cigarettes but this year we have in plan a place for the smoking area to be outside the villa rather than inside.”   The lingo  The show is well known for introducing a range of words into the nation’s vocabulary, including...  Grafting Focusing your attention on the boy/girl you want and working to woo them.   Muggy If you are doing something bad or disrespectful.   Melt Acting soppy.   Pied off When you are shot down or basically rejected.   Stick it on Make a move on a boy/girl.   My type on paper A perfect match.

Graham Cattermole was giving his marching orders by an overzealous security guard after he popped into the supermarket to pick up some shopping. The 64-year-old had gone into the Tesco Express with his wife Christine, 61, and had not even started shopping when he was told to remove his beige cotton flat cap. The electrician, who is just a year off retirement, refused to do and was swiftly ejected from the store in Dudley, West Midlands on Tuesday. The supermarket giant has since apologised and admitted it had implemented their policy on hoodies or crash helmets incorrectly.  Graham said: We went into the Tesco Express - the wife was a couple of feet in front of me and I was just about to go down one of the aisles. Then a security guard came up to us and said \u0027sorry, you\u0027re going to have to take your hat off or you can\u0027t come in\u0027. I thought \u0027how stupid can you be?\u0027 If I had a crash helmet on or I was wearing a hoody and looked like a hooligan, I could understand but I\u0027m nearly 65 and I\u0027ve got a walking stick - it\u0027s not like I\u0027m going to hold the place up. I had been in many times wearing a hat - normally a trilby. It had never been a problem at all. He said they have a no-hat policy there, so we turned round and came out. A couple of customers who were by us just looked on in amazement. It was a bit embarrassing because there was no way he was going to let us shop in there unless I took my hat off. But there was no real reason for me to take the hat off. If it was a crash helmet, then yes.

It took a reassuring hug from a producer, who had noticed stage fright setting in, to give her the courage to step into the spotlight for a performance of her hilarious, madcap magic routine which has changed her life. Mandy, 55, says: “Just before my cue, I was terrified. “I thought, ‘What if they just don’t get me? I’m a tubby, middle-aged woman in a Marks and Spencer dress in a world full of beautiful young women’.  “Hearing the bloke before me get four buzzers, which are far louder and scarier than they sound on telly, just about finished me off. I couldn’t face walking out, as I felt sure they’d tell me I was ready for the glue factory.” Mandy was wrong. The audience and four BGT judges were in hysterics at her seemingly hapless magic act – which actually masked ingenuity and saw her likened to legend Tommy Cooper. Judges Simon Cowell, Amanda Holden, David Walliams and Alesha Dixon, gave her a rare standing ovation. Mandy says: “As soon as I was backstage I burst into tears. I was so amazed at the response. I’ve been doing my act in the wilderness for decades and it made me really emotional.”  Walliams was astounded he had not met her on the comedy circuit. But although Mandy has been doing small gigs across the country and on cruise ships, work had been drying up. She says: “I wasn’t getting enough bookings. And because I’d done cruise ships, I also lost a lot of contacts from home. Things were so bad I applied to my local theatre in Wimbledon for casual work in their box office. But they didn’t even reply. “I’d been applying for telesales jobs, but my age and lack of experience were ruling me out. “I have seen so many acts which are amazing, but the performers just don’t get breaks. Then someone told me there were lots of hairdressers, but could only be one Vidal Sassoon. So I kept going. And I’m so glad I did. “The Monday morning after my audition aired, I got a call asking me to do panto. No one had been interested in me doing panto for years. And when I was on a cruise in Malta recently, people recognised me. I’m not used to it, and I’m loving it. Britain’s Got Talent has changed my life already.”  As a child, Mandy wanted to be a magician, but even then knew it would be hard to break the typical mould of women in the business being there as glamorous ornaments. She says: “I remember seeing a magic act on stage and asking mum why the lady was wearing a skimpy bikini. Mum said, ‘Because men like it’. “I was determined I wouldn’t resort to wearing provocative clothes to impress anyone. I wanted to do that with talent and hard work.” Mandy was the 13th woman to join the Magic Circle after it lifted a female members ban in 1991. Even then, some men gave her the cold shoulder. She says: “I’d be at a Magic Circle meeting and would go to see men showing their latest trick. Often they’d stop until I left.” It made Mandy determined, and she put the hours in to ensure her magic, and jokes, were as good as they could be. One man who showed kindness was the late Paul Daniels. She says: “Paul was incredibly generous in my early career. “I bought an illusion which I couldn’t do and he spent time showing me how to perfect it. What a lovely thing to do – and a lovely man.”  Mandy has been single for more than 10 years, but that gave her plenty of material to co-write a play with friend, actress Claire Sweeney, called Sex and the Suburbs, based on her hilarious dating experiences. Mandy says: “At the time, I spent a lot of time watching Sex and the City and seeing incredibly glamorous women dating gorgeous, rich men. “Things weren’t quite the same. Men would turn up on dates in a beaten up Fiat Panda and didn’t even have the money to offer you a drink. No one tottered around in Louboutins. It was seriously unglamorous. “I remember one really lovely man agreed to come to my flat for dinner, and my West Indian friend showed me how to make a Jamaican curry, which was delicious. “Only it wasn’t delicious when I made it. It was so awful my date was sick, then he pretended he wasn’t sick. But when I asked if he wanted any more, he said, ‘Oh, NO’.” So she is still hoping – and perhaps BGT will improve her love life. She says: “Maybe David Walliams and I can hook up – we both like comedy. Failing that, I’d just like someone who is breathing.” Mandy’s on-stage clumsiness is usually part of her act. But not always. She says: “I was performing in an Italian hotel and there was a beautiful man in the front, an Adonis, all dark hair and green eyes. “Part of my act involved fire, but then I accidentally set my hair alight. “A waitress ran on with a tea towel to smother the flames, then I shot off, dunked my head under a tap, then ran on with hair soaked flat to my head. “I got a standing ovation, but not a date with Adonis. So if the next BGT performance goes better than that, I’ll be one happy lady.”  Watch Mandy on tonight’s BGT live semi-final on ITV at 7.30pm. Also appearing are singer Fr Ray Kelly, Rat Pack singers Demille \u0026amp Muoneke, dancers Lexie \u0026amp Christopher, musical comic Micky P Kerr, eating opera singer Sarah Llewellyn, boy band Bring It North and acrobats the Giang Brothers.

This will affect Northern Ireland, Scotland and western parts of England and Wales. With some torrential downpours, it is likely that we will see some localised flooding.      Forecasters predict up to 1.8ins of rain could fall in the space of an hour in some parts, rising to 3.6ins over three hours. It comes after storms and heavy downpours caused problems in some parts on Thursday afternoon and overnight, with disruption expected to continue into the morning. Train passengers in the Midlands could find their journeys affected after lightning strikes damaged equipment between Birmingham New Street and Wolverhampton.    Network Rail said disruption was expected until about 9am. South-west parts of England were worst-affected overnight, with Gloucestershire County Council reporting multiple calls to the fire service over flash flooding. On Thursday evening, Didcot Parkway railway station in Oxfordshire flooded, leaving passengers to wade through deep waters or be helped by firefighters.

Ella Jansen had the mirene coil removed after her dentist linked the two, but her teeth are still getting worse. The 29-year-old has now been diagnosed with gum disease and has been told she will probably lose all her teeth in her 30s. Ella, who lives in Solihull in the West Midlands, was on her way to a modelling career when her teeth started to change and she claims it has ruined her life.  She claims she had no idea the coil could do this, and now wants to raise awareness for other woman. She said: It\u0027s absolutely ruined my life – I was getting into modelling before I got the coil and I had a few photoshoots. It all seemed to be going so well, but now I can’t even smile properly – I don’t want people to see my teeth because they look so bad. I really want to raise awareness about the issues that can come along with the mirena coil – I don’t want any other girls to have to go through what I went through.  No one mentioned this was a risk when I got the coil and it’s had such a massive impact on my life. After getting the coil in 2013 when she was 24 , Ella began to notice that her gums started to swell and noticed gaps forming between her teeth. Her dentist diagnosed her with gingivitis - gum disease which is linked to bad hygiene.  Ella was very strict with her dental hygiene so was shocked by the discovery. She has claimed that the dentist told her it was caused by a hormonal imbalance from the mirena coil. But despite her concerns and numerous medical issues, Ella says nurses were reluctant to take it out and she was stuck with it for almost two years.  Elle said: I had no idea that the mirena coil could cause my teeth to go rotten, it was a huge shock when my dentist linked the two. She began to also experience leg pain and found herself unable to walk for any longer than a mile before her left leg would give up. Ella added: My left leg would just give way and later on I found out that that can happen when the coil is fitted incorrectly. I was dealing with so many side-effects, but I just couldn\u0027t get my nurse to take it out – she said she was worried I would get pregnant. My teeth eventually got worse and it became full blown periodontal disease – which is gum disease.  It\u0027s incredibly painful – my gums are constantly swollen and bright red, and they bleed often - my teeth are now wonky and sometimes overlap. My gums got infected and the dentist had to make my gums bleed to get the infection out by scraping the gums. I\u0027ve always taken good care of my teeth and had a good diet and exercise. Ella is extremely embarrassed by how her teeth look now and doesn\u0027t like people seeing them. She said: I struggled to get the coil taken out, but it was finally removed in 2015 and my symptoms started to balance out again, but my teeth just got worse and worse. The dentist said that I’ll have lost 11 of my teeth by the time I’m 35 - when he said that I won’t lie, I did cry for days.

Katrina Holmes, 34, was sexually abused by her babysitter, Deborah Evans, in the late 1990s after the woman became close with her family and gained her father\u0027s trust. In secret diaries, the then 15-year-old kept detailed how Evans, 27, groomed her and forced her to perform repulsive acts. Two decades later the entries helped convict Evans, now in her 40s, who has been sentenced to seven years jail. The pair first met when Katrina was seven years old and Evans was aged 19. Evans would babysit Katrina while her father was at the pub.  Katrina, from Cardiff, told Wales Online: “I really liked her – she always had a can of lager in her hand and would get pretty tipsy. “But she was mischievous and fun. My own mum lived hundreds of miles away so I really looked up to Deborah and felt safe with her.” Evans became a family friend, but her attitude towards Katrina changed after the girl turned 15, leading to the woman making a pass at the teenager during a sleepover. Katrina said: “She stayed over our house in my bedroom – with two single beds.  “She said ‘kiss me’. I remember her opening her mouth as her lips tried to close onto mine. “I froze and pulled away from her. ‘What are you doing?’ I said, trying to laugh it off. “She was 27 and I was 15. I wanted her to care about me but I felt more afraid than safe when she was around. “I wanted us to be close – more like a parental figure – not in this way.”  Evans became “controlling and bossy” and even called Katrina’s school to say if there were any problems they were to call her. But things escalated even further when Evans began forcing the girl to take part in sex games at her flat. Katrina said: “One evening when she stayed over at dad’s house she tried to make me perform a sex act on her. It was repulsive. “I said ‘I don’t want to’. But she carried on and ignored me. I felt powerless and afraid. Maybe I wasn’t a tiny child but she had so much control over me.  “Inside I was crying – this woman who I looked up to and loved was now abusing me. She seemed to get a thrill out of the fantasy of being caught. “One morning I was ironing my school uniform and Deborah walked into the room. She said to me ‘You are gay’. But I answered ‘I’m not gay’. “She gripped me hard. ‘You are gay and you will always be gay’, she said aggressively.” The abuse, which went on for five months, was eventually reported to police 12 years later, with Katrina using diary entries she made as a girl as evidence.  Evans, who at the time owned catering firm Cardiff Cuisine Catering with her girlfriend, was charged with 11 counts of indecent assault. She denied the attacks ever took place during a trial at Cardiff Crown Court in February this year but was eventually found guilty and jailed for seven years. Katrina, who gave evidence in court and has bravely waived her legal right to anonymity, said: “I looked over at her to gauge her reaction but there was none. She showed no emotion. “It took me 12 years to speak because I blamed myself for so many years. But when I got to 27 myself I realised what she had done was very wrong.

A shocking video emerged of two women known as \u0027Black Juicy\u0027 and Lizzie in a physical fight, with kicks and punches being thrown around. One of them was pushed to the floor as they screamed at each other and threw around names such as s**t. A coffee cup, which reportedly contained Jim Beam whisky, was also hurled. It was unclear what caused the bizarre altercation in Shildon, County Durham on Sunday afternoon.  But according to the Daily Mail , the women are actually good friends who had a fall out after an all-day drinking session for bank holiday.   The pair were named as Lyndsey Stewart, 27, and Joanne Heckles, 41, who is a grandmother nicknamed \u0027Black Juicy\u0027. Reports said they\u0027d been drinking whiskey before the fight, which was captured on camera by John Canty. But apparently the violence didn\u0027t come between them and they\u0027re still friends. They said they\u0027d never fought before and blamed the booze. A neighbour said the pair were embarrassed about what happened.   A spokeswoman from Durham Police told  a 41-year-old woman was arrested but released without charge.  She said: Police were called to Albion Avenue, Shildon, following reports of two women fighting in the street on Sunday, May 27. One woman was arrested on suspicion of assault however no further action has been taken. Footage of the incident was viewed more than 1.5 million times in 24 hours after it was published on social media.  In the video, the brunette woman, Black Juicy, stands at the door of her house shouting at the blonde female, Lizzie. Lizzie then lifts up her pink strapless playsuit to show her bottom to Black Juicy and mockingly twerks in front of her. In response to this, Black Juicy shouts at Lizzie and calls her a s**t, an utter s**t before picking up her mug of tea. Lizzie then hurls inaudible abuse at Black Juicy and pushes her with both of her hands into her house.  Black Juicy retaliates and throws her mug of tea at Lizzie\u0027s face, who manages to kung-fu punch the cup away from her face. This astonishing feat is shown in slow motion again in the video. The two women then return to physically fighting each other and slap each other in the face. Black Juicy then grabs Lizzie by her pig-tails, putting her in a headlock whilst the two continue punching each other. As the drama continues, Lizzie falls onto the street and as she does this, Black Juicy briefly forgets about her and starts shouting at a neighbour, saying: I\u0027m sick of you.

Kaylee Muthart said she took a hit of laced methamphetamine without knowing in February which left her in a drug-induced psychosis. Under a state of hallucination she found herself in, she gouged her own eyes out using her hands and permanently blinded herself. The incident happened outside a church in Anderson, South Carolina, US and was just days before she intended to go to a drug rehabilitation unit, according to reports.  Kaylee had to have emergency surgery to clean her empty sockets and spent weeks recovering, which included time at a psychiatric unit.  But since the beginning of March she has been allowed back to her mum\u0027s house and is on the road to recovery.  She has stayed clean of illicit drugs and is beginning to adapt to her life without her sight. Kaylee said she felt like she was back to herself, and revealed she likes sleeping because dreaming gives her the illusion that she can see something.  She told People : “My dreams are colorful, and it’s like being able to see again - I like sleeping a lot because it’s like I can see.”   Kaylee has bravely taken part in mobility and orientation training and is trying to be optimistic. But she admitted there are times when she feels frustrated and sad about the new reality of her life. She uses Netflix by selecting its audio description option and has spent time playing the guitar and the piano. In July, she is set to have an operation to her orbital cavities that will prepare her to be able to get prosthetic eyes in the future.

A local paper reported several tourists had been hurt in the mass punch-up in the party resort’s raucous strip of bars and nightclubs.  The violent altercation happened outside a tattoo parlour at roughly 5.30am today.  Footage published by island newspaper Ultima Hora showed a bare chested youngster - also thought to be British - exchanging blows with another man after landing the first punch before he ended up on the ground.  He had to be held back by other revellers as he tried to continue the fight in confusing scenes filmed by a witness on a mobile phone and watched by scores of other youngsters including some who appeared to be encouraging the two men. Seconds later another fight thought to be linked to the first incident kicked off a few feet away.

Another man could be heard repeating over and over in English: “Two people, two people, stand back”  It was not immediately clear how the unnamed woman tourist had been hurt. She is thought to have been with one of the groups involved in the fighting. There was no obvious police presence and Ultima Hora reported local security guards had stepped in to separate the warring holidaymakers.

This surprising discovery was made by images captured by NASA \u0027s New Horizons spacecraft which flew past Pluto in July 2015.  Experts said the likely source of the dune grains is methane ice blown from nearby mountains. Despite its low atmosphere, moderate surface thermal winds of between 30 and 40 kmh had sufficient force to shift the solid grains of frozen gas into tell-tale ridges with a stripped effect. Until now it had been a mystery how the dunes formed on the planet which has an atmosphere 0.001 per cent as thick as Earth\u0027s - which has dunes of sand. The discovery adds Pluto to a list where dunes are known to form including Earth, Mars, Venus, Titan and Comet 67P.  Dr Matt Telfer, lecturer in physical geography at the University of Plymouth, said: We knew that every solar system body with an atmosphere and a solid rocky surface has dunes on it, but we didn\u0027t know what we\u0027d find on Pluto. It turns out that even though there is so little atmosphere, and the surface temperature is around -230C, we still get dunes forming. Pluto has a low gravity with is a twelfth that of the Earth, sparse atmosphere, extreme cold, and surface composition of Nitrogen gas (N2), carbon monoxide (CO), water (H2O), and methane (CH4) ices. Dr Telfer and colleagues from Germany and the US spotted a collection of 357 pale ridges, as well as six darker wind streaks, located on one of Pluto\u0027s largest features, a vast ice plain called Sputnik Planitia. Along the western area of the plain, the ridges run parallel with a mountain range. But further east, they shift their orientation and become more spread out, a pattern also seen in the wind streaks. Several clues revealed these landforms were created by wind because of the location of the ridges and their distribution patterns. Modelling showed wind can create these dunes once the grains are airborne. However a process called sublimation is required first, to lift the grains from the planet\u0027s surface.  In this process, the sun heats surface ice enough that gas is released into the atmosphere, lofting particles into the air as a result. Dr Eric Parteli, Lecturer in Computational Geosciences at the University of Cologne, said: On Earth, you need a certain strength of wind to release sand particles into the air, but winds that are 20 per cent weaker are then sufficient to maintain transport. The considerably lower gravity of Pluto, and the extremely low atmospheric pressure, means the winds needed to maintain sediment transport can be a hundred times lower. The temperature gradients in the granular ice layer, caused by solar radiation, also play an important role in the onset of the saltation process. Put together, we have found that these combined processes can form dunes under normal, everyday wind conditions on Pluto.

Melissa Matos would get high locked away in her blood-spattered bedroom while her eight-year-old daughter, Katherine, helped her younger sister with her homework before getting her ready for school. Katherine would then go upstairs to bring her \u0027sick\u0027 mum food and drink and rub her head to make her feel better, unbeknown that her mum had been ravaged by opiate abuse for almost a decade. At times Melissa, with scabbed spots covering her face, and black circles under her eyes, would spend days and nights in a self induced coma on the toilet floor. Melissa\u0027s harrowing Facebook post, that she shared with the world in a bid to help others escape from the throes of drug addiction, showed haunting pictures of herself looking like a \u0027dead girl\u0027. Now for the first time Melissa, 40, has given an honest and brave account of how she was brought back from the brink of death by the love of her two children.  Katherine had been forced to become the mummy of the house since the age of six when her mum\u0027s life spiralled out of control after Melissa became hooked on Xanax and heroin after doctors gave her prescription drugs to help with postnatal depression and pregnancy complications. My youngest never really talks about it, Melissa told . She doesn\u0027t really remember anything and it didn\u0027t effect her. She\u0027s just proud of my recovery. But my oldest will talk about how it hurt her because I was always locked away in my room and I ignored her. How it was scary seeing me high. I spent most of my days either high or dopesick. My eldest daughter would bring me food and drinks, rub my head, stay by my side like a mother would when her child was sick. She would watch her little sister, help her with homework, help get her ready for school. All the things a mum would do, that at the time, I was not capable of doing. RELATED: Kids film horrifying moment they find their parents overdosing on drugs     My children were always in my care. They were in the house, playing or sleeping. I always used privately, in my room or bathroom. What I recall the most was my bedroom. My walls had blood splatters from trying to unclog needles. My bed sheets always had blood, and cigarette burn holes from falling asleep after using heroin or xanax. As her addiction took hold, Melissa, from Parkersburg, West Virginia, found herself lying, robbing and stealing to support her habit. Melissa, said: The mixture of all of these drugs would turn me into a zombie. I was careless, irresponsible and cold. I was absent as a mother, a wife, a daughter, a friend. I began to lose everything and everyone. This was just the beginning. My opiate addiction quickly escalated into complete chaos. The pills I was taking were not enough anymore so I started doctor shopping. Eventually, that caught up with me, I was blacklisted...and sick. Withdrawing off of the medications had me ready to kill myself.  Somehow Melissa managed to keep her children from coming into contact with any needles as they would either play alone in the house or sleeping - while she was shooting up in her room. They never found her injecting and the needles were always immediately put in a lock box by my ex, she said. The family home was a shambles - never dirty as she \u0027cannot stand filth\u0027 and the girls - now nine and 11 - constantly missed school and she admits she could barely feed them. I spent every day locked up in my room, shooting heroin and snorting xanax, said Melissa. If crack was around, I smoked it. If pills were around, I snorted them. It didn\u0027t matter. I hated myself, hated my life.  In 2015 Melissa overdosed on her bedroom floor as her children played next door. She was saved by paramedics but when she returned home her children went to stay with her parents as her life continued to spin out of control. The (paramedics) told them mummy had passed out from her anemia, said Melissa. It was one of the lowest moments of my life. Still, I was so sick in my addiction, that didn\u0027t stop me. I got home and shot up the same fentanyl that had just almost taken my life. In the next few months I lost two apartments, and just about all of my possessions.  I had started going to an Intensive Outpatient Program but was still actively using. I used to cheat my urine tests, but one day I went in so high that I didn\u0027t even think about what I was doing. I failed my test. Child Protective Services were called. I was going to lose the only things I had left, the only things I loved. That was the day I found sobriety.  Melissa has now been clean since March 1, 2016, and has turned her life around, now working with Alcoholics Anonymous and as a writer and a public speaker raising awareness of drug addiction. She is setting up her own charity RecoverME and works as a behavioural health technician with mothers who have addiction problems to get on the road to recovery. I work with women still sick and suffering, as well as women in recovery. I advocate for their rights as mothers as well. The system we have, unfortunately is much better at taking children away and shaming addicts than providing the necessary help and support to keep families together.

The incredible operation took place at the Federal University of Ceara (UFC), Brazil, in April last year but has only just been revealed after it was confirmed as a success. Patient Jucilene Marinho, 23, has now spoken for the first time and talked about how the revolutionary operation using skin of the tilapia fish has changed her life and allowed her to have sex for the first time. The unorthodox treatment, which was led by gynaecologist, Dr Leonardo Bezerra, is faster, cheaper and less aggressive than the conventional method used for sufferers of Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u0026uumlster-Hauser (MRKH). The rare congenital disorder affects approximately one in 5,000 newborn girls and results in the absence of some or all of the female reproductive organs. The revolutionary treatment involves opening a space between the vagina and anus and inserting a tubular mould lined with the skin of the freshwater fish.  Once in contact with the patient’s body, tilapia skin acts like stem cells and is absorbed and transformed into cellular tissue forming the walls of the canal, similar to that of an actual vagina. Before being used, the fish skin undergoes a special cleaning and sterilisation process in the lab followed by irradiation to kill viruses. The process removes all the scales and fish smell and results in a light-coloured gel dressing that can be stored for up to two years in refrigerated sterile packaging. An ecstatic Ms Marinho spoke for the first time to FocusOn News about how the ground-breaking surgery has changed her life and made her feel like ‘a proper woman’ who now enjoys a healthy sex life. The young university student from Lavras da Mangabeira, was diagnosed in her teens with having no cervix, uterus, ovaries or womb.  However, to doctors’ surprise she developed normally throughout puberty and even experienced menstrual cramping pains in her stomach but never had a period. At the age of 15 she was given the crushing news there was nothing but connective tissue behind the skin blocking the opening of her vagina. “I cried a lot when I found out,” she recalled. “I thought my world had ended. I’d always dreamed of having a baby of my own now I had to accept that wouldn’t be possible.”  She spiralled into a deep depression fearing she would never experience an intimate and loving relationship. This worsened when a teenage boyfriend mocked and broke up with her after discovering the disorder. But last year, six months after agreeing to become the first of four women to have the experimental procedure, Ms Marinho had sex for the first time in her life with her partner Marcus Santos, 24, who she has been with for over a year and who has supported her throughout. “I spent three months recuperating from the operation and then doctors gave me the all clear to have sex in October last year,” Ms Marinho revealed happily.  “At first I was very scared to do it because I thought it would hurt and I was worried it might damage the opening. But it was a wonderful moment because everything worked perfectly. There was no pain just a great deal of pleasure and satisfaction. “I didn’t feel any discomfort and there was no bleeding. Everything felt sensitive in what I’m told is the right and normal way. It was perfectly natural like the opening had always been there,” she confided. Dr Bezerra, who leads a multidisciplinary team of surgeons at the Assis Chateaubriand Maternity School (MEAC), has treated four sufferers with MRKH, also known as vaginal agenesis, with the break-through treatment. It is less invasive surgically than the traditional method which involves creating a vaginal canal using extensive grafts from the patient\u0027s groin. Some 23 patients have undergone the conventional treatment at MEAC over the past ten years. “This procedure can be time consuming and painful as the patient needs to recover from a large incision which leaves a scar that can be unsightly and stigmatising. There is also the possibility of discomfort with the reconstructed tissue,” Dr Bezerra explained. By comparison, neovaginaplasty has a faster recovery rate with no visible scars. There are minimal complications with no risk of rejection or infections the doctor said.  In addition, medical costs and materials are low – a significant benefit in a public health system strapped for cash - with operating times quicker and an abundance of the inexpensive, mild-tasting Tilapia fish readily available from Brazil’s rivers and fish farms. Research shows that tilapia skin, normally thrown away as a waste product, contains large amounts of moisture and is rich in collagen type 1, a protein that promotes healing. It is disease resistant and as strong and resilient as human skin. Since 2015, scientists at the UFC Research and Development of Medicines Nucleus coordinated by Professor Odorico Moraes, have been trialling a radical procedure that uses the moisture-filled skin of the freshwater fish to heal more than 200 victims with severe burns - with notable success. The normal regime is painful and involves regular changes of gauze bandages along with painkillers and ointments. “There was a eureka moment when we thought, if this membrane can be used for burns, why can’t it be used for the vagina,” said Dr Bezerra who began investigating the procedure in January 2016. “To make the ‘new vagina’ we insert a vagina shaped acrylic mould, lined with the skin of tilapia, into the space created between the bladder and the rectum. The device remains there for 10 days to prevent the walls from closing,” the doctor explained.

That was a major factor in coming here,” is how the left-back put it.And he was convinced that will be the case after a chat with United assistant boss Laurie Ellis.The pair know each other, having been team-mates at Raith Rovers during the 2013-14 campaign.“I knew Laurie pretty well from my time at Raith. We got speaking about the prospect (of joining United). Since then it has gone pretty quickly.“Coming to a club like Dundee United is really a pretty simple choice.”Ironically, with new Morton boss Ray McKinnon considering a move for his old work-mate Ellis, it could be the pair don’t end up working together again next season.If United can persuade their highly regarded coach to stay, McKinnon could team up with another of his former Tannadice backroom staff, Darren Taylor.Returning to Booth, after a year spent vainly scrapping to avoid the drop, the ex-Hibs, Arbroath and Brechin man is looking forward to a challenge at the right end of a table.“Last season was tough and we just couldn’t get away from that drop zone,” he added.“This will be a different type of pressure, being expected to win most weeks and one which I will relish.”Booth will battle for the left-back slot with youngster Jamie Robson, who himself last week signed up for another two years at Tannadice.Manager Csaba Laszlo is pleased to have that kind of competition in the squad and to get a man of Booth’s quality and experience.“I’m delighted to bring Callum to Dundee United,” he said.“He is an experienced left-back who has played in the Premiership. Callum will create competition on the left side of our defence and improves the squad. He is a defender who likes to get up the park and helps create attacking situations.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b0d1f489e53b-478x564.jpg ","title":"clarks goals can leave dundee united in good nick ex teammate believes","story":"\t\t\t\t\tHis allegiances these days lie on the other side of the street but Bobby Mann looked on with approving interest as Dundee United fixed up lower division scoring machine Nicky Clark last week.As well the fact he’d like to see his home city back with two Premiership clubs, the former Dundee defender’s attention was sparked by the fact he’s a former team-mate of the new Tangerines striker.And he believes he’s exactly the type Csaba Laszlo needs to get United to the top flight.After leaving Dens Park in 2007, Bobby joined Peterhead and it was during his time at Balmoor his and Clark’s paths crossed.He’s quick to point out, though, back then the there was little indication the teenager he first saw in action would go on to get the goals he has.“I remember him coming to Peterhead, on loan from Aberdeen and then being signed up when he was released by them,” he said.“With us he wasn’t a striker but operated in midfield. He was obviously an attacking player and I think he scored a few goals but he never played right up front.“That might have been because he was young and, when he first arrived, Aberdeen just wanted him getting games. Because we had Martin Bavidge as the main striker, he wasn’t going to get in the team right up top.“Saying that, I’m pretty sure Nicky regarded himself as a midfielder back then and I don’t think there was any thought of moving him forward.”After two seasons and eight goals, Clark moved on from the Blue Toon to Queen of the South in 2011 and, in terms of goals, has never looked back.Whether it was having former Rangers and Hearts front man Sandy as his father, or the foresight of someone at Palmerston, Bobby acknowledged the decision to make him into a striker was a masterstroke.“His dad has obviously had an influence on his career and he might have pushed for him to go up front, or maybe it was just something someone else saw in him that made them think they should give it a try. Either way, it was a great move for him and a player that gets the goals he does is probably just what United need right now.”The fact Clark is a player who knows the Championship well, having played there for Queens, Rangers and now Dunfermline, is a big plus.United now have a few members of their squad who are used to the rigours of the second tier and, for Bobby, that’s the way to go.“When I played in the lower divisions, the teams who were successful were usually ones who had players who knew the league.“United have brought in Nicky and, assuming he’s back fit for next season, they’ll have James Keatings just behind the main striker.“I thought he was a very good signing when he joined up last summer but the season was ruined by injuries. If he’s back, though, you are talking about a player who’s got goals at that level for quite a few clubs now.“These are the type you want – once you go up you worry about a team for the league above.“If you build a team for the league you’re in and get out of it, you find a few of the boys you did bring in are capable of doing well at a higher level.“Some won’t be and will have to be replaced but you are always going to want to freshen the squad each year.“With Nicky, only time will tell how he does if United get back to the Premiership, but he’s a proven scorer in the Championship and, right now, that’s the most important thing.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/03/5abe00fa671c1-848x564.jpg ","title":"confirmed dundee rename dens park","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee FC have completed a historic deal to rename Dens Park in a sponsorship deal.As the Tele exclusively revealed last week, the ground will now be officially known as Kilmac Stadium at Dens Park for the next two years, when the Dark Blues hope to have moved into a new stadium beside Camperdown Park.Managing Director John Nelms said: “We are always looking for new unique revenue streams and this is a fantastic opportunity for the club and it makes it even better that it is with Richard and Kilmac who are and have been lifelong supporters of the club.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/04/5ae33a987e4ee.jpg ","title":"creative dundee launches latest edition of 99 things to see and do in the city","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCreative Dundee has launched its latest edition of 99 Things to See and Do in Dundee.The book, the fourth of its kind, features must see spots in the city, selected by residents, for residents and those visiting the City of Discovery.The guide is split into sections of bites, drinks and sounds, restaurants, bars, live music, indie spots and shops, as well as a take it in section which includes places like The McManus and the DCA.Also included are places to have a stroll and admire the view including, the Law and the Riverside Nature Park.You can also check out the various statues placed throughout the city including Oor Wullie, the penguins and the lemmings.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee council to adopt charter for fairness and equality in workplace","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA fair work charter to oversee fairness and inequality in the workplace is set to be adopted by Dundee City Council.Members of the local authority’s policy and resources committee will be asked to adopt the charter on Monday.Councillors will also be asked to give chief executive David Martin powers to discuss and agree the development of further similar charters with the trade unions.They also want Mr Martin to be given the go-ahead “to advocate and influence the development of similar charters by other employers in line with the council’s commitment to fairness and tackling inequalities”.In his report to the committee, Mr Martin said: “The trade unions have worked with and supported adoption by Dundee City Council of a fair work charter.“Dundee City Council believes that fair work is work that offers employees an effective voice, opportunity, security, fulfilment and respect, and that fairly balances the rights and responsibilities of employers and workers.“We believe that fair work provides benefits for individuals, organisations and society as a whole.”Mr Martin added: “Our people strategy and people charter recognise that our people are our most valuable asset.“It is through having an engaged, skilled, motivated and diverse workforce that we will realise our ambitions to provide excellent services and achieve positive outcomes for the city.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b0fc16ae4c02.jpg ","title":"dundee cyclists get free maintenance work","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCyclists were given a helping hand when an expert carried out free maintenance work on their bikes.Mike Wood, of the Bike Station, was in the city centre fixing and servicing bikes free of charge.The service is funded by Dundee City Council to encourage green commuting.The Bike Station is a registered charity which also recycles donated bikes, sells them at affordable prices and then uses the proceeds to help people across Scotland get in the saddle.Based in Perth and Edinburgh, pop-up events are held in Dundee regularly.

I thought we did an excellent job and I was very pleased with what we achieved.\u0026#8220I will use all those experiences to come down here and be a better manager.\u0026#8220I\u0026#8217m not here to prove anybody wrong. I just feel really hungry to be back in football. My passion is strong and that along with Crawford\u0026#8217s vision for the club is making me very excited.\u0026#8221Rae, who has taken over the running of the club from his elderly father Douglas, has not been afraid to put his own stamp on the club after deciding to axe the popular Jim Duffy as boss.And he believes McKinnon can help fulfil his three-year plan to take the club to the top flight.He said: \u0026#8220One of the regrets my father, who was chairman for 17 years, had was that he never managed to bring top-flight football to the people of Inverclyde.\u0026#8220My father is not keeping to well at the moment, he is quite poorly so fulfilling his dream is now one of my ambitions.\u0026#8220We have a three-year target to do that and when we interviewed Ray, he was an absolute stand-out. He shares our vision.\u0026#8221And McKinnon believes promotion should now be the aim after watching Livingston shock their way to the Premiership.But with just four players currently on Ton\u0026#8217s books, he admits that will be a tough ask.\u0026#8220Everybody should look and be impressed by what Livingston have achieved,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220That will be the incentive for everybody. If you can put the right squad together then hopefully that\u0026#8217s a possibility \u0026#8211 and that\u0026#8217s something we\u0026#8217ll be striving for.\u0026#8220But the target for right this minute and the season ahead is to build a competitive team.\u0026#8220We\u0026#8217ve only got four players signed at the moment so it\u0026#8217s going to be a challenge \u0026#8211 but we look

Public consultation followed with 328 nearby addresses contacted, prompting 104 formal responses.The report to the committee stressed that the brief \"does not seek to create competition between the two locations\".Stratton, it stated, \"has opportunity for larger footprint retail and community buildings whereas Ashton provides opportunity for education, park and higher density residential development\".The focus of development would be \"east Ashton\". The owners of the adjacent western part of Ashton Farm do not intend selling for development but to continue farming the land.Opportunities have been identified for improving public transport links, particularly for Inverness Campus users. Transport agency HiTrans will consider the provision of a new rail station at Seafield, the campus or Stratton.Discussions are underway with the college and Highlands and Islands Enterprise on the \"early delivery\" of sports facilities at the campus. A least one pitch plus associated buildings could cost \u0026pound4.7 million.The expansion also promises to include an upgrade to the busy Inshes roundabout layout.Planning officials are discussing road widening proposals with landowners. Council representatives will attend community council meetings in the coming months to assess local requirements.A 500-space park-and-ride facility was consented as part of the Stratton scheme.The report references a landowner who argued that the brief contradicts an existing development plan and \"fails to recognise Stratton and only refers to potential future development at Ashton Farm\".They also complained that the \"vision map does not reflect the original permission\u0027 town centre at Stratton or the development plan support for it\".Another considers \"Ashton centre\" to be \"an unreasonable competitor location to Stratton\" that \"undermines\" Stratton.It is unclear from the report what long-term employment would be created in the area \u0026ndash an issue raised historically by numerous city councillors who questioned council officials\u0026rsquo aspirations for growth.The report stated: \"Analysis identified that the optimum location for a new centre is at east Ashton.\"This location is, therefore, identified as the core area for new and existing communities to visit as a destination that has footfall generating uses including a new district park, high school and mixed-use centre that includes high-density residential uses.\"It emphasised that the Stratton site does not include provision for a district park or high school with community facilities like those at Inverness Royal Academy.The brief \"does not seek to create competition between Stratton and Ashton\", according to the development planning team.Public feedback has already established an aversion to more development in the area with calls for the focus to instead be on the city centre and brownfield sites, and concern that the recent demand for new homes could stall, leaving a surplus of residential properties.Other responses included a plea that \"pubs should not be allowed\".Smithton and Culloden Community Council chairman David McGrath welcomed the document, with a caveat that it improves access to the nearby Inverness Shopping Park with a short cut for existing residents.A spokesman for the Stratton developer Hazledene said: \"We don\u0026rsquot think it\u0027 appropriate that a competitor town centre should be introduced, as this would add uncertainty and confusion.\"These [Ashton] proposals are early stage proposals and we believe should not be given the same weight as the Stratton permissions already granted.

I find NHS finance statements to be completely opaque.\"We need something much clearer based upon what we need to know each month.\"The council is to write to the health board about the issue.A report to councillors by Bill Alexander, the council\u0027 director care and learning, pointed to poor links between \"financial challenges and service planning processes, particularly regarding adult social care\".He said one of the key motivations behind integrating services had been \"the recognition that the resources of both organisations would become increasingly constrained,\" and that \"major change\" was now required to the way services are planned and delivered.Speaking after the debate, Councillor Davidson said: \"It can improve a lot. I\u0026rsquom still fixated on the most important thing of all, which is to shift the balance of care out of hospitals and into the community.\"The financial challenges (for both organisations) have just got worse. We\u0026rsquove got to make substantial savings but if we plan together we\u0026rsquod be in a much better place.\"It would help to understand each other\u0027 finance statements.\"Asked who was suffering as a result of the lack of clarity, Cllr Davidson said: \"I hope nobody but it\u0027 hard to know.\"NHS Highland did not wish to comment.Friday 1 Jun 2018 7:41 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04102000/04102991.jpg","title":"Ness artwork to link both banks of river","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe wraps have come off the major artwork that is destined to be the centrepiece of the River Ness Public Art Project.The new design involves both sides of the river at the Little Isle salmon pool near Ness Islands.This latest so-called Gathering Place is entitled My Ness, and has been drawn up by the artists who designed the highly controversial previous concept which was dubbed the \"tilting pier\", which was earmarked for a site closer to Eden Court \u0026ndash it was eventually ditched in the face of huge public opposition.The new project is less \"in your face\" and involves a wall starting very low at the Fisherman\u0027 Hut beside Bught Park then rising as it sweeps round until it ends with a viewing platform over the water.The curved wall is repeated on a smaller scale on the Island Bank Road side of the water, the aim being to form two sides of an amphitheatre, embracing the river.Canadian artist Tristan Surtees of Sans fa\u0026ccedilon art company, thought the new design would be embraced by the public.He said: \"We took a different approach this time, and I am confident it is in the right place compared with the tilting pier.\"I think the river is iconic, and this is about framing the river. I think it will help support people\u0027 fond relationship with the river.\"While the final detail has still to be completed, a group of fishermen from Inverness Angling Club seemed relaxed as they studied the computer generated images.Club president Graham MacKenzie said: \"Around the hut is already a gathering place.

It’s great to have the statistical back-up to the arguments.”The announcement was made by Equalities Secretary Angela Constance yesterday at Community Food Initiatives North East (CFINE), which led the six-month pilot scheme in Aberdeen.Ms Constance said: “The pilot in Aberdeen helped us to understand the barriers that some people face when it comes to accessing sanitary products and I’d like to thank CFINE for their help and work on this.“In total, 1,082 women and girls took part and helped us to identify ways that we could make free products easily accessible to those who need them.”An evaluation of the pilot showed two-thirds of those who took part had experienced difficulties in accessing sanitary products in the past.The data also shows 58% (237 women) said they had been unable to access sanitary products at times with some participants saying they had been forced to use alternatives including toilet roll, rags and nappies.Kelly Donaldson, financial capability advisor at CFINE, was one of the team tasked with reaching people who may benefit from the scheme.Ms Donaldson said her own mother was a single parent and found it “very difficult” to provide sanitary products on a budget when she was growing up.She said: “I think it helps when you’re out speaking to women for them to know they’re not alone and that we’ve been through similar kind of experiences which was good as it helped them open up a little bit more.”Ms Donaldson said they visited Aberdeen University, North East Scotland College (NESCol) and “everywhere and anywhere” to reach women across the city.CFINE CEO Dave Simmers said the issue of period poverty has long been an issue of concern for the charity.He said: “We’ve known for a long time it’s an issue for low-income families purchasing their sanitary products and another expense on a low budget and what the pilot did was affirm that.“It’s a natural function, there should be no embarrassment.“The pilot raised awareness of the issue and got people speaking about menstruation.”Meanwhile, the foodbank has revealed it gave out its highest amount of food parcels ever last month – more than 1,450.Emergency items are distributed from its centre on Poynernook Road to those in need.Mr Simmers said it was deeply concerning to see the rise in the use of the foodbank, adding he was worried about the impact the rollout of universal credit may have on the charity.He said: “It is by far the biggest amount we have given out in a month.“What we need to remember is the majority of people seeing us right now are on working tax credits so are in work but are struggling to make ends meet.“Our last highest total for food parcels was around 1,100 and that was in the middle of last year.“Last year we were probably averaging around 800 a month with it sometimes being higher so to reach 1,450 is quite dramatic.“Our foodbank is very busy just now and while people and corporate clients have been fantastic we have come close to running out of items.”Mr Simmers said the charity is expecting a “huge rise” in the demand for its services once Universal Credit is rolled out in October, replacing six other benefits for those in low-incomes or out of work.He said: “Our major concern right now is the roll-out of Universal Credit in October.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/05/5b0b9cf11f9e7-382x564.jpg ","title":"media firm announces partnership with denis laws sporting

“We’re absolutely delighted.“This is a major step forward for us.”The land is listed as “for the common good”, meaning that it is not owned by any party.Due to this, the BSG will have to seek permission from a sheriff to gain the lease, which requires a community consultation to be undertaken, and then to seek planning permission from Aberdeenshire Council.Russ, who has lived in Banchory for 10 years and has three children who all use the existing ramp, regularly updates the skaters in Banchory about the progress of the park.He said: “They’re all really excited about the prospect of the park, but of course, they’re really impatient, almost as bad as me.”BSG estimates that the park will cost between £150,000 and £200,000, and has said that plans for the park will depend on the

growing collection when she competes in the Scottish 3,000m Championships at Glasgow’s Scotstoun stadium tomorrow evening.The Edinburgh University sports science student won the national indoor under-20 title over this distance in January and last summer she won the Scottish senior women’s 5,000m gold.Lang is currently showing outstanding form and it would be no surprise if she won again.Last weekend she knocked almost eight seconds off her previous best 1,500m time with an outstanding victory in a British Milers Club race at Watford.Her time of 4min 20.92secs leaves her within four seconds of the qualifying mark required for a place on the Great Britain team for this summer’s world junior championships in Finland.She said: “At the start of the season I didn’t think I’d be anywhere near the qualifying standard so I haven’t really thought about the world championships.“At Watford I was aiming to get under 4:25 but I was surprised to be so far below that so I was very happy.“I’ll go to the English Championships next month and try to run well and see what happens after that.“Hopefully I can run another fast time there.”Earlier this month Lang scored a notable double at the Scottish East District championships, winning the 800m in a personal best 2:12.12 and taking the 1,500m crown in 4:32.64.The only disappointment she has suffered this summer came in the British Universities and Colleges Championships at Bedford.The former Aberdeen Grammar pupil looked to be in control of the race and heading for a fast time as the leading group went through the bell, but with 300m to go she tripped and fell.By the time she gathered herself together the leaders were out of reach but she bravely carried on to finish in 10th position.She said: “I’m not sure exactly what happened.“I tripped as another girl came alongside me.“It all happened so fast but it was really disappointing as I felt I was having a good run.”Lang has bounced back superbly from that setback and looks to be heading towards more successes in the weeks ahead.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week 2","story":"\t\tHannah O\u0027HanlonUpdated: 11/05/18, 8:40 amLikeGoogle

At times when the builders are working the gulls understandably leave the site but then return during the evenings and at weekends. Several birds were again sitting on apparent nests as recently as May 4, however it looks like many others may have moved elsewhere.Measures have since been taken by the builders to encourage the birds to leave the area prior to laying their eggs and to give them a chance of nesting elsewhere soon. Recently I had a meeting with SNH (Scottish Natural Heritage) and the RSPB and both were sympathetic and understanding of the situation.I also plan to meet with the Scottish Canals environmental scientist soon in the hope that perhaps provision can be made, within the scope of the hub project, to allow for a nesting area for the Common Gulls in future years at the site.This could give rise to an exciting opportunity enabling the public and visitors to the new heritage centre to view these gulls raise their chicks, for which is effectively the rarest colony of nesting birds in the Crinan Canal corridor.Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,This week Allt Dearg Wind Farm distributed over £135,000 to the Ardrishaig Community Trust, which holds the village\u0026#8217s share in this locally owned wind farm.Combined with the recent payments to the Tighnabruaich and Tarbert Trusts which hold similar shares in the neighbouring Sròndoire Wind Farm, together with the wind farms\u0026#8217 contributions to the local educational trust, this brings the total direct community benefit payments from these projects to well over £ 1 million.This is a significant milestone for the projects, and highlights the socio-economic advantages of local ownership in wind power. Despite its relatively small capacity Allt Dearg is the single largest contributor of community benefit payments in Argyll.This week the UK Government published the results of its latest tracking survey of public attitudes to energy and climate change. This shows continued growth in support for on-shore wind, and eight in ten agreed that renewable energy developments should provide direct benefits to the communities in which they are located.Some objections to wind farms remain, and our turbines remain visible in the distance. We hope that the views of Allt Dearg and Sròndoire might remind such objectors that we are economically dependent on what we can produce from the limited options available to us in remote rural areas. That our particular wind farms are able to make a significant contribution to local employment and deliver funding direct to our neighbouring communities, whilst supplying around 20 per cent of Argyll and Bute’s annual domestic electricity requirements from a clean renewable resource, is very satisfying.We would like to thank all those who have made these projects the successes they are, and in particular thank those local community councillors and trust members who have given so much of their time in recent years to make this all happen. For our part, we will continue our efforts to grow the industry and economic activity that provides secure employment and opportunity for our local community.We look forward to our community partners being able to invest the fruits of these wind farms into exciting local projects.Mary Broadfoot of Stronachullin and James F Lithgow of OrmsarySir,Loneliness is a major issue in society and affects everyone from all walks of life, regardless of age or ability.That’s why we’re pleased the Scottish Government is looking at the development of a new approach to tackling the issues of loneliness and social isolation – something we have first-hand experience of and how it affects many of the people we support in Scotland.Following a recent survey of over 150 service users of our homecare services in Stirling, Falkirk, Perth and Kinross, and Angus which focused solely on loneliness and social isolation, it was revealed that loneliest people receive far fewer visitors each week. While this is hardly surprising, we did find that those who either lived with family or had family close by were less at risk of loneliness and the negative health impacts associated. Our research also highlighted that respondents, in most cases, simply wanted a chat over a cuppa with someone their own age.Social interactions are something the vast majority of us take for granted as we all lead such busy lives, but for someone who is alone, watching time go by very slowly, it’s incredibly painful for them to sit at home day after day with no communication from the outside world.Charities such as Sue Ryder regularly arrange social events for our service users and their families.But if, as a nation, we’re serious about tackling loneliness as a public health issue then we need to be resourcing our local authorities to put in place services or to commission them from the third sector to ensure that no one feels alone and isolated in Scotland.Pamela Mackenzie, director of neurological services and Scotland, Sue Ryder, StirlingSir,This spring we hope your readers will celebrate the royal wedding with their very own Right Royal Tea Party in aid of Meningitis Now.Putting on a spread fit for a royal wedding is a piece of cake with our free fundraising pack and, as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have requested charity donations rather than wedding presents, you can fulfil their wishes whilst helping families affected by this devastating disease.A royal-themed Time4Tea can be held anytime, not just on Saturday May 19, the date of the Royal Wedding. And it can take place anywhere – at home, at work, at school.Just pop the kettle on, slice up a cake or two, homemade or bought (you have to have cake at a wedding) and invite friends, relatives and colleagues to enjoy a cuppa or perhaps even a glass of champagne.The serious point is that you’ll be helping to fight meningitis and move us one step closer to our vision of a future where no one in the UK dies from meningitis \u0026#8211 and everyone affected gets the support they need to rebuild their life.Sadly, despite developments in vaccines, meningitis and septicaemia continue to affect thousands every year and kill more under-fives than any other infectious disease.

Moore took the free-kick, but his curling effort from 27 yards lacked power.Moore, however, was not to be denied his hat-trick and 60 seconds later  steered a good low finish past Scott Urquhart\u0026#8217s left hand.The early first-half jitters returned to the League defence just after the hour mark when hesitation in the box allowed Nikki MacDougall, of host club Tarbert, to nip in and force the ball past Urquhart from nine yards to add a fifth goal for Argyll.A flurry of changes from both sides with 16 minutes remaining saw Scott Soudan and Lewis MacNaughton replace MacDougall and McCallum for Argyll.The league adjusted quicker to the changes and Kyle Reid and Robbie Martin combined well for Martin to pull a goal back in the 77th minute.With five minutes remaining, Soudan\u0026#8217s tenacity in the box robbed Daniel Smith on the six yard line and left him one-on-one with Urquhart.Soudan\u0026#8217s stabbed effort was stopped by Urquhart\u0026#8217s outstretched right foot but, typical of his luck on the day, the rebound fell kindly for the Campbeltown Pupils\u0026#8217 striker who rounded the prostrate Urquhart and walked the ball into the empty net.The full-time whistle ended an entertaining encounter with the players and officials retiring to the Islay Frigate Hotel for the presentation ceremony.The Duncan MacDougall man of the match award was given to Red Star\u0026#8217s Kieran Moore.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"sun brings out the best in lochgilphead golfers","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 17/05/18, 2:24 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowOn a lovely sunny Sunday the gents competed to gain a place to play in this year\u0026#8217s match and knockout competition.Jim Hunter was excited to return a nett score of 58, six strokes below par.

It was a gamble \u0026#8211 but one that paid off, with the business now turning over millions each year.He left the business \u0026#8216at least 10 years ago\u0026#8217, but was a very interested visitor at last week\u0026#8217s \u0026#8216Fyne at 40\u0026#8217 celebrations \u0026#8211 more on pages 16 and 17 \u0026#8211 to mark the company\u0026#8217s four decades in business.\u0026#8216Looking back, I feel quite astonished really,\u0026#8217 he told the Advertiser.\u0026#8216I mean, away back we had a wooden hut, but before that there was a fish box and an umbrella. We were growing shellfish, cooking prawns and smoking a bit of fish.\u0026#8216The restaurant as we see it today was an old farm steading \u0026#8211 well, it was a midden, really. But we slowly evolved within it.\u0026#8216It was open to the slates and the wind used to go straight up the length of the oyster bar. We had a hessian sack to keep down the draught, and it used to stand out at about 45 degrees a lot of the time. It was very primitive for many years, because we were skint.\u0026#8216People sat in their overcoats, but they liked the style. All of a sudden they could get local shellfish, and it just developed from there.\u0026#8217He continued: \u0026#8216Since my time the whole place has had a re-make and it is really, really nice.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s been driven by the volume of people wanting to dine here. I mean, you couldn\u0026#8217t keep up that slightly rustic look. It\u0026#8217s a cracking place now. Just superb.\u0026#8217Johnny Noble sadly died in 2002, aged just 66.\u0026#8216He was an inspiring, lovely man, said Mr Lane. \u0026#8216No matter what disaster befell us no matter what cock-up happened, he was ever-optimistic and just kept us going.\u0026#8216We would have our business meetings in the billiard room at [Johnny\u0026#8217s home] Ardkinglas House, and there would be a bottle of something. That just keeps the morale going.\u0026#8216He was a great man, and wonderful entertainment.\u0026#8217The stories of Johnny Noble are legion, and most are true.Andy Lane recalled: \u0026#8216In the days of the Oyster Bar in our old draughty building, everyone had to muck in. Johnny would go round being the wine waiter for a while. Until, that is, someone would choose an inappropriate wine. At that point he\u0026#8217d start a sort of genial argument with them. In the end he\u0026#8217d sit down with them and you\u0026#8217d never see him again for the rest of the evening.\u0026#8216I don\u0026#8217t think we realised just how important he was for the business until he was gone.\u0026#8217Now living a quieter life in Cornwall with his Dexters, Mr Lane concluded: \u0026#8216My wife and I changed tack in life, really, and it keeps us busy.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest.

Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community.

Whitletts has landed an unenviable spot in the country’s top 10 road tests to avoid. The list, published by recovery firm 24/7 Vehicle Rescue, claims the “nerve-jangling lottery” has put Ayr on the map for all the wrong reasons. It follows a \u0026pound3.5m scheme to increase lanes and install traffic lights on the roundabout in 2006, which has sparked trouble for many trying to negotiate its contours ever since. Transport Scotland held a safety review in 2015 after stats showed Whitletts was more dangerous than the giant M8 roundabout at Hermiston Gait near Edinburgh.  Ranjen Gohri, spokesman for 24/7 Vehicle Rescue, said: “Britain is famed for its roundabouts, and being able to safely negotiate them is a major part of driving in this country. “Unfortunately, many motorists are terrified of them. “This is not helped by some of the cases we’ve gathered that have a fearsome reputation and seem to almost unnerve drivers before they even get to them. “With the volume of traffic and unavoidable problems such as breakdowns, driving in the UK is difficult enough without having to attempt some of these roundabouts from hell.” Also making the top ten is Sheriffhall, which sits on Edinburgh’s city bypass, and Haudagain in Aberdeen, which is due for a \u0026pound30m redesign later this year.

We moved in together early 2016 and then Stuart proposed whilst we were on holiday in Dubai in September 2016. “He bought me a pair of Valentino shoes and got down on one knee to put them on for me before pulling out my beautiful engagement ring that he’d designed himself and had made by a jeweller in Dubai.  The couple tied the knot on Saturday, February 24 this year, with the ceremony held at Glasgow University Memorial Chapel and the reception at Boclair House in Bearsden. Erin said: “It was a nice contrast of traditional and modern glam. “We were so lucky getting a beautiful crisp sunny day - right before the Beast from the East came later that week. “Stuart and I wrote our own ceremony and personalised vows. “We ended the night with [I want to spend my] Life with You by The Proclaimers. “It really was a perfect day and more than we could of dreamed of! The bride wore Everlasting by Caroline Castigliano, from The Bridal Garden in Glasgow, with her bridesmaids wearing customised blush Haley Paige dresses from Anne Priscilla, Glasgow.

The couple celebrated being newlyweds with a trip to the sunshine. Erin said: “We squeezed in 10 nights in at the Centara Ras Fushi resort in the Maldives before Stuart went offshore again. “It was paradise!

Emma Lawson of Betty Bluebell, based in East Kilbride, pieced together the bouquets with Ashley Nimmo, Ellis Dewhurst and Jett Paterson of Allure in Kilmarnock creating the hair and beauty looks for the day. As for their cake, the couple opted for four-tiers with all their favourite flavours, including red velvet. A local lady called Gianna made the cake, completed with a handmade topper by friend Rachel Currie.

Neighbours have slammed fast motorists in the Heathfield area and also in Whitletts Road. One resident claims an existing speed camera on Whitletts Road currently isn’t in operation and insist vehicles are zooming past her home at speeds of up to 50mph. She is calling for a speed camera further along the road to curb fast drivers. The concerned woman has called for the camera between Whitletts Road and Mainholm Road. Speaking at this month’s North Ayr Community Council, she said: “I am convinced the speed camera in Whitletts Road is not switched on. “I can hear cars at 6am or 7am travelling at more than 30mph coming into the town and the same going out.  “We need a speed camera.” Councillor Ian David said: “I am waiting for a response from the Partnership Panel as speeding in Whitletts Road was mentioned and it will be taken up with the police.” Speeding was also a hot topic discussed at last month’s Newton and Heathfield Community Council held in Newton Pavilion. Community councillors highlighted problems with speeding cars in Alderston Avenue and Northfield Avenue, and the problem of these streets being used by drivers as rat run to avoid the traffic lights in Prestwick Road. One woman said: “(There is) speeding in Alderston Avenue and there are a few children who stay in that street at the corner and the cars are turning right on to Northfield Avenue.” Police attending the meeting said they would do their best to monitor the situation. A council spokesman said Police Scotland/Safety Cameras Scotland administer speed cameras: “Safety cameras in Scotland are operated under the rules and guidelines of the Scottish Safety Camera Programme.”  A Police Scotland spokesman said: “The speed detection cameras are rotated around camera housing sites and have the ability to be used at any time. “You can find more information on the Scottish Safety Camera Programme and the location of camera sites by visiting www.safetycameras.gov.scot” In March, the Post reported that more than 13,000 speed offences have been captured on Ayrshire’s roads over the past three years Fast drivers were caught 13,103 times racing through the streets at breakneck speeds across the county from 2015 to 2017.

Calls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years. But the request could be snubbed in favour of a joint sporting celebration, the Post understands. A request for the engagement, lodged in the aftermath of Ayr’s success, is being considered by officials. Former cop Alasdair Malcolm, now a volunteer at Somerset Park, has called for the recognition. He said: “Every effort should be made to mark this fantastic achievement. “Ayr United are an integral part of the local community and, particularly through their Academy programme, have close working relationships throughout local schools and community groups. “The club, which has been a feature of the town since 1910, have had an outstanding season.” Ayr became the first club in the UK to score 100 goals in domestic competition en route to their title.  And their championship was the first to be clinched on home soil for 90 years. Mr Malcolm, secretary of the Ayrshire Golf Association, said: “It would be fitting if the local authority, by way of a civic reception or similar event, would mark the achievement of the management, players, officials and staff.” South Ayrshire Tory leader, Martin Dowey, added: “It is a wonderful achievement and one that is worthy of a civic reception. “A prosperous Ayr United is good for the town and we will be calling on all councillors to recognise the title win.” However, it’s believed there may be other invites on the guest list of any civic celebration. Carrick Rugby Club, three-time winners of the BT National Shield, and Commonwealth gold medallist Paul Foster, are among those in their thoughts. A council spokesman said: “A request has been received and will be considered in line with our civic hospitality guidelines.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"win a summer shopping spree","story":"NewsWin a summer shopping spreeTo help you get fashion and beauty- ready for summer, Debenhams at Ayr Central are hosting a fabulous VIP shopping event on Thursday June 7.\u0026nbspShareByAyrshire Post10:35, 30 MAY 2018Updated10:36, 30 MAY 2018NewsGet ready for summer and be in with a chance of winning a shopping spree\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWIN A SUMMER SHOPPING SPREE!

Wren Kitchens will move into a 10,000sq ft unit at Heathfield this September, the Post can reveal. The firm, based in Lincolnshire, will make its first foray into Ayrshire when the store opens its doors. Its nearest outlet is currently more than 40 miles away at Abbotsinch, near Paisley. The addition comes as a welcome boost for park bosses, who are set to lose three retailers this year. Homebase will bow out on June 24, joining Carpetright and Maplin on the casualty list. The departures will see 50,000sq ft of trading space lost. However, Alastair Dickie, director at Heathfield’s developers Ediston Properties, said: “This is a positive piece of business. “Wren are an expanding company and this represents their first store in Ayrshire.  “They clearly view Ayr as a place to be and we are happy to have them on board. “It will mean jobs, not only in store but indirectly for fitters.” Wren will move into the unit vacated by the former PC World. The firm, which was founded in 2009, employs more than 4000 staff. It comes as park bosses prepare to seal a deal with another new name on site. Mr Dickie added: “Since acquiring the park we’ve let out ten units and don’t anticipate stopping there.” Ediston bought Heathfield in 2011 in a deal worth \u0026pound31.8 million. Retail giants such as M\u0026ampS, DFS and Costa have all moved in as part of the park’s overhaul in the intervening years.

This must have been a favoured site well-placed beside a coaching inn on the main road North.\nThe 1860s saw the further development of the railways begun five years previously.\nBefore this Peebles lived up to its reputation of being, \u0026ldquoAs quiet as the grave or as Peebles. With the railways came industry and people and money.\nCommercial Peebles began to develop and the Northgate was no exception. Up until then the Northgate was little more than the road out of town with several pastoral tofts strung out along it.

He was also a member of the Peeblesshire Rifle Volunteers.\nThen as now, such organisations accommodate a little social networking.\nIt is not surprising then that Charles Ker, also a Volunteer and his sister acquired one of these tofts from a comrade.

representing so many young soldiers of the war - with thousands.\nThe show will also incorporate stories about local men at each performance, which are being sourced as part of a community engagement project led by Legion Scotland.\nWorking with the likes of schools, youth groups and history societies, the veterans charity is helping research the local area\u0026rsquos contribution to the war in order that these stories might be preserved and passed down to future generations.\nProfessor Norman Drummond, chair of the Scottish Commemorations Panel appointed to oversee the WW100 commemorations on behalf of the Scottish Government, added: \"By the end of the war, thousands of men from Scotland had gone valiantly to the frontline, a high proportion of whom never returned.\n\"For many survivors, devastating injuries and the trauma of war changed their lives forever, while the nation as a whole grieved the vast loss of loved ones.\n\"It is vital that we continue to commemorate these losses today, and the Far, Far From Ypres tour, a key part of Scotland\u0026rsquos Armistice centenary programme, will carry this message to people of all ages across the country as we encourage families to attend with all generations in tow for what will be a highly moving and educational experience.\"\nThe tour is being delivered by WW100 Scotland in partnership with Legion Scotland and Poppyscotland.\nCabinet Secretary for Culture, Tourism and External Affairs Fiona Hyslop, added: \"World War I had a devastating impact on our nation, with no town or village unaffected.\n\"The Far, Far From Ypres tour, part of the broader programme of activity to commemorate Scotland\u0026rsquos Armistice centenary, will ensure that we continue to learn more about and reflect on what we have learned from the First World War.\n\u0026ldquoUntil the end of 2018, through a series of events taking place across Scotland, Scots can continue to reflect on the devastating impact of WWI and its lasting social and civic legacy, ensuring that the brave soldiers who fought in one of the world\u0026rsquos most brutal conflicts will never be forgotten.\"\nTickets\n, which cost cost \u0026pound15 (\u0026pound10 concession), for the Selkirk show on August 5 are available from the Scott\u0026rsquos Selkirk Shop, 18 Market Place.\nThey, along with tickets for other performances, can also be purchased online at http://bit.ly/2KCsV9g.\nLisa Denham, creative communities manager for charity Live Borders believes the Far, Far From Ypres tour is unmissable.\nShe told us: \u0026ldquoAt Live Borders we are big advocates of touring theatre productions, offering our own Borders Live Touring programme, and this looks fantastic.\n\"The mix of historical impact, strong messaging, community engagement and a stellar cast make it a performance not to be missed.\n\"I recommend those looking to book for the Victoria Halls get their tickets soon!\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Galashiels fashion graduate s cerebral palsy catwalk creations","story":"A FASHION graduate in Galashiels has created an innovative clothing range to help people with cerebral palsy.\nLaura Reid took her inspiration from a book written four decades ago, which revealed that clothing for people with disabilities was either designed for the very young or elderly.\nThe Heriot-Watt graduate\u0027s collection took up the challenge of filling the gap.\nAnd she was influenced from the fashion-forward 1970s to keep on-trend with the mainstream market.\nLaura said: \u0026ldquoCurrently, the options for young adults are limited, with many brands not focusing on the younger adult market and not being financially viable due to the niche market.\n\u0026ldquoI wanted to design a collection which was suitable for my age group -
