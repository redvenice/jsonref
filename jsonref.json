Kate\u0026#39s Alexander McQueen gown has got to be one of the most copied styles of all time, and this breathtaking design is destined to be just as iconic. We\u0026#39ve all been speculating for months as to who Meghan might ask to create the all-important dress. Stella McCartney, Ralph \u0026amp Russo, Burberry or perhaps Erdem? She kept us all guessing right up until the last moment, and as she arrived at St. George\u0026#39s Chapel in Windsor it was announced that it\u0026#39s the work of British designer Clare Waight Keller, Artistic Director at Givenchy. We love the elegant simplicity of this dress. The slight off shoulder neckline, the train... it\u0026#39s perfection.

A trip to Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga in October is being discussed at the highest level and aides are promising that the second half of this year will be \u0027incredibly busy\u0027 for the pair.They will also take a couple of short trips before the summer, including a visit to Dublin.

She has been so touched by how welcoming he has been to her and her mother.\u0027 The couple spent their first night of married life in Windsor Castle\u0027s Lancaster Tower, before enjoying a night at a mystery location. But they will return to work this week, having postponed their honeymoon.

But friends said they were hit by tragedy as meth users exploited her generosity and took over her house          The actress, best known for her role as Lois Lane in the 1978 version of Superman alongside Christopher Reeve, was 69 when she died in her sleep last weekend in her Livingston, Montana home          Margot Kidder\u0027s final days had been beset with health problems brought on by her drinking, close friends of the actress reveal \u0027She became a target for Livingston\u0027s meth scene,\u0027 added Willcox, who had been friends with Kidder for some 30 years. \u0027They took her jewelry, her silver, anything they could get their hands on.\u0027There\u0027s a famous picture of her with Jesse Jackson with their arms raised, that she had in a silver frame. I just hope that is safe — but I don\u0027t know.\u0027She hadn\u0027t realized what was going on. She couldn\u0027t understand why all these strange cars were turning up at her home at odd hours of the day and night.\u0027Thrice-married Kidder, who found fame alongside Christopher Reeve in the 1978 version of Superman, died in her sleep last weekend at her four-bedroom home in Livingston. She was 69.Bruce Becker, attorney for Park County which covers Livingston, told DailyMail.com that authorities are awaiting a toxicology report before determining the cause of death. \u0027It should be ready in two to three weeks,\u0027 he said.          Louisa Willcox (pictured) who was friends with Kidder for more than 30 years, revealed the actress\u0027s home had been taken over by drug addicts Another close friend, author and environmentalist Doug Peacock confirmed that Kidder had been victimized by \u0027a lot of losers\u0027 but said her heavy drinking also contributed to her downfall. Her favorite tipple was cheap rosé wine.\u0027She was never a dull or boorish drunk, just a little crazy and that is how she medicated,\u0027 Peacock told DailyMail.com in an exclusive interview.\u0027Her habits were getting the better of her. She would go on benders and drink too much. From what I heard she was recovering from one of those and went to sleep and never woke up again.\u0027I hauled her into rehab any number of times, most recently a couple of years ago,\u0027 he added. \u0027But she never really stopped drinking.\u0027I wanted her to hang on a bit longer but that stuff catches up with you,\u0027 said. Peacock.Her friends say Kidder was in great pain as a result of a 1990 car accident that left her in a wheelchair for a while and a degenerative back condition.\u0027Her bones were falling apart,\u0027 said Willcox, who said her friend had become really sick after she joined protests against the Dakota Access oil pipeline on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in North Dakota.Kidder collected a huge library of books for a school for children of the protesters who had traveled from all over the country. She took a U-Haul truck full of books to North Dakota but was unprepared for the bitter cold, said Willcox. All she had was a tent, sleeping bag and Jake, her 150 lb. Great Pyrenees.          This was Kidder\u0027s four-bedroom home in Livingston, Montana. Friends say the basement was being used as a meth lab by local drug addicts - who the actress had tried to help          A Park County coroner\u0027s sticker was seen on the side door of her home last Thursday in the wake of her death. Toxicology tests are still being conducted to determine exactly how she died          The meth-heads allegedly stole her jewelry, silver, and even Kidder\u0027s medication \u0027She didn\u0027t want to die there. It was just so cold,\u0027 said Willcox who also spent time at the protests in the winter of 2016-17.Willcox said she and her husband David Mattson left Livingston for six weeks this winter. When she returned she found Kidder had lost some 40 lb. \u0027She was the ever-shrinking woman,\u0027 she said.But she was still dedicated to the numerous progressive causes that she had devoted her life to, working for days on end with no rest, due to her bipolar condition.\u0027I called it Margieland,\u0027 said Willcox. \u0027Her life was chaos. It\u0027s all terribly tragic.Peacock, a Vietnam Green Beret who spent nearly two decades living among grizzly bears in the Montana wilderness as a way of therapy after the war, said his friend\u0027s death did not come as a shock to him. \u0027She was in poor health,\u0027 he said.The Grizzly Years author became friends with Kidder after the actress suffered a mental breakdown in Los Angeles in 1996.She had flown there from her home in Livingston to get her computer fixed and was discovered ranting in a back garden with her teeth smashed in after an attempted rape.She was taken in by police and that\u0027s when she called. \u0027She was allowed one phone call and she called me. She knew I was the one person in the world that would understand that level of madness, and I was,\u0027 said Peacock.\u0027She was delusional and I understood what she was talking about as I had the same demons that were visiting her. She thought she was being followed by the CIA and her ex-husband.\u0027I just listened to her. We had a calm conversation and I didn\u0027t say get help or go see a shrink and she appreciated that. I had been in similar predicaments myself not knowing what was real and what was not.\u0027Kidder didn\u0027t even know Peacock well at the time. \u0027We were acquaintances and neighbors. I lived in Jeff Bridges\u0027s old ranch house and at the time she lived two or three miles down the road — which around here is considered close.\u0027Peacock arranged for literary agent Bob Datilla to fly to California to get Kidder. \u0027He is much better in police stations than me — I tend to end up behind bars,\u0027 he said.Couple take their 30-year-old millennial son to COURT to try...Former girlfriend of R Kelly files lawsuit against the...NYPD cops who died in wedding-day crash in rented Maserati...Share this article    Kidder was a well-known activist who took part in the protests against the Dakota Access oil pipeline at Standing Rock in North Dakota.

That lasted for more than 20 years.\u0027But in recent years as Kidder\u0027s drinking got worse, he saw less of her. \u0027Toward the end she needed people to help her. She had some great people and she had some real losers. But she needed people, because she would fall down.\u0027Peacock was the model for George Washington Hayduke, one of the main protagonists in Edward Abbey\u0027s eco-sabotage novel The Monkey Wrench Gang. He spoke to DailyMail.com at his home in tiny Emigrant, Montana, minutes before he left for Botswana, where, he said, he was going to \u0027tear down a fence that prevents elephant migration.\u0027Kidder\u0027s body was cremated soon after her death. But Peacock hopes to be involved in the scattering of her ashes when he returns from Africa.\u0027She told me she was going to put in her will that she wanted me to scatter her ashes in an impossible-to-find valley in the Absaroka Mountains. It was her favorite spot.\u0027But I haven\u0027t heard from her lawyer, so I don\u0027t know whether that will happen.\u0027Kidder\u0027s brother, John, a Green Party politician from British Columbia, Canada, traveled to Livingston, after his sister\u0027s death. Margot had campaigned for him over the years.          Kidder and neighbor Doug Peacock became close friends after Kidder suffered a mental breakdown in Los Angeles in 1996. Peacock says he also took the actress to rehab for her drinking \u0027many times\u0027           Kidder\u0027s long-time friend Doug Peacock, 76 (pictured outside his home in Emigrant, Montana) said her death did not come as a shock to him since she had been in poor health for years           Kidder and Peacock had a close friendship that lasted 20 years, but the 67-year-old saw less of her after her drinking worsened, he said Kidder had lived in the center of Livingston for the past 19 years. She was often seen riding her bicycle around town. That bike was still parked outside the home four days after her death. A yellow coroner\u0027s tape sealed the door warning people to keep out. A woman at the house told DailyMail.com she wasn\u0027t ready to talk.The family\u0027s only comment was a statement from her son-in-law, Chad Franscoviak. \u0027On Mother\u0027s Day, my wife, Maggie McGuane, was brought by the Park County Coroner and Livingston Police Department into her mother Margot Kidder\u0027s home following her death, Franscoviak said.\u0027The experience has been difficult for her and she is choosing not to make public comment until after the findings of the Park County Coroner\u0027s office have been released. We ask that you respect our family\u0027s privacy during this sad time.\u0027Kidder married three times, but none of them lasted more than 18 months. She originally visited Livingston with first husband Thomas McGuane, who directed her in the movie 92 In The Shade, and fell in love with the area.But her marriage broke up soon after as McGuane was having an affair with her co-star Elizabeth Ashley.She was also married to actor John Heard for six days and French director Philippe de Broca. She famously had affairs with former Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau and directors Steven Spielberg and Brian de Palma. Maggie, 42, was her only child.After her third marriage fell apart in 1984, she said she preferred her dogs to men.Peacock remembered her as someone who loved dogs \u0027more than anyone I knew.\u0027 He said he had helped her bury one of her pets. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/14/4C80E55100000578-0-image-m-10_1526910801534.jpg","title":"Meghans sister calls morally religiously right thing reunite family","story":"    Samantha Markle (pictured left) has claimed Meghan should \u0027do the morally and religiously right thing\u0027 by inviting her into her lifeSamantha called on the Duchess of Sussex to \u0027do the morally and religiously right thing\u0027, adding that their separation should \u0027ride on her conscience\u0027.\u0027I watched the bishop talk about love and unity and forgiveness and I hoped it would strike a chord within Meghan.\u0027I feel a religious and moral obligation to be open to her and not be vindictive or isolating or hurt.Harry and Meghan look deeply in love as they reveal their...Meghan\u0027s snubbed sister Samantha Markle accuses her mother...Share this article\u0027This should ride on her conscience as a moral obligation to at some point communicate with me and be united rather than ided – as that was the whole message.Samantha cashed in Meghan\u0027s wedding by watching her half-sister wed from her home in Florida - alongside a television crew in a paid-for appearance.Her partner Mark Phillips, 60, suggested the appearance was earning her a five-figure sum.Samantha Markle appeared on TV repeatedly ahead of her half-sister\u0027s wedding despite not seeing her for years\u0027You can\u0027t go in there,\u0027 he said outside his home. \u0027She is making big money with an exclusive TV interview.\u0027Samantha also took the chance to lash out at the crown, insisting their family dramas were far greater than the Markle\u0027s.\u0027Well the royals had generations of scandal in their own family.\u0027You\u0027ve got inbreeding, you\u0027ve got substance abuse, you\u0027ve got alcohol abuse, you\u0027ve got infidelity.\u0027She also attacked the royal family for their decision not to give her father a coat of arms - unlike the other fathers of commoners who marry into royalty.Samantha\u0027s offer to build bridges with the Duchess is a huge U-turn for the wheelchair-bound Markle.She also claimed Meghan\u0027s mum Doria Ragland \u0027hogged the limelight\u0027 at her daughter\u0027s wedding.           Samantha made a number of controversial statements in the weeks leading up to the wedding          The Duchess of Sussex\u0027s half-sister also claimed Doria Ragland, the bride\u0027s mother, had \u0027hogged the limelight\u0027 at the ceremony          Samantha Markle appeared on Loose Women and Good Morning Britain in the weeks before Harry and Meghan tied the knot  Ready to broadcast: A satellite truck was parked outside Samantha\u0027s Floridia house during the weddingShe has been accused of cashing in on her half-sister\u0027s fame by writing a book about her entitled The Diary of Princess Pushy\u0027s Sister.She added Meghan has made her feel as if her family is not worthy by \u0027excluding\u0027 them, suggesting this was against the tenets of her baptismal vows.She added if Meghan has been in the Queen\u0027s church she should practice what she preaches.She also revealed Meghan\u0027s father Thomas, 73, who two weeks ago suffered a heart attack is now being secretly cared for in LA.He is reportedly taking blood thinners.She called on Prince Harry to fly Thomas over once he is back to full health in order that he is able to fulfill his lifelong dream of visiting Buckingham Palace. Meghan Markle\u0027s sister pleads for her to reunite troubled family and jet shamed dad over for Buckingham Palace visit"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/22/02/4C83270400000578-0-image-a-23_1526953780212.jpg","title":"Charlize Theron set play Megyn Kelly film Fox News","story":"Charlize Theron (left) will play Megyn Kelly (right) in a film about Roger Ailes\u0027 downfall          Fox News anchors Chris Wallace (left), Megyn Kelly and Brett Baier (right) are seen at a Republican presidential debate in 2012.

committee) claimed todaySpeaking in Argentina today Mr Johnson said: \u0027I believe the Chancellor of the Exchequer has given an authoritative opinion on this matter, which is that it is absolutely not the case that Brexit has damaged the interests of this country. Mr Rees-Mogg told MailOnline said: \u0027The Governor of the Bank of England cannot even get his forward guidance on interest rates right which is his main responsibility so his endless crying wolf over Brexit simply discredits him and sadly the Bank.\u0027The Governor said that the UK\u0027s economy is \u0027up to two per cent

Alan Parker with Samantha Cameron and Justin Forsyth at the Save the Children\u0027s Secret Winter Gala in 2014Sir Alan, who stepped down from StC earlier this year after the aid sector sex abuse scandal broke, also said he and other directors vetoed a £20,000 bonus awarded to Mr Forsyth while the investigation was under way.Mr Forsyth quit his role as deputy executive director of Unicef in April after allegations of inappropriate behaviour towards female members of staff emerged during his time at Save the Children, where he was chief executive between 2010 and 2016.Sir Alan told MPs in the International Development Committee that the charity had spoken with a third-party headhunter about Mr Forsyth but that it was StC policy \u0027not to mention things if they have not been the subject of formal disciplinary process\u0027.He added: \u0027It wasn\u0027t a lucid formal process.

His unconventional approach to business is said to persist in his tendency to kick off his shoes during meetings.Sir Alan, 62, started Brunswick in his parents\u0027 front room in 1987, but the firm now boasts many high-profile clients, including EMI, Pearson, Reuters and Time Warner. It is thought to have advised more than a quarter of FTSE 100 listed firms.Said to be a natural Labour supporter, Sir Alan was involved in attempts to rebrand Gordon Brown\u0027s public image during his ailing premiership.

She also co-founded and served as the senior vice president of the financial services firm, NOW Corp.She also founded a children’s beverage company called Nourish, is CEO of legal consulting firm Sage Works and, under the pseudonym Selena Montgomery, has written many romantic suspense novels and has sold more than 100,000 copies.Stacey Abrams, Minority Leader of the Georgia House of RepresentativesFrom 2007, Abrams became the first woman to lead either party in the Georgia General Assembly and the first African American to lead in the House of Representatives.As Minority Leader, she worked with Republican Governor Nathan Deal’s administration to reform the HOPE Scholarship Program and co-sponsored the legislation that preserved the initiative by decreasing the scholarship paid to Georgia students, as well as funding a low-interest loan program.  Stacey Abrams seen here announcing she has qualified to run for governor in Atlanta in 2018Despite having similar policies, as Vox explained, the difference in the policies of Stacey Abrams and Stacey Evans comes down to their different handling of the HOPE Scholarship Program.‘This dispute has several ins and outs, but the basic shape of things is that Deal proposed swinging cuts to the program that once guaranteed free in-state tuition to any Georgia high school graduate who maintained at least a B average.‘Abrams cut a deal with Deal that reduced the extent of the cuts but still pared back the program substantially. Evans stood strong in opposition,’ Vox reported.Georgia Primary 2018Stacey Abrams is running for Governor of Georgia in the 2018 Georgia gubernatorial election and she will be up against Stacey Evans in the Democratic primary in what has been dubbed ‘the war between the two Staceys.’Both Staceys have similar policies on health care, education and their opposition to President Donald Trump. The Democrat representative for Georgia will be announced on May 22, 2018, in an attempt to damage Republican control over the state.Despite Georgia being far from a swing state, Hillary Clinton was close to winning in the state during the 2016 election, more so than Ohio or Iowa, and this has given the Democratic Party hope of electing a governor there for the first time since Roy Barnes in 1998.This being an important election, it has garnered media attention along with GOP contender Michael Williams breaking news with his idea of touring Georgia with a ‘deportation bus’. But he is unlikely to make it to the runoff election in July 24, with the Republican nomination thought to be won by Casey Cagle or Brian Kemp.Stacey Abrams pollsPolls conducted for FOX 5 Atlanta reveal Stacey Abrams is leading the race for the Democratic nomination for Governor with 58.2 per cent, with Stacey Evans at 19 per cent and 23 per cent left undecided.  Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Evans seen here participating in a debateCasey Cagle is in the lead for the Republican nomination at 30.5 per cent, with Brian Kemp in second place with 19.5 per cent.Stacey Abrams endorsementsHillary Clinton endorsed Stacey Abrams as the Democratic candidate over former state representative Stacey Evans and said: ‘A Yale educated attorney, Abrams is the only candidate with bold new plans to ensure Georgians have access to good jobs, quality public schools, affordable child care and higher education.’Abrams has also been endorsed by Bernie Sanders, who said that she had ‘real solutions that will help the lives of working people in Georgia’.

John Bannon of the US Coast Guard in Honolulu said in a statement. So far the laze has traveled an estimated 15 miles west of where the lava gushed into the ocean on the Big Island\u0027s southern coast.Another hazard was the potential for methane gas explosions as searing lava neared pockets of rotting vegetation, igniting traces of the flammable gas given off by the decay.           A man wearing shorts, T-shirt and flip-flops takes a picture of a sea of lava on Sunday that has consumed an entire valley          Lieutenant Colonel Charles Anthony of the Hawaii National Guard measures sulfur dioxide gas levels at a lava flow on Highway 137 southeast of Pahoa on Sunday during ongoing eruptions of the Kilauea Volcano\u0027These are quite a big hazard in vegetative areas and the explosions can occur well away from the lava flow itself,\u0027 said USGS geologist Janet Babb.Geologists say Kilauea\u0027s eruption, which has already produced around two dozen lava-spewing fissures, has now entered a more violent phase, in which larger volumes of molten rock are oozing from the ground and traveling farther than before.  Over the weekend, the first major injury occurred when spattering molten rock shot out of a fissure and hit a man in the leg, shattering it. At least 44 homes and other structures have been destroyed in the Leilani Estates and Lanipuna Gardens area of the Puna district and more than 2,000 people have evacuated their homes. The area affected by lava and ash is small compared with the Big Island, which is about 4,000 square miles. The volcano has spared most of the island and the rest of the Hawaiian chain.Officials reminded tourists that flights have not been affected, even on the Big Island. There, travelers are free to do most of the usual sightseeing activities that aren\u0027t associated with the erupting volcano.          Lava flows have picked up speed in recent days, spattering molten rock that hit a man in the leg, the first major injury to occur  Brittany Kimball watches as lava erupts from a fissure near Pahoa, Hawaii on Saturday.

In 2015, she reportedly told the journalist Piers Morgan that she had not always sought showbusiness success.‘As a kid, I wanted to be either the president or a news broadcaster like you,’ she told him.          The actress married Prince Harry after meeting him in London in 2016. She has now become the Duchess of Sussex          Meghan Markle is expected to become a British citizen but she has harboured dreams of becoming President of the USMeghan is still a U.S. citizen because the process to become a fully-fledged Briton is expected to take three years. She is expected to retain her U.S. citizenship, as dual citizenship is permitted. Presidential candidates must be U.S. citizens.Meghan has cultivated a warm friendship with former U.S. president Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, while chat show host Oprah Winfrey, who is one of the most influential women in America, was given a prime seat at St George’s Chapel Windsor, opposite the Royal Family.A royal historian says Meghan would find it difficult to enter U.S. politics while still married to Harry. ‘It is a pretty strong rule that members of the Royal Family keep out of politics,’ he says.Share this article    The newly married Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, leaving Windsor Castle after their weddingBut Harry could, of course, give up official royal duties. His mother, Princess Diana, was said to have considered moving to America.And the claim appears to have caused consternation at Kensington Palace yesterday, with the Duchess giving her official spokesman permission to take the unusual step of issuing a public denial.‘This conversation you describe with an associate is fictitious,’ the spokesman insisted.I am, though, not the only one to hear rumours that Meghan still holds political ambitions.Former Times editor Sir Simon Jenkins says: ‘Her friends and associates affirm that she is a political animal.‘Such is her fame, she could perfectly well follow a route taken by a certain Ronald Reagan. She might lead for the Democrats against a Republican Ivanka Trump. All I can say is, why not?’Meghan’s best friend is Jessica Mulroney, whose father-in-law, Brian, was prime minister of Canada for nine years.Meghan has strong political views and attacked Donald Trump in 2016 for being ‘isive’ and ‘misogynistic’. She might have to reach an accommodation with her new chum George Clooney, who is said to hold political ambitions of his own. Perhaps he could be her running mate."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/22/23/4C89D4DE00000578-5759627-image-m-9_1527027616108.jpg","title":"Moment man slashes driver sledgehammer","story":"    This is the moment an enraged driver attacked another man with a sledgehammer on Tuesday          The attack happened Tuesday in Port Richmond of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania  The sledgehammer-wielding man smashed the driver\u0027s side window several times\u0027The driver of the Kia Sportage probably didn\u0027t realize (the street was a dead end) when he pulled into the parking lot,\u0027 the inidual wrote in the email.In the video, the victim in the attack is seen when he pulled into the parking lot in his gray SUV.The other man then sped quickly into the lot after him and parked close behind his car.The man in the red pickup hurried out of his truck with the sledgehammer in hand, as the man in the SUV appeared to back his vehicle up in attempts to drive off.The sledgehammer-wielding man in neon yellow took the tool and slashed the driver\u0027s side window several times.Family of teen killed in FIU bridge collapse reveal they are...\u0027This was as set up and fake as it gets\u0027: Outrage over...Teenager, 16, is charged with murder of Baltimore cop, who...Share this article    The victim appeared to be badly hurt and was seen leaping after hopping out of his SUV          When the victim got out of the car and leaped away, the sledgehammer-wielding man slashed him in the backThe victim then attempted to leap out of the passenger\u0027s side of the gray SUV, as it the SUV was still in drive.The victim, in a sky blue shirt, appeared to be badly hurt and was seen leaping and holding his leg and arm.The man with the sledgehammer afterward followed him as he limped and proceeded to hit him in the back with it.After the victim fled in his SUV, the man attacking him then slashed the back of his SUV, as the man drove off in the SUV.The crazed man in the red truck then hopped inside and drove off afterward.

Meghan is the first mixed-race member of the royal family in an extraordinary journey for a girl born in LA to a white father and African-American mother who fought her way through the tough world of showbusiness to land a plum role in the TV series Suits.Harry and Meghan\u0027s big day couldn\u0027t have been more different than royal weddings of the past, especially because the prince was visibly emotional throughout - and guests suggested it was the most erse major event in the Queen\u0027s 66-year reign.The prince had looked tearful when he saw his bride for the first time, grabbing her hand telling her: \u0027You look amazing - I missed you\u0027 before tenderly lifting her veil.The new Duke of Sussex also said \u0027thank you, pa\u0027 after his father Prince Charles walked the now Duchess of Sussex down the aisle of St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor, having stepped in at the last moment for Meghan\u0027s father Thomas.           Harry looked very emotional at points in the service and several others in the congregation were in tears on their happy day          Harry and Meghan hold hands as they walk out of St George\u0027s Chapel after the wedding ceremony          A sea of smiling faces greets Harry and Meghan as they leave the church after the American-influenced service conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury          Laughter: One of the well-wishers in the crowds makes Meghan laugh and Prince Harry smile as they continue with their 25-minute tour of the royal market town Meghan Markle told wedding guests: \u0027I\u0027ve found my prince\u0027 in an emotional speech after her ecstatic new husband said the support of his \u0027far better half\u0027 meant he could finally be \u0027me\u0027, it was revealed on Monday.The new Duchess of Sussex also thanked the Queen, Prince Charles and other senior royals for welcoming her so warmly to the royal family \u0027firm\u0027.The bride, resplendent in a white evening gown by Stella McCartney, took to the microphone after a private evening dinner thrown by Prince Charles at Frogmore House.  Meghan\u0027s short speech was yet another part of her modernising mini-revolution of the royal family because royal brides usually leave it to the groom to address guests.The 36-year-old, who wore an aquamarine ring which belonged to Harry\u0027s mother beloved mother Princess Diana, ended her short address by declaring her deep love for Harry and said: \u0027I have found my prince\u0027, according to the Daily Mirror.Before she spoke Harry said his wife, brother, father and friends \u0027are the people that make \u0027me\u0027, me, in my Harry life\u0027 before adding: \u0027Now I\u0027m going to hand over to my far better half\u0027.Earlier he is also believed to have told his bride: \u0027I can\u0027t wait to spend the rest of my life with you.\u0027     One source described how Meghan also expressed her gratitude at how welcoming the prince had been to both herself and her mother, Doria Ragland. \u0027She has been so touched by how welcoming the Prince of Wales has been. So is her mother,\u0027 the source said. \u0027Honestly, they are touched beyond belief. It was important to her to make a point of thanking him publicly, although, of course, he knows privately how she feels.\u0027Another source said: \u0027It is often said that he always wanted a daughter and I think he has been really moved by how well they have got on. There is definitely a special connection there. Meghan\u0027s mother means more to her than anything, so it was lovely to see the way he was so welcoming to Doria too.\u0027          Meghan and Harry looked like movie stars after they changed for the evening reception at Frogmore House          Harry and Meghan travelled in a Jaguar converted to electric power, which had a numberplate with Saturday\u0027s dateMan accused of \u0027hitting\u0027 service dog gets attacked by ownerPrince Andrew brings Beatrice and Eugenie to Chelsea Flower ShowHorrific moment Chinese boy is mauled by pit bull outside pet shopJudge orders 30-year-old to move out of his parents house30-year-old Michael Rotondo is being evicted by his own parentsGove wants \u0027to halve number of areas with unsafe  pollution\u0027Saddam Hussein\u0027s superyacht converted into a hotel for pilotsPrince Harry and Meghan attend Prince Charles\u0027 birthday partyPrince Harry gives emotional speech for Prince Charles birthdayIncredible moment hippos save a wildebeest from a crocodilePrince Charles had also paid tribute to his \u0027darling old Harry\u0027 in an emotional speech that is said to have left the 600 guests, including Hollywood stars, in tears.Speaking at the afternoon reception at St George\u0027s Hall in Windsor Castle shortly after they married he Charles told of how moving it was to watch youngest son  get married.Charles, who walked Meghan to the altar, finishing by saying: \u0027My darling old Harry, I\u0027m so happy for you.\u0027Harry, 33, is also said to have given an \u0027off the cuff\u0027 speech about how happy he was.He is also said to have turned to his guests and asked: \u0027Can anyone play the piano\u0027 – before Sir Elton John played a medley of Your Song, Tiny Dancer, Circle Of Life and I\u0027m Still Standing.Harry also said Meghan had \u0027navigated everything with such grace\u0027, adding: \u0027We make such a great team\u0027. According to the Sunday Times. Wedding guest Peter Fearnhead, co-founder of African Parks, told the Sunday Telegraph: \u0027When Harry and Meghan came in they stood on the podium and Prince William introduced them.\u0027Prince Charles made a really gracious speech, it was amazingly endearing. He\u0027s got a wonderfully dry sense of humour. Prince Harry was charming about Meghan, they are so clearly in love. We all had a tear in our eye.\u0027 Later he whisked his bride away in an open-top Jaguar to head for a star-studded, champagne-fuelled, black-tie reception for the bride and groom at the opulent Frogmore House in Windsor Great Park on Saturday night.The newlyweds were cheered wildly as they took to the floor with the funky soul classic Land of a Thousand Dances for their first dance at the spectacular royal wedding reception.Comedian James Corden is reported to have launched a dance routine with Harry, his brother William and his father Charles, apparently refereeing a \u0027dance-off\u0027, while George Clooney danced with both Meghan and Kate. After a very modern take on the traditional royal wedding, the late-night revelry followed suit – and those fortunate enough to bag a place on the ultra-exclusive guest list were treated to a night of risque speeches, wild dancing and plenty of stodge to soak up the alcohol.

ITV’s coverage peaked at 3.6million.The combined average audience for BBC and ITV was around 11million. But this was lower than the figure for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding in 2011, which had a combined audience of 17.6million – although this included people watching on catch-up. Charles and Diana’s wedding was watched by more than 28million in 1981.Saturday’s FA Cup Final averaged 6.7million viewers and peaked at 8.7million on BBC1. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/20/22/065F52DC000003E8-0-image-a-44_1526851071765.jpg","title":"The dotty grandees gone peers just bland blobs QUENTIN LETTS Parliament","story":"    Members of The House of Lords have come under fire for inflicting defeats on the Government over the EU Withdrawal BillMore than in 1998, today’s peers come from similar careers and spout similar views.

Good one! What he meant was ‘the less we will be regarded as parasitic stooges of inertia’.The public would possibly like to see the upper house reduced to something far smaller than 600.But 600 is the figure mentioned in a recent review by Lord Burns, a former Whitehall civil servant. Sound Establishment man, is Terry Burns. He’ll never suggest anything too upsetting. Most peers are delighted by Burns’s review because it does not recommend forced eviction for any current peer. Graze on, sheep. Lord Young has this week noted, with little more than a pointed stare, that the Lib Dems, who currently have a ridiculous 100 peers, have not yet put anyone up for retirement.          A new poll showed there is now dwindling support for the Upper House as many call for it to be abolished Their leader, Lord Newby, yesterday merely moaned that one of the incoming Tory life peers, Andrew Tyrie, recently accepted the chairmanship of an independent body. Lord Young announced that Tyrie would be sitting as a non-affiliate peer.On Monday, that unhappy figure Lord Adonis (a former Blair aide bent out of shape by Brexit) made a similar petty point about political allegiances. Ditto Lady Hayman yesterday. Party power is how they view everything but it misses the point. The problem with the Lords is both its size and, now, its very existence.Several peers yesterday hear-heared when Lord Burns’s report was mentioned. Of course they did.Burns does not threaten to abolish them and allows for them to remain almost as big as the Commons.Lord Young, a gracious stick, smeared his replies with charm. He all but admitted that Theresa May’s Government is trying to say nothing on Lords reform.

The competition regulator estimates these fees earn banks around £1.2billion a year.Consumer group Which? compared the cost of borrowing £100 for 30 days in an unarranged overdraft across 16 high street banks with borrowing the same amount for the same period of time via a payday loan. At 13 of the 16 banks investigated the overdraft cost more than the payday loan.Will UK get a Boris Force One? Foreign Secretary suggests a...Share this articleSantander customers would currently pay £179 – almost 7.5 times the maximum £24 payday loan firms are allowed to charge borrowers.At TSB the fees would be £160, which is more than 6.5 times more costly than a payday loan.HSBC and First Direct charge £150 and RBS and NatWest £144 – around six times more.At Yorkshire Bank and Clydesdale Bank fees are five times the cost of a payday loan at £120.          Banks have been accused of ripping off customers taking unauthorised overdrafts Gareth Shaw, of Which?, said: ‘It’s alarming that the majority of banks are still allowed to charge more than payday loan firms through these rip-off overdraft fees. These extortionate fees can cost thousands of pounds a year, hitting those who can afford it least.’Along with 84 MPs from all major political parties, Which? is demanding City regulator the Financial Conduct Authority take urgent action to restrict these unfair charges.In a bid to reduce fees, the Competition and Markets Authority told firms in May 2016 that they must set a monthly maximum charge for unplanned overdraft usage.However, it stopped short of specifying what the cap should be and limiting how much banks can charge.The FCA has also raised concerns about banks’ high fees for unarranged overdrafts.It is expected to publish the findings of an inquiry into high-cost credit such as overdraft charges on next Thursday. A spokesman for the FCA said: ‘Often the fees are too high and charges can be unreasonable.‘We think the market may need fundamental reform and we have questioned the role of unarranged overdrafts should play in a modern market.’The financial regulator capped payday loan fees at 0.8 per cent a day of the amount borrowed in 2015 – equivalent to £24 on a £100 loan taken out for 30 days.Many major banks and building societies are currently overhauling their planned and unplanned overdraft charges.Lloyds and Halifax have scrapped unauthorised overdraft charges altogether.Santander said it is reducing its fees from July 10 and removing them entirely for four million customers with its 123, Select and Private accounts. Under the changes customers would pay between £30 and £100 to use a £100 unplanned overdraft for 30 days – rather than £179.But experts say many of the changes banks are introducing do not go far enough and that customers are still paying over the odds to borrow small amounts of money.They also argue that because caps are monthly and not per day it means that borrowers are also penalised if they are in the red over two billing periods.Consumer rights expert Martyn James said: ‘People thought the bad old days of bank charges ended years ago – but all firms did was switch from one-off big charges to smaller, more frequent ones, all topped up with interest. These fees are unfair, unclear and are pushing people further into debt.’A spokesman for UK Finance, the trade body that represents the banking industry, said: ‘An unarranged overdraft might arise where customers have miscalculated their finances, although we would always encourage them to contact their bank to arrange an overdraft and minimise costs. Text alerts can help customers take action if they are going overdrawn.’It added that most banks have a fee-free buffer zone of around £10 to £20.Santander said: ‘We continue to focus on supporting customers with managing their money and have specialist support teams in place for those struggling with debt.’A spokesman for TSB said overdrafts can help customers to manage their money but added: ‘A lack of transparency in the market and understanding of how to use them can make them an expensive source of borrowing.’ First Direct, HSBC and NatWest said arranged payday loans and unarranged overdrafts are not comparable and that customers would pay far less for an arranged overdraft. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/18/01/4C6180D400000578-0-image-a-7_1526604848045.jpg","title":"One five families bribing teenage children school time","story":"    Parents are attempting to get their children to study harder and be punctual by bribing them, Santander\u0027s telling new study showsFor this group arriving at school on time commanded a premium of £10 a week on average, with chores such as cleaning a room priced at £5 a week.Children in London collect an average £26.70 a week in basic pocket money, compared with £18.36 outside the capital, according to the survey.

The mid-air tussle had ended within just eight seconds, according to the photographer\u0027I spent the day watching several young foxes, called kits, rest and play on the prairie. I counted at least eight kits. There are probably more. Shortly before sunset, they started hunting. One fox managed to snag a rabbit’s foot. Several kits gave chase, but it made it to its den to feed.\u0027About 15 minutes later, a red fox caught a rabbit and was carrying it across the meadow.

But the berries and voles have been displaced by the rabbits, which have clear-cut the prairie with their vast burrows.\u0027 The photographer added: \u0027Don’t worry: the fox was fine.

Good one! What he meant was ‘the less we will be regarded as parasitic stooges of inertia’.The public would possibly like to see the upper house reduced to something far smaller than 600.But 600 is the figure mentioned in a recent review by Lord Burns, a former Whitehall civil servant.

Lord Young announced that Tyrie would be sitting as a non-affiliate peer.On Monday, that unhappy figure Lord Adonis (a former Blair aide bent out of shape by Brexit) made a similar petty point about political allegiances. Ditto Lady Hayman yesterday. Party power is how they view everything but it misses the point. The problem with the Lords is both its size and, now, its very existence.Several peers yesterday hear-heared when Lord Burns’s report was mentioned. Of course they did.Burns does not threaten to abolish them and allows for them to remain almost as big as the Commons.Lord Young, a gracious stick, smeared his replies with charm. He all but admitted that Theresa May’s Government is trying to say nothing on Lords reform. He murmured: ‘This is the 15th question on the composition of the house I have answered – or, to be more accurate, the 15th I’ve been asked.’ Droll laughter.All those ex-MPs and ex-charity bosses and ex-quangocrats and ex-soapy bishops just want the place to teeter on for another few years until they’ve croaked.

Meghan is the first mixed-race member of the royal family in an extraordinary journey for a girl born in LA to a white father and African-American mother who fought her way through the tough world of showbusiness to land a plum role in the TV series Suits.Harry and Meghan\u0027s big day couldn\u0027t have been more different than royal weddings of the past, especially because the prince was visibly emotional throughout - and guests suggested it was the most erse major event in the Queen\u0027s 66-year reign.The prince had looked tearful when he saw his bride for the first time, grabbing her hand telling her: \u0027You look amazing - I missed you\u0027 before tenderly lifting her veil.The new Duke of Sussex also said \u0027thank you, pa\u0027 after his father Prince Charles walked the now Duchess of Sussex down the aisle of St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor, having stepped in at the last moment for Meghan\u0027s father Thomas.           Harry looked very emotional at points in the service and several others in the congregation were in tears on their happy day          Harry and Meghan hold hands as they walk out of St George\u0027s Chapel after the wedding ceremony          A sea of smiling faces greets Harry and Meghan as they leave the church after the American-influenced service conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury          Laughter: One of the well-wishers in the crowds makes Meghan laugh and Prince Harry smile as they continue with their 25-minute tour of the royal market town Meghan Markle told wedding guests: \u0027I\u0027ve found my prince\u0027 in an emotional speech after her ecstatic new husband said the support of his \u0027far better half\u0027 meant he could finally be \u0027me\u0027, it was revealed today.The new Duchess of Sussex also thanked the Queen, Prince Charles and other senior royals for welcoming her so warmly to the royal family \u0027firm\u0027.The bride, resplendent in a white evening gown by Stella McCartney, took to the microphone after a private evening dinner thrown by Prince Charles at Frogmore House.  Meghan\u0027s short speech was yet another part of her modernising mini-revolution of the royal family because royal brides usually leave it to the groom to address guests.The 36-year-old, who wore an aquamarine ring which belonged to Harry\u0027s mother beloved mother Princess Diana, ended her short address by declaring her deep love for Harry and said: \u0027I have found my prince\u0027, according to the Daily Mirror.Before she spoke Harry said his wife, brother, father and friends \u0027are the people that make \u0027me\u0027, me, in my Harry life\u0027 before adding: \u0027Now I\u0027m going to hand over to my far better half\u0027.Earlier he is also believed to have told his bride: \u0027I can\u0027t wait to spend the rest of my life with you.\u0027     One source described how Meghan also expressed her gratitude at how welcoming the prince had been to both herself and her mother, Doria Ragland. \u0027She has been so touched by how welcoming the Prince of Wales has been. So is her mother,\u0027 the source said. \u0027Honestly, they are touched beyond belief. It was important to her to make a point of thanking him publicly, although, of course, he knows privately how she feels.\u0027Another source said: \u0027It is often said that he always wanted a daughter and I think he has been really moved by how well they have got on. There is definitely a special connection there. Meghan\u0027s mother means more to her than anything, so it was lovely to see the way he was so welcoming to Doria too.\u0027          Meghan and Harry looked like movie stars after they changed for the evening reception at Frogmore House          Harry and Meghan travelled in a Jaguar converted to electric power, which had a numberplate with Saturday\u0027s dateMan accused of \u0027hitting\u0027 service dog gets attacked by ownerPrince Andrew brings Beatrice and Eugenie to Chelsea Flower ShowHorrific moment Chinese boy is mauled by pit bull outside pet shopJudge orders 30-year-old to move out of his parents house30-year-old Michael Rotondo is being evicted by his own parentsGove wants \u0027to halve number of areas with unsafe  pollution\u0027Saddam Hussein\u0027s superyacht converted into a hotel for pilotsPrince Harry and Meghan attend Prince Charles\u0027 birthday partyPrince Harry gives emotional speech for Prince Charles birthdayIncredible moment hippos save a wildebeest from a crocodilePrince Charles had also paid tribute to his \u0027darling old Harry\u0027 in an emotional speech that is said to have left the 600 guests, including Hollywood stars, in tears.Speaking at the afternoon reception at St George\u0027s Hall in Windsor Castle shortly after they married he Charles told of how moving it was to watch youngest son  get married.Charles, who walked Meghan to the altar, finishing by saying: \u0027My darling old Harry, I\u0027m so happy for you.\u0027Harry, 33, is also said to have given an \u0027off the cuff\u0027 speech about how happy he was.He is also said to have turned to his guests and asked: \u0027Can anyone play the piano\u0027 – before Sir Elton John played a medley of Your Song, Tiny Dancer, Circle Of Life and I\u0027m Still Standing.Harry also said Meghan had \u0027navigated everything with such grace\u0027, adding: \u0027We make such a great team\u0027. According to the Sunday Times. Wedding guest Peter Fearnhead, co-founder of African Parks, told the Sunday Telegraph: \u0027When Harry and Meghan came in they stood on the podium and Prince William introduced them.\u0027Prince Charles made a really gracious speech, it was amazingly endearing. He\u0027s got a wonderfully dry sense of humour. Prince Harry was charming about Meghan, they are so clearly in love. We all had a tear in our eye.\u0027 Later he whisked his bride away in an open-top Jaguar to head for a star-studded, champagne-fuelled, black-tie reception for the bride and groom at the opulent Frogmore House in Windsor Great Park on Saturday night.The newlyweds were cheered wildly as they took to the floor with the funky soul classic Land of a Thousand Dances for their first dance at the spectacular royal wedding reception.Comedian James Corden is reported to have launched a dance routine with Harry, his brother William and his father Charles, apparently refereeing a \u0027dance-off\u0027, while George Clooney danced with both Meghan and Kate. After a very modern take on the traditional royal wedding, the late-night revelry followed suit – and those fortunate enough to bag a place on the ultra-exclusive guest list were treated to a night of risque speeches, wild dancing and plenty of stodge to soak up the alcohol.

ITV’s coverage peaked at 3.6million.The combined average audience for BBC and ITV was around 11million. But this was lower than the figure for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding in 2011, which had a combined audience of 17.6million – although this included people watching on catch-up. Charles and Diana’s wedding was watched by more than 28million in 1981.Saturday’s FA Cup Final averaged 6.7million viewers and peaked at 8.7million on BBC1. "},{"url":null,"title":"Incredible moment hippos SAVE wildebeest crocodiles epic struggle South Africa","story":"    The footage shows the heroic hippos approach the struggling creature and pounce on the crocodile which forced it to release its grip on the wildebeest The footage shows the heroic hippos approach the struggling creature and pounce on the crocodile which forced it to release its grip on the wildebeest.  Taking advantage of this, the wildebeest then managed to escape after a long battle. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/22/15/1FBA30AC00000578-0-image-m-166_1526997699089.jpg","title":"MH370 search review scrapped Mahathir","story":"    Still missing: Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared in March 2014 with 239 people onboard while en route from Kuala Lumpur to BeijingThe hunt for the Boeing 777 was previously expected to end in June, as the 90-day agreement did not cover time taken for refuelling and resupplying search vessel Seabed Constructor.However, Ocean Infinity had finished scouring its targeted search area in April and had requested an extension until May 29, Loke said.Aboriginal settlement revealed by MH370-search technology...Share this article\u0027This morning I raised this (request) in cabinet and we agreed to extend to May 29,\u0027 he told reporters in Putrajaya, Malaysia\u0027s administrative capital.

Vladimir Putin\u0027s spokesman condemned the UK\u0027s \u0027unfair and unfriendly\u0027 approach to Russian businessmen.The crackdown means Mr Abramovich, who is away from Britain and missed his club\u0027s FA Cup win on Saturday, is being treated as a \u0027new applicant\u0027 for a UK visa, it is understood.Under new rules to stamp out \u0027dirty money\u0027, the oligarch – who is close to Mr Putin – will have to demonstrate that his fortune is above board.Mr Abramovich is worth £9.3billion. Technically, he will need to show that at least £2million of his investment in the UK is from legal sources.He has held UK visas for many years, but the rules were tightened in 2015, after he obtained his most recent 40-month visa.

Mr Abramovich was one of his early supporters, recommending him for the top Kremlin job to Boris Yeltsin when the ailing leader was looking for a successor.According to the late oligarch Boris Berezovsky in evidence to the High Court in London, Mr Abramovich enjoyed significant political influence in Moscow in the second half of the 1990s.In October 1999, he attended Mr Putin\u0027s birthday party. Soon afterwards, Mr Abramovich allegedly bought Mr Putin, then the prime minister, a $50million (£37million) yacht. \u0027The request came from Mr Putin,\u0027 Mr Berezovsky said in evidence.In 2003, Mr Abramovich bought Chelsea for £60million. Two years later, he was involved in a much larger transaction when he sold his oil company, Sibneft, to state-run Gazprom. He got $13billion (£10billion).He began spending time in London, where he owns a 15-bedroom Victorian mansion on \u0027Billionaire\u0027s Row\u0027 in Kensington, bought in 2009 for a reported £97million and now worth at least £150million.

The average life of a container is thirteen-years but its journey doesn\u0027t have to end there.\u0027Instead of being turned into scrap metal, freight space can become high quality, long-lasting living space.\u0027By doing so, we wish to combat housing shortages in many areas and demonstrate that sustainability and social action does not have to be a drawback for housing association and property developers.\u0027          The quirky design has been produced by German company Containerwerk          The homes start at £35,000 but can be ordered  but can only be ordered with a contract volume of 20 containers or more          The properties have special foam insulation to compensate for the steel structure of the containers          The large master bedroom comes complete with an en-suite bathroom closed off by a curtainModules start at £35,000, depending on the version, but can only be ordered with a contract volume of 20 containers or more.Building shipping containers has been popular for years but the process of turning them into viable living structures is complicated.One of the major problems is insulating the structures but Containerwerk co-founder Ivan Mallinowski has invented an industrial system to line the structures with a layer of foam insulation.Perfect pad to kick off your blue suede shoes! An Elvis...Share this article\u0027Insulation is the big problem with building houses in containers,\u0027 Mallinowski said in a Dezeen video.\u0027If you look at the physics of a container, it is made from steel, and steel is a very good heat conductor.\u0027We build a special type of insulation. It\u0027s a monolithic insulation, made by an industrial process and surrounds the whole container inside without any heat bridges.\u0027According to Mallinowski, using the specialty foam insulation not only makes the containers more efficient, it also allows for 10-centimetre thick walls, meaning that designers can make the most out of the containers\u0027 already limited space.He said: \u0027We can build very thin walls so that the space in the container is as big as possible.\u0027  "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2ba28eec00a70072248d293fda89fddf276bdab/239_59_6481_3889/master/6481.jpg?w=160\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=5cd8f0c6e69205e697e1c9d905d900c3 320w","title":"barclays reported to be exploring merger with standard charter","story":"Newspaper says talks were a response to pressure from the activist investors SherborneBarclays has been exploring a potential merger with rival banks including Standard Chartered, according to a report in the Financial Times.John McFarlane, Barclays’ chairman, was in favour of a deal with Standard Chartered, according to the FT, while Sir Gerry Grimstone, who chairs the Barclays International unit, was also said to be supportive of the idea.A private conversation took place between a director at each bank about the potential benefits of such a deal but no formal or informal bid approach had taken place, the FT said. Barclays declined to comment on the report.A spokesman for Standard Chartered said: “We are entirely focused on executing our strategy and do not comment on this type of speculation.”Sources close to Barclays poured cold water on the report and said the bank was not working on a deal with any of its rivals.Bramson is calling for a shake-up of the bank that is thought to involve a radical reduction in activities at its underperforming investment bank, in a plan to cut costs and boost shareholder returns.Jes Staley, the chief executive of Barclays, met Bramson in New York earlier this month and was told by the activist investor that he was still working on his proposals for the bank’s future.Also this month, Staley was fined £642,430 by UK regulators for a breach of conduct after he attempted to unmask a whistleblower. As well as being fined by the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority, Barclays said it would claw back £500,000 of Staley’s bonus over the matter.The bank will also have to report annually to the regulators detailing how it handles whistleblowing after they expressed concerns about its existing systems.

At the same time, the cost of services, including hotels and communication packages, were on the rise.This is partially a reflection of the diminishing impact on import prices from the sharp depreciation of the pound following the EU referendum, and increasing domestic inflationary pressures as the labour market tightens further and spare capacity wanes. “With oil prices on the up and domestic price pressures unabated, we may not see further falls in inflation this year.”Professor Costas Milas of the University of Liverpool agrees that the case for the Bank of England raising interest rates in August is fading.If CPI inflation falls further in May, they will most likely have to revise their inflation forecasts downwards which will obviously make the case for an August interest rate hike even weaker.Newsflash: Investors have slashed the chances of a UK interest rate hike in August to just a third:That underlines why the pound has fallen -- lower interest rates mean there is less incentive to hold sterling.David Lamb, head of dealing at Fexco Corporate Payments, says the City is right:“Britain’s next interest rate rise hasn’t just been kicked into the long grass, it has been sent sailing right out of the park.“With consumer inflation continuing to fall – even in the face of rising fuel prices – the Bank of England is running out of reasons to raise rates.Predictably, the government has welcomed today’s decline in in inflation, while the opposition points out that real wages are still too low.For the government, financial secretary to the Treasury Mel Stride says:“Inflation falling and real wages on the rise means more money in people’s pockets. We are helping families earn more and keep more of what they earn by cutting taxes for 31 million people and increasing the National Living Wage, worth an extra £2,000. “We must continue to ensure people’s pay outstrips inflation and build an economy that truly works for everyone.But Peter Dowd MP, Labour’s Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, says workers need more help:“Inflation remains higher than the Bank of England’s target, while working people are struggling with real earnings still lower than in 2010, following eight years of Tory economic failure.The next Labour government will introduce a £10 per hour Real Living Wage to tackle the squeeze on wages, and build a high wage, high skill economy for the many, not the few.”Today’s report also shows the impact of Britain’s new sugar tax.That’s a chunky increase, but not enough to prevent the wider inflation rate falling.Mike Hardie, head of inflation at the Office for National Statistics, explains:“Inflation continued to slow in April, with air fares making the biggest downward contribution, due to the timing of Easter. This was partially offset by the rise in petrol prices. “Soft drink prices saw their biggest ever rise for this time of year, due to the introduction of the sugar tax. However, many retailers still haven’t passed the impact of the tax onto shoppers.Martin Lane, managing editor of money, has welcomed the drop in UK inflation to a 13-month low: “The nation can breathe a small sigh of relief. Inflation has fallen, so the pounds in our pockets aren’t being stretched quite as far.The pressure on our wages is easing and the gap between inflation and wage growth has disappeared, easing the strain on our wallets.Something else consumers will be grateful for in the run up to holiday season, is the cost of items like food and airfares are slowing. But consumes should still be cautious, Lane adds:Create a budget and spend 30 minutes looking at where you could make savings, from switching where you do your weekly shop to changing your energy supplier. Half an hour of research and admin could save you hundreds, if not thousands a year.”Kevin Doran, chief investment officer at stockbroker AJ Bell, warns that the drop in inflation may not last.“UK consumers will be glad to see average wage increases starting to outstrip inflation and for the spending power of the pound in their pocket pick up further.“However, the recent weakness in the pound and the rising oil price are a concern and could quickly reverse the drop in inflation. The jump in the oil price has started to hit petrol pumps, pushing up costs for UK consumers and businesses alike. In addition, the weak pound will be driving up input costs for many UK companies which will ultimately filter through to UK consumers in the coming months.The drop in inflation in April suggests that real wages in the UK are still growing, at a modest pace.Why did the unusually early Easter helped to pull inflation down last month?Easter Sunday fell on 1 April, two weeks earlier than in 2017. Airlines usually put prices up as people either jet off for holidays, or travel home - but this year, that rush began in March. That’s another sign of cooling inflationary pressures."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72d8c2fa285450a455990791d154e44ef2bc20a2/0_1078_2988_1792/master/2988.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c364de97523445dbad6217bbe266a822","title":"dublins ghost signs preserving a citys fading memories","story":"Emma Clarke captures Dublin’s history through old advertisements and signs – often only briefly revealed by construction projects in this rapidly changing cityFaded and decaying shop signs remind us of a time gone by. Often painted on brickwork, these ghost signs are found in cities and towns throughout the world – but many of us don’t even notice them. Emma Clarke picked up on Dublin’s fading signs as she walked around the city observing changes to the urban landscape. Originally from Cork, she’s been photographing old signs in Dublin and publishing the pictures through her blog and the account @DublinGhostSigns since she moved there a decade ago. “I’m fascinated by how the city changes and evolves around us,” she says. “Often, we don’t tend to notice the traces of the past which are hidden in plain sight, high up on walls or below eye level at our feet. It’s only when these signs disappear that we realise they were part of the city’s fabric.”Ghost signs remind Clarke of a different Dublin, one with streets of brushmakers, dairies and victuallers. “The old signs provide a contrast to today’s convenience stores and fast food outlets. There is a curiosity among Dubliners about the businesses that once were.”Her blog is a way to preserve elements of Dublin’s history, she says. “Dublin is dynamic and it changes rapidly. After years of post-‘Celtic Tiger’ building inactivity, there is a lot of construction happening in Dublin again. As a result, old signs and shopfronts are being uncovered – and often re-covered within hours,” she says. “More often than not, the building, signage or shopfront disappears and a quickly snapped photo might be all that remains to provide that link to the past.” Cities brings together the best in urban photography on Instagram at @cities.

That category is geographically defined: it’s in the east. In Brussels, Paris, Berlin, and elsewhere in the western part of the continent, it’s become almost common wisdom to say the “easterners” are spoilers in the EU club. Is that fair?Last week Emmanuel Macron, Europe’s poster boy for liberal democracy, seemed to echo that rather patronising western vision: “The last 15 years have shown a path that has weakened Europe by thinking all the time that it should be enlarged,” he said. The rise of populism in former communist-bloc countries has encouraged the notion that if it weren’t for central and\u0026nbspeastern Europe, things would be running much more\u0026nbspsmoothly in the EU. Perhaps it’s time to debunk a\u0026nbspfew stereotypes.This is not to deny that there are serious problems. Poland’s ultra-conservative, nationalist government has come under EU commission procedures for breaching the rule of law. Viktor Orbán’s brand of “illiberal democracy” in Hungary has caused a lot of trouble.Next year will mark the 30th anniversary of the 1989 revolutions that allowed Europe’s reunification. But it now looks likely that the anniversary will be marred by acrimony and tension. The “east” has attained a kind of pariah status. Central and eastern Europeans, goes the logic, “just don’t get” the European project: they’re in it only for the money, they don’t cooperate with Brussels as they should, they’re troublesome, they’re xenophobic, and they hanker for authoritarianism – what a success the club would be without them!But aren’t we forgetting something? Look at the outcome of Italy’s recent elections: anti-immigration populists and far-right extremists are now slated to form the next government in the eurozone’s third biggest economy. And what about Austria, where the far-right Freedom party holds three key ministries? In Germany, not only does the far-right AfD control 92 seats in the Bundestag (a first for an extremist party since the second world war), its ideology now seems to hold sway on how Bavaria’s ruling CSU party is preparing for elections in the autumn in that powerful regional state. Nor can it be said that France, despite Marine Le Pen’s defeat, has rid itself of xenophobic and anti-Muslim sentiment.To ascribe all Europe’s woes to its eastern part is simplistic and in no small part disingenuous. Not only that, but “reading” Europe along east-west lines risks feeding the very isions that pro-Europeans say they want to solve or repair. Tit-for-tat rhetoric is rife and historical complexes abound, with Germany’s influence being an obvious source of resentment.Setting the record straight on western Europe’s own worrisome traits and mistakes might help rekindle a sense of collective endeavour that seems to be cruelly lacking these days. Let’s remember that back in 2005 it was French and Dutch citizens (voting in referendums) who delivered a massive blow to plans for further European integration by rejecting the proposed new EU constitution – not the newly admitted easterners. Nor is central and eastern Europe a homogeneous bloc. Slovakia is a keen member of the eurozone. And some easterners, in particular in the Baltic states, support common EU defence projects.East-west relations within the EU are now so fraught that it’s become tempting to moan about the consequences of Europe’s reunification rather than to applaud it as a major accomplishment for human dignity and the freedom of nations to choose their own destiny, at the heart of a continent devastated by war and totalitarianism in the 20th century.Populists in eastern Europe feed on genuine contemporary frustrations. (Wages are much lower, so catching up with the west feels like an endless process.) They also play on deep historical grievances: an understandable sense of abandonment after the second world war, and the notion that if western Europe had it so good in the second half of the last century, that was because its poorer, eastern half was left to suffer under dictatorship – in a word, sacrificed.Western Europeans thought the bridging of psychological gaps that derive from differences in historical experiences would be easier. But in the east, overcoming the lingering trauma of having been part of Europe’s “bloodlands”, where the crimes of Nazism and Stalinism converged, remains an unfulfilled task – one that westerners can’t fully grasp, simply because their memory is different.This is not to say a blind eye should be turned to democratic backsliding: the EU must defend its principles if it is to survive. But acknowledging the burden and the pains that our eastern neighbours endured, and paying tribute to the legacy of the people power of 1989, might perhaps go a long way to defusing some of today’s disputes.In Bratislava recently I met the writer Fedor Gál, one of the heroes of the 1989 uprising in Czechoslovakia. When I asked him about east-west tensions in today’s Europe, he said this about his region: “We yet have to understand that Europe is a path, not just a source of income.” If we want to find a way of relating to one another, and not just squabbling over quotas or money, we need to show we are aware of history. Calling out misbehaviour when it occurs is necessary, but not enough. We westerners carry our own share of responsibility for Europe’s travails. We have to acknowledge that for us too, the European project is a path."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47a25debfee76bff058bc5191736229ae4d4e92e/0_138_2992_1795/master/2992.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=761ab00613a57a059767677cc10ab0a3","title":"venezuela dictator democracy nicolas maduro venezuelans","story":"The descent of Venezuela into a dictatorship has resembled the fable of the boy that cried wolf. Back in July 2000, when Hugo Chávez won his first re-election, many in the opposition, surprised by his sudden rise in popularity, claimed electoral fraud. Since then, it seems, the norm has been for the opposition to accuse the government of stealing elections, without presenting enough evidence to gain the support of the international community. This has made it difficult for many outside Venezuela to label the regime a dictatorship. Until now.It has never been clearer that Nicolás Maduro – who cynically described this weekend’s vote as “a triumph of democracy” – is a dictator. Dozens of countries throughout Europe and the Americas warned that the fraudulent presidential elections should not occur and are now refusing to recognise the results.We are not dealing with an authoritarian government that, like Chávez’s, still managed to loosely colour between the lines of democracy and the rule of law. This is a textbook dictatorship, with assassinations, torture and sexual abuse of political prisoners, violent censorship of the press, and a sociopathic strategy to use the hunger of its own citizens as a tool for political control. So, in the face of all this, what can we do to help restore democracy in Venezuela?In Venezuela we used to say that the “revolution” would reach its end el día que bajen los cerros (the day the slums join the protests). Over the past four years, however, people from Venezuela’s most impoverished neighbourhoods have protested over shortages of food and medicines, rising inflation and the government’s unwillingness to curb crime – and this has only led to increased repression by the security forces.Now, when many Venezuelans barely have the energy to try to feed themselves, it is very unlikely that a popular uprising will end well. As for a coup, one has to wonder why military forces involved in human rights abuses and drug trafficking would want to depose Maduro – and how that could ever lead to democracy.For various reasons, the US has led the response against Maduro. This is not productive, especially while someone as isive as Donald Trump runs the White House. Efforts need to be coordinated by a wide coalition that includes the Latin American countries most affected by the Venezuelan exodus, and European countries with strong historical ties such as Spain, Portugal and Italy.The US, EU and some Latin American countries have approved targeted sanctions that prevent Venezuelan government officials from owning property or doing business in their jurisdictions. The list of sanctioned officials needs to grow, and there must be stronger enforcement. The US also introduced wider economic sanctions that prevent Venezuela from selling off debt or assets in the US. Despite what some Maduro apologists say, these sanctions are not to blame for the state of Venezuela’s economy. The economic pressure needs to continue – hopefully without ever reaching a full ban on Venezuelan oil exports, which would decimate the country.The preliminary examination by the prosecutor of the international criminal court into alleged human rights abuses by the Venezuelan security forces may be slow, but it would have a massive impact on the regime to see some of its leaders indicted at The Hague.There is a long list of issues upon which both Europe and the US don’t see eye to eye with these countries. But if we could negotiate with them to limit their support for Maduro, it would be a huge step towards democracy in Venezuela.Many Venezuelans are so desperate that they believe that the only solution is for Trump to send in the Marines. We’ve already seen how ineffective the “surgical strikes” against Afghanistan and Iraq were. As decades of research into regime change have shown, the only way to guarantee a democratic future for Venezuela is through a peaceful transition. The international community must pressure Maduro into accepting new elections, with a new national electoral council, guaranteed freedoms and transparency, and proper international monitoring. This is the only path towards democracy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc552774223a7e2c89d97935d4602df6d86b8daf/0_0_2338_1402/master/2338.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b00cf3b435d159c66b1086284fd6a92d","title":"great british bee count 2018 in pictures","story":"As the fifth annual Great British Bee Count gets under way, wildlife and gardening experts are calling on the public to grow weeds to help Britain’s bees.

The 46-year-old Spaniard bolted from the status of outsider to sudden favourite on Monday and he has succeeded Arsène Wenger, who departed after 22 years in the job at the end of this past season.It seems significant that Emery’s title is that of head coach rather than manager and he has been asked to concentrate his efforts on coaching and man-managing the first-team. Ivan Gazidis, the chief executive, has overhauled the club, with Raul Sanllehi and Sven Mislintat having been given overall responsibility for transfers. Emery has agreed to work within the new structure and he knows that the club will operate on a £50m transfer budget this season.Gazidis oversaw a thorough recruitment process and a clutch of candidates were considered and interviewed – chief among them Mikel Arteta, Max Allegri and Patrick Vieira. Arteta was the favourite last week and he expected to be given the opportunity, despite his lack of managerial experience. In the end, though, Emery came to seem like a safer pair of hands given his pedigree at a string of clubs since the 2004-05 season, most recently Paris St-Germain and Sevilla.“I am thrilled to be joining one of the great clubs in the game,” Emery said. “Arsenal is known and loved throughout the world for its style of play, its commitment to young players, the fantastic stadium, the way the club is run. I’m very excited to be given the responsibility to start this important new chapter in Arsenal’s history.“I have met Stan and Josh Kroenke and it’s clear they have great ambitions for the club and are committed to bringing future success. I’m excited about what we can do together and I look forward to giving everyone who loves Arsenal some special moments and memories.”Stan Kroenke, the club’s majority shareholder, described Emery as a “proven winner”. Emery won five domestic honours in his two seasons at PSG – including the Ligue 1 title last season – although his lack of success in the Champions League cost him his job. He also struggled to impose his will on a dressing room packed with egos.Before that, Emery impressed greatly at Sevilla, despite having to sell the club’s best players on a regular basis. Most eye-catchingly, he won the Europa League for three seasons in a row.“We’re delighted to welcome Unai to Arsenal,” Kroenke said. “He’s a proven winner. We’re confident that he is the right person for the job and that he will work to deliver the triumphs our fans, staff and everyone who cares about Arsenal want.“Several things stood out during his interview and the entire process his football knowledge, energy, determination and love of the game. His familiarity with our club and our players, the Premier League, and the game in Europe were all very impressive. He shares our vision to move forward, to build on the platform created by Arsène Wenger and help this club enjoy greater success.”Gazidis said: “Unai has an outstanding track record of success throughout his career, has developed some of the best young talent in Europe and plays an exciting, progressive style of football that fits Arsenal perfectly. His hard-working and passionate approach and his sense of values on and off the pitch make him the ideal person to take us forward.“We conducted a confidential, wide-ranging and rigorous search involving extensive background references, data and video analysis, and personal meetings with all the candidates we shortlisted. All were interested in the position and we were unanimous in our choice of Unai to drive the next chapter of our history.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff30d40f572e1a56fbc5b31c822d733c0a8162e5/880_82_4092_2456/master/4092.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e823662867e85ac9327a8f34199c5ef9","title":"carlo ancelotti new manager napoli sarri serie a","story":"Carlo Ancelotti, the former Chelsea manager, has agreed to replace Maurizio Sarri as Napoli’s coach.

However, sources in Italy say that the 59-year-old Sarri is mulling over an offer from Zenit St Petersburg.Following Sunday’s 2-1 home victory over Crotone, which saw Napoli end the season with 91 points, Sarri told La Gazzetta dello Sport: “Everything in life ends and it is better to finish things after writing a beautiful story. I don’t know if I will stay, I have to talk about it with my family.“The situation is complicated. You can’t say you’re ready to go and try again with this squad when you don’t know that everyone will remain here. I don’t know if the club will manage to keep the players who have release clauses when offers will come in from big clubs.

They’ll be linked with Old Uncle Tom Cobley and all this summer, you see if we’re wrong: that starts today with a loan move for Liverpool starlets Ben Woodburn and Harry Wilson, and a £2m deal for Gerrard’s former team-mate Martin Skrtel, currently at Fenerbahce.And finally … Manchester City want Ajax’s John Stones upgrade Matthijs de Ligt Swansea continue to pursue Ostersunds manager Graham Potter and Everton defender Leighton Baines is bound for LA Galaxy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca2abd9cd1e1d17774a12e5e93f233b79ae5bb5e/0_86_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=955522150d6a0aab53e0381a849e4254","title":"liverpool mohamed salah real madrid jurgen klopp alexander arnold marcelo","story":"Jürgen Klopp can ask Salah to drop and help Trent Alexander-Arnold or concentrate on exploiting the space behind Marcelo and the Brazilian’s defensive weaknessesNothing, perhaps, should give Liverpool such heart ahead of Saturday’s Champions League final as Bayern Munich’s first goal against Real Madrid in the second leg of the semi.Nothing dramatic happens. Franck Ribéry turns in from the left flank and plays an unremarkable low pass in to Robert Lewandowski in a central position on the edge of the box. The ball bounces up in front of the Polish striker and his first touch as a result takes him away from goal. He is able, though, to shield the ball and, as Sergio Ramos decides to sit off, Lewandowski has time to work the ball wide left to Thomas Müller who is, bafflingly, in 15 yards of space, out on the right touchline, roughly level with the edge of the box.Marcelo, the Madrid left-back, has been drawn into the centre, tucking in as though anticipating that Lewandowski might allow Ribéry’s pass to run across his body and then turn Ramos. That much is reasonable. What is not is what then happens. Marcelo must have been aware of Müller’s presence. Müller is, after all, his primary concern. As soon as Lewandowski’s touch took him away from goal and Sergio Ramos didn’t lunge in (and nobody can blame Marcelo for thinking that he might), Marcelo should have been closing down the space Müller had. Instead, he dropped back, five yards behind the defensive line, and only then moved left to shut Müller down.By then it was probably too late, although Marcelo dawdled, hanging back in a no man’s land when a sprint might still have pressured the cross. Ramos, slightly half-heartedly, did cut out the cross at the near post, but his indecisiveness merely knocked the ball down for Joshua Kimmich, who scored.Marcelo is perhaps the finest attacking left-back in the world. That deal that took him from Fluminense to Madrid in 2007 for around £5m may, pound for pound, be the greatest the club has completed. In the majority of the games they play, Marcelo is perfect for Madrid. He works up and down the line. He is quick. His touch is superb. He can cross. He scores a couple of goals a season. The only problem comes when he has to defend. Most of the time he doesn’t have to, but he surely will in Kiev.If Mohamed Salah is gifted the sort of space on Saturday that Müller was in that second leg, and if he produces anything like the sort of form he was showing a month ago, Liverpool will devastate Madrid on that flank. Normally, that would be enough to give them a clear edge, but this is anything but a normal game. None of the usual rules seem to apply.Nothing Trent Alexander-Arnold did in Rome was quite as eye-catching as Marcelo’s dilatoriness for that first Bayern goal, but equally the way Stephan El Shaarawy exposed him in the second leg will have not have gone unnoticed by Madrid. In part, of course, that’s because Salah was exempted from defensive duties that night, seemingly instructed to remain high up the pitch and occupy the space behind Aleksandar Kolarov so that every time Liverpool regained possession there was an obvious and dangerous out-ball.Whether Madrid play a 4-3-3 or, more likely, a 4-3-1-2 with Isco tucked behind Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema, Alexander-Arnold will surely be targeted. The question for Jürgen Klopp is then whether to have Salah drop back and help out defensively, or to call Madrid’s bluff and risk them doubling up on the full-back for the potential reward of Salah constantly in space high up the pitch behind Marcelo.In most games it would be enough to say the battle on that flank would be decisive. But here it feels inadequate. Dani Carvajal did return, after a month’s absence, to play the full 90 minutes against Villarreal on the final day of the league season, which means he rather than the converted winger Lucas Vázquez will play at right-back but if there is any doubt about his fitness it will be sorely tested by the pace of Sadio Mané, particularly if Andy Robertson can get up to support him – which he should be able to do if Madrid play a 4-3-1-2 and focus on trying to expose Alexander-Arnold on the other flank.And then there’s the question of the centre. Sergio Ramos is a fine defender in one-on-one situations, but how will he and Raphaël Varane cope with Roberto Firmino dropping deep, leaving them with space to mark until Salah and Mané dart into it?A repeated problem for Liverpool under Klopp has been the lack of protection afforded their back four when they lose compactness and space opens up in front of it. The nature of their pressing game means there is no natural holding player to sit in. That is a major concern and one that Isco, tucked behind two forwards, could be ideally placed to exploit.Everywhere on the pitch, it seems, on both sides, there are defensive flaws that might be exploited. And that’s what makes this final so hard to read. It’s not just that either side could win, it’s that either side could win by a wide margin."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/baba71c8971d15ecda253bbc33099e58ae574211/0_300_3630_2179/master/3630.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e60177afd0472d4420f85777871f802","title":"world cup stunning moments germany humiliate brazil 7 1","story":"Germany conjured football of a savagery unwitnessed against significant opposition in the tournament’s historyWhen it comes to the World Cup, hosting is supposed to help. Just ask Uruguay (1930), Italy (1934), England (1966), West Germany (1974), Argentina (1978) and France (1998), or Sweden (1958), Chile (1962) and South Korea (2002), who unexpectedly finished second, third and fourth, respectively. Rival teams should be cowed by the passion and the number of home fans, the hosts buoyed.Not this time. “You looked at the faces of the Brazilian players when they walked on the pitch during the World Cup and it looked like they were about to compete in the Hunger Games,” said Zico, great Brazilian midfielder of the 1970s and 80s. “They weren’t enjoying the moment and that made things harder for them. The moment they met a team of the same pedigree they were caught out.”Brazil and Spain are the only World Cup winners not to have won at home, which is particularly surprising as the former have won pretty much everywhere else, and have hosted twice. On the first attempt in 1950 they unexpectedly lost to Uruguay in the final at the Maracanã, a scar on the nation’s footballing psyche that came to be known as the Maracanazo. In 2014 they created another miserable legend, the Mineirazo. This, though, was more than just an upset, different to mere disappointment. This was humiliation.For seven first-half minutes, Germany conjured football of a savagery unwitnessed against significant opposition in the tournament’s history. This was football as blood sport. Between the eighth second of the 23rd minute and the 49th second of the 29th minute Germany, one goal to the good already, scored four more, piercing Brazil’s defence with such frequency and brutality and engendering such horror among onlookers that footage really should be viewed through an opaque shower curtain and accompanied by a screeching Bernard Herrmann score. It was a nation’s dreams being sluiced down the plughole in a stream of saltwater. “I just wanted to give some happiness to my people. To my people, who suffer so much already,”David Luiz said after the game. “I just wanted to see my people smiling.”In the 23rd minute, when Miroslav Klose became the first man to score 16 World Cup goals and put Germany two up, television cameras picked out a female Brazil fan, face painted green and gold, a single tear rolling down her cheek. A minute later Toni Kroos sent a first-time, left-footed shot screaming into the net from the edge of the area, and cameras focused on another female fan, looking at her companion in utter bemusement. It was already too much for one couple of São Paulo. “I was watching at home with my wife and, after the third goal went in, she started to cry,” said Tite, current Brazil coach. “That started me off. The 7-1 is like a ghost. It’s present. People still talk about it, but the more you talk about it, the less likely it is that the ‘ghost’ disappears.”It wasn’t over. From the resulting kick-off Kroos stole the ball from Fernandinho, played a one-two with Sami Khedira and sidefooted in a third. Three minutes later, when Khedira scored the fifth, directors left the fans alone.Meanwhile, on Germany’s bench, coach Joachim Löw had a question for his assistant, Hansi Flick. “Hansi, tell me,” he asked, “is this actually happening?” Löw describes his feelings at this point as “a mix of absolute joy and disbelief. It was 5-0, in a semi-final against the hosts. It was unbelievable”.A little over 15 minutes later Löw gave a half-time team-talk surely unlike any other, one in which he felt compelled to ask his players not to be too good. “I didn’t want anyone to make a fool of the Brazilians in front of an audience of millions,” he said. “The respect the Brazilians showed to us, across the country, was enormous. And for me, it was completely unthinkable that we should humiliate them, or to show arrogance towards them.”Eight years earlier Löw had been assistant manager to Jürgen Klinsmann when the Germans were beaten on home soil in a World Cup semi, by Italy in Dortmund. “In 2006 we experienced for ourselves how painful it can be to miss out on a World Cup final in front of your own fans,” said Löw. In 2014 they mixed cruelty with sympathy.There were two more German goals in the second half, both scored by the substitute Andre Schürrle, though there could have been more: Oscar’s last-minute consolation for Brazil came seconds after Mesut Özil had been one on one with Júlio César, only to miss the chance.It was Brazil’s first World Cup semi-final defeat for 76 years, and their first defeat at home in any competitive match for 39 years. It was their most emphatic defeat of any kind for nearly a century, since Uruguay beat them 6-0 in 1920. In the history of the World Cup, the only other teams to have found themselves five goals down at half-time are Zaire (to Yugoslavia in 1974) and Haiti (to Poland in the same year) this is not the kind of company Brazil are used to keeping.Two members of the team – Luiz Gustavo and Dante – had to go back to Germany to continue club careers. “If I had been in another country, it would have been easier,” Dante said a few months later. “People quickly forget about respect. They forget everything you’ve done. You are alone. You’re playing against people who, as soon as they can, try to hurt you by reminding you of this event. It was painful and hard, but I learned a lot from it. For me, in football, what’s done is done. Today I’m happy. In life, you need to move forwards.”Neymar, Brazil’s forward and talisman, had been injured in the quarter-final against Colombia and watched the semi-final at home. Midway through the second half, with his mother Dona Nadine weeping, Neymar switched off his television. The dream of leading his team to victory – or, given his injury, simply cheering them on from the sidelines – was over.But not for long. Two years later Rio hosted the Olympics, and a younger Brazilian team with Neymar again its figurehead had a chance to make amends. They drew their first two games, against South Africa and Iraq without scoring, towhistles and jeers of a disappointed home support. Then they clicked: Denmark, Colombia and Honduras were beaten by an aggregate of 12-0 and they swept into a final against … Germany.It went, in the end, to penalties all five Brazilians scored, Neymar the last to do so, and Nils Petersen’s effort was saved. It was a moment of catharsis and, as the players celebrated in a sold-out Maracanã, the fans struck up a particular song, one also heard when Brazil returned to the Estadio Mineirão for a World Cup qualifier three months later, for the first time since the heartache of the semi-final, and thrashed Argentina 3-0: O Campeao Voltou. The champions are back."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f84c67c05b89885ce356617590df7d44c7be46ad/0_83_3488_2094/master/3488.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=228f39623ba98253e6845b23dbd82aa1","title":"exeter steve perryman wembley coventry league two play off final","story":"“A40, Hanger Lane, turn left on to the North Circular, past Stonebridge Park and over on my left was Wembley,” says Steve Perryman, recounting his journey from Northolt to training at Tottenham Hotspur as a teenager, a drive he could do with his eyes closed these days. “I would go past it twice a day, there and back, usually sat in traffic, and you conjure up images and think: ‘I hope I play here again.’ And now we are back there with Exeter.”The League Two play-off final against Coventry City on Monday will be particularly pertinent given it is Perryman’s final match before retiring – after 51 years in the game. He grew up in the shadow of Wembley, going to the dogs on a Friday night with his older brothers and playing on Ealing Common. “It is extraordinary and, if I could have written it, I guess this is how it would have finished,” he says.The 66-year-old Exeter City director of football estimates he has been involved in around 2,500 matches, via Norway and Japan, including FA Cup finals at the old Wembley. He played there against Scotland in front of 100,000 for England schoolboys as a 15-year-old but for 12 of the past 15 years he has, alongside the longest-serving manager in the country, Paul Tisdale, resuscitated and revived fan-owned Exeter on fumes. There, it is a constant rebuilding job. At the end of every season they are resigned to selling their best players – David Wheeler, Ollie Watkins and Ethan Ampadu last summer – and Tisdale could follow Perryman out of the door.The Exeter manager is at a crossroads after the Supporters’ Trust voted to serve notice on his two-year rolling contract in November 2016, a decision that hurt him but seemingly galvanised the team. At the time Exeter were 23rd in the table but went on to reach the play-off final last season, losing to Blackpool. “It’s like snakes and ladders when you get to 99 and then crash to zero – we don’t want that again,” Tisdale says.Another neat subplot to Monday’s match, after which the 45-year-old expects to finalise his future, is that Tisdale is good friends with Mark Robins, the Coventry manager, having played with him for Panionios in Greece. Robins, too, has been happy to integrate youth from the club’s prestigious Category Two academy. Tom Bayliss, a 19-year-old winger, is among the homegrown players who have flourished in the first team this season, a path trodden by James Maddison and Callum Wilson, who joined the club aged seven and 11 respectively. For Coventry, who have slid from the Premier League to the fourth tier, players such as Bayliss, Jordan Shipley and Jordan Ponticelli have provided hope on the darkest of days.The goalkeeper Lee Burge and Jordan Willis, two more academy graduates, have excelled this season. They are, Robins says, the lifeblood. In the past 12 months Coventry have sold the England Under-16 international Charlie McCann to Manchester United and the midfielder Ben Stevenson to Wolves. The aforementioned Coventry players have prospered at the Alan Higgs Centre, the academy’s home until at least 2023 after an extension for the site was struck by the chief executive, Dave Boddy. Finally, there are green shoots, regardless of the result against Exeter.Tisdale, in tandem with the director of football, has accelerated the development of young players from Exeter’s academy, as did his predecessors the late Eamonn Dolan and Alex Inglethorpe, now the academy director at Liverpool. Four of the regular back five are Devon-bred, including the captain Jordan Moore-Taylor and Dean Moxey, who returned to the club last year. “It’s no good having a youth policy if you have a manager that doesn’t want to pick young players because of fear about making a mistake, costing you three points and maybe your job,” Perryman says. “Tis is a terrific manager. He could do any job at Exeter City he could be the chairman, Trust chairman, he could be the scout, he could play he’s so intelligent, so switched on, that he should probably be managing director.“Exeter was a little bit of a joke – and now it’s not. Because of the geography, we are still rated as a small club, ‘little Exeter down in the south-west’, but people know we are a serious little club. The question Exeter have to ask themselves is: is fan ownership, which is good for getting you out of the grief, enough? And have they got the ambition to push on or do they want to stay as they are? At the moment it is producing players to survive, and the club was nearly dead.”Perryman is looking forward to the freshness he hopes retirement brings, to spending less time on the road and more in the garden, as well as making the trip “home”, to the new White Hart Lane, after struggling to get to more than one game per season there over the past 30 years. Before that, after a lifetime in the game, he hopes to go out with a bang. “This manager and this group of players are so classy, with their actions, discipline and their belief in the manager’s way. Promotion would be total vindication of how Tis and Exeter City play.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e7d4184da16db822c94e6b752f632cf444e13c3/0_0_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91b0718305133404facfd333c04ed2ce","title":"while the city sleeps london after hours a photo essay","story":"Photographer  Sean Smith captures the city at night, from cabaret stars to road maintenance workers, homeless people to fire wardensPhotographer  Sean Smith captures the city at night, from cabaret stars to road maintenance workers, homeless people to fire wardensIn the changing rooms backstage at Proud Cabaret in London, half a dozen performers are crammed together preparing themselves for the evening’s shows. As one liberally applies eye makeup, another fills the air with a cloud of hairspray. There are nipple tassels, high heels, leather and wigs. It’s 8pm and the night is about to begin.“There’s always a buzzing atmosphere while everyone prepares for the doors to open,” says Fiona Jay-Brown, one half of the acrobatic duo Deux Ailes. “There are a lot of performers so it does get very busy backstage but we all do our best to get the show on the road. There’s rarely a backstage panic. Whether it’s missing tit-tape or hairspray running out, we all help each other out.”Over at the Houses of Parliament, the scene is quiet and the politicians are long gone. Fire officers Eddie Brennan and Paul Chambers sweep through the House of Lords, past the empty benches, along more than three miles of corridors and down into the bowels of the famous structure, patrolling for potential fire hazards.“It’s a world heritage-listed building and I don’t want to go down as the next Guy Fawkes!” quips Brennan.Drawn from the London Fire Brigade, Brennan and his colleagues oversee numerous government buildings in the area. This past year they have investigated more than 200 alarms and reports of fire “but, touch wood, we haven’t had to fully evacuate the palace in the four years I’ve been working here,” he says.Much of the current palace was built following the devastating fire of 1834. The architect, Charles Barry, used brick, stone and iron to try to minimise the risks of another catastrophe but in the interiors he and Augustus Pugin used vast quantities of highly flammable materials.That said, Brennan notes that people present the greatest risk. “You’ve got people laying data cables next to old plumbing and it’s all out of sight, out of mind you find people propping the fire doors open and forgetting to switch off stoves and heaters and lamps. Even after the latest round of modifications, the palace will always be vulnerable to fire.”Further down the river, another London landmark, Tower Bridge, is also staffed at night. The bridge is raised around 850 times a year for registered vessels with a mast or superstructure of nine metres or more.Tower Bridge was the largest and most sophisticated bascule bridge ever built when it was finished in 1894. The lifting mechanism was originally operated using steam to power the enormous pumping engines these days the hydraulics are driven by oil and electricity while the upper walkway – now a function space with a glass floor offering views directly over the Thames – is lit in vivid pink.With the roads relatively free of congestion, Transport for London begins night maintenance work at the Upper Thames Street tunnel. Opened in 1970, approximately 40,000 vehicles and 4,000 cyclists travel through the half-mile long tunnel every day.“We have only one opportunity every three months to close the tunnel and carry out all repairs, maintenance and cleaning for the next three,” says Stewart Wilson, Asset Operations Manager. “You really feel the pressure when you have a dozen jobs that all need to be carried out at once, before the tunnel reopens.”Westminster has become a European hotspot for homelessness, with more and more people moving to the heart of London in search of hope, opportunity and support. By nightfall, not all have managed to get a roof over their heads.The Connection at St Martin’s, next to Trafalgar Square, provides help for approximately 4,500 people a year its night centre accommodates up to 45 people every night – or more during severe weather – on a short-stay basis.“Most of our clients have complex issues so our approach is to help them deal with trauma and help them to gain independence and get their confidence back,” says The Connection’s night centre manager, Paul Symonds.“They’re really relieved to get indoors at night, to have a nutritious hot meal and to get their heads down. It’s like a pool of tranquility while you’re surrounded by the bright lights and madness of central London.”Symonds adds: “You meet the most interesting characters you could ever hope to meet – that’s the joy of the job. I’ve always felt it a privilege really.“We do have our challenging moments with people dealing with addiction and mental health, but generally it’s very fulfilling.”“London can be rough when you’re on the streets. I’ve had some good times, I’ve had some bad times,” says Ken, one of the residents.“You’ve got to understand that to get into The Connection you’ve got to spend at least four nights on the street. They’ve got to see you sleeping out. There are people who’ve been out a lot longer than that, though. At least here you’ve got a bunk and the staff are quite helpful.”While London sleeps, Spitalfields night market comes alive with traders buying and selling goods. Around 750,000 tonnes of produce passes through the market each year and is shifted by 233 forklifts and about 2,000 employees.The market has been on its present 32-acre site near Hackney Wick since 1992 though its royal charter dates back to 1682 when Charles II granted permission for a twice-weekly market for flesh, fowl and roots.Peter Durber began trading at the market in 1983. “It’s still busy and bustling but it’s evolved to be a very different market over the years,” he says. “It was predominantly white trade with Jewish influence but now there’s a very large ethnic influence which has kept it alive and reflects the ersity of London.”Durber works 12 hours, six nights a week, starting at 3am. “Any sane person would look at the hours we work and think we’re all crazy,” he says. “It’s a bit of a beast but I enjoy what I do and when you have a buzz and you enjoy what you do, the time goes very quickly.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c16578329b8c94e8054aca3fd5d1b4c17c5ac6b2/0_374_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c190c7f74c2d7a704416e25c74c77cfa","title":"chelsea flower show eight ideas for home","story":"From gravel and big foliage to the unstoppable rise of houseplants, via stone tables, celebrity cacti, containers full of succulents…1 If you take home one slice of Chelsea, make it this: spurges, AKA euphorbias, are the unsung heroes of the sunny border – unfussy to the point of thriving on neglect, coping with droughts and providing long-lasting acid-green flowers that are the perfect foil for more ephemeral spring delights such as tulips and irises. I was particularly drawn to the compact evergreen cultivar Euphorbia ‘Black Pearl’ in Chris Beardshaw’s Morgan Stanley garden, although I also spotted architectural caper spurge (E. lathyris, often maligned as a weed), bright-yellow-flowered Wallich spurge (E. wallichii) and lime-yellow cushion spurge (E. epithymoides) all over the showground.2 Fancy giving room to the prehistoric-looking black-ribbed stalks of scouring rush (Equisetum hyemale), which popped up in a couple of Chelsea gardens this year? Don’t be put off because it’s a relative of the horribly invasive weed horsetail: this is a brilliant low-maintenance architectural plant that loves swampy spots and pond edges. It was shown off to good effect in Nic Howard’s garden, set against a simple charcoal-grey wall and softened with Mexican fleabane (Erigeron karvinskianus). Stuart Towner paired it with Hosta ‘Devon Green’, Japanese forest grass (Hakonechloa macra), Gunnera magellanica and European wild ginger (Asarum europaeum). Scouring rush will spread relentlessly if given free rein, so contain it in a trough or water feature.3 If you are looking for low-maintenance, low-cost alternatives to paving your front garden, gravel has much to recommend it, and at this year’s Chelsea several gardens took this theme in different directions. Sarah Price showed how to use a Mediterranean plant palette with the papery pink flowers of the Cretan rockrose (Cistus creticus) and the vivid red flower clusters of the blood pink (Dianthus cruentus). Gravel’s also a good mulch for shade planting: see Nic Howard’s row of the huge (and thankfully slug-resistant) leaves of Hosta ‘Sum and Substance’ planted in gravel along a narrow bed that would work perfectly in a gloomy side return.4 If I was in any doubt about the rise of the houseplant, the visitors swarming over the displays of cacti, succulents and orchids in the Great Pavilion were proof of their staying power. It’s not only because these plants are so Instagrammable – Popsy the Cactus from Craig House Cacti is now so popular she has her own Twitter account – but because for many of us without much outside space, an air plant or two is a far more realistic prospect. A collaboration between Ikea and Indoor Garden Design offers clever ways to display plants indoors, from space-saving hanging planters to planters on peg boards. You’ll see houseplants creeping into show gardens, too, from the blue chalksticks succulent (Senecio serpens) in Sarah Price’s garden to the cast-iron plants (Aspidistra elatior) dotted through Stuart Towner’s garden.5 Want garden furniture that will never require repainting and doesn’t need covering in winter? What about a slab of rock? Jo Thompson’s show garden for Wedgwood shows how it’s done, with flat-topped chunks of York stone serving as chair or table or both simply add a comfy cushion or blanket. Just make sure you think carefully about where to position them, as you won’t be able to move them easily. If you’re more of a wood type, take the lead from Nic Howard, whose garden seats are simple cubes of oak, charred and shaped to make the perfect resting spot.6 If summer bedding leaves you cold, try planting up containers with succulents instead. The Pearlfisher garden cleverly employed echeverias, kalanchoes, sedums, crassulas and the like to mimic an underwater scene, while communicating its message about the perils of marine plastic pollution. The key to success is a very free-draining growing medium (use cactus and succulent compost, and choose a pot with plenty of holes in the bottom) and the sunniest spot you can muster. Remember to bring them inside to a frost-free place once summer starts to fade.7 It may be the flower show, but some gardens demonstrated that big and bold foliage can offer as much impact. Stuart Towner’s Spirit of Cornwall garden is a masterclass in combining different shapes and textures to create a big-leaved border, using the palmate-leaved false castor oil plant (Fatsia japonica), the pleated leaves of rodgersias and the huge corrugated leaves of Chilean rhubarb (Gunnera manicata). If you want a really unusual bold-leaved foliage shrub for your garden, get your hands on a spikenard (Aralia cordata), as shown off by Tom Stuart-Smith in his Weston garden in the Great Pavilion.8 Bare concrete in a garden is usually shorthand for something ugly and municipal, but this year’s Chelsea shows how to use this material in an inspired way, from the concrete cubes that break up frothy planting in Robert Barker’s Skin Deep conceptual garden to Stuart Towner’s simple oval concrete patio in his Spirit of Cornwall garden. Just make sure the lines are clean, the finish professional and the planting abundant."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0e730e9f257d4d40f6443f7cc8896d2818f9ba5/0_460_5436_3262/master/5436.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8e95d1d2ba22e38f46d394ae9f87e5e","title":"ditch the tin foil and channel yotam ottolenghi how to enjoy eating outdoors","story":"From flying insects to the weather, Mother Nature can be a cruel mistress.

No wasps hang around the fruit basket in Manet’s painting and nary a seagull e-bombs the bread and cheese as Virginia Woolf’s fractious family finally make their voyage to the lighthouse. If the Famous Five’s tinned sardines ever leaked fishy oil all over the rug, I don’t remember it, while Renoir’s boating party seem bizarrely untroubled by the distinct possibility that the small dog on the table will upset their wine glasses.These are fantasies of alfresco life, but in truth Mother Nature is a cruel mistress who doesn’t give a fig for your carefully laid plans or meticulously sliced cucumber sandwiches – which is why it pays to come prepared for all eventualities. Here’s a guide to dealing with a few of the challenges likely to crop up as soon as the words “it’s a lovely day!” leave your mouth.These days, most special diets are easy to cater for with a little notice – but when someone texts on the day to inform you they have gone plant-based, or gluten-free, it can be tempting to reply telling them to bring their own bloody lunch. Before you do, count to 10 and channel Yotam Ottolenghi: a Middle Eastern feast will keep everyone happy. Big bowls of hummus or baba ganoush, paired with a salad of roasted or barbecued veg and some falafel or vegetable fritters are sure to go down a treat with omnivores, too – add pitta or other flatbreads to bulk it out, then finish with fruit and meringues or damp, sticky polenta cake. Most of these are gluten free and can easily be made vegan too. Failing that, almost all supermarkets carry a wide range of free-from products – and everyone likes crisps, right?Even the most committed animal lover might be hard-pressed to welcome our flying friends to the feast – but if you are eating outside, a certain insect presence is inevitable to be fair to them, it’s where they live. The best way of deterring wasps and bees is thought to be to trap the first inquisitive scout before it returns to the nest weighed down with ketchup and alerts 250 of its nearest and dearest to the free buffet going on in your back garden. Avoid setting up camp close to ponds or the standing water beloved of mozzies and midges instead, embrace the fresh air of a breezy hilltop – most flying insects hate both wind and smoke, which is a great excuse for a barbecue or a campfire.The crunch of sand between the teeth may seem as inevitable a part of eating on the beach as a stiff wind and a Mr Whippy for pudding, but there are ways to reduce your silica consumption. Go for food such as wraps, filled baguettes and oranges that can be eaten straight from their wrappers (see below for eco-friendly options) with minimal contact with the gritty environment. Make sure you rinse your hands, preferably with fresh water, before you even think of unpacking anything, although even a bucket of sea water is better than nothing.Obviously, sun is welcome whether you are planning a barbie in the back garden or a celebratory drink at the top of a mountain, but it can be problematic keeping food fresh in the heat. A good rule of thumb is to choose dishes from warmer climes: cured salami and ham are more robust than poached salmon or coronation chicken, just as parmesan, manchego or feta will do better than cheddar or stilton in sunshine. (That said, if you are eating at home, or can keep them flat in transit, bries, camemberts and their ilk come into their own after a few hours outside the fridge.) Crunchy carrots and radishes and Mediterranean veg are preferable to leafy greens, and vinaigrettes tend to hold up better than mayonnaise in high temperatures. If you are making sandwiches ahead of time, consider replacing the butter with avocado mashed with lemon juice, or a soft cheese.This is more likely to be a problem in the UK than sun, sadly – but all is not lost if the forecast begins to look grim one of the best picnics I have ever eaten was consumed in the very damp shadow of a dry-stone wall on Scafell Pike in December. As on a beach, choose foods that can be eaten straight from the wrappers, and avoid soft bread or delicate pastry: you’d be surprised how water-repellent a pork pie or scotch egg is compared with your average loaf of sliced white. If you are taking advantage of a brief break in the clouds to picnic, pack a waterproof layer to protect the rug, and your bottoms, from soggy grass. If the forecast looks similarly grim for a long-planned barbecue and you cannot fit the grill under cover, or prop a well-weighted umbrella over it, then go for dishes such as jerk chicken or ribs, which can be cooked in advance and then finished off either on a grill or a hot pan, depending on how the sky is looking, or choose recipes that work in the oven as well as on the barbecue.If you are planning to eat a few hundred yards from your own kitchen, I probably do not need to tell you that a tray will come in handy. For picnics at distant beauty spots and barbecues on the beach, however, it pays to consider the very unromantic question of logistics. Some foods travel better than others exquisite Parisian pastries will not look quite so pretty once they have been carted up a hill, but a sturdy British pie with a hot water crust could probably be kicked up there without much damage. Hard cheeses, cooked meats, boiled eggs and crunchy pickles are all good choices, as are soft things such as hummus or potato salad, which won’t mind being shaken about a bit. If you must take ripe tomatoes or stone fruits, then wrap them in newspaper as carefully as fine china, and put them in storage boxes. Cold drinks can be happily decanted into Thermos flasks full of ice.One of the chief pleasures of picnics in particular is their simplicity: unless physical necessity demands it, this is not the time for tables and chairs. Much lovelier to lounge about on the grass, sand or a sun-warmed rock and feel at one with nature as you shovel Pringles into your gob. In reality, all of those surfaces can be prickly, damp or downright spiky – so if you can manage to lug along a stout, preferably waterproof rug as well as the food, all the better (a sheet of plastic, or a few large Ikea bags, underneath an ordinary rug, does the job just as well). If you are planning to sit for a while, you might also like to suggest each guest brings a cushion as head support for an eminently sensible postprandial nap, and consider bringing a parasol as a sunshade: though a hat apiece is considerably easier to carry. Proper cloth napkins not only give a picnic an air of sophistication but are much more useful than paper ones, which tend to disintegrate at the mere sight of mayonnaise – and, of course, they are endlessly reusable, as well as handy for wrapping any crockery, glasses, boiled eggs and so on.As above, if you are eating away from home, keep it simple. Go for finger food – crudités and dips, burgers, hot dogs or samosas – and all you need are napkins to wipe your hands afterwards, although a bottle opener is sure to come in useful at most British picnics, as will some beakers. (Unless you want to be lugging those around yourself, ask everyone to bring their own – it will save on the washing up too.) If you are planning to barbecue away from home, invest in a small portable grill rather than wasteful disposable ones: some models are hardly more expensive, and you will be able to enjoy them for many summers to come. Barbecues will never be the most eco-friendly option of course, but you can also help by fuelling them with sustainable British lumpwood charcoal.Naturally, this should be kept to a minimum – principally for environmental reasons, although aesthetically there is little to spoil the simple elegance of a picnic like outrageous amounts of plastic wrap strewn across the rug. This should not be a problem if you are making the food yourself: there are plenty of good eco-friendly options out there, from sandwich wraps to Indian tiffin boxes, which are not only reusable, but far easier on the eye than tin foil, and a lot better at their job as well. Unless you are feeding the 5,000, you may prefer to decant condiments and seasonings into small jars (I collect tiny jam jars from hotel breakfasts for the purpose), though always leave dressing salads and sandwiches until the last minute, if possible, to minimise the risk of things going soggy and slimy in transit.In theory, without all that rubbish to deal with, this should be relatively painless: box up any leftovers for tomorrow’s lunch, then sluice out dirty containers with water if it is available and going spare, and roughly dry with the aforementioned napkins before packing away. It’s always a good idea to take a couple of bags for any disposable packaging and recycling you do manage to accumulate, and if you are likely to be somewhere without water, a few damp flannels in a waterproof washbag will be invaluable for cleaning hands and faces before you release any trapped wasps, shake out the rug and head home, smug in the knowledge you have done your patriotic duty by the great British summer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67702a83c2bae822a329ae444aeaf5da3b4ab713/0_4_6016_3610/master/6016.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=967a8990b303f86643dde9eaf001118c","title":"just a baby ultra qualifying for the ultra trail du mont blanc","story":"The UTMB is a serious challenge – at 105-miles, with a route that ascends to 34,000ft, and traverses three different countries. But just getting through the qualifying races is an epic feat in itself When you tell other ultra runners that you are training for the Ultra-Trail du Mont- Blanc (UTMB),they give you a certain look. Oh, you are a serious ultra runner. You can almost feel your trail cred rising.Not because the UTMB is the toughest race, or the longest, or in the most extreme conditions – although it is fairly extreme, being a 105-mile race around Mont Blanc that traverses a route with a total ascent of 34,000ft (10,300m) and passes through three different countries.The main reason they give you that subtle nod of kudos is because just qualifying for the UTMB is an epic feat in itself. To enter the ballot for a place, you have to accumulate points by running three qualifying races. While you do not need to win or do particularly well in any of these races – unless you’re shooting for an elite place at the UTMB – you do need to finish them all within the cut-offs.But now I have a place. The UTMB is also the most competitive ultra trail in the world, with more of the top elite runners turning up each year, treating it as the grand final, the unofficial world championships of the sport. I have no illusions about being competitive anywhere near the front of this race, but after just over a year of ultra running, when something has gone wrong in every race I have run, I am working on being as good as I can be, for what will be the culmination of my two-year ultra running adventure.It began last February when I decided to shoot for the UTMB and ran the first qualifying race, and my first ever ultra, a 35-mile jaunt along the coastal path near my home in south Devon. Since then, I have got lost in races, worn the wrong shoes, forgotten to carry water, had extreme lows – clinging to the side of a mountain during a storm in the night –and extreme highs, when I felt like superman, flying up Holyhead mountain 130 miles into the Ring O Fire Anglesey race, unable to believe that these legs that had struggled even to walk a few hours earlier now felt brand new, straight out of the box and filled with rocket fuel.And so, with my entry to the UTMB confirmed, last weekend I took on one of two final warm-up races before the big one. It was a mere 45-mile race along the Jurassic coast in Dorset. “Just a baby ultra,” I kept telling people beforehand.My latest lesson in this sport is never to underestimate an ultra race. The numbers in ultra running are so big and insane that they start to become meaningless in the space between the races, when you’re talking and thinking about them rather than actually running them. After some of the races I had already done, 45 miles seemed like nothing.That was until about 20 miles in, when I started cramping while climbing up some steps after running along Lulworth Cove beach. It was a hot day and I hadn’t taken in enough salt. Luckily the cramps went away, but then came three brutal hills in quick succession, cliffs, pure vertical madness, interspersed, of course, by three terrifying descents. By then, I was on the point of dropping out. I had my reasons clearly laid out in my mind. This was only a training race, and so 25 miles was quite far enough for a training run. And it was dangerous to run with cramps – they had come back a few times on those three hills. What if I got stuck on my own somewhere remote and couldn’t even walk. It was irresponsible to carry on.But something, and it is still hard for me to fathom quite what it is, pushed me on. Every time I resolved to stop, it said no. Go on, go a bit further. After a while, the miles still left to go and the distances already run started to blur, and my mind stopped counting, focused completely on the simple act of moving, even if it was merely shuffling. The cliff paths and seaside towns were full of holidaymakers enjoying a balmy weekend. I ran through them with my rucksack and the number pinned on my shirt like an oddball. But word of who we were had got out, and people cheered me on, telling me I was amazing, telling me to keep going. I tried to wave or smile back. When did I become the maddest guy in town? There were moments of exquisite beauty, when you would come across an isolated cove that took your breath away. In these ultras, you are so raw, that everything is more extreme. A hug from a loved one at an aid station, or the sudden appearance of nature in full bloom, can bring you close to tears. But you must go on. Perpetual forward motion is the goal. Race positions stop mattering – it ceases to become a race. I had started out with a goal time and position, but six hours on, none of that mattered. All that mattered was to keep moving, one step after another.The race ended at Old Harry Rocks. It was a setting to lift the spirits, but just finishing was ecstasy. To sit on the warm grass, take off my shoes and stare out to sea after eight and a half hours of running. In that moment, it all made sense.And so I have one more warm-up race left to go. A 78-mile run through the Dolomites in Italy. It is a scary prospect, lots more big numbers, but for now I am going to bask a little longer in the glory of another ultra completed. Another step along this crazy path I set out on when I decided, last February, to enter the UTMB.

Overall, people expressed their thanks only once in every 20 occasions.Rather than reflecting manners, or a descent into rudeness, the findings say more about linguistic traditions, the researchers said. Across cultures, close-knit groups of people take it for granted that people will cooperate with each other, to the point that saying thanks is no longer needed.“In informal everyday interaction across the world, the general norm is to respond to another’s cooperative behaviour without explicitly saying thank you, but by simply continuing with one’s activities,” the scientists say in the journal, Royal Society Open Science.The researchers studied 1,057 conversations recorded by fixed cameras and microphones in people’s homes or in places where the communities gathered. All the exchanges were casual and between people who knew each other well, such as friends and family. In more formal settings, such as buying food at the shops, the scientists believe expressions of thanks are likely to be far more commonplace.The scientists cast a wide net to capture any phrase that indicated thanks when someone did what was asked of them. In English, that meant terms like “sweet” and “good job” as well as “thank you”. In Murrinh-Patha, it included phrases such as “Yukuy murruwurInyima”, which translates as “That’s right, you’re beautiful”.“This doesn’t mean that people are universally rude, nor that speakers of English are less rude than speakers of other languages,” said Nick Enfield, a lead researcher on the study at the University of Sydney. “We should not conflate the feeling of gratitude with the act of expressing it.”What the study leaves open is why people say thank you on the rare occasions they do. One idea the researchers propose is that saying thanks is reserved for when requests go beyond the call of duty. “In everyday interaction, cooperation is the rule: social life thrives because it’s in our nature to ask for help and pay back in kind, rather than just in words,” said Enfield. “There is literally an unspoken agreement that people will cooperate.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d842f6e63ca80a283cf44a7126172e84b3d441d1/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c0c0a2fb2da595115a7dd4a5526c595","title":"one in eight people set to have type 2 diabetes by 2045 says study","story":"One in eight people in the world will have type 2 diabetes by 2045 if obesity continues to climb at the present rate, according to a new study.The institutions collaborated to launch the Cities Changing Diabetes programme in 2014 to accelerate the global fight against urban diabetes. The program began with eight cities: Copenhagen, Rome, Houston, Johannesburg, Vancouver, Mexico City, Tianjin and Shanghai. These have since been joined by a further seven cities: Beijing, Buenos Aires, Hangzhou, Koriyama, Leicester, Mérida and Xiamen.“These numbers underline the staggering challenge the world will face in the future in terms of numbers of people who are obese, or have type 2 diabetes, or both. As well as the medical challenges these people will face, the costs to countries’ health systems will be enormous,” said Dr Alan Moses of Novo Nordisk Research and Development in Søborg, Denmark. “The global prevalence of obesity and diabetes is projected to increase dramatically unless prevention of obesity is significantly intensified. Developing effective global programs to reduce obesity offer the best opportunity to slow or stabilise the unsustainable prevalence of diabetes. The first step must be the recognition of the challenge that obesity presents and the mobilisation of social service and disease prevention resources to slow the progression of these two conditions.”“Each country is different based on unique genetic, social and environmental conditions which is why there is no ‘one size fits all’ approach that will work. Inidual countries must work on the best strategy for them,” said Moses.The tide could be turned, he said, “but it will take aggressive and coordinated action to reduce obesity and inidual cities should play a key role in confronting the issues around obesity.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6513e88afe04f558c40693d7e6fce786cad9413f/0_165_4938_2963/master/4938.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c07eb699db24e0e5ef4a836743f779e","title":"the friend effect why the secret of health and happiness is surprisingly simple","story":"For some, eating alone can be a joyous thing: forking mouthfuls of pasta straight from the pan, peanut butter licked off a spoon, the unbridled pleasure of walking home from the chippie alone on a cold night. But regularly eating meals in isolation is a different story. This one factor is more strongly associated with unhappiness than any other apart from (unsurprisingly) having a mental illness. This is according to a new study by Oxford Economics that found, in a survey of 8,250 British adults, that people who always eat alone score 7.9 points lower, in terms of happiness, than the national average.This research is far from the first to suggest a link between eating with others and happiness. Researchers at the University of Oxford last year found that the more that people eat with others, the more likely they are to feel happy and satisfied with their lives. The study also found that people who eat socially are more likely to feel better about themselves and have wider social and emotional support networks.Robin Dunbar, a professor of psychology, worked on the Oxford University study. He says that “we simply don’t know” why people who eat together are happier. But it is clear that this is a regular social ritual, a moment of union and communion in our often chaotic lives. It can be a place of conversation, storytelling and closeness.“At a psychological level, having friends just makes you happier,” says Dunbar. “The kinds of things that you do around the table with other people are very good at triggering the endorphin system, which is part of the brain’s pain-management system. Endorphins are opioids, they are chemically related to morphine – they are produced by the brain and give you an opiate high. That’s what you get when you do all this social stuff, including patting, cuddling and stroking. It is central to the way primates in general bond in their social groups and relationships.”Our face-to-face relationships are, quite literally, a matter of life or death. “One of the biggest predictors of physical and mental health problems is loneliness,” says Dr Nick Lake, joint director for psychology and psychological therapy at Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust. “That makes sense to people when they think of mental health. But the evidence is also clear that if you are someone who is lonely and isolated, your chance of suffering a major long-term condition such as coronary heart disease or cancer is also significantly increased, to the extent that it is almost as big a risk factor as smoking.”One of the most striking pieces of evidence for this, says Dunbar, is a meta-analysis of 148 epidemiological studies that looked for the best predictors that patients would survive for 12 months after a heart attack. “The best two predictors, by a long way, are the number and quality of friends you have and giving up smoking,” he says. “You can eat as much as you like, you can slob about, you can drink as much alcohol as you like – the effect is very modest compared with these other two factors.”Human beings are biologically engineered for human interaction – and particularly face-to-face interaction. One study from the University of Michigan found that replacing face-to-face contact with friends and family with messages on social media, emails or text messages could double our risk of depression. The study also found that those who made social contact with family and friends at least three times a week had the lowest level of depressive symptoms.“The ability to stimulate positive emotions, which is linked to happiness, begins in interactions with others who are having positive emotions about you. So, when we see our friends and they say, ‘Good to see you’ – it’s important.”But there are many factors that might prevent us from seeing friends and family: mental ill health, immobility, a lack of money. Alison Harris is a consultant clinical psychologist and professional lead for psychological services in Salford. “Austerity has a huge influence on the loss of happiness and wellbeing,” she says. “Homelessness and unemployment in particular takes us out of contact with others. In addition to the obvious harms of homelessness, it does massively increase social isolation and anxiety. To take that even further, many people are in exile from their communities. In mental health services, we see an enormous amount of grief, depression and anxiety in people who are asylum seekers and refugees and much of that is not just due to trauma or torture or detention or fleeing from their country, but from the severe rupture of being cut off from their families and communities of origin.”When we are around others, it has an effect on our body. Some forms of friendship – going to parties, getting married, having positive interactions with others – stimulate our sympathetic nervous system. Gilbert says that the parasympathetic nervous system (otherwise known as the “rest and digest” system) “is stimulated through the verbal and voice tone of relations with each other. As far as we know, it’s not that stimulated through texts. Generally speaking, you’re designed to respond to voice tone and expression, and stroking. We are physiologically designed for face-to-face interaction.”Of course, for those struggling with depression, the idea of physical contact can be impossible to fathom. At those moments, the capacity to lift up a mobile phone and type out a text is an enormous mark of progress. It may not be the ideal form of interaction, but it’s a vast improvement on staring at a wall.He says that what has happened in the past decade, with the rise of social media, “is that it has become a very plastic society. We are all living like theatrical actors, presenting ourselves as our best. That can’t be real, and so we have many people who feel like failures or useless. They say: ‘I’m not as attractive as that, I’m overweight, I’m not kind or compassionate to others.’”As Gilbert says, the best relationships are the ones where people love us for our perceived dark sides and flaws. “People forget that love is about loving you for the difficult things, not the easy things,” he says. It is those who know us intimately who can provide that, and they do it through their physical presence, through touch, and through eating, drinking and sharing with us. Spending time together is social nourishment. So, instead of texting a friend or messaging them on social media, why not knock on their door, look them in the eye and make yourselves both feel better?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0ba09cd28532872e30ea8f03de765ca0b4d2f6e/641_174_4050_2431/master/4050.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d746b995b0a5bf1828b4bf139fdc436","title":"andrew strauss andy flower england compassionate leave","story":"Andrew Strauss is to take a summer-long break from his role as director of England cricket with Andy Flower stepping into the breach as a temporary replacement.The former England captain’s wife, Ruth, was diagnosed with cancer last December and is due to begin a new treatment at the end of this week. With that in mind, Strauss has been granted a period of compassionate leave to offer his full support.Strauss, who was appointed three years ago, said: “Andy Flower is going to be stepping in for me over the course of the summer. We all know about his qualities and his experience of both England and English cricket and he will fill in my shoes very adequately.“ I look forward to returning and grabbing the reins again but at this period of time my focus has to be on supporting Ruth and my family at a challenging time for us.”Since standing down as England’s Test team director after the 2013-14 Ashes whitewash Flower has been operating in a number of roles behind the scenes, first as the head of elite coaching before taking over as head coach of the Lions set-up.Strauss has continued his running of the senior England teams during the early stages of his wife’s diagnosis and has recently introduced a new selection system, with Ed Smith taking charge of the panel and now six new scouting roles handed to Marcus Trescothick, Glen Chapple, Steve Rhodes, Richard Dawson, Chris Read and James Taylor.“They will be compiling reports on players of interest to us,” said Strauss. “But they won’t compile reports on their own players, if they are involved in a county. It is just formalising a process that has been going on in a more ad hoc manner for a long time.On the new approach he added: “The idea is for us to get better information on all the players in county cricket.

While Thursday’s uphill finish is the kind of nagging climb that suits him Friday and Saturday have repeated climbs that will favour Yates’s climbing strength. Moreover Dumoulin’s Sunweb team do not seem to have enough climbing strength to put Yates’s Mitchelton-Scott team under pressure.Amid his obvious pleasure at retaining the pink jersey for the 10th day, Yates said his tactical plan would change. Having focused on attacking to gain time to create a cushion for Tuesday’s stage, he can now ride more conservatively. “It changes my tactics for the next few days. Unfortunately for the fans it means I can be a lot more defensive, all the way to Rome. Sorry guys.” As he noted, his stage win on Sunday, where he gained 47sec on Dumoulin, was critical in giving him the lead he now enjoys.Over a largely flat course through the vineyards that line the valley of the river Adige – and alongside the motorway that runs south out of Trento, this was far from the “kicking” predicted by Yates’s directeur sportif, Matt White, but it was by no means a straightforward process for the Briton. He never looked entirely comfortable on his time-trial bike, in stark contrast to Dumoulin’s smooth, unflustered style.The risk Yates ran, as all climbers do in this kind of stage, were exemplified by the fortunes of Thibaut Pinot, a past winner of the French national time trial title and a contender for the podium in this Giro until this stage. Here, a catastrophic performance meant he dropped to fifth overall.The top three on the stage were specialists, led by Dennis, who had targeted the opening time trial in Jersusalem, where he finished second to Dumoulin, although that ride enabled him to snatch the pink jersey in the opening week. It is a welcome result for the BMC team, which is searching for a new sponsor after the death of its founder and long-time backer Andy Rihs, and it hoisted him to sixth overall.The former world champion Tony Martin finished ahead of Dumoulin in second, while Chris Froome’s fourth place on the stage suggests he can still at least target third place, although he has been anything but consistent over the past two and a half weeks. Just behind Froome the Italian national champion, Fabio Aru, created the one major shock with fifth place – surprising for a rider who had looked close to quitting the race on Sunday – while the Essex rider Alex Dowsett posted a respectable seventh.Yates has now opened a healthy gap over the other riders pushing for victory behind Dumoulin: Pozzovivo has slipped to 3min 11sec, Froome is at almost 4min, just ahead of Pinot, which again gives grounds for optimistim.“I’ve got a bigger gap to the guys behind me,” Yates said. “It’s not just Tom he’s at a minute. The guys behind him are at a good gap. There are still some hard days to come.

Britain issued 35,000 notifications regarding EU nationals being convicted in the UK.The UK’s presentation said: “The continued, uninterrupted and secure flow of personal data between the EU and UK is vital for all partners.“An agreement on data protection will be crucial for the EU and the UK, and any disruption to cross-border data flows would be costly to all partners. An agreement will also ensure clarity on enforcing citizens’ rights.”The EU has expressed willingness to strike a deal over data, but there are serious concerns in Whitehall about the UK losing its say over the future shape of the legal framework and day-to-day impact of imposing those rules on businesses and iniduals.The EU’s Brexit guidelines, published in March, suggested a future legal framework for data sharing “should be governed by union rules on adequacy”, meaning Brussels would allow data sharing if the UK’s standards stayed in alignment with the EU.However, the UK’s presentation said such a basis for data “would not reflect the full breadth and depth of the UK-EU relationship”.Britain instead wants a more “stable” system that allows the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), the largest data protection authority in the EU, to sit on the body that regulates and sets guidelines.It also wishes to be part of the “one-stop shop” mechanism, whereby only one supervisory authority, rather than multiple bodies across the EU, decides on cross-border data disputes.The nationality of the body taking the lead would be determined by the location of the main establishment of the data controller involved.The UK’s presentation said: “It will benefit EU businesses operating in the UK to avoid two parallel processes on data protection disputes – one in the UK led by the ICO and one in the ‘one-stop shop’, and avoids unnecessary additional cost.“It could include amendment, dispute resolution and termination provisions. This would provide EU and UK iniduals and businesses with greater stability and certainty.”Barnier has previously expressed his concerns about attempts by the British government to meddle in the autonomy of EU decision making after Brexit.The UK, however, has said trade, consumers and public services stand to lose out if such a deal cannot be struck.It also pointed to its efforts to enforce General Data Protection Regulation – which aims to make all organisations gain genuine consent to use personal information – as an indication of the UK’s high standards.Officials told the commission’s negotiators: “We seek a new agreement on data protection that builds on a standard adequacy decision.“Such a pragmatic approach would reflect our close shared interests and unique relationship, to the benefit of both the EU and UK … The UK is ready to begin discussing the future EU-UK relationship on data protection now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa064e804025eedffabff6bc754b5311e7210010/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8636606b3b7e30bc02b88b28a28bc973","title":"dundee on lonely planet best in europe hotlist 2018 emilia romagna cantabria","story":"The Scottish city has a top 10 slot on this year’s list – along with Emilia-Romagna and Cantabria – as the guidebook publisher looks to reflect concerns about overtourismThe “thriving, creative” city of Dundee has been rated as one of the best places in Europe to visit this year by Lonely Planet. The travel guide publisher has attempted to tackle the issue of overtourism in its annual holiday hotlist, by highlighting lesser-visited destinations across the continent.Dundee is Scotland’s fourth largest city and is sixth on Lonely Planet’s Best in Europe 2018 list. It earned the spot for its “head-turning” urban redevelopment, including the transformation of its historic waterfront and the opening of a new branch of the V\u0026ampA this September .Lonely Planet describes it as an “exciting moment” for a city that has often been overlooked by visitors to Scotland, and praised its “nationally important museums and attractions” and “dynamic, creative spirit”.The number one spot went to Emilia-Romagna in Italy. The region was picked out as an alternative to Tuscany, Campania and Veneto, and for its emergence as one of the best foodie spots in the country. Emilia-Romagna is the home of ragù, Parma ham, balsamic vinegar and Parmesan cheese. Recently Bologna, the regional capital, saw the opening of the world’s largest culinary theme park, Fico Eataly, where visitors can sample all manner of local cuisine. Other picks on the list included the wild beaches, mountains and “enchanted” villages of Cantabria, Spain (a far cry from the overcrowded attractions of Barcelona and the Costa del Sol) and Kosovo, which boasts “dramatic hiking trails, Ottoman-era history and a growing cultural scene”. “There is growing concern over the increase in tourism to popular European destinations, particularly over the busy summer months, so with this list we wanted to show that there are a wealth of incredible alternatives to discover across Europe,” said Lonely Planet editorial director, Tom Hall.

Like Ariana Grande.” It is poignant because, even now, these teenagers are able to recapture that sense of anticipation. It is devastating because you know what is coming next.In all, 14,000 people attended Grande’s show at the Manchester Arena on 22 May last year. Manchester: The Night of the Bomb (BBC Two) recounts the events leading up to, and after, the explosion in the foyer that killed 23 people and wounded more than 500. It is a documentary you can watch only with your heart in your throat.Grande performed her last number and walked off stage shortly before 10.30pm, perplexing a lot of her young fans. “It was the Dangerous Woman tour and she hadn’t sung Dangerous Woman,” says Acacia Seward, 12. By the time Grande came out and did the song as an encore, a good proportion of the audience were already making their way through the foyer.The device went off at 10.31pm, while the bomber stood among parents waiting to collect their children. The moment of the explosion is recalled by survivors in a litany of horrifying details. People were lifted off their feet. The doors blew open, then shut themselves. The foyer was filled with a bright white light – “Like snow coming towards you” – and then darkness as it was suffused with smoke. Nuts and bolts from the device ricocheted, making a sound like machine-gun fire. For some victims, the immediate aftermath was eerily silent: their eardrums had been perforated. There was blood everywhere and people struggled to grasp the\u0026nbspextent of their injuries. “I saw my legs were on fire and then I was unconscious,” says Eve Senior, 15.A countdown clock (reminiscent of the one Grande employed as her big entrance approached) winds back to the moment of the explosion for another perspective. Phone footage recorded the panic inside the auditorium, where there was a stampede of people trying to get out\u0026nbsp– running towards the carnage by the exits. In all the\u0026nbspconfusion, rumours about gunmen spread.Winding back again, the documentary adopts the point of view of the emergency services. Four transport police were on duty at Victoria railway station, connected to the arena by a footbridge. They ran toward the scene, in the opposite direction of the fleeing crowds. “If you can imagine hell,” says PC Steve Corke, “times it by a million”.Because of the possibility of secondary devices – there were abandoned bags everywhere – arriving ambulance crews were kept back, even as members of the public ran toward the danger to help. With no proper medical equipment on the scene, the flow of blood was stemmed with Grande T-shirts. Victims had to be ferried to the train station to get medical attention. The safety protocols in place were much criticised after the fact, but the documentary obliges you to experience the confusion, the agonising and frustration over decisions taken, for better or worse, on\u0026nbspthe night.The other main strand of the film concerns the 23rd fatality: 22-year-old Salman Abedi, sliced in two by his own bomb. Born and bred in Manchester, Abedi had returned to the city four days before on a flight from Libya. His parents, who fled Libya during the Gaddafi regime, had recently gone back there to live. A difficult and sometimes violent student, Abedi was fighting on the front line in Libya’s civil war by the age of 17. In the months before the attack, he was living alone in the family home in Manchester. His exact motivations remain opaque, but police say he would have been incapable of making the bomb he used without close guidance. Abedi does not qualify as a victim alongside those he killed, injured and traumatised that night, but he is bound up in the tragedy all the same.Manchester: The Night of the Bomb provides a gruelling evocation of that tragedy. Some of it – such as the recorded announcement still blaring out the words “Attention: due to an incident, it is necessary to evacuate the area” long after the building had been emptied of anyone who could walk – is positively haunting. But it is also, in the end, inspiring, thanks to the determination of those present to tell their stories."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90d6c444b6075a7e238f31728a885556facb1e3a/397_272_2603_1562/master/2603.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=071893b1a0fde989556eb5077268ae42","title":"roseanne tv show america cold comfort","story":"The finale of the controversially rebooted sitcom brought to an end a season of problematic storylines, familial strife and a star whose off-screen politics threatened to derail it all There’s a moving scene in the season finale of the Roseanne revival where Dan is desperately trying to save sentimental items from his rapidly flooding basement. At first he seems to have a handle on things, but when he places a large box on a shelf, it suddenly collapses, and boxes and toys and mementos come crashing down into the water. Dan smiles, bewildered and exhausted by his bad luck, and then proceeds to take a crowbar and angrily destroy the wall next to him, half laughing and crying as he does it. There is a desperation to this scene that I think defines the entire first season of the series, which strives to tell the story of ordinary working-class people who just can’t seem to catch a break. Despite the attention the series has received for touching on “hot-button” issues, the show is ultimately about disappointment and loss. Roseanne jokes that “at least we finally got a swimming pool after all these years”, but her humor is cold comfort for an American dream that has all but dried up. When Dan’s best friend Chuck comes over to confront him about hiring cheaper labor for one of his projects, Dan is both ashamed and resolute that he had no other option, “I always told you, if I’m eating, you’re eating. I’m not eating,” Dan tells him sadly.In this way, the Roseanne revival isn’t just a portrait of middle America, but a portrait of middle America in profound crisis. True, the Conners have had to weather tough times before, but the new season is especially bleak, with each character having to contend with their own personal regrets at a time when options seem to be running out. Becky finds out her eggs are too old and she will never be able to have a baby. Darlene is forced to move back in with her parents and two kids when she loses her job. Roseanne is popping pain pills out of desperation, since she can’t afford knee surgery.The show’s exploration of these economic issues is often subtler and more nuanced than the series is given credit for. John Goodman is particularly moving as Dan, a devoted father and husband who is trying to make the best choices for his family, and Sara Gilbert’s performance as Darlene is a compelling exploration of what happens when real life gets in the way of our dreams. It’s not just poverty that is a roadblock to happiness either – one of the series’ triumphs is being able to depict to loving allure of family life, while also illustrating its profound frustrations, from daily squabbles over household chores, to the way that intimacy is often conveyed through mean little jabs at one another’s expense, rather than little “I love yous”.Roseanne’s meanness has always been an aspect of her character, yet her willingness to say the unsayable has taken on new meaning in a culture that has grown crueler over the past 20 years. While the reboot consistently handles economic issues with sensitivity, it is also often remarkably insensitive when it came to race. Roseanne assumes that the Muslim neighbors next door are terrorists, and both she and Dan malign Mexican workers as “illegals”. When Dan and Roseanne sleep through the “black and Asian” shows, Roseanne quips that they didn’t miss much, noting how they are, “just like us”. Moments like these are meant to be edgy rather than overtly racist, but as much as the series tries to tie economic anxieties to racial tensions, it’s clear that Roseanne’s fears and frustrations around non-white families are portrayed as being “natural”, rather than sinister.Likewise, there is a moment in this season when Roseanne quite literally holds her teenage granddaughter by the neck and pours water on her head as a kind of punishment for talking back, which is held up as an effective parenting technique, rather than a huge overstep that is borderline abusive. On Twitter, the real-life Roseanne touted her role in this episode by writing: “The next episode shows Harris (my TV granddaughter) calling me a stupid old hillbilly – watch how I handle her and her very liberal mother!”On the surface, these moments actually seem to run counter to the show’s theme of bringing politically ided families together to the table to actually talk. Yet despite the constant refrain that Roseanne is more about family than politics, the main reason that Roseanne has been so successful is that it stokes controversy. Viewers, liberal and conservative, tuned in to the show in huge numbers because they wanted to see just what the real-life Roseanne Barr would use the show to say. Roseanne didn’t offer America a seat at the table to discuss pressing issues, but a pop culture framework for fighting with one another more directly, not just about politics, but about dramatically different interpretations of what America can and should be.With the news that co-showrunner Whitney Cummings, an outspoken liberal comedian who referred to herself as the “PC police” of the writers’ room, is leaving, producers have been working hard to assure viewers that the show will be even-handed in its approach. The now solo showrunner Bruce Helford explained in an interview with the Hollywood Reporter that the show will champion many perspectives: “We have a lot of new voices, younger voices, which I think is important on the show … We run a democratic room, almost nobody has a stronger voice than anybody else everybody’s input is there.”Even so, it seems clear that the show itself will never be exactly non-partisan. Its ratings success hinges on strong feelings about its lead star, rather than the show’s reputation for offering a refined take on what it means to be an American family. In fact, the show has received a great deal of attention precisely because its star is so over-the-top. Roseanne’s far-reaching success points to how American culture continues to conflate bravery with bravado and to see outraged clicks as just as important an indicator of success as well-reasoned content.The last moments of the season finale end with a strange scene of forced plenty, where Roseanne’s family comes together to eat a full meal just a few minutes before Roseanne has to begin to fast for surgery. “We have seven minutes!” DJ says, as a laugh track plays in the background. The overflowing table is a symbol of family togetherness, of connection, and hope after a season where there just never seems to be enough. There is not a moment to waste and, as they get down to eating, no one talks to one another at all.

I’ll regret trying to grow my hair out as a teenager. I’ll regret spending so much time on dishwasher comparison websites. But most of all – and I guarantee that this will happen – I will regret sticking with Westworld.And I suspect this is the case around the world. I have yet to meet a person – a real flesh-and-blood person, who does not work in television or get paid to write Westworld recaps – who can summon even a hint of excitement about it. Westworld’s entire audience, I am certain, is made up of people who sit there idly checking their phones during episodes because they’re still on the fence about formally giving up.I think I can feel the start of something similar happening with The Handmaid’s Tale. What started off as something timely and necessary has given way to out-and-out torture porn. The first episode of the second series – which variously included muzzling, nooses, freezing, chaining, burning and graphic, closeup self-mutilation – was essentially one liquidised pig’s carcass away from becoming Saw III: The Series. The Handmaid’s Tale is now so relentlessly grim, so spectacularly, queasily bleak, that it overwhelms any point it might be trying to make. I would be much happier if I gave up on it now and never looked back. But guess what? I am still here, because it is a big important show, and that apparently overrides whether or not I like it.This is not to say that I am entirely hamstrung by apathy. There have been a couple of moments this year where I have victoriously given up on a programme. The first was Amazon’s The Crossing, billed as The New Lost, but which ended up being a honking great mess of too many ingredients hurled at the screen with a shrug. Yes, it might have taken five episodes for me to get there, but turning to my wife at the conclusion of another hour of nothingy bullshit and asking “Do you actually want to keep watching this?” felt like a moment of genuine triumph. Same goes for BBC One’s’s Hard Sun, which I bailed from two episodes in because I’m only human.There was a time when I would have persevered more aggressively with these programmes. I might have even made a sport of it, turning Westworld into a hate-watch endurance test, gleefully yelling at the TV whenever Jeffrey Wright murmurs another faux-intellectual phrase with all the pretend idiot profundity his stupid robot body can muster. But what is the point, when there are dozens of better shows I could be watching instead? Or a new show that I would otherwise never get around to watching? To hate-watch Westworld in 2018 would be even more self-indulgent than Westworld itself, if you can imagine such a thing. So here I am, trapped in purgatory. This is what I want to know: at what point do you summon the courage to give up on a show? Is there a tipping point, a moment of no return, where you can happily cash in your chips and move on from a series you no longer enjoy? If there is, for God’s sake tell me, because I would love nothing more than to stop watching Westworld and The Handmaid’s Tale. I won’t stop watching them, obviously, but I would love to."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3504733.1527012506!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"minister tries to stall reckless drink can return scheme","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAn Oireachtas committee is presssing ahead with plans to introduce a deposit scheme for drinks containers, despite reservations by Minister for Environment Denis Naughten. Photograph: ReutersAn attempt by Minister for Environment Denis Naughten to stall the introduction of a deposit scheme for drinks containers has been rejected by an Oireachtas committee.Amid claims it could cost up to €116 million to set up a deposit and return scheme (DRS), Mr Naughten warned it would be “financially reckless” to proceed without proper scrutiny of the proposal.However, members of the Committee rejected the Minister’s view, voting to press ahead with the plans drawn up by the Green party.The decision was taken when the committee met in private session on Tuesday to sign off on its final report on the Green’s Bill, following hearings on proposed measures in recent months.Green party leader Eamon Ryan said the amendment, if adopted, would have effectively killed the Bill. It envisages a 15 cent deposit on aluminium and plastic bottles and a mandatory DRS, which is vehemently opposed by Repak recycling company.Whether it goes onto committee stage is now “in the Government’s court”, Mr Ryan said. Mr Naughten had the option of bringing amendments at that point, he added – or it could stop the Bill by way of issuing a “money order”.The Minister’s proposed amendment stated: “The Committee also recognises that a further Committee Stage amendment will be necessary to give the Minister the discretion to introduce a DRS Scheme rather than the current mandatory nature of the Bill. This will afford the Minister time to carry out the necessary research into a model that may be fit for purpose in Ireland and does not increase costs or have effects on the existing kerbside collection system.”One evaluation submitted to the committee suggested a DRS could cost €116 million to set up. It is understood Mr Naughten told committee members household charges would also rise by up to €1 per lift for the green bin collection to recover an estimated 3 per cent of additional plastics.Mr Ryan said a DRS might be introduced for closed drinks containers but would exempt\u0026nbspglass bottles “as the current rate of recycling for both of these items is fairly high”.He proposed changing the charging structure for plastic bottles and aluminium containers under current arrangements with Repak, from paying by tonne to paying by container. This would amount to a five-fold increase in what producers pay on plastic and aluminium but bring in on a par with other countries.In response to the committee’s draft report Mr Naughten said the potential consequences of a DRS must be carefully considered: “Without a complete understanding of the cost implications on the taxpayer, on employers, on retailers and on customers it would be financially reckless of me to proceed with its introduction without proper scrutiny.”Currently, €65 is paid to waste collectors for every tonne of household packaging waste collected by Repak money they collect from producers who place packaging on the Irish market to do this."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3502274.1526843650!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"in muff we pray for the president in culmore the queen","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tArchdeacon Robert Miller at Muff Church of Ireland in Co Donegal. Photograph: Trevor McBride. “When I’m in Muff we pray for the President, and when I’m in Culmore we pray for the Queen.”For Archdeacon Robert Miller, that is the only difference between his parish in Donegal and his three in Derry.The rector of Christ Church, St Peter’s and Culmore in Derry City, and Muff in Co Donegal, Archdeacon Miller laughs at the idea of having an “international ministry” given the cross-Border nature of his work.With Brexit looming, he admits there is uncertainty among some in his parishes around what may come, but he says that for the church “the Border doesn’t really exist”.“I have joked that I hope I won’t need my passport to go to Muff on a Sunday morning,” he says, “but the reality is that we’ve been here before with Border checkpoints and crossings and during that time Muff and Culmore related and worked together, so I would be hopeful that whatever happens, we’ll manage.”Culmore is about 3km from Muff. The journey between the two takes less than five minutes and only the changing road signs and a poster erected by the Border Communities Against Brexit campaign group, marking the Border’s location, suggest that you have moved from Northern Ireland to the Republic.There may be complications down the line if a political agreement on Brexit is not reached but Archdeacon Miller says the Church of Ireland existed long before there was any Border.“We predate partition, and the reality then was that the Church of Ireland had to negotiate something that was imposed upon it and which put a Border between some of its dioceses,” says Archdeacon Miller.“But the Church of Ireland is a church of the whole island, and whilst obviously we acknowledge the secular way in which the island is ided, the Church of Ireland operates as a whole-island church.“If you talk to people they’ll say that the reality of the matter is that at partition a line was drawn on a map – and especially during the Troubles things were very, very difficult – but the relationships existed and persisted.”Archdeacon Miller ministers to about 330 families across the four parishes. He says his responsibility is to provide pastoral support for his parishioners throughout the challenges posed by Brexit.“I don’t do down the uncertainty, because certainly for people who are farming, or people whose business causes them to go back and forth across the Border, or even those who work in one or both of the currencies and then have to cross the Border, all of this causes uncertainty for them,” he says.“Each generation will have its own challenge, and in some ways our challenge is Brexit.”The archdeacon says that while it is not the church’s role to have an opinion on Brexit, its responsibility is to react to people’s concerns.“In terms of peacebuilding, you’re always aware that a change in the status quo at the minute could be a difficult thing,” he says. “For people who have lived on the Border for 40-plus years of troubles, that would be a concern if there was an attempt to reimpose it, but it does seem that it will be a soft Border.”Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3503528.1526934314!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"westminster committee urges may to take more active role in north","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Theresa May was urged by the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee at Westminster to take a more active role in Northern Ireland’s affairs until devolved institutions there are restored.  Photograph: EPAThe Northern Ireland Affairs Committee at Westminster has called on Theresa May’s government to take a more active role in the affairs of Northern Ireland until the devolved institutions there are restored.In a report, Devolution and Democracy in Northern Ireland – Dealing with the Deficit, to be published on Tuesday, the committee also urges an early return to talks to restore the Executive and Assembly.“Karen Bradley is right to make restoring power-sharing devolved government in Stormont her first priority. However, while the political impasse continues the list of policy obstructions and project delays grows and becomes more serious,” committee chair Andrew Murrison said.“We believe the Secretary of State is correct to insist that any decisions from Westminster align with the principles of the Good Friday Agreement. Helpfully, some GFA-compliant guidance already exists. For example, the Hart Report makes policy recommendations that were broadly welcomed across the community.“Elsewhere, the Secretary of State will need to develop stronger ways of engagement and consider new measures to secure adequate scrutiny. Our recommendations include a committee system at Stormont as a temporary expedient pending restoration of the Executive.”Some members of the committee, including Labour’s Kate Hoey and the DUP’s Ian Paisley, have criticised the way the Belfast Agreement operates and the report calls for a consultation between London, Dublin and Belfast on how it might be improved. The report suggests that such a consultation should review how the power-sharing system works and if and how it should be changed.“The Good Friday Agreement has had a transformative effect on Northern Ireland. However, its institutions have collapsed and even if restarted tomorrow would likely remain fragile,” Dr Murrison said.“With the involvement and consent of the whole community in Northern Ireland, we have to consider if they can be more robust and how improvements can be made, as envisaged in the agreement itself. We must investigate every avenue to secure long-term stable government. For political stalemate to become the new normal is unthinkable and unacceptable.”-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3503426.1526927646!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tory brexiteers should hope for another election and soon","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSir Ivan Rogers, who resigned as Britain’s diplomatic emissary to the EU in January last year.

The latest answer to the customs impasse is continuation of the status quo until 2022, when new technologies might fix the problem. By then, the process of exit will rival the second World War in length. If a technical solution does not emerge, Britain’s holding pen could become a permanent home.There is also a new immigration system to decide, as well as the UK’s freedom of manoeuvre on state aid and other regulatory matters. Whatever Britain does in these areas could affect the terms it secures in the trade talks that constitute yet another avenue of negotiation with the EU. In all likelihood, London will be haggling with Brussels over one thing or another indefinitely, much like the Swiss. Ivan Rogers predicted this future when he quit as Britain’s diplomatic emissary to the EU after the referendum.It is not clear that Britain will turn on Brexit as young voters replace old. Demography is not destiny. Even if it were, it is slow to work. All the same, Leavers should worry about the passage of time. The drop in European immigration that is already showing up in data could blunt the public’s main grievance against the EU. Endless negotiations could themselves accustom voters to a kind of rolling semi-membership. If a clean exit is to happen, it has to happen before long.At the risk of riling Brenda of Bristol, the voter whose fatigue at hearing the news of last year’s general election became a viral hit, the best hope for Tory Leavers is another election, and soon. A plan leaked over the weekend envisages a vote of no-confidence in prime minister Theresa May, before an autumn date with the electorate, perhaps under the leadership of Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary and committed Leaver.A new election is not certain to fix the Leavers’ central problem, which is the shortage of parliamentary numbers for their preferred exit. But the potential is there. Two favourable circumstances obtain right now that might not in a few years. One is material. The economy is still growing, with wages rising ahead of inflation. If the business cycle turns before Britain leaves, the animal spirits behind Brexit could weaken. A downturn has the power to frustrate Brexit in a way no human factor can. It is one thing to vote Leave, and another to leave while the economy is fragile.The other tailwind is political. The opposition Labour party still wants to leave the single market. As stable as this seems, Leavers cannot treat it as an immovable fact of politics. They are in parliamentary trouble because the opposition line is already softer than it was at the turn of the year. If it softens much more, a hard exit becomes a fringe prospect.In other words, this apparent rough patch for Leavers is, on second glance, much better than things might be in the near future. The Conservatives are in reasonable shape after the local elections this month. Some voting-intention polls have them ahead. Other surveys show that voters trust them over other parties to negotiate exit.Most Tories dismiss the weekend speculation out of hand. A snap election seems implausible. But the same was true five minutes before May called one last spring, at which point such insurmountable barriers as the Fixed Term Parliaments Act were breezily surmounted. Given the delicate balance of forces in the House of Commons right now, it would take a small shift in their favour to smooth the way to a clean exit.The Eurosceptic dread was never a formal annulment of the decision to leave. No government could do such a thing without inciting half the nation. Their real nightmare is a prolonged exit that ultimately obscures the difference between leaving and staying. This explains their impatience to leave now, and to elect a parliament to that end.On the balance of probabilities, they will fail. May should see out the year, and the process of exit. But that balance is finer than generally believed, and liable to change with events. The parliamentary deadlock is real. The answer is the long grass or to consult the country. Voters who were not exasperated by last year’s election might yet have their patience tested with a fifth major democratic event in as many years.

And seeing just one extra advert each week was associated with consumption of an extra 60 such snacks a year – or 18,000 calories annually.Obese participants in the study were found to watch around five hours more television weekly, and one extra advertisement..html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}The food industry wouldn’t pump hundreds of millions into advertising their products by creating catchy adverts if it didn’t get people to eat moreDr Jyotsna Vohra, study authorThe findings, presented at the European Congress on Obesity in Vienna, Austria, come as ministers prepare to publish an updated childhood obesity strategy, which could see restrictions on advertisements and marketing.Study author, Dr Jyotsna Vohra, head of the Cancer Policy Research Centre at Cancer Research UK, said the observational study suggested clear links between obesity and advertising.“Junk food marketing is associated with obesity in young people of all ages, and we know that obesity is  linked to at least 13 types of cancer”, she said.“The food industry wouldn’t pump hundreds of millions into advertising their products by creating catchy adverts if it didn’t get people to eat more.”Current broadcast regulations in the UK “clearly aren’t working” and have not been updated for a decade, she said. And she said future restrictions should also cover streaming platforms, given that around half of television watched by young people is now consumed this way.The study found that on average, young people consumed around 30 unhealthy snacks weekly – taking up around half of their recommended total calorie intake – but just 16 portions of fruit and vegetables.The more junk food advertisements young people watched, the more junk food they ate, with all participants able to recall a favourite advertisement, with those which were catchy and fun standing out.“With today’s teens spending more time in front of screens than any other activity apart from sleeping, curbing exposure to junk food ads on streaming platforms as well as TV will be key to helping teens make healthy diet choices and reducing obesity rates,” Dr Vohra said.Sugar tax | Can it solve the obesity and diabetes epidemics?One third of children are overweight or obese by the time they leave primary school, and two thirds of adults weigh too much, national statistics show.Separate research suggests obese children are around five times more likely to become obese adults with a much higher risk of health problems including 13 cancers, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.Last year, research by the Obesity Health Alliance found that junk food companies in the UK spend £143 million a year on advertising – almost 30 times the £5 million spent annually by the Government on healthy eating campaigns.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Duke and Duchess of Sussex make first appearance as a married couple at Prince Charles\u0026#39 70th birthday partyMeghan Markle and Prince Harry wedding speeches: The most moving lines and best jokesInside the royal wedding evening receptionNottingham Cottage: The Kensington home where Meghan and Harry live as a married coupleHow Meghan and Harry\u0026#39s official wedding photographs capture the importance - and joy - of the dayComment: Britain has an opportunity and a duty to protect children trapped in war zonesUS issues health alert in China after employee suffers similar symptoms to Cuba \u0026#39sonic attack\u0026#39Acid attacker who left ex-lover in such pain he took his own life is jailed for life for \u0026#39act of pure evil\u0026#39Prince George terror suspect encouraged \u0026#39lone wolf\u0026#39 attackers to target royal at school, court hearsIsil sleeper cells could strike the Philippines, army chief warnsPrivate jet splits in half as it crashes after skidding off runway in HondurasSplitting up families on flights a risk to air safety, report warns Israeli military officers have no regrets over use of lethal force at Gaza protests International journalists depart for North Korea\u0026#39s nuclear test site, as experts warn demolition could destroy valuable evidenceDitch the bath, Environment Agency chief says as he warns of need for personal water use targetsNew York lawyer insists he is ‘not racist’ after tirade at Spanish-speaking restaurant staff prompts Mariachi protest outside his homeBenedict Cumberbatch and Mark Gatiss tease new Sherlock mysterySpaceX rocket launches satellites designed to track climate changeOxford University in spat with David Lammy over ersity figures, as official account retweets post calling MP \u0026#39bitter\u0026#39What is the \u0026#39First Past The Post\u0026#39 voting system?What is Article 50?

It followed a threat from President Donald Trump that a June summit with Kim Jong-un could be called off. Journalists on the trip revealed that they face a 12 hour train ride, followed by four hours on a bus and then a two hour hike to reach the remote test site in the mountains of Kilju County, North Hamgyong province. Tom Cheshire, Sky News Asia correspondent, described a surreal first day after the first batch of journalists were flown to Wonsan on a charter flight from Beijing on Tuesday. Satellite images of the Punggye-ri test site on May 7 2018His team’s satellite phone and radiation dosimeter – a device to measure the level of nuclear radiation they would absorb – were immediately confiscated at the airport, he revealed. “Officials assured us that the test site is completely safe so we would not need it, despite our repeated protests,” he wrote. Even after arrival, the journalists were being kept in the dark about their schedule, he continued. “What is sure is that it will be what the North Korean regime want to show. A government minder is by our side every minute.”Mr Cheshire said their hotel in the port city, which until recently was a base for artillery drills and missile launches, was intended to be a luxury resort and had the overpowering smell of fresh paint. The visitors were offered a bizarre banquet in a large hall. “Music – a violin cover of Frank Sinatra’s My Way – was piped in. On the menu: everything from fondue to steak, as well as fried turtle and shark fin soup, and row after row of silver cutlery,” he said. “In a country that has suffered so much from famine and poverty, and which continues to suffer, it was a dislocating experience.”The journalists are expected to be able to film the dismantlement of Punggye-ri, the only active nuclear weapons test site in the world, from a viewing platform at a safe distance.  The exercise is intended by Pyongyang to show good faith over a moratorium on nuclear and missiles tests that it announced in April, amid a diplomatic thaw with South Korea and ahead of a summit with President Trump in Singapore that is still planned for June 12. Since 2006, the North Korean regime has conducted six nuclear tests in tunnels beneath Mount Mantap, close to Punggye-ri. The most recent, on September 3 last year, caused a 6.3 magnitude earthquake. According to several reports, the blast, which was almost 17 times the size of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima at the end of World War II, may have caused the site to partially collapse, raising concerns about the stability of the mountain itself. In October, the Japanese media reported that a tunnel under construction had collapsed, killing up to 200 workers. North Korea’s decision to close the site has been welcomed by the US and South Korea as a positive diplomatic gesture. But scientists and nuclear experts, who have not been invited to the closing ceremony, have warned that the demolition of Punggye-ri’s tunnels will also destroy valuable evidence and data about the North’s weapons programmes. Cheryl Rofer, a chemist who has worked all over the world on the disassembling and decommissioning of nuclear and chemical weapons, said that much information about the country’s bombs could be gleaned by allowing experts access. “I would want to bring some capability of taking samples, and I would also want to bring a geologist with me. I’d want to have a radiation counter, I would want to go into the tunnel to see if parts of it have caved in at the back,” she told CNN. “Isotope measurements could tell you about the design of the device, it would tell you what kind of bombs they’re making, what they’re making them out of, how much uranium and plutonium is in the bombs. We might be able to infer what they’re planning and the shape of their progress,” she said. Please review our commenting policyDuke and Duchess of Sussex make first appearance as a married couple at Prince Charles\u0026#39 70th birthday partyMeghan Markle and Prince Harry wedding speeches: The most moving lines and best jokesInside the royal wedding evening receptionNottingham Cottage: The Kensington home where Meghan and Harry live as a married coupleHow Meghan and Harry\u0026#39s official wedding photographs capture the importance - and joy - of the dayComment: Britain has an opportunity and a duty to protect children trapped in war zonesUS issues health alert in China after employee suffers similar symptoms to Cuba \u0026#39sonic attack\u0026#39Acid attacker who left ex-lover in such pain he took his own life is jailed for life for \u0026#39act of pure evil\u0026#39Prince George terror suspect encouraged \u0026#39lone wolf\u0026#39 attackers to target royal at school, court hearsIsil sleeper cells could strike the Philippines, army chief warnsPrivate jet splits in half as it crashes after skidding off runway in HondurasSplitting up families on flights a risk to air safety, report warns Israeli military officers have no regrets over use of lethal force at Gaza protests Ditch the bath, Environment Agency chief says as he warns of need for personal water use targetsNew York lawyer insists he is ‘not racist’ after tirade at Spanish-speaking restaurant staff prompts Mariachi protest outside his homeBenedict Cumberbatch and Mark Gatiss tease new Sherlock mysterySpaceX rocket launches satellites designed to track climate changeOxford University in spat with David Lammy over ersity figures, as official account retweets post calling MP \u0026#39bitter\u0026#39What is the \u0026#39First Past The Post\u0026#39 voting system?What is Article 50?

Muslims are asked to give away 2.5 per cent of their wealth during the 30-day festival as part of zakat.“We are trying to appeal to a wider audience with the new money,” Erkin Guney, the chairman of the board of trustees, told The Hackney Gazette. “It’s big in the Islamic world, and we have set up a platform for wealthier Muslims outside our community to support and donate to our mosque.”Last month, Muhammad Abu-Bakar of Blossom Finance in Indonesia explored the functionality of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to determine whether they fit with Islam’s strict definitions of money.“Several recent fatawah issued by prominent Muslim scholars offered incomplete or contradictory opinions on the topic,” said Matthew Martin, CEO of Blossom Finance.“With all the confusion out there, we wanted to offer clear guidance supported by solid research that benefits both laypeople and practitioners of Islamic finance.”The conclusion of his study was that bitcoin is permissible in principle as it is accepted by a wide variety of global merchants.Scandal and infighting fuels the battle over bitcoinThe bitcoin wallet address used by the mosque to receive the cryptocurrency has so far only received one donation, worth just over £100 at today’s prices. Gurmit Singh, founder of blockchain startup Combo Innovation who helped advise the mosque on setting up the bitcoin wallet, is hopeful for more donations.“If Muslims, who make up a quarter of the world’s population, hold just 1 per cent of bitcoins – or £1.04 billion – then £26 million in Zakat contributions is due,” Mr Singh said.“It is likely the actual figure is much higher. Currently hardly any mosques or Islamic charities accept Zakat in cryptocurrency.

In addition, the weak pound will be driving up input costs for many UK companies which will ultimately filter through to UK consumers in the coming months,” said Mr Bell. “If inflation does increase, UK consumers will once again start to feel the pinch. \u0026nbspWage growth is currently only marginally ahead of inflation at 2.6 per cent and interest rates on cash savings remain rock bottom so rising prices will weaken the spending power of both earnings and savings.”Alistair Wilson, head of retail platform strategy at Zurich, offered a more optimistic view and said UK inflation is “finally heading in the right direction for savers”. “Coupled with rising wages and record levels of employment, this will provide a small, yet well-deserved boost to the spending power of UK households,” he said. However, Charles Haresnape, chief executive of Gatehouse Bank, said the UK’s savers “still have little reason to feel uplifted”.“Despite its recent falls, inflation remains far above what the average deposit account is paying, which means the vast majority of savers are still seeing their capital eroded in real terms,” he added.You can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

Investing in digital currencies is therefore more similar to buying equity in a high-tech firm rather than a normal currency, the study suggests.The volatile price of bitcoin reflects core ideas of the study, having swung between $6,500 and $10,000 just within the last six weeks. Dr Bianchi warned that the current cryptocurrency market is akin to the dot-com bubble between 1997 and 2001 that saw excessive speculation in internet firms on the part of investors, eventually resulting in the collapse of many of the companies.“Most of these cryptocurrencies come to existence through unregulated crowd sales similar to IPOs, the so-called Initial Coin Offering,” Dr Bianchi said.“As a result, the market for cryptocurrencies may look similar to the dot-com bubble at the end of the 1990s, and it may be that only a handful of them survive, so for investors it is like choosing who will be today’s Amazon.”The Independent\u0027s bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

As these movies have gone on, they’ve also become ever-more interlinked, featuring regular cameos, references, and Easter Eggs to other instalments.For newcomers to superhero movies — perhaps those who have become absorbed in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) following Black Panther — the amount of material to watch can be overwhelming. But for those wanting to persevere, there are two watching orders. Really, you should probably watch these movies in release order, starting the journey starting with Iron Man — one of the best MCU instalments to date — moving onto The Incredible Hulk, then Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger, finishing Phase One with Avengers. This order works well in terms of the post-credit scenes all setting up the next movie and has the intended rhythm formed by producer Kevin Feige.However, many fans have taken to watching the series in chronological order. This might be a little convoluted, but that should not put you off: below is every piece of MCU viewing material mapped out into chronological order including movies, Netflix shows, one-shots (those mini-films you will find in the DVD extras), and other TV shows. 27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 Agent Carter (seasons one and two)For phase two, things almost play out in release order, except s of the Galaxy Vol. 2 comes directly after the first s, meaning the movie has been moved into Phase Two, despite being a Phase Three release. Ranking the Marvel Cinematic Universe filmsAlso of note, one-shots were phased out during Phase Two with the introduction of the Netflix shows and Agents of Shield. For those who do embark on Agents of Shield (the second and third seasons are great), you should definitely watch along with the movies as they have major effects on the show’s story.All Hail the King (one-shot – Thor: The Dark World)Agents of Shield (season one: episodes 1 — 7)Agents of Shield (season one: episodes 8 — 16)Agents of Shield (season one: episodes 17 — 22)s of the Galaxys of the Galaxy Vol. 2Agents of Shield (season two: episodes 1 — 19)Avengers: Age of UltronAgents of Shield (season two: episodes 20 — 22)Agents of Shield (season three: episodes 1 — 19)Made it this far? Well done, you’ve watched a whole lot of Marvel! Phase Three marks some of the best MCU movies so far, but also some timeline bending difficulties. For instance, Doctor Strange begins before Civil War, but finishes after Civil War, Slingshot features lots of flashbacks, and Agents of Shield season five features a lot of obscure time travelling. Also, Black Panther and Spider-Man both take place directly after Civil War, while Ragnarok and Panther directly lead into Avengers: Infinity War. Below’s just a guide for a manageable way of watching based mainly on release order.Agents of Shield (season three: episodes 20 — 22)Agents of Shield (season four: episodes 1 — 8)Agents of Shield: Slingshot (web series)Agents of Shield (season four: episodes 9 — 22)Agents of Shield (season five, episodes 1 — 14)Cloak and Dagger (season one)Congratulations. If you’ve watched all of the above, you’ve processed over nine days worth of Marvel movies and television. Nine days! And there’s still more to come, including: Ant Man and The Wasp, Captain Marvel, an untitled fourth Avengers movie, Spider-Man: Homecoming 2, s of the Galaxy Vol. 3, Luke Cage season two, Daredevil season three, The Punisher season two, Iron Fist season two, Jessica Jones season three, and New Warriors season one.

Meaning means being able to be British and hold a British passport.Clearly those words at the moment are inappropriate insofar as we put a real hurdle to people wishing to have a British passport which is not the case for people who wish to have or find it expedient to have an Irish passport.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesFelix, two,sits next to messages and flowers left in Manchester, ahead of the Manchester Arena National Service of Commemoration at Manchester Cathedral to mark one year since the Manchester attack.

In addition, the weak pound will be driving up input costs for many UK companies which will ultimately filter through to UK consumers in the coming months,” said Mr Bell. “If inflation does increase, UK consumers will once again start to feel the pinch. \u0026nbspWage growth is currently only marginally ahead of inflation at 2.6 per cent and interest rates on cash savings remain rock bottom so rising prices will weaken the spending power of both earnings and savings.”Alistair Wilson, head of retail platform strategy at Zurich, offered a more optimistic view and said UK inflation is “finally heading in the right direction for savers”. “Coupled with rising wages and record levels of employment, this will provide a small, yet well-deserved boost to the spending power of UK households,” he said. However, Charles Haresnape, chief executive of Gatehouse Bank, said the UK’s savers “still have little reason to feel uplifted”.“Despite its recent falls, inflation remains far above what the average deposit account is paying, which means the vast majority of savers are still seeing their capital eroded in real terms,” he added.You can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

Mr Conte also said he had attended the International Kultur Institut in Vienna to refine his legal studies. The Kultur Institut is however a language school and does not offer legal courses, according to its website.The politician, who previously acted as the personal lawyer for Luigi Di Maio, the leader of the Five Star Movement, also claimed that he pursued his legal studies at Yale University, Duquesne University, the Sorbonne in Paris, and the University of Cambridge. Cambridge was unable to immediately confirm or deny whether Mr Conte had attended, citing confidentiality rules.A spokesperson for the Five Star Movement said in a statement that the criticism of the would-be prime minister’s CV showed that the press was “so afraid of this government of change”.“In his curriculum Giuseppe Conte wrote with clarity that he perfected and updated his studies at New York University. But he did not cite courses or say he completed a master’s at the university,” the spokesperson said.“Conte, like any scholar, has studied abroad, enriched his knowledge, and perfected his legal English. For a professor of his level, the opposite would have been strange. He did it and rightly wrote it in the curriculum vitae, but paradoxically this is not good now and it even becomes a fault. It is the umpteenth confirmation that the press are so afraid of this government of change.”World news in picturesWorld news in picturesPeople demonstrate in Paris during a nationwide day protest by French public sector employees and public servants against the overhauls proposed by French President Emmanuel Macron, calling them an attack by the centrist leader against civil services as well as their economic security.Newly appointed Catalan president Quim Torra arrives to visit jailed Catalan separatist politicians at the Estremera jail near Madrid.Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro casts his vote during the presidential elections in Caracas.

The Home Office remains tight-lipped and government spokesmen have offered little of substance. Visa applications are “rigorous and proper”, Downing Street has suggested, while a security minister has noted that “more cases over the next few weeks could be on their way”. Many questions remain – has Mr Abramovich been denied a visa? If so, on what grounds? Is this a demonstration of muscle before the inevitable new documents are issued? Or has this been directed by Downing Street?Roman Abramovich must reveal finances to get back into the UKAnd this, says the Russian exile businessman Vladimir Ashurkov, is highly problematic. “If the British are trying to send out a message, it is a really weak one,” he says. “Mr Abramovich is one of richest men in Britain, owns a football club, and is a prominent public figure. The public deserves to know what the government really thinks about him.” Mr Abramovich has held British visas for several years. But the rules on his Tier 1 investor visa were tightened in 2015, after his last renewal. Applicants now have to show that £2m of the investments they make into the UK are from legal sources.The oligarch is unlikely to have much problem in doing this, if that is indeed the only hurdle he has to leap. But whatever the British decision actually is, it suffers for being non-transparent, says the author and security expert Mark Galeotti. It would be one thing if he was targetted for being a Russian oligarch, and quite another if the government was acting on intelligence.“If they have some specific information about Abramovich, they should make it public, so the punishment actually has some deterrent effect,” he says. It is also unclear whether the British government decided to move against Mr Abramovich because of coincidence – a visa renewal so soon after Skripal – or due to his proximity to power. Russia warns UK it is \u0027playing with fire and will be sorry\u0027 over Salisbury spy poisoningMr Abramovich is considered to be very close to the Kremlin, but he is not unique in that regard, and is not quite in Vladimir Putin’s inner circle.But the oligarch is also considered a reliable go-to and source of finance for many projects, says Valery Solovei, Professor at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations. And that link has been enough for Moscow to draw its own conclusions. World news in picturesWorld news in picturesPeople demonstrate in Paris during a nationwide day protest by French public sector employees and public servants against the overhauls proposed by French President Emmanuel Macron, calling them an attack by the centrist leader against civil services as well as their economic security.Newly appointed Catalan president Quim Torra arrives to visit jailed Catalan separatist politicians at the Estremera jail near Madrid.Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro casts his vote during the presidential elections in Caracas.

By attacking Russia’s vulnerabilities – the nexus of money and politics – the conflict with Britain has become not only serious, but also highly personal. “The mood in the Kremlin is that they want to have nothing more with this British government,” he says. “There is no way back for Theresa May or Boris Johnson as far as Moscow is concerned they are waiting for the next elections.” Why it’s a big problem for Putin if the Balkan countries enter the EUThe British moves have been heavily ridiculed in state propaganda. News programmes have suggested the UK is out to punish Russia, whatever the grounds, with Theresa May portrayed as the main bogeywoman. “The average Russian isn’t going to shed tears over poor oligarchs, but the lack of clear reasons has allowed the Kremlin can put whatever spin they want on it,” says Mr Galeotti. “But the rich Russians who once thought London was open to them have begun will now look to find somewhere to go. It doesn’t modify behaviour at all.”  Following tightened legislation and warnings of an impending crackdown, hundreds of millions of pounds of Russian cash has already left British shores over recent months. The trend looks set to continue. “The UK was once considered a safe haven for Russians, but no more,” says Mr Solovei. “Well-off Russians have begun to look for other places to put their cash, nervous about the possibility of new and unpredictable sanctions.” John Woodcock disagrees over comment Jeremy Corbyn was ‘a robust critic of the Russian governmentt for more than 20 years’A parliamentary report published on Monday raised the prospect of a further strengthening of the sanctions regime against Russia. It claimed “dirty money” was in danger of undermining the reputation of the City of London. In its most radical sections, it suggested coordinated moves to make it harder for Russia to raise money on the markets. One of the people interviewed for that report, Mr Ashurkov, said that it is unlikely the UK would gain broad agreement for a move that would likely enrage Moscow further. “That, at present, seems an unwarranted step,” he said. or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Rather, she wanted to widen the electorate by attracting young voters and non-whites who hadn’t been casting ballots. She will test her theory as the underdog against either Lt Gov Casey Cagle or Secretary of State Brian Kemp, who will meet in the Republican runoff in July. Mr Cagle led a five-man Republican field, with Kemp qualifying for the second spot after a campaign that was a sprint to the right on everything from immigration to support for President Donald Trump. Mr Kemp promised to keep pulling in that direction, with Mr Cagle trying to balance the demands of a conservative primary electorate with his support from the business establishment. The scenario worried some Georgia Republicans who were accustomed to centrist, business-aligned governors who rarely flouted Atlanta-based behemoths like Delta and Coca-Cola. Some GOP figures worried the GOP gamesmanship on immigration and gay rights, in particular, had already ensured Georgia wouldn’t land Amazon’s second headquarters. Elsewhere in the South, Texas had three House runoffs that will be key to whether Democrats can flip the minimum 24 GOP-held seats they would need for a majority in next year’s Congress.All three were among 25 districts nationally where Mr Trump ran behind Hillary Clinton in 2016. Democrats nominated women in two of the districts and a black man in the third all three nominees will face white, male incumbent Republicans in November. Attorney Lizzie Fletcher far outpaced activist Laura Moser in a metro-Houston congressional contest that became a proxy for Democrats’ fight between liberals and moderates. National Democrats’ campaign committee never endorsed Ms Fletcher, but released opposition research against Ms Moser amid fears that she was too liberal to knock off vulnerable Republican Rep. John Culberson in the autumn election. World news in picturesWorld news in picturesPeople demonstrate in Paris during a nationwide day protest by French public sector employees and public servants against the overhauls proposed by French President Emmanuel Macron, calling them an attack by the centrist leader against civil services as well as their economic security.Newly appointed Catalan president Quim Torra arrives to visit jailed Catalan separatist politicians at the Estremera jail near Madrid.Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro casts his vote during the presidential elections in Caracas.

Will Hurd in November. Ms Jones would be the first openly lesbian congresswoman from her state. Former NFL player Colin Allred won a battle of two attorneys and former Obama administration officials in a metro-Dallas House district. Mr Allred, who is black, topped Lillian Salerno and will face Republican Rep. Pete Sessions in November. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee lined up behind Mr Allred after the group’s initial favourite failed to make the runoff. Among Republicans, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz showed off his endorsement muscle, with his former chief of staff, Chip Roy, winning a competitive runoff for a San Antonio-area congressional seat opened by the retirement of Rep. Lamar Smith. In the governor’s race, Democrats tapped former Dallas County Sheriff Lupe Valdez to take on Republican incumbent Greg Abbott in November. Ms Valdez is Texas’ first openly gay and first Latina nominee for governor. Voters in a central Kentucky congressional district opted for retired Marine officer and fighter pilot Amy McGrath over Lexington Mayor Jim Gray to advance to a campaign against Republican Rep. Andy Barr. National Democrats once touted Mr Gray as one of their best recruits in their efforts for a House majority. They said in recent weeks they’d be happy with Ms McGrath, but the race still shaped up as a battle between rank-and-file activists and the party establishment. Ms McGrath was making her first bid for public office, among a handful of female Naval Academy graduates running for Congress this year. Mr Gray also lost a 2016 Senate race. In eastern Kentucky’s Rowan County, voters denied the Democratic nomination to a gay candidate who wanted to challenge the local clerk who denied him and others same-sex marriage licenses. David Ermold had wanted to face Republican Kim Davis, who went to jail three years ago for denying marriage licenses in the aftermath of an historic US Supreme Court decision legalising same-sex marriage. Republicans want new special counsel to probe alleged FBI misconductClinton endorses woman who could become first black, female governor While Washington fixates on the daily developments in the Russia election meddling investigation, Democratic congressional candidates insist they’ll win in November arguing about bread-and-butter issues like health care. Arkansas state representative Clarke Tucker captured Democrats’ congressional nomination in a Little Rock-based district by telling his story as a cancer survivor. Though he faced a crowded primary field, his real target all along has been Republican representative French Hill, who voted many times to repeal the 2010 Affordable Care Act. The Arkansas district may not be at the top of Democrats’ national target list, but it’s the kind of district the party might have to win to be assured of regaining House control in November. The state’s Republican governor Asa Hutchinson dispatched primary opposition as he sought another term. Democrats nominated former Teach for America executive Jared Henderson. or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The two had been lovers after meeting in 1960 when being gay was banned.Scott, who worked as a model, was said to have had a full blown affair with the politician and even had liaisons in Thorpe’s Commons room.But after they parted, Thorpe was said to have viewed Scott as a dangerous blackmailer intent on revenge - something that could have wrecked his political ambitions.For while homosexuality was legalised in 1967 it was still taboo for people in the public eye.Scott had been lured on to Exmoor by a hitman, who was allegedly a part-time pilot called Andrew Newton who had been hired as part of the plot.He shot the model’s dog before turning the gun on Scott – but it jammed. Effing and jeffing, he sped off.After managing to hail down an approaching car, Scott blurted “Jeremy Thorpe” to the driver.A police investigation lead to a trial in the Old Bailey with the Liberal leader accused of conspiracy to murder along with three other men. But the jury did not feel convinced that Thorpe, a man of hitherto unblemished reputation and a national figure with a very distinguished public record could be capable of the crime. And he was acquitted along with the others.But Scott maintains Thorpe wanted him dead and said he only felt safe when the politician died in 2014.His younger self has been played by actor Ben Wishaw in the new BBC drama starring Hugh Grant called Very English Scandal."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict0004075418813.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"david starkey harry meghan royal wedding","story":"Nazi-uniform-wearing, strip poker-playing, headstrong Harry was the black sheep of the Royal Family and his whirlwind romance the most unlikely, least planned of royal unions.But by wooing and winning Meghan he’s done more to change the image of the Royal Family than any focus group or image consultant.More than Prince Charles’s anxious musings and more even than his mother Diana’s dramatic life and death.Actions, they say, speak louder than words. Well, Harry’s acted.They all talked about modernising the Royal Family. Harry has actually done it with a bride and a wedding service like no other.“Love,” Bishop Curry told us in his extraordinary sermon — which spoke in accents unheard of in polite English churches — “love can change this world.”It’s sure changed the Royal Family. Ms Markle, it is worth repeating, is mixed-race, American, of uncertain religion, an actress, divorced and with a sexual history.In the past any one of these would have rendered her deeply doubtful as a royal bride and the combination would have ruled her out entirely. But the times they are a’changing.The stigma of divorce was still powerful as late as the 1990s, which is why it took so long to dissolve the disastrous marriage of Harry’s parents, Prince Charles and Princess Diana.But their divorce, and Charles’s subsequent remarriage to Camilla, acted as a sort of earthquake which brought all the remaining conventions of royal marriages — virginal brides, nice English girls, no divorce — tumbling down.Which, in a nutshell, is how the Royal Family came to get Meghan.But why did Meghan want to become royal? The short answer is that she wanted Harry. But so did lots of other women, who all baulked at the prospect of becoming royal.Not Meghan. Indeed, she seems to have embraced it as passionately as Harry himself.As an actress, of course she wasn’t fazed by the publicity that had so put off Harry’s earlier girlfriends. But there’s more to it than that.At university she took a double major in theatre and international studies — which was her real love.She became an intern in the American embassy in Argentina. She took the exam to enter the US State Department, which is the equivalent of our Foreign Office.It was only when she failed the notoriously difficult test that she turned to acting.Moreover, the moment she enjoyed success and fame with Suits, she used it to leverage her entry on to the international stage as “Global Ambassador” for World Vision Canada, among many other good causes.In other words, acting was not her vocation. It was only a means to an end.And that end is much better served by her marrying Harry, becoming royal and using her fame — and his — to serve the issues, particularly women’s issues, she is so keen on.So you could say that Harry — the eternal boy-man — is marrying his mother, since Diana used her fame too.But Diana did it in opposition to her estranged husband. Meghan aims to do it in partnership with Harry and at the very heart of the Royal Family.And she’s proving astonishingly adept — is it those actressy skills again? — at winning over the British establishment.Back in the 1930s, the Archbishop of Canterbury was the deadly foe of Wallis Simpson, King Edward VIII’s divorced American bride, and led to his abdication.Today, Archbishop Justin Welby is Meghan’s best friend. Indeed, he’s practically three in a bed with the couple.There’s chemistry, of course. But there’s also calculation on both sides.Welby wants to use Meghan, who as an American does religion as well as touchy-feely, to spearhead a religious revival among the young.The Royal Family also want to buy into her as an international brand.Which is why the Queen appointed Harry Commonwealth Youth Ambassador.Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKKeeping the Commonwealth going in the face of the overwhelming indifference of British politicians of all parties has been the greatest personal achievement of the Queen’s long reign.And she capped it by ruthlessly stage-managing Charles’s acclamation as her successor as Head of the Commonwealth at the most recent Commonwealth Conference.That was the constitutional bit sorted out.Harry’s appointment addresses the equally important question of PR.Meghan and Harry are the model modern couple: Mature (well, she is), bi-racial,bi-cultural, international, do-gooding, fashion-conscious and media-savvy to their fingertips.They are the perfect face of a modern monarchy at home and ideal Global Ambassadors for Brand Windsor abroad.And, come to think of it — which I’m sure the Queen and her advisers have done — they are the perfect Global Ambassadors for post-Brexit Brand Britain as well.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nobody would believe that.Yet the happy couple set aside family rows, petty jealousies and drunken sabotage and basked in the warm embrace of an adoring public.Windsor’s Disney-style ceremony was watched in broad daylight north of the equator and the middle of the night Down Under by happy viewers of all races and creeds.There is a message here for us all.Harry and Meghan’s wedding did more than unite this nation in sympathy and affection for a popular prince and the love of his life. It showed this country is world class.The sub-plot, of course, was the emotional union between the damaged children of two broken families.Fans have long yearned for Prince Harry to find happiness after the roller-coaster life and shocking death of his fabled mother, Princess Diana.They have warmed to a young man who transformed himself from a mixed-up kid to a likeable soldier, helicopter pilot and champion of war-damaged Invictus casualties.As for his bride, Meghan Markle is the glamorous star of hit TV series Suits, who dreamed as a child of becoming a princess.Best of all in this age of right-on political correctness, she is the daughter of a charming African-American mother and an Emmy-winning Hollywood lighting specialist.The House of Windsor is now truly multicultural.It is also hip.Our amazing sovereign, at 92, and doughty Prince Philip, 96, both heading for their royal telegrams, are the Queen and King of Cool.Where else in the world would you see an Elton John double act with Windy City preacher Bishop Michael Curry?This was a truly uplifting occasion, worn lightly by a once-stuffy Royal Family.Nobody does it better when it comes to choreographing mounted cavalry, trumpets, banners and horse-drawn carriages with an electric-powered E-Type and a vintage Rolls-Royce.All underscored by a sense of humour, as Harry and his supportive brother William exchanged banter at the altar of Windsor’s historic St George’s Chapel.Even the weather turned out in tribute, bathing Windsor Great Park’s glorious greenery in spring sunshine.There may have been some muffled coughs over Markle family squabbles but they were nothing compared with the torrid dramas leading to the Queen’s own “annus horribilis”.The world has become used to British pageantry.But this Royal Wedding was a timely reminder that Britain is not just a small island with a fading history on the edge of Europe.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex ride in a carriage down The Long Walk back towards Windsor Castle after getting married in St Georges Chapel, WindsorThe 21st-century United Kingdom is an unrivalled brand on the global stage.The world was witnessing more than mere pomp and circumstance.This was UK plc on international parade, joining hands with the global community in a way no other nation can match — even the mighty USA.Had Meghan married into the family of a French or American president, a German Chancellor or a Kremlin tsar, would anyone have tuned in?Neither China nor Russia could captivate so many friendly eyeballs.The Olympics might do it.But London 2012 revealed Britain is best on these occasions, too.On Saturday, Britain proved it is capable of reaching out to a world beyond borders.Harry and Meghan’s marriage bonded the UK indelibly with the US.If the new Duke and Duchess have kids, they will be American citizens — as well as British due to Harry’s lineage — and will eventually be liable to American tax.Importantly, this wedding had special significance for the 2.5billion citizens of 52 Commonwealth countries, especially in Africa and the Caribbean, who swear allegiance to the Queen.My Australian in-laws were constantly on the phone from Sydney this weekend, all thoughts of becoming a republic abandoned, to discuss the finer points of royal protocol.But this event was watched from lands with no current ties to Britain — South America, the Far East and the Gulf States.It was a showcase of modern Britain forever adapting to change, the key to our success as an outward-looking nation.There was a clear hint of defiance, too. This steely couple were doing it their way.Our Brexit negotiators — on both sides of the argument — should take note.That big wide world, viewing us in high definition on Saturday, is where Britain’s future lies.These are our markets.The audience liked what they saw and they want some of what we’re having.In marketing terms alone, it was priceless.Too often we underestimate our strength and standing.We have developed an absurd inferiority complex.We’ve been led to believe we are too weak and puny to stand alone on the global stage.Yet we are among the world’s greatest economies, second only to Germany in the EU.We are a nuclear power with a real professional army which has helped keep the peace in Europe, and have an envied place on the UN Security Council.Republican lefties despise all this stuff.They smear Britain’s record as a brutal colonial power while ignoring our global lead in abolishing slavery.Disturbingly, some Conservatives seem to agree the UK is washed up and past its prime.Since we cannot run our own economy, they say, we should hand the job to unelected bureaucrats in Brussels.These, remember, would be the same Brussels flunkies who created the euro, wrecked the economies of member states and put millions of unemployed young people on the scrap heap.Most of those workless youngsters gratefully upped sticks and moved here.I wonder why?Saturday’s Royal Wedding showed we are in the Premier League.Now the world is watching, perhaps with slightly less enthusiasm, as another British saga lurches towards its climax — another broken family consumed with jealousy and bent on revenge.The cast is familiar — the statutory drunk, a bully who prefers to talk with a gun in his hand, some characters who would prefer a car crash to a happy ending.Can we stop the bickering and reach a good Brexit deal?Why can’t the Leavers and Remainers put the country first, join hands, bury their differences and take a vow to work together to serve the national interest?Inspired by the Royal Wedding, by the poem Invictus, we can rise above petty differences.“We are the masters of our fate: We are the captains of our soul.”Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Oh well.Most married couples leave it 18 months before they reach that arrangement.But on that bombshell it was on with the Royal Wedding, which normally divides the nation into two distinct camps.There are the royalists, who have great fun watching all the pomp and pageantry on television.And the republicans, who have great fun hating all the pomp and pageantry on television.So the only real choice to be made, for all of us, is: Which channel?Personally, six hours of a photobombing Kay Burley giving it the full Partridge on Sky News was a punishment that’s way beyond me, as was five hours of the E! channel gang ­yelling: “Oh my God. Wow!”ITV was never going to be anything less than thoroughly professional in the hands of Julie Etchingham and Phillip Schofield, once he shut up about Holly Willoughby, so I went with the Beeb, where Naga called it a night shortly after announcing Prince Harry was now: “The Duke of Essex.”Oi! Oi! “Sussex rather.” Oh. Pity.The real surprise for some of you, though, might have been discovering that to give it an informal vibe, ­alongside Kirsty Young, BBC1’s 9am-and-beyond coverage was now being fronted by the strangely contorted ­figure of Dermot O’Leary — the former host of ITV’s The Marriage Ref.A show that may have been the ­perfect rehearsal for most royal ­weddings, but probably not this one.They weren’t alone, obviously.The Beeb had the joint surrounded, in fact, by among others Huw Edwards, ­fashion expert Jo Elvin, who was “across the dress” (as clueless as the rest of us), Alex Jones, Ore Oduba and Anita Rani, who performed the ­essential task of repeating what the other person had just said.Ore: “First glimpse of the dress, it’s going to be a moment.”Anita: “It’s going to be a moment.” Traditionally, of course, on these great state occasions, the moment TV crews start interviewing other TV crews is the cue for the coverage to descend into flannel, repetition, idle speculation, cliche (“Excitement’s ­building”), imponderable questions and outright stupidity.On Saturday, by slight contrast, the trigger was actually the arrival of Oprah Winfrey and the first trickle of celebrity guests, who had a clearly ­nervous ­Dermot asking: “When the invite says ‘hats’, does that mean hats are an absolute given?”“Absolutely, it does,” said Kirsty, slapping him down testily.It got progressively worse with each arrival as well.So by the time Amal Clooney wafted in alongside husband George, who was dressed as one of Modern Romance, even basic motor tasks seemed beyond some of the BBC team.Kirsty: “It can be difficult to wear a hat, can’t it?”Jo: “I think so, yes.”In fairness, it should also be stated this idiocy was certainly not restricted to the BBC.I switched over to ITV during the ­arrivals and heard Meghan’s old drama teacher, Gigi Perreau, say: “This is incredible and we’re right there. Well, we’re here but we’re also there, so it’s fabulous.”It’s just the nature of the beast.With so much time to fill, everyone will say these things.Only the BBC, though, could possibly leave me feeling queasy with the choice of one of its Royal Wedding experts.This was left-wing “social commentator” Afua Hirsch, who was privately educated and has led a life of unimaginable advantage, compared to most of us, but is also a professional victim who thinks pretty much ­everything is “racist”, wants Nelson’s Column torn down and wasn’t about to drop her agenda with such a large audience at her mercy.“While I have felt alienated by the inherited privilege,” said Afua, who’s enjoyed more than most, “my own struggles with identity have made me appreciate the need for cultural ­continuity.“So while I didn’t relate to the Royal Family, I did relate to that need for a sense of tradition.”Quite a brass neck, isn’t it, speaking out against the whole concept of the Royal Family, while simultaneously using them to increase your TV profile, as Afua had been doing all week.Instead of telling her so, or pointing out Harry’s ex Chelsy Davy had arrived while she was guffing away, a nodding Dermot said he could listen to Afua “all day”.A claim I doubt, frankly.Indeed, I reckon he’d have been throwing himself off Windsor Castle’s ramparts before breakfast if he’d tried.No one else, I suspect though, was listening to a single word she said.Nor will they have needed Afua’s lofty approval to enjoy a day filled with so many memorable events, including Bishop Michael Curry’s fiery address to the congregation, the ­reappearance of the Duke of Edinburgh and Meghan’s Rolls-Royce ­hurtling up the Long Walk past 100,000 Union Flags like it was being driven by Richard Hammond.These are all magical moments you’ll possibly want to watch again — and if you do, having sat through both start to finish, I’d probably recommend the ITV version.It had the better ­historic detail, was never in any danger of missing Chelsy Davy’s arrival and rounded everything off nicely as well.Over on the BBC, meanwhile, Kirsty did it by searching for profundities and going where angels feared to tread.“Something has travelled between Harry and Meghan that might be the next page of the story, where they give us a gorgeous little product of their union which we might enjoy too . . . ?”Though not if Naga’s honeymoon arrangements are to be believed, they won’t.Obviously.Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Brexit negotiators should remember this.An exciting new era awaits the happy couple, and us, as a truly global Great Britain.SHADOW Chancellor John McDonnell is a sinister politician who would wreck Britain’s finances.Yesterday he outlined how he wants to overthrow capitalism and introduce socialism.He and Jeremy Corbyn would take us down a very dark path. Just look at once-rich Venezuela, where socialism resulted in the poor starving to death and there being no medicine for the sick.Madly, McDonnell yesterday claimed the South American country’s problem was that it was not socialist enough. He also said he wanted a “zero- tolerance” approach to anti-Semitism, yet defended Labour’s appointment of Martha Osamor to the House of Lords.That’s the same Martha Osamor who claimed the party’s anti-Semitism row was manufactured as “a tool to intimidate activists on the Left”.We wouldn’t expect anything less from McDonnell, a man who glorified the IRA, described London rioters as “the best of our movement” and joked about lynching a Tory minister.There are rumours the Government is insanely considering calling a snap election — risking handing this scary clown the keys to the country finances.The Tories would not just be gambling their future, but Britain’s.CULTURE Secretary Matt Hancock is right to get tough with the social media giants.For far too long Facebook and Google have shown no concern for the youngsters using their sites.Mr Hancock invited 14 of the internet giants to a consultation.

Later, I went back with him after he had built a night school for the boys, and asked over a cup of tea: “Why are you doing this, Harry?”He replied: “This is the most important thing I do.”It tells you everything about who his mother was.Inside the Chapel, the hymn was Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer, which was played at Princess Diana’s funeral and one of her favourites.Di’s sister Lady Jane Fellowes delivered the only reading. Listening to it was Sarah, the Duchess of York, who had not been invited to other recent royal weddings.Inviting Fergie was a brilliant thing to do. During Diana’s troubled times every Sunday she would drive down to Berkshire to have lunch with Fergie, spending the afternoon talking about their divorces.Outside in the Chapel courtyard were 2,000 people from Harry and Meghan’s charities, including servicemen who have lost limbs.Harry is following Diana’s hugely successful campaign to stop landmines by working with those who have been wounded by IEDs.When Harry was flying back from one of his tours of Afghanistan he shared the plane with three soldiers who were in a coma.He realised these soldiers, if they recovered, would have limbs missing and facing a life of misery — which is why he inspired them with his support for the Invictus Games.And Harry and Meghan asked guests to make donations to the Children’s HIV Association.Harry has clearly never forgotten how his mother took the stigma out of Aids by embracing sufferers, including babies in Brazil.And then there was the ring. On Saturday night Meghan was wearing the emerald-cut aquamarine ring Diana first wore in 1996.Harry once told ITV’s Tom Bradby: “I wanted to do something that would make my mother proud.” He succeeded on Saturday.Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Such an amazing day #Golden ticket #Royal connections.But the excitement apparently didnt last long as her complimentary goodie bag was posted on eBay hours later where it eventually went for £21,400.The hessian bags, inscribed with the couples initials, contained a welcome letter, commemorative chocolate coin, bottled Windsor Castle water, fridge magnet, official order of service and a tub of shortbread.Claire received more than 80 bids on her listing - with one bid of £60,000 retracted - before managing to sell it.The young woman is not believed to have received the cash yet.According to eBay rules, bids can only be retracted within one hour if there is less than 12 hours in the auction to go. The decision to allow a bid to be cancelled is up to the seller.But Claire isnt the only opportunist to sell off the commemorative bag, with a number of other bags put up for sale just hours after the wedding that saw everyone from the Queen to the Clooneys attend.One seller called Chrisofwilliams, from Merthyr Tydfil, Wales, stands to make more than £40,000 after putting his commemorative bag on eBay.The gift was initially listed for 99p on Sunday, with the seller saying: Buy a piece of history and memorabilia to celebrate a momentous special day for Britain’s and the royal family.I am selling my limited Goody bag for guests of Royal wedding of Meghan and Harry 19th May 2018.Official bag with full contents containing commemorative chocolate coin unopened sealed and in original condition, labelled spring water bottle unopened and sealed in original condition: royal wedding fridge magnet unopened in original packaging, the castle spectator badge and a tub of ‘handbag shortbread’ unopened as well as a Marriage order of service booklet and a 20% off voucher of middle ward shop in Windsor castle.Don’t miss out on this limited once in a life time opportunity to have a piece of royal history.”But many saw the monetary value in flogging off the bag, selling it online.So what does the bag actually contain? - Bottle of Windsor Castle Still Spring Water 500mL- Harry and Meghan Traditiaionl Handbag Shortbread Biscuits- Royal Wedding 2018 Belgian Milk Chocolate Coin 90g- Royal Wedding Commemorative Magnet- Voucher for royalcollectionshopAnother online listing has reached £420 while another hit £411.One of of the listings, the seller declared proudly: “At the wedding today I received this wonderful gift bag for guests.”And the post promised: “I forgot to mention all money raised will go to charity.”Another seller has even been trying to flog PDFs of the Royal Wedding order of service - for £5 each.As the non-VIP guests departed on Saturday the wedding reception turned into an ­outrageous party with a very royal dance-off and “beer pong” games. The Sun can reveal that chat-show superstar James Corden — who was compering the event — instigated an extraordinary dance routine which featured Prince Charles, Prince William and Harry.The royal couple chose I Wanna Dance With Somebody as their first dance at the fun-filled, early-hours wedding bash.Harry, 33, and Meghan, 36 — now the Duke and ­Duchess of Sussex — let their hair down to the hit by Whitney Houston at Frogmore House, Windsor, where telly’s Corden hosted dinner and fireworks for 200 guests.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This song is set in Albert Square, where you’re standing.It’s about the first morning of new love. Love’s something that our city’s famous for. Go on Manchester!While Mani from The Stone Roses said: One voice Manchester. Sing it up.My heart is always going to be in Manchester, always has been and always will be. I am proud to be a Mancunian. I am sure it will be an emotional occasion.Shaun Ryder, of the Happy Mondays, said: I am thinking of you. In fact I know I love you all big time massive. I am going to send 0161 love and peace vibes to the world.There was also a performance of Tony Walsh’s poem This is the Place, which became closely linked to the tragedy by his rendition of it at the vigil in its aftermath.The Manchester Lesbian and Gay Chorus performed a medley of some anthems by Manchester-based acts, opening with New Order’s Blue Monday and moving onto Wonderwall by Oasis.The Parrs Wood High Schools Harmony Group, which viral last year when it played at the One Love Benefit Gig, also performed with Symphony by Clean Bandit.The Bishop of Manchester David Walker told the audience: We are a city of music so it is appropriate that we come together to let our music come to the forefront of who we are.Doing things together makes us stronger and makes us Manchester.At 10.31pm, bells will ring out from buildings across the city centre to mark the moment when the attack took place 12 months ago.Prince William and Theresa May earlier joined mourners at a service in Manchester Cathedral to pay tribute to those affected by the terror attack on May 22, 2017.William left the cathedral at 4.40pm following his private meeting with some of the bereaved families.He also left a message on a Tree of Hope which read: To all those affected you will never be forgotten.And to the people of Manchester my admiration for your display of strength, decency and community in the face of this unparalleled tragedy. William.Mrs May left shortly afterwards.In her message she wrote: Today we hold in our hearts the memory of those who were lost on the 22nd May 2017, their families, friends and those whose lives were irrevocably changed.May the kindness and fortitude we witnessed that night triumph and the great spirit of Manchester never be vanquished.Tears were shed ahead of a minute silence held across the country for the victims, which included a six-year-old girl and an off-duty police officer, an aunt who shielded her 11-year-old niece from the bomb.Families of the victims, the injured and the first responders to the scene are also at an invitation-only service today in Manchester Cathedral.There were emotional scenes in Cathedral Gardens, where the service is being broadcast, as people wept and hugged each other.Manchester has rallied together to mark the first anniversary of the terror attack.A choir performed in St Anns Square this morning, while hearts have been left in Exchange Square.Others have been hanging messages of support on the Tree of Hope set up in the city centre.Stones decorated with bees, which became the symbol of Manchester in the wake of the devastating blast, have also appeared across the city today.The invitation-only service was laos attended by Jeremy Corbyn, Andy Burnham and the Lord Mayor of Manchester June Hitchen.It included a reading by Prince William from the book of Corinthians.He said: For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then we will see face to face.“Now I know only in part then I will know fully, even as I have been fully known.“And now faith, hope, and love abide, these three and the greatest of these is love.”The choir sang the National Anthem and Somewhere Over The Rainbow, which Ariana Grande sang at the One Love Manchester concert in the wake of the atrocity.The Bishop of Manchester the Rt Rev David Walker gave a lengthy address, saying: Here in this building is where Manchester remembers a specific moment in its history.This place, so close to the spot where lives were lost and so many changes forever. By gathering today we have it for all the tomes to come. Manchester is here.The hour-long service was rounded off with a final message from the Archbishop of York, Dr John Sentamu, who said: “Go forth into the world in peace.”The events came after Ariana sent her fans “love and light” a year after ISIS terrorist Salman Abedi slaughtered 22 people and injured 800 more at her concert.The warped bomber detonated a homemade explosive device made of shrapnel, nuts and bolts in the arena foyer as young fans left the concert.Ariana, 24, who returned to Manchester the month after the attack to hold a tribute concert, wrote on Twitter today: “Thinking of you all today and every day 🐝 I love you with all of me and am sending you all of the light and warmth I have to offer on this challenging day.”The atrocity also claimed the lives of several parents who were waiting in the foyer of the venue.Manchester-born attacker Abedi, 22, had targeted the arena after travelling to Syria for ISIS training.He later visited terrorist hotbeds in Germany where he liaised with fellow jihadis.Hours after the bombing ISIS celebrated the “successful and surprising” attack and claimed it was revenge for Mosul airstrikes.But, speaking today Theresa May will say that Abedi’s “sickening” blast failed to “break our resolve and divide us”. She will add: “Such appalling acts of wickedness will do nothing but strengthen our resolve to defeat such twisted ideology.“The resilience and determination shown by Manchester in the 12 months since is testament to that.”The comments will come in a piece in the Manchester Evening News as the PM attends a memorial service in the city."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/15888359obj-js4095873.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"doctor baby decapitated trying too hard","story":"Dr Vaishnavy Laxman, 43, who had been nearing the end of a 24-hour shift on a maternity unit, should have given the 30-year old patient an emergency Caesarean section as the premature infant was in a breech position.But she instead attempted to carry out the delivery naturally urging the patient to push while pulling on the baby’s feet.The manoeuvre caused the infants legs, arms and torso to become detached leaving the head still in his mothers womb.At the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester, consultant Laxman wept as she relived the bungled procedure and said the youngster would have died had a C-section been carried out.She said: I was trying to deliver a live baby, I was trying really hard, possibly too hard.“I did not intend to harm mum or the baby. I am distraught at the outcome and I am very sorry it did not come out the way I meant it.”The tragedy occurred on March 16, 2014 whilst Laxman was working at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee.She told the tribunal: “The plan was for the baby to be delivered by a Caesarian section.I thought with a C-section we might not have a live baby and it would have been a difficult procedure.Dr Laxman urged the mother to attempt a natural birth rather than having a C-section“I still believe we had a very good chance of having the baby using other options than a C-section but we had to act fast.The bottom of the baby came out quite easily and when this happened I thought it was going to be possible.“I started to encourage the patient to push. Whilst she was pushing I applied some traction to the baby’s feet so I could deliver the baby. She was doing well.“After that there was some difficulty in delivering the arms.The arms were then delivered and I went to deliver the baby’s head, I was trying to flex the baby’s head but I didn’t feel the baby move and the cervix started to close. I tried to deliver a couple of times and asked for help.”Laxman said she to tried to cut the cervix but the incision had no impact.She added: “We made another cut to the cervix and I used my index finger to flex the baby’s head.But, at some point between the general anaesthetic and the decapitation, the baby died - I’m not sure when.”I was told the neck was tearing and that’s when I knew the baby had died.The hearing continues."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000405543210.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"jeremy corbyn is alienating both sides of brexit debate and should start backing second referendum tony blair says","story":"The ex-PM claimed the current Labour boss is a closet Eurosceptic who is refusing to take a strong stance on Brexit.And ultra-Europhile Mr Blair said Mr Corbyn should throw his weight behind a second EU referendum.He claimed Labour’s vow to leave the single market but stay in the customs union would create “the worst of both worlds”.Mr Blair added: “If the reason for being against the single market is we don’t want to be merely rule takers, then the customs union solution has the same objections.”He said Labour’s support for a customs union is an “unacceptable compromise” for Leave voters.But at the same time pro-EU voters were also “losing faith in Labour as a route to avoid Brexit”, Mr Blair insisted.Speaking on BBC Radio 4s Today programme this morning, he said: That ambiguity probably did serve Labour well at the last election... I dont think it works any more today.Were in a position now of not pleasing the Remainers or the Leavers.Mr Blair concluded: I think the sensible thing for the Labour party to do is to say, if we want a jobs-first Brexit the sensible thing to do is to stay close to Europes economic area.If people then say, Whats the point of leaving?, you say the final decision should be taken by the British people on whether to proceed on this basis.In the same interview, the former PM insisted he had no idea that a Libyan dissident had been sent from Britain to his home country when he was in power.Mr Blair said he acknowledged Theresa Mays decision to make a formal apology to Abdul Hakim Belhaj and his wife Fatima Boudchar.He added: I have gone along with what the Governments done, which is issue the apology, I didnt actually know myself about this case until after I left office.The couple were sent to a prison run by the forces of Libyan dictator Muammar al-Gaddafi."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict0004081846481-e1527003437942.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"this modest semi detached home in middlesbrough is hiding an incredible secret","story":"Chris Scott, 40, decided to investigate what was underneath what he believed was just a drain cover in his back garden.He found a flooded cavity below - and spent two days draining it.When it had dried out, Chris was intrigued to find it consisted of two rooms with solid concrete walls and two escape hatches.It is thought the secret hideout in Middlesbrough was a World War 2 bunker used to accommodate the 100 people living on the street.His semi-detached home was undergoing a makeover at the time, and it was builder Tony Sizer who persuaded Chris to investigate the cross hatch which is situated 20ft from the back door.Chris said: “It just looked like a drain cover. The neighbours had mentioned a bunker but I hadn’t thought anymore about it.“I was talking to the builder about it while we were having a cup of tea in the garden and he said, ‘Come on let’s have a look’.”The first cavity, which had a metal ladder about 8ft to 10ft in length attached, was full of water so they spent two days pumping it out.At the bottom of the ladder was a wooden door which was open and led to the two rooms.The first measures four metres by three metres and the second is five metres by three metres.At the end of that room, the pair found another door. Tony dug out the rubble behind the door and discovered another ladder.Chris added: “It’s an emergency escape ladder in case the first one was destroyed or blocked by rubble from a bomb.“It’s not worth fully digging it out as it’s a small area.”Chris said neighbours had mentioned the possibility of a bunker in the back garden.He said: “I’ll be asking them more about it. We were really shocked by the size of it.“There are a lot of electrics and switches down there and lights on the wall. A big table and lots of silt that could contain anything from back then.”Chris, a managing director who lives with his wife Tony and their three-week-old daughter Nola, is currently living in an apartment while the house undergoes extensive renovations."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000407501523.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"the queen is a feminist too meghan but she didnt feel the need to label herself as such","story":"No idea how Princess Anne reacted when she heard that ground-breaking news, but one likes to imagine that her eyes rolled so far back in their sockets that they had to be surgically recovered.For unlike America, where virtue-signalling is practically an art form, over here it is still largely frowned upon as a wholly transparent and vulgar flaunting of, as you see it, your own moral superiority.Princess Anne is a feminist. So is Her Majesty the Queen. They haven’t felt the need to label themselves as such we know from their actions.As the basic scriptwriting rule dictates, show don’t tell.To her credit, Meghan Markle championed many charitable causes that advocate female empowerment before she met Prince Harry, and no one is suggesting she shouldn’t continue with this work.But what grates about the above statement is the unsaid inference that here is a feisty, independent woman who, unshackled by pomp, ceremony and dutiful political impartiality, is going to drag the stuffy, deluded old monarchy kicking and screaming into the 21st century.That this go-get-’em gal from the US of A is going to shake things up with a few bumper-sticker sentiments and teach those Brits a thing or two about how the world works.Or perhaps we should leave it to Patrick Jephson, former private secretary to Princess Diana, a man very much in the know on the inner workings of the House of Windsor.In his book, The Meghan Factor, he says: “The one key skill Meghan absolutely must perfect is how to avoid being seen as any kind of a destabilising force. It’s a useful guideline when weighing the pros and cons of any intended course of action, from saving a local playgroup, to saving an endangered species, to saving the planet. What always comes first is saving the monarchy.”Quite. In other words, don’t get up the collective nose of the British public or they might just, ahem, pick it and flick you off into oblivion.As we saw on Saturday, as Bishop Michael Curry’s address entered what felt like its third decade, The Queen’s resolutely impassive expression suggests she’d make a fine poker player.We have no idea what she thought of it, nor Donald Trump, Brexit or the highly political Me Too campaign. She has opinions, of course. But what she doesn’t do is wear them like a badge.Just like her great-great-grandmother Victoria, who advocated “never complain, never explain”, The Queen knows the future of the monarchy lies in being a non-political figurehead who promotes national unity.Jephson adds: “If you acquire a profile, a purpose and a passionate public devotion independent of the royal mainstream, then you risk being perceived and presented as a threat to the Crown itself.”We already know what Meghan thinks about an awful lot of things, because her life so far can’t be edited.We also know that her soapbox has just got bigger thanks to her new status which, to those unused to it, could foster the corrosive misconception that everyone is hanging off your every word.Read my pursed lips: They’re not. They’re just being polite.So Meghan must learn fast that she’s a very minor cog in an ancient royal machine that has survived so long by saying nothing and doing its duty to its loyal subjects.Frustrating that may be for a “feminist” (or, indeed a manist), but that’s the trade-off for the largely taxpayer-funded life of luxury that is granted, not self-generated.As a celebrity, you can say what you like and we can choose to listen or not. But opinions divide people and, as a royal, you are supposed to represent everyone.Meghan needs to understand, and implement, that distinction sooner rather than later.HUMAN rights lawyer Amal Clooney was officially crowned “best-dressed guest” by fashionistas observing the Royal Wedding.According to one, she was “a sublime vision in marigold”, though personally speaking, Colman’s Mustard yellow might be more accurate.Either way, Ms Clooney once again proved adept at pulling focus from the other mere mortals floundering in her ever-stylish slipstream.By contrast, the Duchess of Cambridge’s understated, Alexander McQueen frock coat got a sniffier reception from certain fashion quarters, not least because she’s worn it three times before.They’re missing the point.A wedding is about the bride, not the guests.And Kate understood that perfectly by wearing something that wouldn’t propel her into the limelight on Meghan’s big day.Now that’s style.THOSE attending Chelsea Flower Show (no, me neither) have declared that “she-sheds” are the latest must-have – kitted out with radiators, chandeliers and squishy sofas.Alternatively, we could have all that inside the house and just send the other half out into the garden.AN Islamic school in Birmingham has warned female pupils against using tampons.The guidance, adopted as school policy, states: “Among the types of pads, tampons may not be appropriate due to insertion.”But the head of the school insists it has “no connection to faith”.Hmmmm. Meanwhile, it has emerged that women are having “virginity restoring” operations on the NHS at a cost of £1,000 a time.The 30-minute procedure involves the hymen – which can break after using tampons, doing sport or having sex for the first time – being stitched or reconstructed.One relationship counsellor suggested that one of the reasons was that some religious women were “over- whelmed” by feelings of sexual guilt and wanted to be “as pure as possible again” for their husband.Want to? Or are forced to by religiously driven, moral expectations not placed on the man they’re marrying?Either way, is this really something the NHS should be funding when money for other, more vital, operations is so scarce?MEMO to Sir Anthony Hopkins: Yes, families do fall out and just because you’re related doesn’t mean you have to like each other.But saying you “don’t care one way or the other” whether your 48-year-old daughter Abigail has children or not seems overly cold and perhaps partly explains your 20-year estrangement.In future, a simple, “We don’t speak and I’d rather not go in to it”, might be wiser.HOW come, in this age of state-of-the-art camera phones, when anyone spots the Loch Ness monster, beast of Bodmin Moor or any of the other fearsome creatures supposedly roaming our shores, the evidential photo is always out of focus?Exhibit A: The “lion” spotted in Oldbury in the West Midlands this week.Yep.

More than 40 volunteers run and operate the railway and without them it can’t run.“The track issue is a diversion. We have had good weather lately and we have probably lost several thousands of pounds in income and disappointed lots of kids.”Friends of Poole Park, which won the contract to operate the railway last year, has posted a plea for new volunteers on Facebook.

He had definitely had a procedure done – he wasn’t feeling very well. He seemed like he was in a bit of pain. Heart surgery obviously isn’t something minor.“He definitely wanted to lay low. He was given his space and he did not come out of the guesthouse.It was an apartment with a full kitchen so he could cook. He didn’t have any visitors – it was a bit sad that he was all by himself.“He checked out on Monday and said he was feeling better and well rested. It is good to see him back on his feet again.”He emerged from the guesthouse, in a gated compound three miles south of Antonio Del Mar, on Monday afternoon, after telling the landlady that his daughter looked “beautiful” at the wedding.Despite recovering from heart surgery, Thomas Sr was picked up by a pal, single mum Lori Davis, 38, and driven to a Starbucks, where he was seen holding a creamy Frappuccino with whipped crème.The Emmy Award-winning lighting expert was then taken back to his scruffy cliff-top home – carrying a bag marked ‘personal belongings’. It was one week since he had been seen at the property – following the heart drama which eventually saw him ruled out of attending the royal wedding on health grounds.He had told TMZ on Monday last week that he suffered a heart attack six days previous and was not going to go to the royal wedding. Twenty-four hours later he informed the website that he had checked into hospital.The father-of-three underwent surgery on Wednesday – later revealing that three stents had been inserted into his blood vessels. He then told TMZ that he had crossed over the border, 45 minutes from his Mexican home, and was recovering in California, where he watched Meghan get hitched from the bedroom of a ‘safe house’.Thomas Sr, who watched as Prince Charles gave Meghan, 36, away, told the website it was “emotional a joyful”, adding: “My baby looks beautiful and she looks very happy. I wish I were there and I wish them all my love and all happiness.“The service was beautiful and its history. I will always regret not being able to be there and not being able to hold my daughters hand. My baby girl is a duchess and I love her so much.“When you watch your child get married, every thought goes through your mind, every memory from the first day she was born, the first time I held her.”The Sun told on Monday how Meghan and Harry – who had spoken to Thomas Sr during an emotional phone call on Thursday – were discussing plans to visit him.They are thought to be leaving on their honeymoon this week, following Saturday’s glitzy wedding at Windsor Castle – attended by David Beckham, Oprah, Tom Hardy and George Clooney.

So the inescapable conclusion is that Mr Livingstone has jumped before he was pushed. After left-wing activist Marc Wadsworth was expelled for bringing the party intro disrepute for comments towards the Labour MP Ruth Smeeth a few weeks ago, the disciplinary panel would probably had found against \"Red Ken\" too.Critics of Mr Corbyn claimed earlier this year that he had hounded out Labour\u0027s former general secretary Iain McNicol, awarded a peerage on the eve of the Royal Wedding last week, and that his replacement, former Unite official Jennie Formby, was a stooge.As a result, his one-year suspension was extended by another year.It was then that the Labour MP John Mann confronted the former London mayor in front of reporters in Westminster, accusing him of being a \"Nazi apologist\".Mr Mann, who chairs parliament\u0027s All-Party Parliamentary Group Against Antisemitism, chased Mr Livingstone up the stairs at the Westminster offices of Sky News, shouting and calling him a \"f****** disgrace\", which resulted in extraordinary TV pictures showing the clash.This year, the anti-Semitism row in the Labour Party has become more damaging.An unprecedented demonstration by Jewish organisations, supported by dozens of Labour MPs, filled Parliament Square and there was evidence that the row robbed Labour of taking control of Barnet Council in the elections on 3 May.After the Parliament Square demonstration, the leaders of the same organisations held a meeting with Mr Corbyn in Westminster, but immediately dismissed the talks as a missed opportunity.The first demand of these Jewish groups - and the so-called \"moderate\" Labour MPs who joined them in Parliament Square in March - was the expulsion of Mr Livingstone from the party.Some of Mr Livingstone\u0027s strongest critics are disappointed that he was not put through the formal disciplinary procedure and expelled, claiming that would have made his return to the party impossible, while resignation leaves the door slightly ajar.In his resignation statement, Mr Livingstone said he recognised he had caused offence and upset in the Jewish community. \"I am truly sorry for that,\" he said.But he said he does not accept the allegation that he has brought the Labour Party into disrepute, nor guilty of anti-Semitism. That suggests he is unrepentant and remains defiant. Mr Livingstone has, of course, quit the Labour Party before, when he stood as candidate for London mayor as an independent after he was denied the Labour nomination by a plot by Tony Blair to install Frank Dobson instead."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/skynews-theresa-may-jeremy-corbyn_4311636.jpg?20180516121026 ","title":"north korea path to peace is paved with photo ops","story":"And we\u0027re wondering: How much importance should we attach to the closing of the Punggye-ri test site? And to the fact that we\u0027ve been allowed to watch it?First, it\u0027s worth noting how unique Punggye-ri is. It is the only active nuclear weapons test site in the world. It\u0027s where the North Korean regime has detonated six nuclear devices, the most recent, in September, a massive hydrogen bomb. To let foreign reporters in to see a place like that is extraordinary. But this is where the objections mount. Kim Jong Un is welcoming reporters, not weapons inspectors, who might be able to more comprehensively verify the regime\u0027s claims. And even us journalists have had our dosimeters confiscated so we can\u0027t independently confirm how much radiation (if any) is leaking out of the site. Then there\u0027s the site itself. Some reports have suggested that it\u0027s now unusable thanks to a tunnel collapse, triggered by detonation after detonation. Six nuclear blasts is a lot even for a mountain to endure.And the final argument - Mr Kim has already proved, to his and the world\u0027s satisfaction, that he has a nuclear weapon of terrifying power. He simply doesn\u0027t need to do any more tests, so shutting down Punngye-ri doesn\u0027t mean all that much. Those points are good ones, although you can deal with them one by one.In reverse order: The last test might have been impressive but the North\u0027s nuclear programme is far from complete - not least in demonstrating the ability to fit a warhead to a missile that successfully reaches its targets.Second, even if Punggye-ri is out of action, there are plenty of mountains in North Korea. It would be easy enough for a totalitarian dictatorship to build another test facility.Third, if Kim is promising not to conduct any more nuclear tests - well, you don\u0027t need weapons inspectors to check that. They show up as glaring seismic events continents away. The decommissioning of Punggye-ri is therefore total symbolism. That\u0027s why camera crews are here, not weapons inspectors. But that symbolism is hugely important.Kim has pledged no more tests - an easily verifiable claim. If he reneges on that, he makes a very public, deliberate choice - the opposite of hiding a weapons program in secret.More importantly, the path to peace is paved with photo ops. The rapid turnaround in the situation on the Korean peninsula has been captured in three moments full of imagery and symbolism.The North Korean delegation to the Winter Olympics the meeting of Kim Jong Un and Moon Jae-in in the demilitarised zone between their two countries, still technically at war the handover of three American political prisoners to the US, shown off by a deliriously happy Donald Trump at Joint Base Andrews in Washington. All photo opportunities.But photo ops that have pushed things closer to peace, stunts that have built momentum when the difficulty of complex geopolitical negotiations have slowed it."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/skynews-racing-hayley-moore_4317732.jpg?20180523103245 ","title":"what we know about north koreas secretive punggye ri nuclear site","story":"In April, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un announced his country would suspend nuclear and missile tests, as well as closing Punggye-ri.But some scientists have said that the site may have been rendered useless months ago anyway.In October, a Japanese news outlet reported that a tunnel being built at the site had collapsed and as many as 200 workers were dead.And in December, two aftershocks were detected, raising concerns about the stability of the mountain."},{"url":null,"title":"labour suspends man who applied","story":"NewsLabour suspends man who applied to be a women\u0027s officer because he \u0027identifies as female on Wednesdays\u0027David Lewis sparked anger when he took the provocative move in a stand over Labour\u0027s \u0027self-identification\u0027 policy for transgender women\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByDan BloomPolitical reporter08:37, 23 MAY 2018NewsDavid Lewis sparked anger with his stand over Labour\u0027s \u0027self-identification\u0027 policy for transgender women\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLabour has suspended an activist who applied to be a women\u0027s officer because he identifies as a woman on Wednesdays. David Lewis sparked anger when he took the provocative move in a stand over Labour\u0027s \u0027self-identification\u0027 policy for transgender women. The policy says anyone who defines themselves as female can stand for women\u0027s roles in a bid to reduce transphobic discrimination.  But although backed by Jeremy Corbyn, it has sparked a row between trans activists and some who claim it undermines other women\u0027s rights.  Mr Lewis, 45, said he thought his application to the Basingstoke Labour party would be rejected - but to his surprise it was accepted.   He told The Spectator: My womanness is expressed by my saying ‘I self identify as a woman’ now and again on Wednesdays.  I make no changes in my behaviour or my appearance. I keep my name, David and my male pronouns. I wear the same sort of clothes I wear the rest of the week. I keep my beard. I enjoy the full womanness of my beard. He added: My priority here is to inform the [constituency party], and maybe some other people, about what this policy means. About what happens when you say that someone’s gender depends only on what they say and nothing else. We need to be able to debate this, we need to be able to talk about this without being told we are transphobic and to shut up. Mr Lewis\u0027s stance provoked a furious debate online.   While some backed him, Labour activist Duncan Hothersall branded him a smug bloke gurning into the camera, adding: Meanwhile actual trans people are just asking to be treated fairly by society. How about we don\u0027t congratulate the d***heads, for once? Lily Madigan, the first Labour trans women\u0027s officer, said: Labour has been very clear - people abusing trans inclusive policy will be removed from the party. Goodbye transphobe.

A record 7,493 British people gained German citizenship in 2017 - 12 times the figure of 622 in 2015, and a 162% rise on the 2,865 in 2016. A spokesman for Germany\u0027s Federal Statistics Office told Reuters: A link to Brexit is obvious. The total for the two years, around 10,400, is more than double the number of Britons who became Germans in the 15 years from 2000. German officials said Britons were the second biggest group to be granted German citizenship last year, after nearly 15,000 Turks. British people usually need to have lived in Germany for eight years to qualify for citizenship.  Applications take more than six months to process and Britons can take up dual citizenship while the UK is still an EU member. Overall the number of people becoming German rose by 1.7% last year to 112,200, the highest level since 2013. There is still uncertainty over what rights British people will have to live and work in the EU after Brexit. Britain and Brussels have agreed EU nationals can continue arriving in the UK, and vice versa, until December 2020. After that, Brexit Secretary David Davis has hinted EU citizens could carry on being given preferential treatment to live and work in the UK. That suggests British citizens could also be offered a preferential deal. But there are big question marks over whether UK citizens heading abroad will retain rights to move around the EU, or be stuck in the country where they\u0027ve settled. And UK negotiators have repeatedly stressed that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.

And now, for the Duchess of Sussex, the serious work begins.  She and Prince Harry were already back on royal duties yesterday at a Buckingham Palace garden party celebrating Prince Charles’ 70th birthday .  But she has made it clear that her role in “the Firm” will be to do more than wear stylish dresses or just be arm candy for her husband.  Shortly after the wedding, her official biography on the Buckingham Palace website was out and in it she boldly announced she is “proud to be a woman and a feminist”. It was a signal she will be using her huge platform to support causes that help the advancement of women. Insiders say she has the blessing of the palace to do so.  It didn’t take long for the haters to pile in at the mention of the word feminist and I must admit that I initially groaned at the thought.  Of course I believe in equality of men and women which, by definition, makes me a feminist. But I’ve always felt excluded from feminism and feminist debates because they’re always dominated by one voice – well-off middle-class women. Instead of being inclusive, it is exclusive and rarely addresses the views and needs of ethnic minority or working-class women. It seems those who benefit most are usually already well paid and well connected. I’ve been to networking events about gender equality in business or the media and I can usually count the number of non-white women on one hand. During panel discussions I never hear anyone talking about tackling the lack of social or racial diversity. Instead it’s a certain group of women fighting for women like themselves. Women of colour have fought against sexism and racism, but their voice is rarely heard. I believe Meghan can change that. Yes she’s well-off and privileged, but her background, and the fact she was raised by a black woman, gives her a different perspective.  As her bio says, she’s had a keen awareness of social issues from an early age, instilled by her wonderful mother Doria Ragland . “Those early experiences helped shape her lifelong commitment to causes such as social justice and women’s empowerment,” it says.

Friends and family of Emmanuel Elliott, 81, and partner Hilda Farmer, 79, have spent days trawling the streets around Cheltenham General Hospital without any luck.  But they don’t believe it has been stolen because Hilda has yet to find the “well heeled” Cheltenham road where she left her silver Ford Fiesta, reports GloucestershireLive .  Now they are asking others to try and locate the car which they believe will be a topic of conversation in the street where it is parked.  “If it was Gloucester I’d know exactly where it was,” said retired nurse Hilda who was driving her partner of ten years to hospital when she became lost in the spa town which is currently gripped by road works. “I’m a Gloucester girl so Cheltenham is like a foreign land to me. If I have to go there, I normally go on the bus. “I feel really stupid about the whole thing and we are really missing our car so I hope we can find it.” Hilda actually paid for a parking space at the hospital before learning the car park was full so dropped retired company director Emmanuel at the door for his appointment with a consultant.  She believes she had to travel a mile or two on busy roads to find a space where she could leave the vehicle on the street at around 2.30pm on Friday. She cannot remember the name but recalls it was on “a street with really nice houses on one side and some kind of greenery on the other.” “The houses had drives with cars parked on them so I was the only one in the spaces across the road and they were alongside a green space, maybe a park or a field,” she said. “As soon as I saw it I thought ‘Oh goodie, I’ve got somewhere to park’. “I think I must have asked four or five local people to point me in the direction of the hospital and they all told me it was down this road, so maybe somebody remembers talking to me. It took Hilda about half an hour to find her way back to the hospital and meet with Mr Elliott. “When he’d finished I went looking for the car but could not find it,” she explained. “I think he thought I’d run off to Spain because I didn’t come back for ages. I couldn’t even call him because my mobile was in the car.” "},{"url":null,"title":"grenfell families flee tears shocking","story":"NewsGrenfell families flee in tears as shocking footage shown without warning during public inquiryVideo showing a victim pleading for help from the 23rd floor and shots of the high-rise fully ablaze proved too much for many of those in attendance\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByMatthew Young23:40, 22 MAY 2018NewsGrenfell families had to leave the room after being shown harrowing footage without prior warning (Image: Adam Gerrard/Daily Mirror)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTraumatised Grenfell Tower survivors fled the public inquiry in tears yesterday after harrowing footage of the inferno was played without warning. Video showing a victim pleading for help from the 23rd floor and shots of the high-rise fully ablaze proved too much for many in the room. Around 20 people walked out and at least one woman had to be treated by paramedics after collapsing in the area outside the hearing room. Bernard Richmond QC had promised at the start of both days of the inquiry there would be a warning ahead of any disturbing footage.  But he forgot, saying changes in the schedule made him misplace notes to remind him. Apologising after a break, Mr Richmond said: “This has been a very busy day. We’ve had a number of technical difficulties to sort out. I said at the start there would be distressing images. I have a system to make sure there are warnings. “Sadly, because of things being moved around, my notes got moved. I should have mentioned again there were images in this room. And for that I’m truly sorry.”  The footage was in a film played as part of tributes to the Choucair family, who lost six members and three generations in last June’s blaze. In heartbreaking testimony, the hearing was told how Zaynab Choucair, three, died alongside sisters Fatima, 11, and Mierna, 13, and mother Nadia, father Bassem and grandmother Sirria.  Nadia and Bassem lived on floor 22, with Sirria next door. Nadia’s sister Sawson and brother Hasim described the horror of losing half of their family in one night. Hasim said he ran to the building with his children after getting a phone call about the fire. He said: “I found the building completely engulfed in flames. We had to stand there for hours, helpless, watching them all burn to death.  “It was five months before we were able to bury them. We took them to a village [in Lebanon] where my family are from. “It was my mother’s wish to be buried next to my father.” Hasim added that he feels part of him has been taken away and described getting flashbacks whenever he looked at the tower. “This inferno has split up families and smashed up their lives,” he said.

David Capes says numerous pets in his neighbours home along with hoards of waste has attracted vermin to the area, forcing residents to stay inside to escape the stench and to avoid the flies. Nine months after his neighbour\u0027s death, Mr Capes says East Riding Council have still not completely cleared the home and got rid of the rats which have caused so many problems.  “It’s been a living hell and is just beyond a joke now, said Mr Capes, who claims at one point, as many as 100 cats and three dogs also lived in the property along with the owner, reports Hull Live .  “The problems caused by the smells, flies and rats from the neighbour’s house, which my garden is backed on to, means that we can’t fully enjoy our property or really go outside.  “It also puts people off coming round and the smell is really embarrassing when I have visitors – the rats burrowing through the neighbour\u0027s fence in to my garden also means that we need to keep a real close eye on my four year old grandson when he comes round. “I balk at the smells and have seen that the garden there is covered in cat mire, which is what is causing it. “I’m so angry and at the end of my tether – I just don’t know what I can do anymore. Mr Capes says the issues have driven other neighbours out of the street over the years, including Mr Higgins, 66, who also lived in the road between 2015 and 2017. “We felt like prisoners in our own home, he said. Due to the smell and flies we couldn’t open any of our windows or sit outside.  “We spent around \u0026pound30,000 fixing up the property when we moved in, but couldn’t really enjoy it due to the filthy conditions next door. “We were forever on to the council to put in an order to get the house cleaned up. “Eventually we had to move out as nothing was done and we really struggled to sell due to the issues.” A East Riding Council spokesman said the former occupant was handed an order to clear up the home in July 2017, and when they died solicitors had the property cleared up. Mr Capes claims it took four days and eight skips for the Skirlaugh home to be cleaned out after the resident died last summer. He said cleaners had to wear masks and suits to protect themselves before entering the property, and bombs had to be let off to try and clear the vermin.  But Mr Capes is still complaining of offensive odours and vermin running out of the neighbour’s garden and in to his. He said: We are still fighting for the enforcement order to be fully achieved, even though it was put in place last year. I’ve been told by the council that they will decide whether or not the clearing that happens fits with the order, but I think it should be up to me to decide that, as I’m the one living here. Mr Capes said he has been rushed to hospital with chest pains as a result of the stress of his ordeal. He said: “Last week I was rushed in to hospital with chest pains due to the stress of it all. It’s absolutely out of order how my wife and I have been treated.

HR manager Claire Oliver, 31, was invited to watch the wedding inside the grounds of Windsor Castle after being hailed a \u0027community champion\u0027 thanks to her work with Troup Bywaters - an engineering group involved in offering apprenticeships to get more young people in work - a cause close to Harry\u0027s heart. Claire, from Cambridge, bagged herself one of the cream and blue bags filled with treats, including shortbread, a chocolate coin, a bottle of water and a 20% discount voucher for the Windsor Castle gift shop. While some guests will no doubt be holding on to their gifts as a token of the momentous day, others, like Claire, have offered theirs up on eBay. Claire tweeted on the big day: \u0027I got to watch the royal wedding right outside Windsor Castle in this amazing setting. Such an amazing day #Golden ticket #Royal connections while also filming herself twirling with joy in the grounds.  But hours after she watched Meghan and Harry tie the knot, Claire uploaded images of her goody bag contents to eBay, prompting a bidding war between royal fans, reports the MailOnline . Within three days, the bag of fairly humble treats had been sold to the highest bidder for an eye-watering \u0026pound21,400. The MailOnline said Claire did not wish to discuss the sale and that she was among 25 others who sold their goody bags online. Other goody bags are being sold for thousands of pounds, along with an empty KFC Royal Wedding bucket which is going for an astonishing \u0026pound800. Claire was among 1,200 non-VIP guests who were invited to watch the wedding in the grounds of Windsor Castle.  They had been chosen for their dedication to community work and as representatives from charities close to Harry and Meghan\u0027s heart. Some who opted to sell their bags had clearly planned on making a quick profit from their gift, photographing them at Windsor Castle on the day as from of its authenticity. While non-VIP guests received a tote bag and some sweet treats, those at the couple\u0027s after party were treated to some incredible food and cocktails. The evening do is thought to have had more in common with a West End club night than a traditional wedding breakfast with a \u0027carnival atmosphere\u0027 being reported in the 230-year-old Frogmore House.

The day\u0027s official photographer Alexi Lubomirski has spoken about the touching image and how he quickly asked the bride and groom to perch on the steps for some quick candid shots. The fashion photographer, who was also invited as a VIP guest to the big day, said: After the set up shots we went to the reception and I said if the couple had any energy after that, we were going to go into the Rose Garden and take some intimate quick shots.  We went out there and had about three and a half minutes to take some quick shots because everything was running like clockwork. Then I said \u0027OK, you can go back to your thing now, but listen just before you go in sit down on these stairs\u0027. She just slumped in between his legs and there was this moment they were just laughing because of how exhausted they were and that finally it was all over. Lubomirski went on to explain how he tackled the natural set up shots inside Windsor Castle. He added in an interview with the BBC: I didn\u0027t want it to feel like a sports team photo or an army photo, regimented and linear.  So he talked about how we could break it and get some rhythm and asymmetry into it and it all came down to very little tiny things - nothing crazy. In terms of how were were placing people - we wanted some people sitting, some people standing, kids on parents laps and that was a huge thing to get that realness out of it.

Dowdy stores, drab clothes and fashion flops have seen shoppers shun the chain. It was late to launch online and has been playing catch-up ever since.

The very real danger is that, once M\u0026ampS goes, it sends shockwaves through the wider area and leads to even more store closures.  Many were already reeling from the collapse of BHS. New Look, Mothercare, House of Fraser and many more are either closing stores or threatening to do so.

Whitney Martin, 18, believed she simply had a cold when she became bed-ridden with flu-like symptoms three weeks ago. Her condition, however, worsened and on May 4 she was rushed to Princess Royal Hospital in Telford, Shrops, after her illness began attacking her vital organs. Just 24 hours later, she was placed in intensive care at a Manchester hospital after suffering heart failure and \u0027technically dying twice\u0027 on the operating table.  Whitney has since been left in an induced coma, relying on two life support machines and has been diagnosed with sepsis and myocardiopathy - a disorder of the heart muscle. Her mum Suzanne, 38, has been forced to quit her job as a support worker in order to care for her daughter who is receiving around-the-clock hospital care. The mother-of-two, who is now living in a bungalow for transplant patients on the hospital site to be close to her daughter, said: It all started about three weeks ago when she had a cold. It was usual flu-like conditions such as tiredness and being hot and cold and we thought she was just being a bit of a drama queen.  She was a fit and healthy girl and we never expected what was to come next as she was such an outgoing girl. On the Friday, her blood pressure was too low and her temperature was sky high and I took one look at her and knew I had to get her to a hospital. She had been due to start a job as a waitress at one of our local pubs the next day. Within 24 hours her condition completely deteriorated and they wanted to transfer her to Birmingham by air ambulance for specialist care because they thought she was going to die. The didn\u0027t have any beds so she went by land ambulance to Manchester. She went straight into intensive care as she suffered heart failure. Her heart stopped twice, she technically died twice on the operating table and she only had a 50/50 chance of survival.  Whitney was placed in a BiVAD machine, an implantable pump designed to help the heart function better when both sides of the organ are failing.  She was also hooked up to an ECMO machine, which uses an artificial lung to oxygenate the blood outside the body. Although her condition is life-threatening, her family remain hopeful she can pull through after she started showing signs of recovery this week.   Suzanne, who lives with partner Kevin Davidson, 42, a lorry driver, and her son Luis, 20, added: It has just been a living hell and every mother\u0027s worst nightmare.  But she is now off one of the machines after her heart started working independently of the BiVAD machine, which the consultant had said is a small miracle.  We are just hoping for the best now, she has picked up but I could still potentially be here another six, nine or 12 months until after Christmas they are telling me.  The doctors and nurses have just been amazing and I cannot thank them enough for what they have done for Whitney so far.  We are just praying she carries on fighting because we\u0027ve always said Whitney cannot live without me and I can\u0027t live without Whitney - she is my little mini me.   Her grandmother Wendy Burford, said: As a family we\u0027re living day-by-day as everything is now down to chance.  It has been such a shock to everyone as Whitney was so young and full of life.  We are remaining hopeful that Whitney will pull through and wake up soon.  Of course, we want to do as much as we can to help family members who want to visit and support Whitney and make regular visits.  Her mother, Susan, has been so strong throughout it all.  She\u0027s had to give up her job in order to care for and visit Whitney in hospital. Manchester is quite a way and affording to travel on a regular basis is tiring and very expensive.

Linda Humphrey, 59, and her partner Norman Howe, 47, of Grimsby, were served an eviction notice by their estate agent after they had fallen more than \u0026pound1,000 behind on their rent, when it was not paid to them through Universal Credit.  Linda, who lost her leg last September due to complications with her diabetes, said that all of their problems seemed to occur at once, as she had just lost her beloved son Paul, 37, three months before, reports the Grimsby  .   Paul had spent 45 weeks in Grimsby hospital with penile cancer before his death. His family had campaigned for a specially-adapted home for him in which to die in peace.  He had lost around 12st while in hospital, having weighed 42st when he was admitted. But sadly, he died in hospital.  She said that Paul\u0027s death played a huge emotional toll on her family, as well as a financial one, because before he was admitted to hospital he had helped to provide support with the rent and bills. It also hit her ex-husband so hard that he was forced to leave his home due to panic attacks fearing that he would die alone there, and he moved in with Linda, Norman and her other son. Linda said: Paul\u0027s passing was very hard on us all, nobody should ever have to lose their child. Since then it just seems like life has got to be very cruel on us, because while we were still trying to cope with his loss, I found that due to my diabetes I had developed an infection in my foot that caused all of the bones to shatter and I was forced to have it amputated. As I normally took care of all the bills things just seemed to start to slip, and we have spiralled into all of this debt just to get by. Linda had been receiving disability benefits since 2009, following an accident at work when she was a carer, while her partner Norman had been getting income support as he was her full-time carer. Following the tragic events of last year, they say that they were advised to switch from their current benefits and go onto Universal Credit, as that would mean that they would receive more money than they had been before. However the pair say that this just was not the case, and that the rent portion of their claim was not being paid directly to their landlord, despite assurances that it would be.  They also claim that even though they explained that they would need \u0026pound207 a week for rent, they had in fact only being receiving \u0026pound137, and this meant they were unable to pay it, or their arrears, putting them into even more debt. Going into the Job Centre after receiving notice from their landlord to find out what the issue was, they were told that they would be able to get the correct benefits that they need if they sign up for a disability premium, which would give them the amount of help and support that they need. But this premium would take 12 weeks to process, meaning that they would not actually receive it until after they are due to be evicted on June 21. The couple say that because of their debts they have been forced to live on less than \u0026pound200 a month, and that they have racked up further debt on credit cards as they have had to use them in order to buy food. Norman was even forced to sell his car in order to try and recoup some money. Norman said: We were advised to go onto Universal Credit because we were told that it would allow us to receive more money than we were currently getting, but that just didn\u0027t seem to be the case.  Our rent money was not being paid to our landlord, and when it started to be they were not providing enough money. Because of this we have been trying to live on less than \u0026pound200 a month, I have had to sell my car, and we are relying on credit cards in order to do the shopping and put food on the table. A single system replacing six benefits: Child and Working Tax Credits, Housing Benefits, Income Support, Jobseekers’ Allowance, and Employment and Support Allowance. It was launched in 2013 as the pet project of Tory Iain Duncan Smith supposedly to make work pay. Who claims it? Low earners, those out of work and the sick or disabled. Already 610,000 people are on UC - 8% of benefit claimants. It is being rolled out to individual Jobcentres including 52 in October 2017. What are the problems? Debt-ridden claimants must wait six weeks (five from early 2018) for their first payment, with 19% waiting longer than that and 4% waiting ten weeks in late 2017. Research also suggests overall, UC leaves many working families worse off than the old system. That is because payments taper away at 63p for every \u0026pound1 claimants earn.

Jo Barton, 32, who now lives in Sawbridgeworth, left school in Harlow at the age of 14 without any GCSE’s or qualifications to her name.   She then entered a “pit of depression” where she drank on a daily basis and descended into being a “nightmare teen”, reports EssexLive .  “We didn’t have my mum about as she was in the hospital being sectioned,” explained Jo. My teenage years are where it all went wrong really.  “I left school at 14, halfway through year 10, and I ended up skipping a lot and I wasn’t living at home. “I got into alcohol at an early age – about 13 – and I was drinking every single day. “I think I was probably depressed but I didn’t know it at the time.  “I turned to alcohol and then I began to rebel and that got me into lots of trouble as a teenager .”  Jo’s mum suffered with bipolar disorder, although these days she is coping much better with it. Her dad had moved away from the area so she says she and her sister were often left to their own devices. However, after years of depression and gaining a “reputation” in Harlow, she sought a clean break and new life. As a result she started scouting around for any job she could find.  “I kept thinking I couldn’t do that for my mum and I was quite depressed in Harlow,” said Jo. “I think I wanted to start a new life because I had a reputation – it was either that or staying depressed. “I got my first job at 17 at a restaurant in Great Dunmow. “It only lasted four weeks because I was a really bad waitress. “It was my first job, it was long hours, and they fired me after four weeks.” Despite the brief nature of her very first role, the restaurant job wasn’t all bad for Jo as she met her partner there, who she is still with 15 years later. Without any qualifications, and a relatively empty CV, Jo explained that she eventually turned to looking at healthcare jobs. The reason being was that they were advertised as not requiring any previous experience and soon she managed to land a job as a health care assistant at St Catherine’s Care Home in Broxbourne. Furthermore, while working she could also train towards her National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) in care. In her two years at the care home Jo managed to achieve her NVQ as well as getting key skills in English and maths. Whilst at the care home Jo said her confidence grew but she soon started wanting more and set about finding a path into hospital care. She managed to get a part time job on an x-ray ward at Princess Alexandra Hospital and landed a place on an access to nursing course at a college in Enfield, North London. However, because of the financial constraints Jo ended up working for 60 hours a week as she tried to balance work with her studies.  “You don’t really get support in college and I just got on with it,” she explained. “I had about one meal a day and that’s effectively how I survived. “There were lots of times I wanted to quit but if I did that then I would have got nothing. She added: “My final year was a very tough year for me. “My mum had been well for a few years but she got taken off of tablets and she got sectioned again. “I was commuting each way trying to visit my mum but also studying for my final exams.” Despite the tough nature of her college years Jo managed to pass her exams but her graduation day was spoiled as her mum was unable to attend due to anxiety attacks. After a surgeon at Princess Alexandra let her watch a number of surgeries Jo subsequently fell in love with medicine and focused on her next goal – becoming a doctor. She found an access to medicine course but required maths and English GCSE’s so she had to do them via home learning. Once she completed her two GCSEs she was accepted onto the course and moved to Norwich. She then applied for a university place to study medicine, but failed to be accepted.  Instead, she was accepted for a biomedicine course, but didn’t feel it suited her at all, so once again applied for a degree in medicine. Jo was accepted onto a six-year degree at St George’s Hospital in London where she graduated from three years ago. Now she is currently working in accident and emergency at Princess Alexandra hospital in Harlow, and she has already set her mind on her next task – to become a GP. “I felt like I needed a better work life balance so I decided to apply for GP training. “I was working nights and I didn’t want to do that for the rest of my life.” Jo’s journey has not been without its struggles. But regardless of that, she wants to use her personal journey as an inspiration to others. “I just want people to know that if you come from nothing there are options if you are willing to put the effort in,” she said.

German newspaper Bild said she was filmed in the Majorcan town of Inca at 11am on Sunday. Majorcan newspaper Ultima Hora also carried the picture, linking it to the drunken tourism the island is fighting against. The newspaper also mentioned the party resort Magaluf , which is 29 miles away from Inca. Inca is in the centre of the island and is not a mass tourism hotspot.  Bild claimed the woman was with with two friends and needed the burger as a hangover cure and headlined its article “This is how you ask for a hamburger in Majorca”.

The 17th Century mausoleum and one of the New7 Wonders of the World sits alongside a garbage-strewn river and is often enveloped by dust and smog from smoking chimneys in Arga. Tiny insects from the drying Yamuna River, into which the city pours its sewage, are also reported to be crawling into the Taj Mahal, their excrement further staining the white marble, an environmental lawyer told India\u0027s Supreme Court. The court slammed the government for not doing enough to preserve the monument, which was built by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan as a mausoleum for his wife Mumtaz Mahal. Lawyer M.C. Mehta, who has been fighting to save the Taj Mahal from pollution for three decades, said: If the Indian scientists and the (conservationists) can\u0027t do the things, they should be able to contact foreign experts or conservationists, those who can come and they will be readily happy to help.  Restorers have been using a paste of a clay mineral to clean the marble which pulls away impurities from the surface and can then be washed off with water. Activists are also concerned that the falling water table in Agra may be weakening the wooden foundations. Other worries include roads clogged with polluting vehicles and rampant construction around the mausoleum. Behind Taj\u0027s back, plastic bags and garbage pile up by the river as smoke billows from a chimney in the distance. The change in colour has not come out of the blue. Environmentalists and historians have long warned about the risk of soot and fumes from factories and tanneries dulling the ivory monument.

In 1708 the war ship carrying treasure of gold, silver and other precious metals and stones, sunk off the coast of Colombia after a fierce battle. The San Jose, went down with 600 people on board during Spain\u0027s war of succession against the British, and soon became known as the \u0027holy grail\u0027 of shipwrecks. For three centuries the ship and its treasures were lost at sea until November 2015, when a team from Colombia\u0027s archaeology institute discovered the wreck laying on the ocean floor 600 metres below the surface. On Monday, the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution received permission from the Colombian government to finally reveal how the legendary 62-gun galleon ship was found.  The exact location of the shipwreck remains a secret due to a legal dispute between U.S based salvage company, Sea Search Armada - which claims it discovered the wreck in the 1980s - and Colombia, over who has rights to the proceeds of the wreck. The ship was found by authorities in 2015 using an autonomous underwater vehicle called REMUS, which has previously assisted to find the wreckage of Air France 447 in 2011 and mapped the Titanic wreck site during a 2010 expedition.  WHOI engineer and expedition leader Mike Purcell said the San Jose wreck was discovered during a survey of an area off Colombia\u0027s Baru Peninsula during a large, coordinated block search. He said: “During that November expedition, we got the first indications of the find from side scan sonar images of the wreck. “From those images, we could see strong sonar signal returns, so we sent REMUS back down for a closer look to collect camera images. The wreck was partially sediment-covered, but with the camera images from the lower altitude missions, we were able to see new details in the wreckage and the resolution was good enough to make out the decorative carving on the cannons. MAC’s lead marine archaeologist, Roger Dooley, interpreted the images and confirmed that the San Jose had finally been found.”  The ship sunk in 1708 while transporting its precious cargo from America to Spain. The hauls of treasure were meant to help finance Spain\u0027s succession against Britain. The historic find has provided the Colombian people with clues to Europe\u0027s economic, social and political climate in the early 18th century.

But the Iraqi dictator never boarded the 82-metre (270-foot) Basrah Breeze built for him in 1981 - and its amenities will now be enjoyed by the pilots who guide shipping in and out of the port of Basra, the main southern city.  In common with other treasures left by Saddam, toppled in 2003 during the US-led invasion of Iraq and hanged three years later for crimes against humanity, the governments that succeeded him have been struggling to find a use for the ship.  Since Iraq got it back in 2010 following a court battle and a three-decade odyssey abroad, it has been mostly moored in Basra.    What was it like in Baghdad when Saddam Hussein\u0027s statue was toppled? Defining moment vividly retold   Equipped with a presidential suite comprising Saddam\u0027s private quarters, dining rooms and bedrooms, as well as 17 smaller guest rooms, 18 cabins for crew and a clinic, the opulently equipped and decorated vessel was put on the market for $30 million.  The government failed to find a buyer, and for the past two years the Basrah Breeze has served Basra University, hosting researchers on trips to study marine life.  The presidential yacht is in a very good condition. Its two engines and generators are functioning, said Abdul-Zahra Abdul-Mahdi Saleh, its captain. It only needs periodic maintenance.   But authorities have now decided to moor it permanently as a hotel and recreation facility for the southern port\u0027s pilots, many of whom live in distant cities.   The port needs the boat to be a station where sea pilots can rest, said Basra port spokesman Anmar al-Safi. Built by a Danish shipyard while Iraq was at war with Iran, the yacht was passed on to Saudi Arabia - then a Saddam ally - to protect it from air strikes on Basra, officials giving an exclusive tour said.  The kingdom, which fell out with Saddam after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, then handed the vessel over to Jordan.  Its subsequent movements were unclear until Iraq tracked it down in the French resort of Nice, where a court seized it and sent it home.  While the Basrah Breeze survived the turmoil of Saddam\u0027s decline and demise, its sister ship al-Mansur - which he also never boarded - suffered a different fate, sinking in the Shatt al-Arab waterway that passes through Basra after it was hit by US planes and then stripped bare in the chaotic aftermath of his overthrow.

It is the most powerful weapons test from a single submarine since the Cold War and is the first time four missiles have been simultaneously launched from one vessel, according to Russia. All reached their designated targets at the Kura test range on Kamchatka from the nuclear-powered Yury Dolgoruky, Russian forces reported.  The Northern Fleet\u0027s press service lavished praise on the test, saying the crew of the submarine cruiser demonstrated high professionalism and naval training prior to and during the exercise, reports military TV channel Zvezda.  The Russian Defence Ministry released footage, on Tuesday, which shows the enormous missiles being launched.  The Bulava can be seen emerging from beneath the sea\u0027s surface, through thick smoke - and all four launch within a 27-second window. The test was carried out within the framework of planned combat training services, the press service continued, from the main ship of Project 955 Borey. The tactical and technical characteristics and reliability of the strategic missile submarine of Project 955 Borey and the Bulava missile system were confirmed, the report says.  Zalpovaya shooting of such a number of missiles on the submarine cruisers of this project was carried out for the first time.  The same submarined launched two Bulava missiles in September 2016, reports the Barents Observer, also then from a submerged position in the White Sea.  More than 30 Bulava missiles have been tested since 2004 - it will be the future cornerstone in the naval leg of Russia\u0027s nuclear triad and is the most expensive weapons project in the country.

Only three to four percentage points separate the two groups, with 74% of middle class and 70% of working class Southerners opting for “dinner”.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b03ea942ad44-846x564.jpg ","title":"completion of 5m dundee water network upgrade delayed again","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe completion of a £5 million Dundee-wide water network upgrade has been delayed for a second time.Scottish Water and Caledonia Water Alliance started work on the project in 2016 and it was originally scheduled for completion late last year.Now, however, it’s been announced that there has been a further delay.It is expected that the work will not now be completed until “late summer”.Dundee City Council’s convener of city development Lynne Short said that although it was frustrating, the work had to be carried out and it would be worth it in the end.Councillor Short said: “Myself and council officers are aware of the delay and we have asked Scottish Water to explain the situation.“We continue to thank people for their patience and assure them that the work should be completed as soon as possible.“We are having many miles of very old pipes replaced and in the end we will have a pipe network worthy of our city.”Some of the city’s pipes had lain untouched for more than a century prior to the work starting.While the works have been ongoing, many streets have seen closures and disruptions.Work has so far been completed on more than 50 miles of water mains.This has led to improvements for more than 15,000 households.A spokesman for Scottish Water said: “Scottish Water’s £5m mains upgrade across Dundee is expected to be completed by late summer.“Caledonia Water Alliance, which is our alliance partner carrying out the project on Scottish Water’s behalf, has to date replaced or refurbished more than 80km of mains across the city.“As the project has progressed, some of the pipework initially earmarked for refurbishment has had to be replaced due to its condition, meaning a knock-on effect on the initial timescales for the job.“This essential project is being carried out to ensure the people of Dundee can continue to enjoy clear, fresh drinking water long into the future and we thank customers across the city for their patience and understanding as this work continues.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/02/15512677556_6c95b0b5bc_b.jpg ","title":"dundee college graduate returns to city to help folk conquer stage fright","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Duncan of Jordanstone graduate will return to her old university this weekend to give a talk on conquering stage fright.Lauren Currie OBE will invite audience members to join her on stage when she appears as guest speaker at the University of Dundee’s Saturday Series.The founder of design agency Snook has devised a new movement called #Upfront, which sees speakers sharing their stage with audience members wanting to experience the spotlight without having to perform.Lauren said: “It’s a great way to step outside your comfort zone and get a feel for what it is like to be on stage.”The free event takes place at the Dalhousie Building, Old Hawkhill on Saturday from 6-7pm.Tickets can be reserved online at dundee.ac.uk/saturdayseries.Anybody wanting to join Lauren on stage can apply by sending an email to helloupfront@googlemail with the subject line “University of Dundee”.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/Mark-2.jpg ","title":"dundee people dondonian draws on lifes experiences for new novel about interrailing through europe in the 80s","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA former Dundonian has drawn on his experiences Interrailing around Europe in the 1980s to write a book which starts in the City of Discovery.Mark Johnson was born in Kirkcaldy in Fife, then moved to Dumfries and Galloway and eventually came to Dundee aged eight.\u0026#8220I visit often and love how the city has been modernised, especially the riverfront,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220But when I left, it was the 1980s \u0026#8211 the Thatcher era \u0026#8211 and Dundee, with its staunchly militant political leanings, didn’t offer the opportunities for young people to prosper.\u0026#8220I always remember our Accounts class teacher once telling us, perhaps rather flippantly, that it didn’t really matter how well we did in our exams as most of us would probably end up ‘on the dole’. It wasn’t exactly encouraging.\u0026#8221Mark was 19 when he left Dundee and decided to travel Europe by rail, and it was those experiences that prompted him to write a book, titled Changing Trains.\u0026#8220The main character in the story is Sam, but much of it is based on my own experiences travelling alone in Europe in 1985,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220I’m a big fan of the novelist Christopher Isherwood, whose books formed the basis for the film Cabaret.\u0026#8220My title is a nod to his book Mr Norris Changes Trains.\u0026#8220Isherwood’s Fraulein Schroeder is remembered in my book as Madame Gilbert and all the young female characters that Sam encounters in my book kind of collectively represent Isherwood’s Sally Bowles.\u0026#8221\u0026#8220When I travelled across Europe in 1985, we were still in the cold war era \u0026#8211 weird to think we could heading that way again now \u0026#8211 and it was pre-Shengen, so I had to go through border controls as I entered and left each country and there was no euro at this point, so I had to get my head around constantly changing my currencies \u0026#8211 pounds to francs to pesetas to lira. This is all described in the book, and I have a little fun with it.\u0026#8221Mark began writing the book in 2010, while he was travelling between his work in London and a small house in France.\u0026#8220I’m a huge fan of Ian Fleming’s James Bond stories and when I travelled to places like Paris, Monte Carlo, Venice and the French Riviera \u0026#8211 all places that have appeared in Fleming’s novels \u0026#8211 it really felt like you were in the world of Bond, so I play with this a bit too,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220And when I went Interrailing, I travelled \u0026#8211 as everyone did back then \u0026#8211 with a number of compilation tapes for my Walkman, so the soundtrack to the book is also very 80s.\u0026#8220Everything from Duran Duran’s Bond theme ‘A View to a Kill’ to Simple Minds’ Glittering Prize album. Fab music.\u0026#8221The story starts in Dundee, and Mark said it was central to the story of Sam\u0026#8217s journey from uncertain, undecided small-town boy to a modern, outward-looking European with a sense of direction in his life.\u0026#8220Once the main character Sam has left Dundee and is discovering new cities like Paris, Barcelona and Monte Carlo, he often compares them with his origins. His experience of ‘otherness’ opens new possibilities to him, ones that weren’t available in Dundee at that time,\u0026#8221 Mark said.He initially started looking for a publisher for the book but decided instead to self-publish and said the reviews had been great.\u0026#8220I’ve been amazed at how many people have said it really took them back to that period and reminded them of their own lives back then. I love that it resonates with them,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220I’ve also done some readings in London and a few guest spots on blogs.

career at Dens Park.The 19-year-old, signed from Port Vale two years ago, impressed manager Neil McCann enough to see him made second-choice behind Elliott Parish, despite the signing of Jeremy Malherbe in January.That brought a debut at Ibrox in April after Parish was hurt late on before Ferrie was rewarded with a new contract and then his first start on the final day of the season.That ended in frustration for the Dark Blues as they were beaten 1-0 by Partick Thistle after a limp performance and left Ferrie “annoyed” that his hopes of keeping a clean sheet had been dashed.He said: “The result wasn’t what we wanted and we could have done better.“However, on a personal note it was a great achievement to play and I feel I did alright.“It was a good confidence booster for myself to get that full start under my belt, I really enjoyed it.“It’s always frustrating as a keeper because you can’t really influence the play in front of you.“That’s just the life of the goalkeeper – it can be a lonely position. Sometimes you just have to look after yourself, make sure you give your team the best chance to go and win a game by making saves when you need to.“All I did really in that Partick game was do my job.“I conceded a goal which is very annoying because I just want to keep clean sheets – that’s what goalkeepers are built on.“I wasn’t happy about that but, overall, it was a pleasing performance for myself.”And Ferrie did impress, making timely saves as well as commanding his area with Partick quickly putting the rookie keeper under pressure from the off.An early save that saw him claw an Adam Barton header out of the top corner set him on his way and, although he couldn’t stop Kris Doolan poking in the winner, he was happy with this performance.On that Barton header: “It had me worried when it was looping over me! I was thinking ‘oh, no, it’s looping, it’s looping, please get there!’“I managed to just get there and then, after that, there was a corner and with a young keeper they were going to put it on me. That’s what anyone does with a young keeper, and I got a good punch on it.“I felt that was important because it meant they maybe didn’t put it on me as much. I found in the second half they didn’t. The crosses were a bit further out, which was good.“Teams might look at that because I’m maybe not as big as other goalkeepers. I’m 6ft 1in but it doesn’t matter, you just have to be dominant and you get yourself out for crosses.“I’ve always tried to do that because I always think if you attack it 100% you can get there even if they are six foot seven or eight.“If you want that ball more than them then you can go get it.”His displays in training and for the successful U/20 side, saw him handed another year’s deal by Dundee and Ferrie is determined to make the most of the chance he’s been given.He added: “It was good to get that signed, get secure for next year knowing I can come back and work 100% again to make sure that gets me as far as I can go.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2016/02/wf-863x575.jpg ","title":"free dundee waterfront wi fi to be working by summer","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA free public Wi-Fi scheme will be operational at Dundee Waterfront by the end of July, it has been revealed.Mike Galloway, executive director of city development, has given assurances the service will start with a temporary set-up for Slessor Gardens by July 31, with a wider area operational before the V\u0026ampA opens on September 15.Mr Galloway also confirmed provision for Union Street, Crichton Street, Castle Street and Reform Street will be operational by September 7, with a permanent solution for Slessor Gardens expected to be in place by November 16.However, he said the work was still “out for tender”, adding that dates may have to be revised slightly when a preferred bidder has been appointed.It is understood no specific timelines have been given for introducing free Wi-Fi to the City Square area, although all firms bidding to provide the service have stated this should be completed by the end of the year.Paul Jennings, chairman of Visit Dundee, said free Wi-Fi being available in time for the V\u0026ampA’s opening was “brilliant” news and “could create real economic benefits” for the city.“We’re looking at an influx of visitors to Dundee and I think their ability to access information on the move is going to be key,” he said.“That ability to access content live – whether it’s nearby restaurants, shops or other attractions – could be really useful in providing a boost for the local economy.”City councillor Fraser Macpherson said the service could provide a “boon” for the city and added: “Many cities are discovering free Wi-Fi is a good way to attract more visitors.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/10/SMac_Invertay_House_Maule_Monifieth17100501.jpg-846x564.jpg ","title":"fresh hope of building facility for local community","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPlans to build a new community centre in the local area could be back on the table.The Monifieth Community Resource Group (MCRG) suffered a huge setback in March when a £1 million request to the Big Lottery Fund to refurbish Invertay House was rejected.The former school building was earmarked to be turned into a multi- purpose centre to hold sports and community events.Angus Council had most recently used the premises to process benefit inquiries, but agreed to the community asset transfer in August last year.Jean Lee, chairwoman of MCRG, said: “Before Invertay House was declared surplus to requirements by Angus Council, and we began the whole process, we had done a huge amount of work on the potential development of a community hub on land beside the Blue Seaway.\u0026#8220We were at the stage of being ready to apply to the Big Lottery for funding.

We have had very positive preliminary discussions with Monifieth Athletic to take this forward as a joint project.“They had ambitions to create a sports hub down at the riverfront and we had always shared the understanding that we would support them in this ambition after we had secured our community centre.

They started to chase after the car in case he injured someone and the bouncer told him to give him the keys.Police were called and Palade disappeared, however when police attended, he returned with a spare set of keys and tried to get into his car and start it up.Officers prevented him from doing so and a roadside breath test showed a reading of 134 mics. He was then taken to Bell Street HQ but would not agree to provide two further specimens of breath and would not provide any explanation, Mrs Bruce said.Solicitor Nicola Brown told the court Palade had “panicked” when told what the roadside breath test reading was and had failed to provide further tests.She said in terms of the driving offence, he had driven about 300 metres.Ms Brown said he had gone to the pub for a drink with a colleague but ended up consuming far more than he had intended and had foolishly decided to move his car away from the restricted parking area he was in to avoid getting a parking ticket the following day.She said he intended to sell the car to pay for any fine that was imposed.Sheriff Alastair Carmichael fined Palade £800 and banned him from driving for 16 months.

proud of stints at both dundee and united but focus is now on hibs","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSought-after Simon Murray’s future will not be decided until July at the very earliest.And while the striker, who’s just finished a loan spell at Dundee, is extremely flattered by interest from the other side of Tannadice Street, his first choice is to remain at parent club Hibs.Murray is currently enjoying his summer break but is well aware of speculation linking him with a return to first full-time employers Dundee United.Beaten Scottish Cup finalists Motherwell are also known to be considering a summer move for him and, dating back to his time at United, several clubs in Europe have monitored his progress.As recently as Dundee’s victory over St Johnstone last month, one sent their chief scout to update their file on him.For the 26-year-old, however, the next piece of business he aims to be involved in is a battle to re-establish himself at Easter Road.“I am contracted to Hibs for another year and, although I spent the second half of the season on loan at Dundee, my aim has always been to go back there.“I still finished the season top scorer for them and, even when I went to Dundee in January, the plan was always to go back.“At the time I spoke to Neil Lennon and he stressed whether or not I went was entirely down to me.“I could have stayed and he would have considered me for selection but really the move came up because Anthony Stokes had left and they needed a No 10.“They wanted Scott Allan and the only way the deal was going to be done was if I went to Dundee, so the gaffer did say to me I would be back in the summer.“He’s told me I can stake a claim for a place in the team next season and I know, if he says that, he means it, because he’s very honest with me.”Should things not work out in his second season at Hibs, Murray will look at his situation.“Obviously, if they sign another striker or decide to go another way I’ll have to think about what happens next, so it is good to know other clubs are interested. If it doesn’t work out, the only person I will blame is myself but I feel the move to Dundee has been good for me because it’s got me a lot more Premiership experience.”He admits had the loan interest at the turn of the year been from someone other than Dundee, there’s a fair chance he would have opted to stay put.“A lot’s been said about me being a Dundee fan and that was a factor.“More important was it was a move that wasn’t going to involve me having to get used to a new city or league.“I stayed at my mum’s when I was back up and I already knew some of the boys, so it was easy to settle in. I’m not saying I wouldn’t have gone somewhere else but all that made it an easier choice to come.”And, as a proud Dundonian, Murray admits the fact he’s joined a select band of players to have worn dark blue and tangerine is pleasing.“I will look back at the end of my career and be proud I played for Dundee and United. While I’m a Dundee fan, even before I was at United I was never one who didn’t want them to do well.“I always went to see both teams and I still do. I’m a football fan and I want to see both sides from my city doing well.“Now I’ve got a United connection, they are a club I will always have a lot of time for.“They were the team that gave me my chance in the game full-time and I’m grateful for that.“I still know a lot of people there and they are very good people who I respect a lot.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b03eb36a6964-e1526984625691-490x564.jpg ","title":"wwe star drew mcintyre salutes dundee grappler after tournament win","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Dundee wrestler has been given a glowing endorsement by a WWE superstar after winning a tournament in his honour.Adam Hastings — who performs under the name Irving Garrett — was recently crowned the winner of the first Drew Galloway Invitational.The 26-year-old fought off stiff competition from other up-and-coming grapplers to win the event in Glasgow.Drew, competing for WWE as Drew McIntyre, took to Twitter to congratulate the city centre man on his achievement.The former Intercontinental and NXT champion said:\u0026mdash Drew McIntyre (@DMcIntyreWWE) May 13, 2018The seal of approval from his fellow Scotsman has led to a flood of interest from promoters across the UK.Speaking to the Tele, Adam said: “It was really cool to be able to win that, especially considering it was in Drew’s name.“It was amazing that he Tweeted out that support, and since then I’ve had lots of people getting in touch on Twitter.“I’ve always been such a huge fan of wrestling and my family knew I was always going to get into it.

wishlist","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee are in the hunt for a goalscorer and Leyton Orient marksman Macauley Bonne is top of their wishlist.The Zimbabwe international scored 25 goals for the National League side last season, sparking the Dark Blues interest.Born in Ipswich, Bonne started his career at Colchester United, where he played with current Dundee midfielder Glen Kamara briefly, before loans at Lincoln City and Woking.It’s been at Brisbane Road, however, where he’s shone, smashing in 22 league goals last season.With a year remaining on his current deal there, a fee will be required to prise him from Orient and that could be a sticking point with the non-league side holding out for six figures.With Shrewsbury, Portsmouth and Burton Albion all interested, too, Dundee have fierce competition to land the 22-year-old striker.Orient are also keen to keep him on a longer contract but a mid-table finish in the National League is unlikely to have been enough to keep him amid interest from other clubs.Dens gaffer Neil McCann highlighted a lack of killer instinct in his side throughout last season, something he is determined to rectify this summer with a proven goalscorer.With money in the bank from the January sale of defender Jack Hendry, Dundee have the funds behind them to strengthen that area of the team.And having already raided the English non-league for Roarie Deacon last summer and Elton Ngwatala last week, Neil is hoping he can attract another National League star to come north of the

artwork","story":"\u0026nbspAN alternative artwork to replace the controversial tilting pier concept proposed for the banks of the River Ness will be showcased at a public exhibition next week.Designs, to be displayed at Inverness Town House on May 24, have thrilled councillors who have had a peek at an international architect\u0027 new offering.The images are being kept under wraps for now. But the Courier understands the \u0026pound370,000 art installation, still branded by Highland Council as the Gathering Place, will be divided into two sections positioned on either side of the river. The installation is thought to be a mix of stone and wooden construction.There is great excitement among city councillors who have seen two-dimensional design work, and there is apparent consensus that it is aesthetically pleasing and will easily blend into the local, tranquil environment.The \"pier\" project, proposed for a spot by Eden Court, was aborted two years ago due to the scale of public objections to the design.The location for the new proposal is believed to be nearby, slightly further upriver, at the most shallow point on the edge of the Ness Islands.The council\u0027 Inverness city committee delegated powers of approval to the Inverness city arts working group. Its current chairwoman, councillor Isabelle MacKenzie, said she had closely scrutinised the fresh concept adding that it was \"within budget\".Giving little away, she added: \"I can see it appealing to the local community. It\u0027 innovative and there are a variety of ways to use it.\"The artwork is believed to be static and radically different from the previous offering.Fellow city councillor Duncan Macpherson said: \"The whole thing looks good. I think people who use this walkway regularly will be impressed.

It enhances a current meeting place and it\u0027 a natural walkway.\"It\u0027 a good design, in the right place and way better. It\u0027 a natural \u0026lsquogathering place\u0026rsquo unlike the previous design which was very modern. That may go on to be a great success in another city but it wasn\u0026rsquot for Inverness or the location.\"A two-day public consultation was held last December at the city\u0027 railway station and in the Eastgate Shopping Centre to gather opinions about the overall riverside arts project to consider \"how the river should connect with the people and community of Inverness\".The arts initiative has been plagued by complaints about design and costs.The council has consistently stressed that the overall \u0026pound759,000 project, featuring a range of different art installations, is publicly funded but largely through ring-fenced grants.They were \u0026ndash Creative Scotland (\u0026pound305,600), the Inverness Common Good Fund (\u0026pound281,000), the council\u0027 \"cities gateway\" initiative (\u0026pound66,000), Highlands and Islands Enterprise (\u0026pound66,000) and a further \u0026pound40,000 from the council. Backers also emphasised that if Inverness spurned the project the funding would simply go elsewhere in Scotland.The local authority\u0027 Inverness city manager David Haas said: \"It is in development and about to be revealed to the public.\"I\u0026rsquom confident the new proposal will prove a big hit for the city. It fits the brief and will add to the city environment and the amenity of the city and the river, so I\u0026rsquom very excited to see it being put forward for the public to see.\"Tilting pier designer Chilean-born architect Karsten Huneck won a contract for a second time after a separate tendering process.An economic assessment carried out for the council had suggested the \"pier\" project would have recouped its cost through additional tourism within two years.Wednesday 23 May 2018 12:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04099000/04099471.jpg","title":"Lack of cash forces arts group to fold","story":"\u0026nbspAN organisation set up to provide access to arts and cultural activities in a deprived Inverness neighbourhood is to be wound up due to a lack of funding.Since being set up 15 years ago, Arts in Merkinch has been responsible for a broad programme of events and activities including an acclaimed annual arts festival and craft workshops for all ages.
