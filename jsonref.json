Photograph Nick BradshawThe The Government has approved plans to remove almost all Covid-19 related restrictions next Monday. Under a plan that went to Cabinet, all legal requirements to wear masks will expire after February 28th, with their use only required in healthcare settings. People will be advised to exercise their own judgement on the use of masks in schools, in retail settings and on public transport. Speaking during a visit to Berlin, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said he wanted to thank the Irish people for their resilience and the manner in which they responded to the pandemic. “It has been a very difficult period. Many people have lost their lives as a result of the pandemic, many families are bereaved, many have fallen ill and it has caused strain at different times on the health service ... to which we how a huge debt of gratitude,” said. He said there would be a Covid subcommittee meeting next Monday. “I think the challenge there is to map out how to manage and navigate Covid for the next 12 months, with a more permanent vaccination structure in response to given situations.”Tánaiste Leo Varadkar also said there would be “significant changes” regarding testing. People with symptoms who are aged under 55, or those over that age who have had a booster vaccine dose and are in good health, are no longer required to get tested. Those aged over 55 and not boosted, pregnant women and people who are immuno-compromised or have high-risk medical conditions should still get a Covid-19 test.People with confirmed cases of Covid-19 must still self-isolate. However,close contact are no longer required to restrict movement or self-isolate unless they have symptoms from Monday.The changes were announced as the Health Protection Surveillance Centre reported an additonal 3,294 PCR-confirmed cases of the disease, as well as the logging of a further 4,060 positive antigen tests through the HSE’s online portal.There were 608 people being treated for the disease in the State’s hospitals on Tuesday, a decrease of 28 in 24 hours, including 54 patients in intensive care, an increase of one. EndemicMr Varadkar said Cabinet agreed to accept the advice of the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) and he described the changes as the next steps towards living with Covid-19 as an endemic disease.While mask mandates would end on Monday as a legal requirement, he said it was still advised to wear them on public transport and in healthcare settings. He said people who still wished to wear masks should feel free to do so. In schools and childcare pods for children, staggered breaks and physical distancing can also end from Monday. These settings will still be required to practice good hygiene and have good ventilation, while children should stay at home if they are sick. Mr Varadkar said Nphet recommended that there be no vaccine mandates either for the general public or healthcare workers and the Government has agreed with this.Teaching unions expressed concerns over the decision to end mask wearing requirements in classrooms. The Teachers’ Union of Ireland (TUI), which represents staff at second- and third-level, said the move could be “premature”. It said it was particularly concerned about the impact of the decision on staff and students with underlying health issues, or those who had at-risk family members. “Removal of such a key protection against infection will be an extremely worrying development for them and their families in what has already been a very stressful two years,” the union said in a statement. The Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland (Asti) said it would “continue to urge caution” around changes to Covid-19 safety measures in secondary schools. “Covid-19 is still a threat to the operation of schools and the education of young people,” it said.Meanwhile, Ireland could more than double its contributions to global efforts to vaccinate people against Covid-19 under proposals being examined by Government.Donation of vaccinesPlans to donate up to 3.3 million more jabs are being developed by Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly with a view to being finalised in the coming weeks. Ireland - which has high levels of vaccination it is own population - has already donated or pledged around three million doses. Mr Donnelly is understood to be examining how further contributions can be made with a source saying he is “keen to see greater vaccine equity and solidarity” especially with the African continent.Under the proposals Ireland will maintain sufficient vaccine stocks to cater for the current vaccination programme and any possible further vaccine roll-out later this year.However, Mr Donnelly is said to be authorising a waiver of additional vaccine options on 1.7 million doses which will be donated as part of an EU-wide donation of Janssen vaccines.The possibility of donating a further 1.1 million donation of Janssen vaccines - due in Ireland in the second quarter of 2022 - is also being examined. Almost half a million Pfizer and Moderna vaccines that are already in Ireland - and have a shelf life of at least July onwards - may also be donated on a bilateral basis with other countries.

Video: ReutersA man with a stuffed koala toy and flowers at the arrival hall at the international terminal of Sydney Airport. Photograph: Brent LewinBloombergAustralia on Monday fully reopened its international borders to travellers vaccinated against Covid-19 after nearly two years of pandemic-related closings, as tourists returned and hundreds of people were reunited with family and friends.More than 50 international flights were to reach the country through the day, including 27 touching down in Sydney, its largest city, as the tourism and hospitality sectors look to rebuild after getting hammered by Covid-19 restrictions.Most regions of the country were reopening to all fully vaccinated visa-holders without restrictions or exemption requirements. However, the Department of Foreign Affairs warned on Monday that arrivals into Western Australia, including Perth, will have to quarantine on arrival, with this arrangement in place until at least March 3rd.“It is a very exciting day, one that I have been looking forward to for a long time, from the day that I first shut that border right at the start of the pandemic,” Australian prime minister Scott Morrison told reporters in the island state of Tasmania, which relies heavily on tourism.After being away from loved ones for months there were many emotional reunions, including for Cindy Moss, who travelled from the US state of Kentucky to see her daughter.“I just haven’t seen her in so long and it was such a big thing to be able to get over here. So I’m so excited,” she said after hugging her daughter, her voice cracking with emotion.Tourism is one of Australia’s biggest industries, worth more than A$60 billion (€38 billion) a year and employing about 5 per cent of the country’s workforce. But the sector was crippled after the country shut its borders in March 2020.Once a champion of Covid-suppression strategy, Australia shifted away from its fortress-style controls and relentless lockdowns since late last year and began living with the virus after reaching higher vaccination levels. Skilled migrants, international students and backpackers have been allowed to fly into Australia since November in a staggered reopening exercise.PartyingPassengers flying to Sydney were greeted from the air with “Welcome Back World!” painted on a sign near the runways while people in kangaroo costumes welcomed travellers and a DJ played music from a van festooned with a banner saying “You were worth the wait”.“It is a party out here, music playing, smiles on people’s faces, they will be dancing soon, I’m sure,” Australia’s minister for tourism Dan Tehan told broadcaster ABC from Sydney Airport as he gave travellers gift jars of Vegemite, the famed Australian food spread, and stuffed koala toys.Mr Tehan said he was hopeful for a “very strong” rebound in the tourism market, with Qantas looking to fly more than 14,000 passengers into Australia this week. Virgin Australia said it was seeing positive trends in domestic bookings and continued to assess demand for international flights.All trains in Sydney, meanwhile, were cancelled on Monday after pay disputes between a union and the state government, taking some shine off the reopening.As borders reopen, Australia’s outbreak of the Omicron Covid-19 variant appears to have passed its peak, with hospital admissions steadily falling over the past three weeks. The bulk of Australia’s pandemic total of about 2.7 million confirmed cases has been detected since the emergence of Omicron in late November. Total deaths stood at 4,929.Just in excess of 17,000 new cases and 17 deaths were registered by midday on Monday, with the Northern Territory due to report its figures later. – ReutersEverything you

Covid in the future.The Prime Minister announced that all Covid regulations, including those that mandate lockdown and require people to self-isolate if they test positive, will be scrapped from Thursday, Feb 24.Here, we explore everything that is set to change in the days ahead. People who test positive and their close contacts will no longer be required by law to self-isolate. Anyone who receives a positive test result after Feb 24 will be advised to isolate for five days and avoid contact with vulnerable people, but will not be required to do so.People who are unvaccinated and have come into close contact with a positive case will also no longer be required to isolate.The legal duty for workers to tell employers if they are required to self-isolate will also end, as will government financial support for people who are isolating.The Prime Minister said he would not wait for a total end to this war before lifting remaining measures, warning that to do so would involve restricting the liberties of the British people for a long time.From April 1, when the general public will no longer be able to access free tests, the guidance will change again to suggest that those with Covid symptoms should exercise caution to avoid spreading the virus. At a press conference, Mr Johnson suggested the UK could learn from Germany, where people are much more disciplined about not going to work if they are sick.From April 1, the Government will remove the Covid provisions on statutory sick pay, which allow employees to claim sick pay and Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) from the first day they are not at work.From March 24, the system will return to its pre-pandemic form, which allows people to claim sick pay after four days off work and ESA after seven days.Blanket lockdown regulations will also be replaced by a requirement on local authorities to manage outbreaks through planning and pre-existing public health powers, as they would with other diseases.Mr Johnson refused to rule out reintroducing restrictions in the face of a new variant in the future, saying: You\u0027ve got to be humble in the face of nature.From Feb 24, he said the Government would end routine contact tracing and no longer ask fully vaccinated close contacts to test daily for seven days.All temporary provisions of the Coronavirus Act, which enforces legal restrictions on the public, will end from March 24.The general public will no longer be able to access free lateral flow and PCR tests from the NHS from April 1.Tests are expected to be available for the over-80s and the clinically vulnerable, but the precise groups able to access them are to be decided by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) before the April 1 deadline.Care home patients will continue to get regular free asymptomatic testing and staff will be entitled to them if symptomatic. Free diagnostic testing will continue for NHS patients, with stocks available for asymptomatic “surge” testing of staff if needed.Mr Johnson told MPs the testing, tracing and isolation budget had come at a “vast cost”, exceeding the entire budget of the Home Office in 2021, a further £15.7 billion in this financial year and £2 billion in January alone at the height of the omicron wave. He said: “We must now scale this back.”Twice weekly asymptomatic testing for staff and students in most education and childcare settings will also end from April 1. Mass testing in schools is also expected to end.The UKHSA is also working with private companies to ensure that lateral flow tests will be available in supermarkets and pharmacies when they can no longer be ordered from NHS Test and Trace for free.The Government is keen to avoid a repeat of the travel test rip-offs that saw private companies charging more than £100 for PCR tests. Ministers want to ensure there is a regulated market and see no reason why a pack of six lateral flow tests should cost more than £20.In an attempt to prevent panic buying of the kits before April 1, the Government has started rationing lateral flow tests to one pack of seven tests every three days instead of one every 24 hours.Tests for symptomatic people will be free for hospital patients, but there will not be regular asymptomatic testing on wards unless there is a local outbreak.The Government will also maintain a stockpile of tests that can be deployed if a new variant threatens to overwhelm the health service.Protection against laboratory leaks will be stepped up, said Mr Johnson as he set out a strategy to future-proof Britain against another pandemic.He said the UK Biosecurity Strategy would be refreshed to shield the country against both natural spillovers and accidental releases, as well as biological threats from other countries or terrorists. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) infection survey will also remain in place to monitor the virus, and laboratories will maintain the capability to ramp up testing to combat any new variant.But Mr Johnson made it clear that Covid would now be managed through routine public health and pharmaceutical interventions as the “first line of defence”.Vaccination will also continue into the future with the UK securing supplies of new bivalent vaccines currently in trials, which can combat multiple variants in one jab.Britain will host a global pandemic preparedness summit later this month, and is expected to sign an international treaty agreeing to ongoing surveillance.Travel tests and red tape will remain despite the relaxation of domestic restrictions.Unvaccinated travellers will still be required to take a pre-departure test and pay for a PCR test on or before day two of their arrival in the UK.All travellers – jabbed and unjabbed – will also have to continue to fill in the passenger locator form to enter the UK, to the anger of many in the travel industry and Tory MPs who have campaigned for “frictionless” travel.Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary, is expected to announce long-term plans for travel in the next month, which could see the passenger locator form further streamlined, the scrapping of hotel quarantine for red list countries and measures to prevent a return to on-off border closures.Mr Shapps has been working with other countries to draw up a “playbook” of rules to deal with new Covid strains so action can be taken without shutting frontiers.He said this “will help us to ensure that, rather than having to shut down, we can put measures in place that are internationally agreed if required”.Following the abolition of the Covid regulations, face masks will no longer be legally compulsory anywhere.Instead, it will be left up to businesses and iniduals to decide the approach they adopt, which means companies, theatres and shops could still request that coverings are worn by employees and customers.On Monday, Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, said masks would no longer be compulsory on the Tube, even though officials have the power to impose them as a condition of carriage.“Following the Government dropping all legal Covid restrictions, and in light of falling infection levels in London, it is expected that wearing a face covering will no longer be a condition of carriage on the TfL network,” he said.A government source said it was “likely we won\u0027t be explicit” on the approach businesses should take to masks, adding: “We are now in a world where we’re moving away from Government diktat to personal judgement and responsibility.”Ministers will still suggest that people continue to wear face coverings in crowded and enclosed spaces where they may come into contact with people they do not normally meet in order to minimise the risk of infection.Dr Raghib Ali, a senior clinical research associate with the Medical Research Council at the University of Cambridge, urged vulnerable people to wear good quality surgical masks.Hospitals are still likely to limit visits, as living with Covid plans will leave it up to inidual trusts to decide their own policies.More than a quarter of NHS trusts have suspended routine hospital visits completely, and in some cases relatives are being prevented from seeing non-Covid patients for weeks at a time.NHS England encourages trusts to facilitate visits “wherever possible, and to do so in a risk-managed way”, but it is up to inidual trusts to set their own policies based on UK Health Security Agency guidelines.All 125 trusts have some form of visiting restriction in place. The most common policy is to have one named visitor per patient for the entirety of a patient’s stay, who can only visit for one hour once a dayMillions of over-50s could be offered Covid boosters this autumn, as Boris Johnson hailed Britain’s vaccine rollout as key to “restoring our liberties in full”.Fourth jabs will start being offered to those aged 75 and over and the clinically vulnerable from next month, with a further rollout of vaccines expected later this year, when the programme may be much more widely extended. The vaccine programme will see fourth jabs offered to those aged 75 and over from next month, around six months after their booster.  Those who are immunosuppressed will also be offered an extra jab, which for many will be their fifth dose.The Joint Committee on Vaccine and Immunisation said the extra “spring dose” would be advised for the most vulnerable ahead of the expected autumn booster programme. On Monday, the JCVI said people over 75, those living in care homes and anyone over 12 who is immunosuppressed will be offered a fourth jab. Those over 18 will be offered the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines, while those 12 to 18 will be offered Pfizer.Prof Wei Shen Lim, the JCVI chairman of Covid vaccination, said: “Last year’s booster vaccination programme has so far provided excellent protection against severe Covid-19. “To maintain high levels of protection for the most vulnerable iniduals in the population, an extra spring dose of vaccine is advised ahead of an expected autumn booster programme.“The JCVI will continue its rolling review of the vaccination programme and the epidemiological situation, particularly in relation to the timing and value of doses for less vulnerable older adults and those in clinical risk groups ahead of autumn.”Mr Johnson said that from April 1 the use of voluntarily Covid status certification would no longer be recommended but left open the possibility that they could still be used by businesses, theatres and other venues.But the Government said the pass within the NHS app for domestic purposes would only be available for a “limited period”.It will, however, continue within the NHS app for international travel to allow people to declare their vaccinated or Covid recovery status.The Prime Minister suggested companies should consider lifting work from home policies to restore public confidence after the pandemic.Full guidance for businesses is expected before April 1, when tests for the general public will no longer be free. That could include the advice that offices should consider lifting their work from home policies.The Government repealed its advice for employees to work remotely last month, but official figures from the ONS show that, by the end of January, more than a third of workers were still working from home.Virtual court hearings will become a permanent feature to clear the backlog of cases that has built up during the pandemic, despite emergency Covid laws being scrapped by the Government.More than 12,000 hearings per week have taken place across 3,200 virtual courtrooms, and the power to continue them will be transferred to a new police and crime act when remaining coronavirus laws expire in the next six months.Coroners will also be given the permanent power to carry out inquests without a jury where Covid is suspected as a cause of death.In all, 40 temporary non-devolved powers were made under coronavirus laws, of which half have already expired. Of the remaining 20, four cover the inquest and virtual court hearing provisions, and the other 16 will expire at midnight on 24 March.They include the emergency registration of nurses, healthcare workers and social workers the funding of employers’ liabilities for statutory sick pay powers in relations to the transportation, storage and disposal of dead bodies tenants’ protection from eviction and the relaxing of rules covering medical certificates for cremations.Nicola Sturgeon set out the SNP\u0027s plan for the future of Scotland\u0027s response to Covid on February 22. She referred to Scotland\u0027s initial objective to suppress the virus to the lowest possible level, which has now been modified further to manage Covid effectively, primarily through adaptations and health measures that strengthen our resilience and recovery as we rebuild for a better future.The First Minister credited vaccines and treatments with reducing the direct harms of the virus. She encouraged those who had not yet recieved three doses of the jab to come forward and confirmed vaccines for children aged between 5 and 11 years old will be issued from mid-March.Ms Sturgeon confirmed that the Covid pass scheme will also end in Scotland on Monday, while on March 21 the requirement to wear face coverings on public transport and in certain indoor settings is to be converted to guidance.The legal requirement for businesses, places of worship and service providers to have regard to Covid guidance will also end on this date, as well as contact tracing measures will also end on this date.This should not be taken as a signal that Covid no longer presents any risk to health, because it certainly does... We will still recommend voluntary compliance as part of the range of measures that will help keep us safe.People who test positive in Scotland should still self-isolate, as she said isolation support payments will also remain in place.I think it is worth stressing that isolating, staying at home when positive with a highly infectious virus and the follow-up tracing that test and protect does remain one of the most fundamental public health protections that we have available to us, she said.Ms Sturgeon called the new framework an important moment in our recovery - it marks the point at which we move away, hopefully sustainably, from legal restrictions and rely instead on sensible behaviours, adaptations and mitigations.

He has been trying to bring the Russian leader together with US president Joe Biden in a last-ditch effort to prevent an invasion.But while Mr Biden had agreed in principle to a summit, the latest development has surely killed off any hopes of a rapprochement.While a diplomatic solution is preferable to war, it cannot be at any price, as Ben Wallace, the Defence Secretary, told MPs. The West must not support the dismantling of Ukraine in order to persuade Mr Putin to remove his troops.The provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk have been at the centre of a bloody stand-off between the two countries since 2014 that has already cost 10,000 lives. If Mr Putin can split them from Ukraine, as he did Crimea, he will consider his acts of intimidation and aggression to have been a success. But he will come back for more, with the Baltic states next on his list.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Liz Truss says \u0026#39nothing is off the table\u0026#39 as G7 plots more sanctionsAnthony Blinken cancels meeting with Sergei Lavrov over Russian moves on UkraineWhy Vladimir Putin is obsessed with UkraineDonald Trump hails Vladimir Putin as a \u0026#39genius\u0026#39 over Russia\u0026#39s invasion of UkraineGunman takes hostages at Apple store in Amsterdam Russian oligarch hit with sanctions \u0026#39trained with Vladimir Putin at elite KGB spy academy\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"thank god jeremy corbyn isnt charge","story":"There’s an interesting pattern of dialogue that is provoked on Twitter whenever the subject of the 2019 general election is raised. Those of us who switched from Labour to the Conservatives in order to prevent the election of a Jeremy Corbyn-led government are frequently challenged, post-Partygate, to renounce our sins, invited to concede that a government led by the veteran Left-winger, however disastrous, would still have been preferable to the current one led by Boris Johnson.I beg to differ. As if the politics gods are always on the lookout for a way to remind us of our past decisions, we now have the Ukrainian crisis and an opportunity to consider, once again, the political instincts and loyalties of the man elected twice as  leader of the Labour Party.It might be appropriate to remind ourselves that, following Labour’s unexpectedly vigorous performance at the 2017 general election – coming second, more than 50 seats behind the Conservatives, counted as a win in the Labour Party back then – Corbyn seemed to be on the front foot, with his party regularly ahead in the polls. Apparently unable to bring himself to believe that Russia had deliberately launched a chemical attack against British residents, killing at least one British citizen in the process, Corbyn holed his already fragile leadership below the waterline. Why not send a sample of the deadly toxin used in the attempt to assassinate a former KGB agent to the Kremlin, suggested Corbyn to an astonished Commons, so that they could tell us whether it was theirs or not?There was much in subsequent months that led to Labour’s election defeat and Corbyn’s dispatch as leader. But you can easily trace his fall from the dizzy heights of Glastonbury celebrity to naïve (or duplicitous) Kremlin patsy to that moment in 2018.But for all Corbyn’s faults, he is consistent. On several occasions now, he has publicly appeared to sympathise with the interpretations of Putin’s Russia. Everything is Nato’s fault, he and his fellow-travellers on the hard-Left endlessly seem to think. How can poor Russia be blamed for annexing part of Ukraine in 2014 and for its attacks this week when the big, bad military alliance is expanding ever eastwards?He was at it again yesterday in the Commons, suggesting that “longer term, secure peace in the region” might be achieved if Nato reduced its presence in the region. This is a textbook tactic for appeasing hostile forces. So now would be as good a time as any to revisit the choice of prime minister presented to the British public in December 2019. Labour under Keir Starmer is in a difficult position since it cannot, with any sincerity or credibility, pretend that it wishes Corbyn had won that contest. Previous Labour oppositions have been able to claim, following every election defeat, that things would have been far better had the public made a different choice last time round. That is not a tactic available to Starmer’s front bench.So consider that scenario: a UK government, probably a “rainbow” coalition with all the chaos and stupidity such a phrase conjures up, led by a man who opposes the military alliance on which his own country’s security is based. Imagine that day in parliament, when the prime minister’s bike arrives and he steps off it, removes the straps securing his red box and heads into the building, preparing for his statement.“Both sides are at fault,” he might intone, perhaps reading out an email he had received from Brenda in Norwich, affirming her desire to see peace talks without preconditions. “I oppose all forms of war,” he might have told MPs. But some more than others, he would have been careful not to add.Now, there are no doubt those of Boris Johnson’s critics who regard the above scenario as preferable to, or at least the equivalence of, a couple of legally dubious parties in the Downing Street garden. As the scale of Russian aggression and anti-democratic actions become more apparent, however, Britons should be careful. December 2019 represented a lucky escape for our country, whatever you may think of the victor that night or since.The installation of Corbyn in Number 10 would not just have been disastrous for Britain far worse than that, it would have been an undeserved, key victory for Putin and his mafiocracy in Moscow. What is happening in Ukraine is serious, grown-up politics, and concerns about drinks parties and even Brexit pale into insignificance in the fight against corrupt autocracies that view their neighbours’ territory with envious eyes.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Liz Truss says \u0026#39nothing is off the table\u0026#39 as G7 plots more sanctionsAnthony Blinken cancels meeting with Sergei Lavrov over Russian moves on UkraineWhy Vladimir Putin is obsessed with UkraineDonald Trump hails Vladimir Putin as a \u0026#39genius\u0026#39 over Russia\u0026#39s invasion of UkraineGunman takes hostages at Apple store in Amsterdam Russian oligarch hit with sanctions \u0026#39trained with Vladimir Putin at elite KGB spy academy\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"three pictures tell us putin power","story":"There are plenty of mysteries surrounding the character, history and motivations of Vladimir Putin but, over the 23 years he’s spent as a world leader, we have at least grown used to one unassailable fact: nothing he does is accidental. The weightlifting videos, the military exercises, the horseback-riding without a shirt – everything the Russian president presents to the world is about image, and the messages aren’t subtle. In fact, subtlety would be a waste – he’s a drama queen at heart. It has never seemed coincidental that Vladislav Surkov, one of the founding fathers of Putinism and once a key figure within the administration, trained as a theatre director until he was sacked for fighting. The plots aren’t always tight, but they’re certainly tense. In recent days, as photos of Putin holding failed meetings to discuss the Ukraine crisis have held front pages around the globe, the image-making has been as intentional as ever. Sometimes it’s in the little details, sometimes it’s hidden in the backdrop, sometimes it’s in the massive, massive table, but every image tells us a little more about his grip on power. Vladimir Putin has a lot of rooms he could use for meetings (there are 700 in the Kremlin Grand Palace alone), and everybody present at Monday’s gathering of top security officials could easily have squeezed into the usual cabinet room. As it was, he convened them in the vast, grandiloquent Hall of the Order of St Catherine.It could be a hygiene precaution for the deeply Covid-phobic leader, but unlike Emmanuel Macron or Olaf Scholz, it seems unlikely those in the room wouldn’t have acquiesced to a PCR, so this was all about the photo-op in the former throne room of the Russian Empresses.  In the past it has also been the venue for Thatcher meeting Gorbachov, Nixon meeting Brezhnev, and Putin\u0027s annexing of Crimea. Usually, it is used for peaceful state receptions, occasional press conferences and high-profile international negotiations. Not internal matters and definitely not with the bizarre seating arrangement of Monday’s meeting. This was classic Putin set-dressing. Why are all these senior officials in the Russian government – including the spy chief and iniduals with decades of loyalty to Putin – arranged like the audition scene from The Producers? The answer, of course, is for maximum pressure and pantomime – making it crystal clear that this may be a government in name, but only one man is calling the shots. Yesterday morning, footage of Putin rendering Sergei Naryshkin, chief of Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service, a quivering wreck by barking at him across this echoing hall in front of his peers, went viral. Putin would be absolutely delighted with that result.As any action movie auteur could tell you, there is no allegory for urgency quite like a literal close up of a ticking clock. And in this meeting, Putin took off his (potentially Blancpain Grande Date Aqua Lung, a favourite from his luxury collection) wristwatch part way through, and placed it in front of him as you might in a GCSE exam. This is a man famous for being hours late, who lets meetings run on half the night, and is occasionally accused of editing footage to fit a more convenient time-frame – like yesterday, when some onlookers noticed the watches of those in attendance didn’t always line up with the reported time. The message? Chop chop, people, I have things to do. Later in the night, we found out what...There are a few standout things to notice about the office from which Putin gave his lengthy televised address on Monday night. The totally blank desk, the screensaver showing the outside of the very building he’s in (no offence intended, anybody whose lockscreen is their own house), the menacing white button that may or may not be connected to his nuclear arsenal. Is that a lesser-spotted Amstrad ‘e-mailer’ phone in front of the computer? What is that massive television monitor next to his PC for – watching the History Channel’s Ice Road Truckers while pretending to work? When saying something terrifying, like declaring an invasion, it’s good to offer distractions.Despite being a former spy, Putin is also an inveterate technophobe, who reportedly hates mobile phones and computers, preferring briefing folders, secure landlines and pen and paper. It was said that eight years ago, when US agencies attempted to figure out what was going on inside his camp during Russia’s takeover of Crimea, they were met by nothing but silence. Nothing to listen in on, nothing to intercept, nothing to give the game away.What we didn’t know was that he liked old-fashioned phones so much as to have three on his desk, including one with only one button in the middle, and what looks like Dr Dre’s mixing desk underneath them all. “Does President Putin run his own switchboard?” comedian David Mitchell asked on Twitter yesterday. Well, does he?It’s difficult to imagine Putin tending to this pair of pot plants, which look like they may belong to the dieffenbachia family and stand awkwardly in an otherwise devastatingly lifeless room, but he is a lover of the natural world, and may have even insisted on their appointment to that eminent corner of the room behind his bank of phones. Once, he even wrote that he likes “events in which fauna take part”. Nicholas II had Rasputin Putin has these two. This isn’t a tried and tested theory, but could it be that, over the past two decades, Vladimir Putin has attempted to match the growth of Russia with an equally rapacious and worrying expansion of his own face via the medium of industrial-strength fillers? Photographs of him in 1998 look like a different man. He is nothing if not committed to visual metaphors.Much has been made of Putin’s shuffleboard table diplomacy. Last week’s meeting with Emmanuel Macron, which might as well have been conducted on Zoom as they were effectively sitting in different countries, resulted in a vast international effort – to create memes. And here he is again, at his usual cabinet table, making absolutely sure that foreign minister Sergey Lavrov couldn’t touch him with a bargepole, let alone any accidental spittle.Putin, projecting his Tsarist side as ever, is at the head of the table, with Lavrov, who has been in his post since 2004, stuck down one side, only just fitting into frame. Putin is cautiously distant from even his most loyal subjects this is not a man with deputies as we understand it. As the saying goes, keep your friends really far away, and your enemies even further. In Britain, Henry the Hoover manages to creep into any room he wishes – nobody questions that little suck-up’s face. In Russia it appears his counterpart is a mysterious white appliance on wheels – could it be a two-bar heater? An emergency trouser press? A defibrillator, for if the tension all gets a bit much? It was there behind Putin at the Macron meeting, and now here it is again, lurking beside a small side table, pumping out hot air or poison or Dettol or nothing. Always consistent, you will notice this (quite uncomfortable-looking, and presumably low-slung, given he is 5ft 7ins) style of chair in almost all Putin’s Kremlin photographs. It may not be the same one, but we do know he is a creature of habit.When he became prime minister and allowed Dmitry Medvedev to be president from 2008 to 2012, Putin reportedly kept sitting in his same old chair, on the left of the president’s office, while Medvedev took the right, usually reserved for guests. A first photograph of the pair meeting to discuss the cabinet sent a clear signal to world leaders and investors alike: the boss might be different, but the chairman’s the same.Is it possible that these random, chunky coloured buttons in the foreground don’t do something nefarious? Sure, they probably turn on the air con. But do the Kremlin photographers, and by extension Putin himself, know we will ask the question? Also yes. It’s all about perception.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Liz Truss says \u0026#39nothing is off the table\u0026#39 as G7 plots more sanctionsAnthony Blinken cancels meeting with Sergei Lavrov over Russian moves on UkraineWhy Vladimir Putin is obsessed with UkraineDonald Trump hails Vladimir Putin as a \u0026#39genius\u0026#39 over Russia\u0026#39s invasion of UkraineGunman takes hostages at Apple store in Amsterdam Russian oligarch hit with sanctions \u0026#39trained with Vladimir Putin at elite KGB spy academy\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"wuhan lab leak believed behind closed doors likeliest origin","story":"A lab leak in Wuhan, China, is now considered the most likely origin of the Covid pandemic “behind closed doors” in the Government, it has been claimed, after Boris Johnson signalled that security measures would be enhanced to prevent accidental escape.On Monday, the Prime Minister told the House of Commons that the UK biosecurity strategy would be refreshed to protect against “natural zoonosis and laboratory leaks”, in a public acknowledgement of the threat from insecure research facilities.There is mounting suspicion that Covid-19 leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology which had been collecting and experimenting on dangerous bat coronaviruses in the years before the virus first emerged in the city.The Government has asked for evidence before drafting a new biosecurity strategy, which will deal with “accidental release and dual-use research of concern, where life science research is capable of being misapplied to do harm”.Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, an expert on chemical and biological counter-terrorism and former British Army officer, has submitted evidence for the strategy. “There is a huge amount of concern about coming out publicly, but behind closed doors most people think it’s a lab leak. And they are coming round to the fact that even if they don’t agree with that, they must accept it’s likely, and they must make sure the policies are in place to stop it.”He added: “My view, that I’ve put to the Government already, is that we cannot afford emotionally, physically or financially, to go through another pandemic. We must now get on the front foot.”Lab leaks are fairly common, with smallpox, swine flu, anthrax, foot and mouth disease, and the original Sars virus all known to have escaped from facilities in recent decades. In Britain, there have been more than 100 safety breaches at labs handling dangerous pathogens over the past 15 years. Colonel De Bretton-Gordon, who was formerly the commanding officer of the UK’s Joint Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Regiment, said that current biosecurity was “in a shocking state” with little regulation or monitoring.He believes it is time to revamp and reinvest in the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, an international treaty ratified by 22 states in 1975, but which is underfunded and has no policing system.Biosurveillance systems, which can quickly detect pathogens in the air, could also be installed in train stations and airports. They are already being developed in Britain.“If we had all our biolabs networked with a surveillance system, we could detect a lab leak as soon as it happened,” said Colonel De Bretton-Gordon.“If you’d had detectors at stations and airports in Wuhan, you could have prevented about four million journeys in that first week. With that kind of system, you could stop a lab leak turning into an epidemic, turning into a pandemic.“My big concern is that next time it might not be an accident, because it’s easy to do. If you had no morals and no scruples, why not infect your enemy?”Last year, the House of Lords risk assessment and risk planning committee warned that backstreet laboratories around the world are capable of creating a biohazard that could spark a pandemic as deadly as Covid-19.The comments followed evidence showing that labs in China and the US were manipulating coronaviruses before the pandemic to make them more infectious to humans in so-called “gain of function” experiments.Earlier in February, an early version of Covid-19 that appeared to have been grown in a laboratory was discovered in samples from a Chinese biotechnology firm.The variant has mutations that bridge the gap between bat coronavirus and the earliest Wuhan strain, so it may be an ancestral version of the virus. The samples also contain DNA from hamsters and monkeys, suggesting that the early virus may have been grown in animal cell lines.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Liz Truss says \u0026#39nothing is off the table\u0026#39 as G7 plots more sanctionsAnthony Blinken cancels meeting with Sergei Lavrov over Russian moves on UkraineWhy Vladimir Putin is obsessed with UkraineDonald Trump hails Vladimir Putin as a \u0026#39genius\u0026#39 over Russia\u0026#39s invasion of UkraineGunman takes hostages at Apple store in Amsterdam Russian oligarch hit with sanctions \u0026#39trained with Vladimir Putin at elite KGB spy academy\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid rule changes set announced","story":"All the Covid rule changes set to be announced by Boris Johnson TODAY as isolation axedCovid isolation rule changes and the date free lateral flow and PCR tests will be axed are likely in Boris Johnson’s ‘living with Covid’ plan, due to be published today.

The Prime Minister is expected to scrap all self-isolation, even for people who have the virus, from around Thursday. He is also likely to confirm the date free lateral flow and PCR tests will be axed - although is not expected to actually happen this week. The £ self-isolation payment for low-income workers and legal powers for councils both face being scrapped. And the Mirror understands he was weighing up whether to axe sick pay from day one of Covid isolation, despite fury from unions and Labour. Scroll down for the full guide to the changes - or join the debate in the commentsFor holidaymakers, Passenger Locator Forms could be simplied further, or even scrapped completelyTransport Secretary Grant Shapps gets his way.Travel testing, however, is likely to stay for unvaccinated people entering the UK for the foreseeable future. Mr Johnson is likely to give a statement to Parliament at around .pm on Monday. He could also give a press conference. Facing pressure from Tory MPs over his leadership, the PM has decided Britain has had all the restrictions it can tolerate. Speaking before his announcement on Monday, the Prime Minister said: Today will mark a moment of pride after one of the most dficult periods in our countryaposs history as we begin to learn to live with Covid. It would not be possible without the efforts of so many - the NHS who delivered the le-saving vaccine rollout at phenomenal speed, our world-leading scientists and experts, and the general public for their commitment to protecting themselves and their loved ones. The pandemic is not over but thanks to the incredible vaccine rollout we are now one step closer towards ato normality and finally giving people back their freedoms while continuing to protect ourselves and others.It comes after ministers confirmed all children over five will be able to get the Covid vaccine from April. But charities worry millions of vulnerable or immunocompromised Brits will be thrown to the wolves with little support.And the governmentaposs own scientic advisors have warned ending testing and isolation could trigger a rapid rise in cases. Here’s everything we know about what is likely to be announced.Self-isolation laws scrappedLegal Covid self-isolation is due to be scrapped - evenyou currently have the virus - from as soon as Thursday  February. The decision will end almost exactly two years of legally-enforced isolation for people who test positive. But it raises ethical dilemmas about whether to go to work and put others at risk, especiallyyou can no longer claim a £ isolation payment or sick pay from day one . Despite scrapping legal isolation, No said: “We’re not saying isolation is pointless. We’d expect anyone with an infectious disease to take steps not to spread that disease further - a colleague at work with flu, for example. Currently people who test positive must go into self-isolation for at least five full days in England, a period that has been repeatedly cut from  days and seven days. Fears Statutory Sick Pay will be stripped back Boris Johnson has been weighing up whether to scrap sick pay from day one of Covid illness, the Mirror understands.£.-a-week Statutory Sick Payis usually only available from the fourth day of any illness, after three ‘waiting days’ are complete. This was cut to the first day in  for people isolating due to Covid. Ministers said the move was “vital” to ensure people get help and follow the rules.But the power is contained in the Coronavirus Act, which is currently due to expire on March .That means it could be removed, even though No has advised people who are sick with the virus to stay away from work. TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said: “It’s vital that sick pay remains a day one right and is made available to all. Workers who are laid low by Covid must be able to make ends meet – not pushed into financial hardship.”A date for scrapping free lateral flow testsBoris Johnson’s plan is expected to set a timetable for the end of free lateral flow tests, with people having to pay instead.The government warned last summer it would eventually stop paying for these rapid tests due to the huge cost of the NHS.Sources told the Mirror that claims the tests themselves will end this week are wide of the mark. However, the Living with Covid plan could set a date in the future for when they are cut off. It’s not known how much lateral flow tests will cost, but estimates have put it at £ for a pack of seven. A date for scrapping free PCR tests and Test and TraceIt’s thought the plan may contain a date for ending free ‘gold standard’ PCR tests as England’s Covid infrastructure is wound down. Whitehall sources told thethe Treasury is trying to cut the £bn-a-year cost, which will mean having to phase out free testing and all but ending the contact-tracing system. Scientists have raised the alarm about ending these free tests, with reports suggesting they could cost £ each privately. According to reports, only health and social care workers and .million vulnerable people will continue to get free PCRs. Prof Lawrence Young of Warwick University said: “Living with Covid doesn’t mean letting our guard down”. Covid travel Passenger Locator Form could be simplied or axed Fully-vaccinated people entering the UK do not need to take any Covid tests, under changes that happened on February . But they still need to fill in a Passenger Locator Form - albeit a ‘simplied’ one - and further changes to this are possible in this week’s Covid plan. It’s understood the Department for Transport was pressing to further simply the Passenger Locator Form - or get rid of it completely. It is thought there was only a slim chance of the form being axed altogether, as health officials were still worried about needing to track new iants coming in to the UK. Meanwhile, unvaccinated people still need to take one pre-departure test and one post-arrival test before entering the UK. It’s understood this rule will stay for the foreseeable future and no changes to it are due this week. £ self-isolation payment could be scrappedThe £ self-isolation payment for poor workers with Covid could end as the legal requirement to quarantine is scrapped. The Test and Trace Support Payment was introduced in September  to help low-wage workers afford to self-isolate for up to  days. No final decisions have been announced yet over the future of the £ payment, and its status was being considered by the government last week.  Legal powers for councils will goLegal changes will end remaining powers councils had under the  Coronavirus Act in England to close some venues. However, these powers were barely ever used, because powers for lockdowns flow from a separate law passed in . And the vast majority of Coronavirus Act powers - including on detention, events, gatherings, shops and restaurants and schools - already expired in September . Only a few of the more draconian powers - including the power to suspend port operations - remained in the Act. Vaccines for all children over five All children over five will be able to get vaccinated against Covid- from April. The “non-urgent offer” to the parents of nearly six million - year olds was confirmed by the Government moments after advice issued by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation . Two smaller doses of the Pfizer jab,  weeks apart, will be available to this age group to help control future Covid waves after Covid curbs have been lted. It is understood there are no plans for a major publicity drive to encourage this age group to be vaccinated and it will be left very much up to parents to decide. Itaposs understood a rollout for over-s will be less urgent than previous vaccine drives, due to the very low risk Covid poses to younger kids. The idea is that ordinary NHS care shouldn’t be interrupted to give kids the jab, like it was for adults. All children over  have been able to get the Pfizer Covid jab since September last year. Currently, only the most vulnerable kids aged  to  are eligible. They are offered two jabs but at a lower dose than for adults -  micrograms instead of .

The Government has accepted an amendment to the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, which will see the  Vagrancy Act repealed. It follows a drive by homelessness charity Crisis to get rid of the dated law, which makes it illegal to sleep rough or beg. Campaigners have long argued the legislation forces homeless people in England and Wales away from help and into the criminal justice system. Matt Downie, Chief Executive of Crisis, said: “For almost two hundred years, the criminalisation of homelessness has shamed our society. But now, at long last, the Vagrancy Act’s days are numbered and not a moment too soon. “This offensive law does nothing to tackle rough sleeping, only entrenching it further in our society by driving people further from support. We know there are better, more effective ways to help people overcome their homelessness. “We thank the UK government for using the policing bill to finally consign this appalling act to history, where it belongs. We look forward to working with them to finish the job without delay and ensure the criminalisation of destitution is over.  “We are immensely grateful for the tireless work of Peers and MPs from across parties, as well as every Crisis supporter who has got behind our Scrap the Act campaign, who have all brought us to this historic moment.” Former Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick has been among those campaigning for the end of the Act. He said: This long overdue reform will reframe the issue of homelessness away from it being a question of criminality, and towards our modern understanding of homelessness as a complex health, housing and social challenge. The Vagrancy Act is an archaic piece of legislation which creates a wholly unnecessary obstacle that homeless people must overcome in order to rebuild their lives. I welcome the action that is now being taken to put repeal into law and I urge the government to continue to work with charities, including Crisis, on the detail of its implementation.” Lib Dem MP Layla Moran, said: “After years of campaigning I am elated that we consigned this archaic and cruel law to history. No one should be criminalised for sleeping rough, especially by a piece of legislation passed in the Georgian era. “This is testament to the hard work of so many people: the students who first brought the issue to my attention, and to our campaign partners Crisis.Rough Sleeping and Housing Minister Eddie Hughes, said: “The Vagrancy Act is outdated and needs replacing, and so I’m delighted to announce the government will repeal it in full. “This is the next step of our action, which has already driven a % drop in rough sleeping since  and we will build on this with a strategy setting out how we will end rough sleeping for good, support vulnerable people off the streets and continue to protect communities from crime and antisocial behaviour.

However, several cabinet ministers opposed the proposalsJacob Rees-Mogg is said to have argued the Government should not be limiting personal choice Image: REUTERSByNada FarhoudEnvironment editor:,  Feb |comments Measures to ban imports of cruel fur and foie gras are being opposed by Jacob Rees-Mogg and other top Tories.The plans were due to be included in the forthcoming Animals Abroad Bill. But several Cabinet ministers have opposed the proposals. Brexit Opportunities Minister Jacob Rees-Mogg is said to have argued the Government should not be limiting personal choice. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace also raised concerns last year about using faux bear fur in hats worn by Guardsmen.Animal Welfare Minister Lord Goldsmith has previously said the bans would be made law at “the earliest possible slot”.  But sources in his department reportedly said: “The MoD is refusing to compromise on this. Wallace is believed to be very anti-change.” Animal campaigners have condemned moves to scrap the ban. TV presenter Chris Packham said abandoning plans would be an “appalling betrayal of animals who desperately need a kind nation to defend them”. Claire Bass, of Humane Society ­International UK, said: “The vast majority of the public fully support these bans, to send a global message we won’t be complicit in the suffering of millions of animals for cruel, unnecessary products. “We urge the Government to base its policy on public opinion and evidence, not the whims and fancies of one or two out-of-touch ministers.”  Conor Jackson, founder of Open Cages, said: “Thanks to them protecting our ‘personal choice’, we will soon be justying pretty much any cruelty.” Abigail Penny, of Animal Equality UK, added: “Backtracking on a ban would be the ultimate betrayal of animals and the British public.” Since the Mirror launched the Fur Free Britain campaign with Humane Society International UK in July , we have revealed horric cases of fur farms abroad. An investigation in Finland’s Ostrobothnia region found tiny cages full of helpless, sick foxes. Since banning fur farming in , the UK has imported fur worth more than £million.

We are also ready to impose swt and severe consequences should Russia instead choose war. The Kremlin said that Russian President Vladimir Putin and Mr Biden could set up a call or meeting at any time but there were no firm plans yet for a summit.  It comes following a flurry of late-night calls between French President Emmanuel Macron and Mr Putin. Mr Macronaposs office and the White House said details of a possible summit could be hammered out during a meeting on Thursday between US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. The development offers a glimmer of hope of a diplomatic solution but Western leaders still fear a Russian invasion of Ukraine could be imminent.More than , Russian troops are massed around Ukraineaposs borders, according to US estimates, with , along the countryaposs eastern flank and tens of thousands alongside Belarusian troops in the north.Fears have been mounting that Russia will stage  flag attacks to justy further aggression against Ukraine. A UK source told the Mirror that they believed an invasion was going to happen in the next  to  hours.  Boris Johnson warned at the weekend that Europe could be on the brink of the biggest war since  as he travelled to Munich for a crunch security conference.In a call with Mr Macron on Sunday night, the Prime Minister welcomed the prospect of a diplomatic solution and urged Mr Putin to step back from his current threats and withdraw troops from Ukraine’s border. A No spokesperson said: “The Prime Minister noted that President Putin’s commitments to President Macron were a welcome sign that he might still be willing to engage in finding a diplomatic solution. The Prime Minister stressed that Ukraine’s voice must be central in any discussions.

Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper demanded much stronger action against illicit financeKeir Starmer called for an end to oligarch impunity Image: SKYByBen GlazeDeputy Political Editor:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |commentsFurious MPs demanded an end to the London “laundromat” which allows “dirty Russian” cash to flow through the City today after Vladimir Putin’s troops invaded Ukraine. Boris Johnson announced sanctions against three billionaire oligarchs and five banks in retaliation for Kremlin forces launching action in the breakaway regions of Luhansk and Donetsk.The Prime Minister told the Commons: “Any assets they hold in the UK will be frozen, the iniduals concerned will be banned from travelling here, and we will prohibit all UK iniduals and entities from having any dealings with them. “This is the first tranche, the first barrage, of what we are prepared to do.“We will hold further sanctions at readiness, to be deployed alongside the United States and the European Unionthe situation escalates still further.” Critics blasted the move after it emerged the oligarch trio have been on a US sanctions list since  - meaning it is unlikely many UK businesses have dealings with them. Mr Johnson insisted the Government would “be bringing forward further measures to hit Russian iniduals and Russian companies of strategic importance to Russia, stopping Russian companies from raising money on London markets and stopping them even trading in pounds and dollars”. Keir Starmer said: “We have failed to stop the flow of illicit Russian finance into Britain.” Calling for the invasion to be “a turning point”, the Labour leader added: “We need an end to oligarch impunity, we need to draw a line under Companies House providing easy cover for shell companies, we need to ensure that our anti-money-laundering laws are enforced.” Former Treasury Minister Dame Angela Eagle questioned whether the sanctions would “close down the so-called London laundromat which is laundering dirty Russian money straight through the City”. MPs have become increasingly frustrated at the failure to crackdown Russia on cash swirling around the capital. Mega-rich, Kremlin-linked tycoons have bought multi-million-pound mansions in London and country estates in Surrey, sending their children to elite boarding schools. Ministers have repeatedly been accused of turning a blind eye or even encouraging them because of the funds they pump into the UK economy.  MPs on Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee published a damning report in July  accusing successive governments of paving the way for Russian funds to infiltrate Britain. “It would appear that the UK has been viewed as a particularly favourable destination for Russian oligarchs and their money,” the -page study said. “The UK welcomed Russian money, and few questions –any – were asked about the provenance of this considerable wealth.” Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper tonight said Britain had become a “centre for illicit finance that reality discredits us in the eyes of the world”. She demanded “much stronger action against illicit finance in the City of London, and the way in which - not just Russian money and illegal money, including money from organised crime in other countries - it’s possible to launder that money in the UK because there just aren’t strong enough checks in place”. Former Foreign Office Minister Chris Bryant, who chairs the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Russia, fumed: “We have to close the dirty Russian money down.” Exeter University academic Tena Prelec, part of a research team investigating international kleptocracy, said: “Our research shows elite iniduals from post-Soviet states are laundering their wealth and reputations in the UK, knowingly and willingly supported by a network of British professionals.  “The UK remains a safe haven for dirty money, a great deal of which comes from Russia and Eurasia. “Failure to tackle this thriving billion-dollar industry is damaging for the UK’s rule of law and to the UK’s professed role as an opponent of international corruption.” Campaigner Bill Browder, the head of Global Magnitsky Justice campaign, branded the Government’s sanctions “pretty tepid”. He added: “We should be going after the  oligarchs who look after Putin’s money.”  He said: “We don’t have a beef with the Russian people, we have a beef with Vladimir Putin and the oligarchs who support him and the oligarchs who look after his money. “We don’t have to punish the entire Russian population at this stage of the game - we should be going after the  oligarchs who look after Putin’s money. “Putin is one of the richest men in the world, he’s stolen an enormous amount of money over the last  years, and he doesn’t hold that money in his own name, he has other people holding it for him - his oligarch trustees. “It’s pretty straightforward,we were to sanction the  oligarch trustees who hold Putin’s money and their family members in the UK, he wouldn’t invade Ukraine.“We know exactly who they are, Boris Johnson knows who they are, the Foreign Office knows who they are, the Home Office knows who they are, I know who they are. “It’s all just a question of political will - does the Government want to actually stop a war  Or do they just want to seem to be reacting to this ” Royal United Services Institute think-tank financial and security expert Tom Keatinge said of the UK sanctions: Weaposve taken a peashooter to a gunfight. “It doesnapost make any sense to me at all, the whole point of the sanctions has been to deter Putin andat the first chance you get to use these sanctions you only tickle his feet, whataposs the point  “If we ever had the upper hand, weaposve lost it today. Meanwhile, calls mounted for Russia to be stripped of the UEFA Champions League final.St Petersburg is due to host the European club game’s showpiece event in May. But Mr Johnson told MPs it was “inconceivable” Russia could now stage major sporting fixtures. There was “no chance” of holding football tournaments in a Russia that “invades sovereign countries”, he told MPs.

Its p spaghetti is, like the proleration of food banks in the UK, a treatment of the symptom of poverty.We need to address the cause. The responsibility for the welfare and wellbeing of our most vulnerable citizens should not rest on the shoulders of charities, nor supermarkets. It’s easy to paint the large ­corporations as the villains, but questions need to be asked as to why people need p spaghetti and p pasta to survive in one of the richest economies in the world.  And the answers lie squarely at the well-heeled feet of those who have held the purse strings and policies of the country for the last  long and dismal years. Those years of austerity cuts to social care and health services mean the safety net of a decent and supportive society is less than threadbare. The triple threat of rocketing food prices, unmanageable energy bills, and an underfunded National Health Service is going to cause long-term damage to families, communities, and ­iniduals in almost every ­neighbourhood in the country. Every area now has at least one foodbank we live in a society where people need the ad-hoc macro philanthropy of neighbours and strangers to not starve to death.  Over the last two years of the pandemic, the Chancellor has proven time and again that he can magic up a whole orchard of flourishing and evergreen money trees when it comes to propping up his pet projects. Writing off £.billion of furlough fraud, £.billion “lost” down the back of the Downing Street couch, supposedly spent on PPE nobody has any record of, not even the company that received the payment. That money alone could have paid for TWO YEARS of the continuation of the £ uplt to Universal Credit. Somehow there is always money for crony contracts, Parliamentary p*ss-ups, weaponry and warfare, and DWP cover-ups, because it comes at the expense of social care, school dinners, and starving pensioners. So while I welcome the ­reappearance of budget groceries on the supermarket shelves as an ­immediate-term relief for millions of people struggling to make ends meet, and while I will continue to write recipes for p a head and publish them for free on my website, I’m determined that we work towards building a world where neither of those things are essential any more.

The three oligarchs - who Mr Johnson described as very close to the Putin regime” and cronies of the Russian President - are Gennady Timchenko, Boris Rotenberg and his brother Igor Rotenberg. Boris Johnson told Parliament: Any assets they hold in the UK will be frozen, the iniduals concerned will be banned from travelling here, and we will prohibit all UK iniduals and entities from having any dealings with them.But what do the sanctions mean for the UK  Here is all you need to know. Are British troops going to be sent to Ukraine No. One of Vladimir Putin’s excuses for invading is because he fears Ukraine will one day be accepted into NATO. But it is not currently part of the -nation military alliance and therefore is not protected by its Article V clause on collective defence - that an attack on one is an attack on all. Dozens of UK forces had been deployed in Ukraine since  on Operation Orbital - a training mission to help local troops. They withdrew earlier this month as tensions mounted. However, the UK has bolstered troop numbers in Estonia, which is a NATO member and which also feels threatened by Russian aggression.Will petrol and gas prices rise  Almost certainly. While the UK buys just % of its gas from Russia, Britain is exposed to price volatility on the international market. If Moscow restricts supply, countries which buy Russia’s gas will have to look where - pushing up prices for everyone. Oil prices usually climb when there is any global tension. The cost of a barrel of Brent crude - the world benchmark - hit nearly  yesterday, which could soon hike pump prices for British motorists. Experts warned unleaded could reach £. a litre. Boris Johnson told MPs: “One of the risks of Putin’s venture is there could be a spike in gas prices, in oil prices.”  What are these sanctions  The PM announced sanctions against five Russian banks and three iniduals described as Putin allies. The banks are: Promsvyazbank, Bank Rossiya, IS Bank, Black Sea Bank for Development and Reconstruction and General Bank. Three billionaire oligarchs were also hit: Gennady Timchenko, Boris Rotenberg, and Igor Rotenberg. The PM told the Commons: “Any assets they hold in the UK will be frozen, the iniduals concerned will be banned from travelling here, and we will prohibit all UK iniduals and entities from having any dealings with them.” Is that it A Western official admitted it was “a relatively small but very high value number of Russian oligarchs”. They stressed more sanctions could follow, adding there was a “clear declaration of intent to go further as Russia makes any further incursion into Ukraine”. Russian MPs in the Duma who voted to recognise the breakaway regions of Luhansk and Donetsk also face being sanctioned. The PM insisted of the sanctions announced: “This is the first tranche, the first barrage, of what we are prepared to do. We will hold further sanctions at readiness, to be deployed alongside the United States and the European Unionthe situation escalates still further.”What about Roman Abramovich  Not for the first time, Boris Johnson got his facts wrong and sowed confusion when addressing MPs by incorrectly claiming that Cha FC owner Roman Abramovich was facing sanctions. The PM’s spokesman later admitted Mr Johnson misspoke. An official indicated No is expected to correct the record. It is thought the PM became confused over issues the oligarch had around his entrepreneurial visa in . Last October, the businessmanaposs spokesman confirmed he travelled to London as an Israeli citizen - entering the United Kingdom without the need for a visa.

If today, you were constructing the best model for a European trade organisation, would it resemble the bloated, bureaucratic, monolith run by unelected, mediocre, pro-German civil servants called the EU  And more than half the country, predominantly older people staunchly proud of Britain’s history and its ­constitutional monarchy, thought not. Well, I’d like to ask them,they were constructing a model British state today, would they have a Windsor at the head of it  Park this year’s fairy-tale narrative about the past seven decades being one long, glorious reign, and focus on the past few days. The heir to the throne faces a police investigation over claims his advisers fixed a CBE for a Saudi tycoon who had given a fortune to one of his charities. Charles denies any knowledge of a deal but can’t deny secretly meeting the tycoon in Saudi Arabia, welcoming him to Clarence House, and giving him the CBE at Buckingham Palace.  The Queen’s second oldest son has just agreed a reported £million payoff to a woman who claimed he raped her when she was , as a minor under US law, which he denies. In fact he denies ever meeting her. So we’re expected to believe he’s just given £million to a complete stranger. And the royals won’t denysome of his hush money comes from the Queen’s Duchy of Lancaster tax-deductible fund. Which would effectively mean taxpayers crowdfunding the Duke of York’s escape route from a child sex scandal. He still retains that title, despite York MP Rachael Maskell demanding it be removed after a poll claimed % of York citizens don’t want him shaming their city. He will also remain a Queen’s ­Counsellor of State. I can’t wait to hear how he counsels her on legislation about sex trafficking. The views of York’s citizens are deemed irrelevantbecause in our monarchical system, subjects cannot question royals. I would love to hear MPs debate the issues around Charles and Andrew, and how much, and for how long, the Queen knew of her son’s connections to his convicted paedophile friend. And the morality behind Buckingham Palace finally ordering Andrew to settle the allegations against him to save the precious Platinum Jubilee. But our elected representatives cannot mention such issues in the Commons, just as we can’t see how much royals leave in their wills, because as Parliamentary bible Erskine May states: “No question can be put which brings the name of the Sovereign or the ­influence of the Crown directly before Parliament, or which casts reflections upon the ­Sovereign or the Royal Family.” Hence why MPs are forced to take an oath of allegiance to the monarch and all their heirs. What a ludicrous, humiliating stitch-up. All to keep these accidents of birth ruling over us. And to think, most Brits believe the EU is an anti-democratic gravy train which keeps charlatans in clover, while our “democracy” is the envy of the world. I’d love to think this week will convince royalists that this family they idolise is not only not better than theirs, some of its members are far worse. And we should bin the whole feudal farce once the Queen dies. But I’d be kidding myself.

In September , Amandaaposs friends persuaded her to get a new dog, and she welcomed an Afghan hound puppy from Belgium. Daposhari was well-behaved, albeit slightly bonkers - but that helped to distract Amanda. She came just when Jamie started going really downhill, Amanda explained. Daposhari didnapost mind Amanda iding her attention between home and hospital, and the pup managed to meet Jamie a couple of times. After he tragically passed away, Amanda wanted to give up but Daposhari kept her going.  While Amanda grieved, Daposhari was by her side and would lay her weight on Amanda to comfort her.

Pippa Fulton was born a month prematurely, weighing just .lbsand with several heart conditions.Doctors tried to carry out surgical repairs when she was a day old but her heart was so small – the size of a walnut – that they were unable to complete the operation successfully. Pippa spent five months in intensive care as the team spent hours practising on a D-printed replica while waiting for her organ to grow. Pippa is now recovering at home with mum Lizzie and dad Nathan, both , after a seven-hour op. Primary school teacher Lizzie said: “To finally know she has a chance of survival and to now have brought her home at long last is incredible.

There was a real mix of emotions, from fear of someone so precious and tiny having open-heart surgery to complete relief that it was finally happening.” Surgeon Mr Viola said: “This was a very complex operation.

If you sell goods to the EU, or buy goods from the EU and bring them into the UK, you need to be able to prove that they meet the new rules of origin requirements to access preferential tarfs. It’s vital you understand the new rules to keep your business moving. To benefit from the preferential tarfs, you must have proof that any goods you import from the EU originate there, or any goods you export to the EU originate in the UK. Proof of origin can either be a statement of origin completed by the exporter, or evidence of the importer’s knowledge of where products originate. If you cannot prove the origin, you or your EU customer may be liable to pay the full rate of customs duty and could face penalties. Andrew Macleod, founder of London-based restaurant brand Emilia’s Crafted Pasta, explains that imports from the EU are vital to his brand: “We import ingredients directly from Italy, including special cured meats, cheeses, drinks and alcohol. Each of our suppliers is hand-picked.”  Has he had to make any changes to his business now that there are new import rules in place  “Yes – of course we already knew the origin of all the goods we import as we source everything carefully. But we’ve trained two of our managers on the rules around importing, so we know that we have staff in house who are well versed in the process.”  And having successfully navigated the changes, what advice would Andrew offer other businesses that import  “We found using a customs agent really helps the process run smoothly, but it’s equally important that you understand the rules yourself,” he says. “It’s not too late, and the gov.uk site has lots of valuable information.”  You must be able to prove the origin of any product you import You can choose to work with a freight forwarder or courier To benefit from preferential tarfs, you must be able to prove that any goods you import originated in the EU Note:you’re moving goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, rules of origin work dferently.

Dramatic CCTV footage showed him then jabbing food in the ready meal section of stores with a syringe during the evening of August  last year. He also threw a syringe at a doctor, but it luckily caused no injuries. Police were alerted at around .pm after a man was reported to be throwing blood-filled syringes and eggs in the three supermarkets. The three supermarkets involved - Sainsburyaposs Local, Tesco Express and Little Waitrose - had to throw away all their products as a precaution, causing nearly £, in losses. Elghareeb denies three counts of contaminating goods and two counts of assault.  It is agreed he carried out the acts, but the defence argues that he was in the legal sense, insane at the time. Prosecutor Philip Stott told the court: “In short what happened is this: in the early evening of a late summeraposs day last year, Mr Elghareeb walked down the Fulham Palace Road in West London carrying a bucket. It was filled with syringes, some of which had hypodermic needles attached. A number of those syringes were filled with blood - his own. Mr Elghareeb then entered, in turn, three supermarkets on the Fulham Palace Road - in order: they were Waitrose, Sainsburyaposs and Tesco - and he proceeded to stick those syringes in food products inside those branches of those supermarkets. “Along the way he also threw some of the syringes at people inside and outside the store including hitting a passerby on the street.”  Elghareeb is accused of assaulting Dr Meghana Kulkarni by throwing a needle at her and pushing security guard Bilal Ansari in the chest while shouting: You are all vile people and Sainsburyaposs is vile. Dr Bradley Hillier, a consultant forensic psychiatrist, told the court Elghareeb was severely psychotic at the time and could not appreciate that his actions were legally and morally wrong.

Footage of the rescue was captured by another motorist named Jen Mahony on a motorway near Leeds, after the drivers found themselves in the middle of a blizzard. The video shows four men working together to push a stranded car along the road, managing to get it moving despite the poor driving conditions.Heavy snow hit the area from am until pm, affecting public transport and roads, Leeds Live reported. The Met Office subsequently issued a yellow weather warning, stretching across Yorkshire.The Met Office said: A short period of heavy snow may cause some temporary disruption on roads, mainly across higher ground such as the Peak District.  Rain may turn to heavy snow in a few places later this morning and early this afternoon. This is most likely on roads above  metres elevation, such as across the Peak District, but also a lower likelihood to some lower elevations in Yorkshire. Some places could see - cm of slushy snow which could build up quite quickly, before conditions ease from the west this afternoon.Many cars were left stranded by the conditions described, which is why the menaposs bravery and help was sorely needed.One of the men was only wearing a t-shirt as they pushed cars down the street, helping several people get home or to the shops amidst the weather.The minor snowstorm came in the aftermath of Storm Eunice, which was quickly followed by Storm Franklin. Both storms led to widespread floods around the city too. The snowstorm dissipated into sleet showers over the weekend, but the driving conditions were still quite poor.

It is said to be in an almost pristine condition despite dating back around  million yearsResearchers carry part of the fossil Image: via REUTERSByEllie Forbes:,  Feb |comments Remains of the world’s biggest flying reptile from the Jurassic-era were unearthed on the Isle of Skye.A fossilised skeleton of the winged creature is said to be in an ‘almost pristine condition’ - despite the pterodactyl dating back around  million years. The creature, which is said to have had a wingspan of . metres and been the size of an albatross, has been given the Gaelic name Dearc sgiathanach, which translates as ‘winged reptile’.It was found at Brother’s Point, the same stretch headland on Skye’s Trotternish peninsula where fossilised dinosaur footprints made around  million years ago were discovered. The huge flying reptile is the latest in a series of signicant palaeontological finds in recent years on what has become known as ‘Scotland’s Jurassic island’. The discovery was made in  by Amelia Penny, a PHD student at the University of Edinburgh, while she was on a field trip. Scientists hailed the ‘unique specimen’ as the best-preserved skeleton of a pterosaur - the world’s first flying animals, which appeared on Earth around  million years before birds. Professor Steve Brusatte, a leading palaeontologist at the University of Edinburgh, led the  field trip and has been an adviser on the new Jurassic World blockbuster. He worked with director Colin Trevorrow and designers on the film, which will widely feature pterosaurs.  Prof Brusatte said: “This is a superlative Scottish fossil. “The preservation is amazing, far beyond any pterosaur ever found in Scotland and probably the best British skeleton found since the days of Mary Anning in the early s. “Dearc is the biggest pterosaur we know from the Jurassic period and that tells us that pterosaurs got larger much earlier than we thought, long before the Cretaceous period when they were competing with birds, and that’s hugely signicant.” Ms Penny was said to have spotted a fossilised jaw protruding from a limestone layer on a tidal . After the head of pterosaur was identied, a team led by Dugald Ross, founder of the nearby Staffin Museum carried out a painstaking operation, using diamond-tipped saws, to extract the fossil.  Natalia Jagielska, one of the researchers aiming to find out more about the Dearc’s behaviour, said: “To achieve flight, pterosaurs had hollow bones with thin bone walls, making their remains incredibly fragile and unfit to preserving for millions of years. “And yet our skeleton remains in almost pristine condition, articulated and almost complete, its sharp fish-snatching teeth still retaining a shiny enamel cover ashe were alive mere weeks ago.” Dr Nick Fraser, keeper of natural sciences at the National Museum, said: “Even in the context of the amazing palaeontological finds on Skye in recent years, this one really is remarkable. “To find and describe a specimen which is both so well-preserved and so signicant is really special and we’re delighted to add Dearc into our collection.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON University of EdinburghJurassic WorldDinosaursMuseumsDaily Mirror,callToAction:ltpgtGet weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emaillt pgt,buttonText:,contentId:,newsletterImage:https:i-prod.mirror article.ece ALTERNATES sd _AlisonHeaderFinal.png,endpointUrl:https:response.pure interface list.php,profile:Reach_Mirror,isPureNewsLetter:true,pureMailingListId:Mirror - Alisons Newsletter,isDoubleOptIn:,newsletterSiteName:Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emailInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Georgia, who lives in Halax, West Yorkshire, with her nurse mum, Katie, , football coach dad, Richard, , and sister Rebecca, , said: “I was leaning on a table when I realised my right side felt a bit uncomfortable and when I looked to see why, I saw the tiniest little bump. “It only felt sore and looked red, so I looked to seeanything had irritated it and showed it to my mum, who is a nurse. “We thought we’d keep an eye on it, but then it started to grow so fast it was five times bigger in just two months, so we went to see the doctor.”  The GP suspected the lump had resulted from damaging the bone in the area and asked Georgiashe had done anything that could have injured one of her ribs. The only thing she could come up with that could cause such an injury was her ice skating. She said: “The only thing I could think of was ice skating, because I was going every Saturday. I skated with my friends, but I’d also been on a rollercoaster, so wonderedthat had caused some damage without me realising it.” Told by the doctor to come backthe pain worsened, two months later - a few weeks before her th birthday - she ed and was sent to the hospital in Huddersfield for tests and scans. When her results looked fine, she settled into revising for her upcoming GCSEs and booked into an adventure programme as a treat when her exams finished. But when she prepared to take part in the National Citizen Serviceprogramme in the summer of  she realised something was very wrong.  She said: “I was trying to put a safety harness on to do one of the activities and I couldn’t because the lump was just too big and it was too painful. “It was now the size of an orange. I knew that wasn’t right and that it wasn’t getting better on its own. Following the negative results from the hospital, when she saw her GP once more, they were concerned in case Georgia had broken a rib. But she had no memory of any injury that could have caused such a dramatic lump. Worried, her mum asked a doctor colleague who is a bone specialist to take a look at Georgia, who had started college and is studying for A Levels in law, criminology and health and social care. By the end of that same day the teenager and her family were given the devastating news that the lump was in fact a tumour. Georgia said: “My mum came to find me in the hospital and said, aposI think we’d better go home.apos I knew she should have been working until later that evening, so I asked her to tell me there and then what the doctor had said. “She told me he thought it was tumour. I burst into tears. I didn’t know what that meant.”  Sent for more scans at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, soon they had a complete picture. She said: “I remember being with my mum and my granddad in the waiting room and watching people walking down the corridor. You can tell who had been given good news and who must have been given bad news, because you could see they were really upset. “We went into a room to get the results of the biopsy and the first thing I saw was that the nurse was wearing a lanyard that said ‘Macmillan Nurse.’ The doctor then told us they were  per cent sure my lump was cancer.” According to the Teenage Cancer Trust charity, every day in the UK seven young people aged between  and  are told they have cancer. And for most, like Georgia, because they are so young, the diagnosis comes as a complete shock, because the thought of having cancer has never crossed their minds. She said: “I asked the doctors, aposAm I going to die apos I was in tears and just asked, aposIs it bad apos” The doctors told Georgia and her family they could not confirm anything until she had a biopsy. And in January  - nearly a year since she first discovered the small red lump on her right ribcage - she was told she had a grade two to three osteosarcoma, which is a type of cancer that starts in the cells that make up bone. On January  , she started seven cycles of chemotherapy, which was followed by major and painful surgery in May  to remove the tumour. Then, at the end of July, she was scheduled to have seven further rounds of chemo, but stopped after five, as her body could not tolerate any more. “I tried to keep up my college work, but the chemotherapy made me too tired and the second lot was even worse than the first, so I had to stop,” she said. After spending most of the  lockdowns in treatment, Georgia is now cancer-free. She has a scan every two months to monitor her condition, but says that while her outlook is good, she continues to worry in case the cancer s.  She said: “It is a constant in my le, so however much I’d like it to go away, it is always there and I think about it every day. After ing to college in September  and restarting her A level course, she now plans to train as a specialist cancer nurse, so that she can eventually help people in the same way she was helped through her own treatment. “The Teenage Cancer Trust and the doctors and nurses all supported me and my family. I now want to train so I can give something back,” she said. Recognising that her own experience and fears that her cancer couldhave changed her le for good, she is determined to make the most of every opportunity. She said: “I have learned you only get one shot at le, so now I’ll go for opportunities that I would have been too scared to try for before. “For example, I recently got a job at McDonalds which doesn’t sound like a lot, but I never thought I’d have the courage to go for something like that. Before I had cancer, I’d have been too nervous. “It is still dficult talking about how hard it is to go through cancer, especially as a young person, but I’ve met some amazing people because of it who will be friends for le.And I would say to any other young person who is diagnosed with cancer. aposYes, itaposs scary, but there is so much fantastic support out there for you and your family and they will help you through this. “Also,you are worried, then remember you know your body better than anyone , soyou have a feeling something is wrong, ask for help and don’t stop until you get it.

Praising fathers for taking time off work to “get to know” their babies, she spoke of the universal struggle of parenthood where even the most well-educated can struggle to ask for help. During a visit to Børnemuseet, the Children’s Museum in Frederiksberg, Denmark, to hear about the “Understanding Your Baby Project”, the Duchess said there should be just as much discussion about the social and emotional development of young children as their physical milestones.  After meeting with two eight-month-old baby boys and their parents, she joked: “It makes me very broody. “William always worries about me meeting under one-year-olds. I come home saying ‘let’s have another one’.”The Duchess spent time with three Danish health visitors, who told her about their system of continued care for families from pregnancy.They visit seven times in the first year, and have all been trained to teach parents how to boost their baby’s social development through eye contact, chatting and play. “Do you feel there is an awareness of social and emotional development  the Duchess asked, adding that in her experience: “There is a lot of talk about feeding and nutrition and physical milestones, but less on the emotional and social milestones.”  Told how even well-educated mothers and fathers struggle with feeling “insecure” about their parenting, she agreed: “[There is] The expectation that maybe they should know already. “Whereas some of the more disadvantaged families probably have dferent challenges  “Do you feel there is a challenge for poorer communities and disadvantaged families, of having to concentrate on primary needs  If they are struggling with meeting primary needs [ like providing food and clothes] do they have time to focus on social and emotional development ” In a small art studio, the Duchess sat around a table with two couples, each first-time parents, and their nearly-nine-month-old babies Svend and Aksel.  The Duchess asked them about their experiences of the Danish health visitor system, observing: “From what I’ve heard about health visiting here it seems really extraordinary. “This focus on emotional and social development, looking holistically. It’s a highly-regarded profession.” Asking whether they felt confident asking for helpthey were struggling, or whether there was a “stigma”, she heard how important it was for parents to know that their trusted health visitor was giving advice based on research. “To have first-hand advice based on research, founded in science, must be really good,” she replied.  Commenting on a tendency to look online for answers but not be able to trust the results, she agreed: “It’s a wealth of knowledge but you don’t always know where it’s come from.” Hearing about how the Danish system trains health visitors to speak to new parents in a non-intimidating way about how to boost their children’s well-being, she asked the fathers whether it helped provide them “with a common language” to discuss emotions with their friends. “As fathers, do you feel part of this conversation ” she asked. “Particularly the age your kiddies are, often people’s focus is on the mother. Do you feel the health visitors bring you into the role as well ” Told that yes, many Danish fathers took parental leave, she added: “It’s so nice! You get to know him [your baby].”  The “Understanding Your Baby Project” is a universal educational parenting programme teaching health visitors to have more helpful and sensitive conversations with parents. In Denmark, all children have seven “preventative health examinations” with their GP before they start school. They will have an average five or six home appointments with a health visitor before the age of one, and there are around , health visitors for a population of .million. In the UK, there are five mandated checks for children before the age of ., with some taking the form of a questionnaire for parents to fill out. There are , health visitors in England for a population of .million.

Cha FC owner Roman Abramovich bought a £million house there in Eaton Square is also known as Red Square by Russian residents in London Image: ANDY RAIN EPA-EFE REX ShutterstockByTom ParrySpecial correspondent:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |comments Built by the landowning Grosvenor family, and named after Eaton Hall, their Cheshire country house, the history of London’s Eaton Square could not be more English. In the heart of well-heeled Belgravia, the five-storey Georgian townhouses that look out on six manicured private parks are among Britain’s most desirable addresses. But many residents are not UK taxpayers, and are more likely to be billionaire Russian oligarchs with some having had past relationships with Vladimir Putin.Eaton Square has been nicknamed Red Square due to the amount of Russian-owned property there. Cha FC owner Roman Abramovich, who has a £billion fortune, bought a £million house there in  – one of several mansions he owns in London. Another oligarch with property on the square is aluminium magnate Oleg Deripaska, believed to have a £bn fortune. He is said to be close to Putin, and claims have been made that he is the premier’s “favourite industrialist”.  Many Russians have invested large amounts in London amid rumours of some Russian money being circulated through untraceable shell companies registered in tax havens. A Transparency International probe identied property worth a total of at least £bn bought in posh London areas using suspect funds from Russia. There is no suggestion of anyone named using suspect funds.  Others with properties in the capital include Arsenal’s former largest shareholder Alisher Usmanov, whose wealth came from metal and mining. He owns -acre Beechwood House in Highgate, North London. Billionaire Eugene Shvidler is thought to live in Belgravia. London-based oligarchs are among the .% of Russians who own more of their country’s wealth than the bottom .%. Many of Russia’s  million people live in poverty and as the President has no genuine competition in elections he can afford to focus more on the .%.  Investigative journalist Oliver Bullough, who has been involved in bus tours of the oligarchs’ mansions, wrote: “No one has done more to channel the flood of money out of Russia than London’s army of lawyers, bankers and accountants no one has been more accommodating of Putin’s oligarchs than Britain’s politicians and, as a result, no one is more to blame than us for the fact Russia’s richest can treat war like a spectator sport.” Critics say the Government must do more to stop some oligarchs hiding money here, as they could provide a financial war chest for Putin. By siphoning money into London property, Russians can disguise the origins of their money.After the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergie Skripal in Salisbury in , former PM Theresa May introduced a crackdown. But in , Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee Russia Report called Russian influence in the UK “the new normal”.Russian-born donors or iniduals with business links to Russia have given nearly £m to the Tory party or constituency associations since Boris Johnson took power in July , Electoral Commission figures show.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has called for new anti-corruption measures, writing recently: “Over almost  years of Tory government, the creeping tendrils of the Kremlin have been allowed to wrap themselves around the UK.”Seven hundred wealthy Russians were among those allowed to enter the UK on Tier  investor visas between  and  infor £m, a period when no state checks were carried out. The Home Office is reviewing all visas granted during that period. If Putin does invade Ukraine, some oligarchs in Belgravia could see their assets frozen. For now, however, London remains the city of choice for many who benefited from the Soviet Union’s break-up.

Dale Saint Cullen, , has spent the last five years chase a certain look, and says social media brainwashed him into chasing this  reality. He is now telling his story to raise awareness of the impact of social media has on peopleaposs self-esteem. He said: On social media, I never noticed at the time, but I was looking at these people who looked perfect and I fell into this vicious cycle of chasing what was not the reality, it was completely .I was flying out to Poland and Turkey and showing surgeons filtered pictures on Instagram of how I wanted to look.It took me a while to realise thataposs not what they actually look like in real le.  Dale said he has realised that he will never achieve the look that he wanted, and he now advocates for people to love themselves inside and out. He is hoping to warn others to not fall into the same trap.He said: Iaposm -years-old now and it seems like people on social media are getting younger and younger and I worry about the affect it has on them. When you see all these reality TV stars ad influencers and they look perfect it can be really damaging to young people. Dale said that when celebrities encourage surgery or tell people to buy these products to get the perfect Hollywood smile, it has a profound effect on their self-esteem. He adds: I think I was trying to fit in with society. I was fine during school. It wasnapost until social media came about, thataposs when I first started thinking about getting work done.  Dale initially only wanted to get a nose job, but has described surgery as a slippery slope. Social media led him to want surgery on his chin, have better teeth, bigger lips, and a sharper jaw. He said: Its like thereaposs always a new trend and I just couldnapost keep up. Iaposm all for following the trend but not when it means you have to change your entire face. Dale doesnapost regret the work heaposs had done, only the reasons behind it. He will also be doing another surgery in June.  He is encouraging people to make sure theyaposre getting surgery for the right reasons -thataposs what they want to do. He said: I spent so much time, money, and energy on chasing that perfect look, itaposs crazy. I would just say to people to make sure you do your research first and make sure youaposre doing it for the right reasons. Iaposm seeing a therapist to try and make sure I work on myself. The work I had done in the past, it wasnapost for me, I did it under the pressures of social media. Iaposm in a much better place now and I make sure everything I do is for me. Dale has also warned that getting cosmetic surgery can make you feel worse rather than helping with any issue you think you may have. I really want to show other young people that chasing a look like that isnapost possible and it can leave you feeling worse than you did beforehand, he explained. He adds that there are some days where he wakes up and feels more self-conscious now than he did before the surgery.

Talor Hartshorne was on sht at a BM store when she turned round and spotted her daughter, Maisie Glynn, standing next to her. Maisie, who is in year one, had managed to leave the school grounds during the lunch break and made her way to her mumaposs place of work in Batley, West Yorkshire. Luckily she was unhurt in the incident but Talor said it could have been much worse. The mum has now pulled her child out of the school, as she no longer trusts them to look after her daughter.  She said: She was in the school playing and having her lunch, then managed to leave the school grounds and head into Batley without any of the teachers realising she was missing. I was at work at the supermarket and turned round and my daughter was there. I took her back to school to find out what was going on and they didnapost know she had gone. Itaposs disgusting to have allowed that to happen. Sheaposs only five years old. It was very lucky that I was in a place that she has visited before. It could have been a very dferent situation. Itaposs a very busy town. I have now taken my daughter out of that school. I told them that they are not to be trusted.  Philip Sunter, headteacher at Maisie’s former school, Batley Parish Junior, Infant and Nursery School, said it had launched a probe into the incident that took place on Tuesday th February. He added: The safety of all of our pupils is always our number one priority and we are thoroughly investigating how this was able to happen. We offer our deepest apologies to the parents of this pupil. I would like to reassure all parents that this is an isolated incident and something we are taking incredibly seriously.

Some months Iaposm OK and I manage and I get by. But other months I find it really dficult, she told YorkshireLive. One month I was unable to get bread, milk, the basic things we all take for granted. My mental health has really really struggled. I wait two weeks for the money to come in, and then often find thereaposs so many things I need to get it ends up gone and Iaposm back to square one. Itaposs a vicious circle.  I donapost really bother about me but I constantly worry about whether I can keep the kids alright. Rebecca looks after her two children, aged nine and , as well as her niece, , due to her sister recently having a stroke. She started off working  hours a week at the Premier Inn in August , before moving to do more hours a week at a coffee shop. But Rebecca said that she found herself struggling increasingly while working on Universal Credit - and sometimes didnapost have enough left to buy milk or bread. Rebecca estimated that after rent she had £ or £ a month left when she was working for her family. I felt like I was getting penalised because I was working. It seemed like everything I made was taken straight off me, she said. I felt much better mentally and able to manage before I started working. I had to organise child care on my own and start paying full council tax. I was getting myself in such a state and I wasnapost seeing my children because I was always at work. I couldnapost pick them up from school or anything, I was often too tired to cook too. The Universal Credit taper rate is currently %, meaning that for every £ a claimant earns their allowance is reduced by p. After around a month of struggling at the coffee shop, Rebecca opted to go back to receiving full Universal Credit to help her get by. She now has rent paid and most of her council tax, and estimates that after that she has £, a month left. It has been easier but she still finds it hard to get by. The kids all needed new school shoes the other day, she said. It doesnapost seem like itaposs going to be much, butyou pay £ per pair of shoes for three children - thataposs £ I donapost have. All those everyday essentials - school stuff, snacks - theyaposre really dficult. I feel like I canapost provide for my kids. On really skint weeks we have to go and get boxed foods from Iceland and Heron Foods. I have a huge fear of running out of the things I class as urgent like sanitary towels, cleaning products, hygiene items. Sometimes women canapost afford to buy all these things and itaposs very degrading. I canapost afford carpets in our property. Recently my son tripped over and got a huge splinter in his foot and I had to take him to the hospital to get it sorted. The nurse made a joke about us needing to get carpets in the house and I felt so judged. I had to contact a charity just to get us a taxi back from the hospital because I didnapost have the money. All these little things mount up. The rising cost of living is another big concern for Rebecca, who is already paying £ a day for her electricity bill in her three-bed maisonette. My energy bills are absolutely extortionate. I donapost have the heating on that much because we canapost afford it. We tend to have it on for an hour in the morning and an hour at tea time, she said. The cost of living rise is really scary. During winter Iaposve already had to say to my kids aposeven though weaposre freezing, we have to turn it offapos because I just canapost afford it. We often canapost afford to go out and do things in the winter so we spend all weekend in our cold house without the heating on. Iaposm constantly watching our meter to make sure we donapost go over.I struggle enough as it is - with the price cap going up in April, I just think we wonapost be able to cope at all. Iaposd like to see Boris Johnson try live on the amount we get. My mum only gets £ a week to live on - I donapost understand how thataposs possible.The stress has left Rebecca really struggling with her mental health. She is currently receiving Cognitive Behavioural Therapy to help her cope.

Our local charity Noahaposs Ark said theyaposve heard some people are feeling suicidal. I enjoy going to work and have always been art of a working family, but it started to feel pointless. I do understand why people want to stay on benefits because itaposs so much less stress. People donapost understand how dficult it can be. I think something needs to change. The Universal Credit taper rate was reduced from p to p recently by the Department of Work and Pensions . The DWP states it provides a financial safety net while claimants go back to work. There is also some support for upfront childcare costs through a Flexible Support Fund award. A DWP spokesperson said: “Our changes to Universal Credit are boosting nearly two million working families by £ a year on average, making sure work pays, with our upcoming .% rise in the living wage offering another boost. “We recognise people are facing pressures with the cost of living, which is why we are taking decisive action through a £ discount on bills this autumn and a £ non-repayable reduction in Council Tax bills through the £bn Energy Bills Rebate.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON TaxEnergy billsMental healthChildcare\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The message was found by a member of the public late last month and could provide clues as to the whereabouts of the chef who was last seen  years ago.Photo evidence of the tribute shows a small bouquet of flowers placed next to a laminated missing personaposs photo of Claudia. On the bottom of the page, there is a chilling note written in block capitals that reads she is in the water, with two arrows pointing in one direction. There is also a separate note that says god bless her on one side of the page.  Family spokesperson Martin Dales said the tribute was originally found on January . It could be interpreted in all sorts of ways, he said. There are clearly many parts that make up the jigsaw, and after  years it is high time the truth becomes clear and the publicaposs vigilance in reporting information is vital. Information is going to find the answers here. Itaposs really down to people to keep coming forward with information. I donapost know what to think. Itaposs an unusual situation for a member of the public to come across something like this.  While the exact location hasnapost been revealed, itaposs understood the tribute wasnapost discovered at Sand Hutton gravel pits, near York, where investigations took place last September. During those investigations, specialist officers conducted a fingertip examination of the site, eight miles from Claudiaaposs home. On that occasion, around  cops were involved in combing the popular fishing site for clues, which included trimming back woodland near the two lakes. Specialist search teams also pumped water for around a week, with one lake at the site left almost empty. No one has heard from Claudia since she called her mother Joan on the evening of March , .She failed to arrive for work at York University the next day and was reported missing by her father, Peter. The disappearance remains unexplained and is now treated by North Yorkshire Police as suspected murder. Tragically, her father died earlier this year aged  without finding out what had happened to his daughter. Mr Lawrence spearheaded a nationwide search for his daughter Claudia, which cost police around £m over the last decade. Nine people have been questioned, but no charges have ever been brought. Martin paid tribute to Mr Lawrence, with whom he had enjoyed a -year friendship, following the update.  He said: He asked me to do this - to keep his daughter Claudiaaposs name in public lights and not forgotten by the authorities looking for her. On a personal level, I miss Peter hugely after nearly  years of friendship and over  years of seeking out with him what has happened to Claudia. However, a spokesman for North Yorkshire Police said: The person who left the item has been identied as a spiritualist and they have been spoken to by the investigation team. There are no substantive links to the inquiry.

Tia Watson, , who was -weeks pregnant at the time and was left stuck in France due to a miscommunication by the budget airline. She, her partner Martin Beard and their daughter, four, were scheduled to fly to Fuerteventura on Monday, February , before ing to England on Friday, February .However, as the plane attempted to touch down at Manchester Airport on Friday, bad weather conditions led to an aborted landing. The flight was then erted to Bordeaux in the South of France, Nottinghamshire Live reports.The family then waited at Bordeauxaposs airport for nearly three hours before they were told to go to a hotel overnight, paid for by the airline. Tia said: We received a text on Friday night to say, aposWe apologise for your overnight delay, your new flight time will be :pm on Saturday evening local time.apos  As a result, Tia and her family went to sleep and prepared for a leisurely morning as they had nearly  hours until their flight. However, when they arrived at the hotelaposs restaurant for breakfast, Tia said: There was literally no one at the hotel from our flight. She continued: We thought this was really weird because the flight we were on was full and there was hundreds of people in our hotel. Reception then told us that they all got picked up on free coaches this morning. We assumed that everyone  had been told the correct flight and weaposre the only ones that had received the error, she said.  The family then phoned Ryanair to ask about the situation, but were reassured that they were still booked on the :pm flight they had originally been told to board. But, when they got to the airport, there was no such flight on the departures list, and a Ryanair delegate told them that the only flight to England that day left at am, meaning theyaposd missed it. After being on the phone for hours all day, getting to the airport with a four-year-old, Iaposm pregnant myself and obviously itaposs very, very stressful, Tia explained. Then they said thereaposs a flight today , so they wanted us to lug all of our stuff to the airport again, three hours before the flight, go through check-in and everything, on the off-chance that three people donapost show up. Thataposs stressful in itself, she added.  The family were then booked to fly home on Wednesday, February , which would have left them stranded in France for a few more days. Luckily, they managed to get back home late on Sunday, February . Tia said that her partner is a reception teacher and it was a nightmare having to contact the headteacher at the school to let him know about the situation. Additionally, the family were not logistically prepared for the mix-up. Tia said: We were in Fuerteventura so we obviously only packed summer clothes. So, now, weaposre in  degree weather in dresses and sandals with no money, no clothes. If I donapost laugh, I will cry. Yesterday, I was just crying all day, Tia added.

The source said: The royals are not very good at communicating with one another so this is one way around it. Nicknames are a way of taking the family tension out of things. “They can also be a rather childlike family. They love to play games and they give each other silly presents.

Another said: I feel a little claustrophobic just looking at all the stuff in their living room.In a video congratulating those who were involved in the opening of the NHS Louisa Jordan Hospital in Glasgow, we got to see another room in the home.The cream-coloured room features metallic bronze furniture including a large mirror, a cabinet filled with animal ornaments, and four rectangular framed photos hanging on the walls. There are also three side tables behind her - one features a blue and white desk lamp with a large lampshade and three framed photos.  Another below the mirror holds more photo frames and a vase full of light pink roses, and the last directly behind Anne showcases two white photo frames including a photo of Zara and her husband Mike on their wedding day. Zara also lives on the Gatcombe Park estate with Mike along with their daughters Mia, six, and Lena, one. We got to see a small glimpse inside of their home when she appeared as a guest on Good Morning Britain via video call.  Zara sang the Queenaposs praises to Piers Morgan on the national address on coronavirus she delivered to the UK, and also thanked the NHS and key workers for their hard work.The video call meant viewers were able to see into her home, as the shot showed a cream room with traditional wooden beams and a staircase in the corner. It also showed a cream kettle and a coffee maker on the side, and a Dyson fan.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

They needed blood tests and Hepatitis jabs in AEAll three friends were left bruisedByKelly-Ann MillsNews ReporterStephanie Balloo:,  Feb |commentsThree students believe they were spiked by injection on a night out leaving them completely wiped out, sweating excessively and with bruises on their arms. The women, two aged  and one , were out with friends in the Gay Village area of Birmingham when they say they were targeted. One of the trio, who suffers with health anxiety, described the experience on Friday night as traumatising. The student said her heart dropped as she says she later discovered a pin prick hole in the arm of her leather jacket. The three friends, who had been part of a seven-strong group, said they were forced to visit AE for blood tests and Hepatitis jabs amid the scare.It felt like quite a unique experience because itaposs not like I noticed anything dferent, one of the students, who did not wish to be named, told Birmingham Live.My night was pretty normal, until the morning I felt Iaposd got a bruise on my arm. A friend then explained how she felt she had been aposspiked on the night outapos, but couldnapost remember a thing. She was the first to visit AE and report she had been spiked to the hospital staff.  The student added: She wasnapost unconscious or anything but she was acting out of character. Usually, sheaposs bubbly, kind, never starts an argument. She was getting quite argumentative and running away. She couldnapost remember anything she had done, people were telling her things sheaposd done on the night and she couldnapost recall any of it, which is unlike her. We all felt awful but we thought: aposMaybe itaposs just a hangoverapos. The entire day was wiped out, I was exhausted and excessively sweating, it was like cold sweats and I was constantly sleeping. I felt really weak, my arm was killing me. I dismissed it asIaposd accidentally bruised it because I didnapost black out. Her friend later called to tell her a second pal had also discovered a bruise on her arm. And on closer inspection of her own bruise, she found a mark where a pin prick could have been. I was so confused because I was wearing a jacket the entire night. So then I looked through my jacket and I found a pin prick hole where my bruise was in the jacket - my heart just dropped, she added. Before I was invalidating it a bit because I hadnapost had the experience of feeling out of it. My arm had been hurting all day but I just dismissed it. I have quite bad heath anxiety so this is literally traumatising. The two friends travelled to AE at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in the city. She added: I got my Hep B jab on the other arm, but my spiked arm is hurting more than it has been for the past two days. Thataposs how I definitely know itaposs a spike mark, it would be better by nowit was just a bruise. Both my friends didnapost know they had been injected until the next day, which is terrying. When I spoke to the people at AE they said: aposMost shts there is at least one person that comes inapos, I was like: aposThat is awful, why is nothing being done about this apos West Midlands Police said it had launched an investigation after the three friends reported the incident to the force.A statement from West Midlands Police read: We’re investigating a report of three women being spiked during a night out in Birmingham city centre on Friday . The women – who are friends - all noticed bruising to their arms the following day. They also could not recall events from the previous evening. This led them to believe they had been spiked and report this to us.

Body language expert Judi James has said Kate Middleton definitely seemed nervous at ious moments during her overseas tour. Speaking to OK!, the expert said: There are only a couple of gestures that hint at any potential feelings of nerves or any suggestion of anxiety about the current crisis in the royal Firm back home. In one pose, Kate has both hands on the handle of her bag and is holding it in front of her torso in a barrier gesture that makes her look less assured than she does when she is walking with the bag hanging at her side. And when she sits at the table for her meeting at the university, she is the one in the group sitting with her hands on her lap rather than on the table like the others, giving them the edge in terms of signals of spatial dominance and status. James explained further. She added: It makes her look a little unsure, but then the world of the boardroom is not her natural habitat and hopefully she spread out a little as the meeting went on.  However, despite the ious moments of nervousness, James did note that in many of the photos, Kate showed a keenness and a purpose as she visited the Scandinavian country. The royal has been pictured this week in Copenhagen, visiting the Centre of Early Childhood to learn about Denmarkaposs approach to early childhood development while wearing a white shirt and a red Zara jacket.  James said, on the whole, Kate is stamping her royal profile with a look of calm confidence and charm here as she undertakes her first solo trip abroad since the pandemic kicked in. Although she produces a perfect and often fun-looking double-act with her husband , Kate appears to project higher levels of assertive confidence here by herself, James said. Her outfit looks like an intentional statement of a more brusque, business-like approach and that sentiment is very much echoed in her handshaking techniques. James added that when Kate waves to the crowd and shakes hands with fans, she shows warmth and modesty.

Further gale force winds could hit the isles on Thursday, just days after Storms Dudley, Eunice, and Franklin wreaked havoc across most of the UK.In response the Met Office issued several weather notices, including rare red warnings advising people in the south of England and Wales to remain indoors as blustery winds raged outside.The agency rolled out new yellow warnings today before more wind and heavy rain is expected tomorrow across the north and west of England, with the potential for snow to hit some areas of Scotland. They expect to issue more National Severe Weather warnings later this week, but added the risk of impacts is lower than we have seen in recent days.The windy conditions are expected tofor much of the UK on Thursday - which could end up being named Storm Gladys, Manchester Evening News reports. Although the name of the next storm has already been decided, it is too early for forecasters to tell whether it will develop this week. In the North West, weather conditions will remain unsettled today with some heavy rain showers forecast for Greater Manchester. Into tomorrow, the showers will remain in the north and west, bringing wind and a band of heavy rain with it which could fall as snow or sleet over the hills, but also to lower levels at times. This rain and blustery weather will move south and east through Wednesday - when a number of yellow National Severe Weather warnings have been issued.Windy conditions are forecast for Thursday, alongside a mix of sunshine and showers which could turn wintry on the hills. Friday will be a drier, brighter day with sunshine forecast for most of the afternoon. Officials have warned that unsettled conditions over the coming days could aposslow downapos recovery efforts following the three named storms.  Forecaster Mark Wilson told the PA news agency: It’s been an improving picture following a really bad start to the week, with strong winds due to Storm Franklin. Outbreaks of rain have been clearing off to the east, and some parts have been brighter but still windy, so not a great start but it has improved.  Overnight and in the early hours of Tuesday bands of rain and strong winds in the north of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland will begin to move, bringing scattered showers across many regions, including those which have already seen flooding. Although there won’t be a huge amount of rain and it will pass through quickly, further rainfall on top of the regions which have seen flooding is not helpful and could cause recovery to slow down massively.

However, one day, after attending a church service, Beth decided to go one step further and ring around some fostering agencies.Being just  and single at the time, she was initially knocked back, with many people calling her crazy for even wanting to foster in the first place at such a young age. Unperturbed by those who doubted her, Beth was given her first two foster children Ava and Sadie, when she was just  years old. The girls were two and four at the time, and going from no kids to two proved to be the hardest transition for Beth. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Beth said: I had to try and understand being a mum in general, trauma and their special needs. I felt defeated, I almost gave up and gave them back. But I didnapost give up. Becoming a foster mum was dficult because it felt like I was given a pile of information and then handed a child. It was extremely overwhelming. Some days I felt insane and under-qualied but it has been the best gt because I now have my kids. Ten months later, Beth was asked whether she could also take in a one-month-old baby girl, Nora, leaving her with three foster kids while still in her early twenties. She recalled: She was a perfect baby and it was a smoother transition going from two kids to three. At the beginning of January , I decided I was going to adopt my three foster children. It was at this point that Beth then decided to close her home for a while in order to bond with her three adopted children.By July , her home was reopened once again, at which point she fostered the prematurely born Mia, picking her up from NICU.  Four months later, Noraaposs biological mother had another baby, named Lucy, and requested that Beth take her in because she knew she would be loved. Beth brought Lucy home and eventually ended up adopting both her and Mia, leaving her a single parent of five adopted daughters. Beth, now , said: So I was a single mum of five and people were constantly telling me I would never find a husband because of the kids. Iaposd tried online dating, but nothing worked out. Iaposd pretty much given up hope. However, everything changed when Beth met Marc, , a fellow single parent who interviewed her for a podcast about foster care back in , right at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. According to Beth: We got talking and discovered we had many connections, and we just continued to get to know each other. He had two kids from his previous relationship. Within a month of knowing him, I knew he was going to be the man I would marry. The Mirror is committed to more hopeful news.

Those horrible pains can last for days and apart from some painkillers and a hot water bottle, there isnapost much we can do about them But it turns out cramps arenapost the only tell-tale sign your period is about to start.There are actually six other things you can look out for, reports RSVP Live.Some of them make a lot of sense, but others are slightly more unexpected. Migraines caused by period Lots of women suffer from really bad migraines in the lead up to their period, and the pain can even be worse than cramps.  Migraines are known to be associated with the hormones that regulate the menstrual cycle — estrogen and progesterone.  According to official guidelines from the American Headache Society, the window for menstrual migraines is between two days before a period starts and three days after. If it gets really bad you can take painkillers. Weird period poos  Most women will find their bowel movement changes during their period. During the first few days your body releases the chemical prostaglandins, which makes the uterus contract. But the prostaglandins sometimes stray over to the bowel, so it also contracts. Mira Kaga, an internal medicine physician, said: Sometimes our body releases so much prostaglandin that it doesnapost just target the uterus, it targets other areas of the body, and in this case, the GI tract.Kaga said this rush in prostaglandins can cause diarrhea for some, and just increased bowel movements for others. Tender boobs before period  Thereaposs a good chance your boobs may become a lot more tender in the lead up to your period.Gynecologist Alexa Dweck told Cosmopolitan breast swelling can sometimes occur over the course of an entire week, and itaposs not uncommon to go up a bra size.This is because of rising progesterone levels. Dr Rebecca Brightman, a gynecologist in New York City, recommends drinking less caffeine, using an ice pack or heating pad on your chest, or taking painkillers. Craving sugarYou experience a lot of hormonal changes in your period. Not only do you feel more sexually energised but you crave a lot more sugar and fatty foods.  Dr. Deb Laino, a licensed sex therapist in Delaware, said serotonin levels tend to deplete before the start of a period, and cortisol released when youaposre stressed rises.He told Cosmopolitan : Sugary and fatty foods tend to give a burst of serotonin. The same thing with cortisol. Cortisol goes up under stress — youaposll start to crave salty foods. This symptom is sometimes not actually the worst, because eating salty and sweet foods is fun. Just, you know, throw a vegetable or two in there at some point. Putting on weight Alyssa Dweck says a spike in the hormone progesterone is to blame here. For most people, the fluctuation resolves within a few days of starting a period.She said: Most [medical] literature says itaposs just a couple of pounds. But anecdotally, women will complain about a five-plus-pound fluctuation before the period. Exercise is harder before period  Many women find exercise really helps ease craps when theyaposre expecting their period, but your time of the month can make it tougher.A  study published in the Journal of Trauma Rehabilitation on how women recover from mild traumatic brain injury found that when progesterone levels are high the week before a period , women took longer to recover.This doesnapost just apply to brain trauma, which is why your regular gym routine may leave you feeling sore longer before your period starts. The luteal phase also leaves a lot of people feeling out of breath faster and just generally fatigued. Your bodyaposs preparing for a period! Itaposs hard work. Most doctors recommend you take it a little easier during your period.

The -year-father spent days creating the game, which involved going from station to station in search of clues and Harrison, who is said to be amazing with geography, was thrilled. What do you think to Harrisonaposs hide and seek game  Let us know in the comments...The clue-seeking father and son team set off from Rainham, close to both Charlie’s home in Dagenham and Colchester, where Harrison and his mum live. The first stop was East Londonaposs West Ham, with Charlie having travelled ahead and given staff the very first clue. Here, young Harrison was asked what you’d use to wrap a birthday present as well as what cars drive on, with the answer taking them to Bow Road. From thereon, the keen train fan had to work out a number of other clues which took him to stations such as London Bridge, Canary Wharf, Tower Hill, Victoria, Holborn, and Tottenham Court Road. Charlie believes the clue cracking day out helped to build up Harrison’s confidence, with his son living with both autism and ADHD.He said: He has autism and ADHD so he struggles a little bit at school but is now getting the help he needs. He’s amazing with geography, it’s amazing really, he knows the capital of every single country. Now he’s moved onto trains and train stations. I travel quite a lot and two years ago we went to Disneyland Paris and we went on a double-decker train. Now he loves the London Underground. It was really good for his independence. He had to take us to the right , work out what train we had to get on and where we had to go. He was so happy about it. He’s still talking about it now.

According to Charlie, the gt has proven to be a huge success, with the -year-old having since hung his train station canvas on his bedroom wall and doesn’t sleep without it. Charlie added: Kids are so on their phones nowadays and I try and do the opposite. I take him away once or twice a year. His mum has put him into boxing classes.

Sadly, the app wasnt laughingJess believes she was kicked off the app because of her clown pics Image: @jessicamagician TIKTOKByJulia BanimAudience WriterOlive Loveridge-Greene:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |comments After having recently decided to reboot Tinder, -year-old Jess Harkin decided to replace her existing pics with photos of her in full costume as her alter-ego, Kazoo the Clown. Keen to find a clown man with a sense of humour to match her own, Jess, of County Donegal, Ireland, uploaded six pictures of herself wearing a clown costume, complete with gloves, hat, fake nose, and silly face paint.Taking the jokey theme to her bio, Jess wrote I heard you were aposjust looking for fun apos Well pal, the party has arrived!! Where can I set down this birthday cake and chocolate milk  It worked like a charm and she was flooded with messages, but Jess claims that soon Tinder banned her profile due to activity that violates our Terms of Use.What do you think to Jessapos unique Tinder profile  Let us know in the comments...TikTok star Jess, @jessicamagician, claims that the dating app had taken issue with her clown photos, and has been left frustrated by the ban.She said: Iaposve seen girls with more make-up than this on. Evenyou are you, you can still get banned. I decided it would be funny to make a mini-series of videos where I changed all of my pictures on Tinder to pictures of Kazoo.She continued: I even took the verication pictures in full make-up. It was going well, people were enjoying the videos, people were having a laugh on Tinder about it and then they banned my account. How am I going to find a clown man now  Many of Jessapos TikTok followers have been left indignant on her behalf. One user demanded, Justice for Kazoo!, while another declared the ban to be anti-clown discrimination. Jess appealed Tinderaposs decision and claims the app initially refused to reopen her account, throwing yet another banana skin in the works. Thankfully - after months of waiting - Jess has been officially let out of Tinder exile as of Friday, February , free to drive off into the sunset with a clown car companion of her choosing.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Jess first decided on a career in clowning when she was just three years old, after seeing a clown at the circus for the very first time. Sadly, she was put off celebrating her alter ego by cruel bullies, but remained determined to succeed. Being a very, very shy kid, clowning provided Jess with a character that she could hide behind and - the summer before starting high school - she began teaching herself magic tricks. When she turned , Jess decided to drop out of college and pursue her real dreams of working in the circus, and was determined to make it. Jess said: I went to every circus that came through town. Iaposd go in my full costume and hand in a CV to the ringmaster at the end of the show. I was accepted the same week I started college. For a while, I was juggling between the two but it got to a point where it was nine hours of travel. Revealing why she opted for the name Kazoo the clown, Jess explained that kazoos are annoying and no-one likes them. Jess now works full-time as Kazoo and began using TikTok to introduce new fans to her character over the pandemic. A spokesperson for Tinder has since given a statement saying Jess was banned from the service due to her account being used for promotional purposes. The spokesperson said: Our community guidelines state that we may remove accounts used for promotional purposes however, we want our  to be a place where our members can share what they’re passionate about with matches.Do you have a funny or infuriating dating app story to share  We pay for stories.

Yulia Tarasevich, , won runner-up in the Mrs Russia-International contest two years ago, and soon afterwards went for plastic surgery at a top clinic. Despite the pain caused by the surgery, she claims she was told it wasnapost the surgeonsapos fault because she had a rare genetic condition. “I came to them with a beautul, healthy face,” she said. “I just wanted to correct some nuances caused by ageing. “But sadly I lost my health.”The mother-of-two was left “disfigured” during facelt surgery, a blepharoplasty of the eyelids, and reduction of fat in her cheeks, she said. In the surgery, in Krasnodar, her face became badly swollen and inflamed. Yulia had emergency follow-up surgery by another doctor to save her eyes from necrosis, she said in a complaint that is leading to criminal action against two doctors involved in her original operation. The original medics, named as doctors Andrey Komarov and Omar Khaled, claim she had the rare genetic condition scleroderma. They claim that the reaction was impossible to predict and deny responsibility for her nightmare.Scleroderma is a condition that results in hard, thickened areas of skin and sometimes problems with internal organs and blood vessels, caused by the immune system attacking connective tissue under the skin.However, there is so far no evidence that the victim was suffering from this condition.  She told Russian Channel : I have scars that formed in my cheeks when they ripped out all my tissue. “My eyes donapost close. “And I canapost smile. “I canapost lt my upper lip. “One part of my face doesnapost work at all. “I went quietly to the operation, firstly, because all my tests were in order. “Secondly, because I had plastic surgery before this, I did rhinoplasty, and it went perfectly for me, without any genetic abnormalities. She claims to have spent £, to try and recover from the damage, with more bills ahead. But she will not get back her looks from before the surgery. She accused the surgeons of blaming her by claiming she had a condition which they could not detect prior to the surgery.  “The surgeons made me the only one guilty for what has happened,” she said. “The doctors, who... disfigured my face, relieved themselves of all responsibility. “I decided to have my day in court.” Dr Khaled said the case had been “exaggerated”. He and Dr Komarov are under investigation for flouting laws on the “safety of le and health”, said the Russian Investigative Committee. Spokeswoman Anna Pushkina said: “A forensic medical examination has been appointed to determine the severity of the harm to health, and other patients who could have suffered from poor-quality services in this clinic are also being identied. “The investigation of the criminal case is ongoing. The beauty contest was linked to a US pageant - Mrs International.

That was until they received a letter from an aposangelapos called Helper, who claims to have been keeping an eye on Sunny in Heaven. The family said: We had to put down our dog. He was . We got this letter from our vet. No words right now. The vets letter reads: Hello. My name is Helper. I am an angel. There are a lot of angels in Heaven and we all have dferent jobs.to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories. My job is to write to people and let them know that their pets have arrived in Heaven. One of the head angels told me that you were worried about Sunny and asked me to write you about him. Reassuring the family that Sunny made it into Heaven, the angel said he has settled in and is doing just swell. The letter added: I know that he was ill when he was with you. He had gotten very old and when you get old, your body is not as strong as it used to be. Sunny was tired and I think maybe he knew that it was time to come here. And it is a good thing he did because now he is not old anymore and he isnapost sick either. In fact, I saw him just a little while ago and he was running and jumping with some other dogs and having a great time.  Relaying a message from Sunny, the angel told the family just how much their dog has been missing them - but said he wants them to know that he will see them again one day. Sunny misses you and hopes that you understand he had to come here, it continued. I am sure that one day Sunny will be there to greet you when you come here and you will have a grand reunion. Until then, we will keep him busy and happy. Here we donapost have time like you do. It never gets dark. It is just one long day. And everyone here is your friend, so donapost worry. Sunny is not ever going to be lonely. Someday when he sees you again, it will be like you were never apart. Donapost feel sad. Sunny is just fine. He is happy and he sends his love to you. Sharing their thoughts on the letter, which has been shared on Reddit, one user said: Our vet sends sympathy cards signed by all of the staff. Itaposs kind of hard to take, but they know people are hurting.Ask vet staff what the hardest part of their job is, and itaposs putting down a pet who has been part of your le and family day in and day out for many years. In agreement, another veterinary worker added:Sometimes we ask another employee to swap with uswe are too emotional. It doesn’t do anybody any goodyou’re crying louder than the owner. They add up though, and sometimes it just explodes. One of the most memorable experiences for me was this sweet old widow and her friend. They both quietly sobbed while we put down her senior dog. We gave them time alone afterwards with him, and after  minutes, they exited the room and closed the door quietly behind them. I went in to prepare her pet for the next step, and the dog was covered in beautul handpicked field flower bouquets. Maybe they had a little ceremony for him. It brings tears to my eyes every time I think of this, and now whenever I have to euthanise a pet, I try to pick some flowers along the way.Do you have a heartwarming dog story to share  Email paige.freshwater@reachplc.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON RedditTeamDogsDogsAnimals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

On Monday night, Putin ordered troops into two eastern regions of Ukraine, Luhansk and Donetsk, which he says are independent states, - a move that Boris Johnson said signals the beginning of a full-scale invasion of the nation.Over the last few years Putinaposs power has grown after constitutional changes in  allowed him to rule the country until  - when heaposll be in his eighties. In , Forbes listed Putin as the second most powerful person in the world with an estimated fortune of billions - and he certainly lives a lestyle to match.  A billion mansion known as aposPutinaposs Palaceapos and a £m superyacht are believed to be highlights of his portfolio - but there also reports he has  other homes,  planes and helicopters,  cars and a watch collection worth , The Russian president is even known to have flaunted his power through ownership of outlandish pets - including a tiger called Boris, who he released into the wild on live TV in . Speaking to the Washington Post, hedge fund manager Bill Browder estimated Putinaposs wealth was around billion USD - but his fortune is surrounded by mystery. Putinaposs PalaceWhile itaposs well-known that Putin owns several luxury properties in Russia, one particular mansion reported to belong to the Russian president has turned heads in recent weeks. The so-called aposPutinaposs Palace,apos which is thought to be worth more than  billion, was reportedly built for Putinaposs personal use. Last month nearly  photos of the lavish mansion were published by Alexei Navalnyaposs Anti-Corruption Fund, set up by the outspoken Putin critic who is now in jail.reports the palace, which is on Russiaaposs Black Sea coast, has a marble swimming pool decorated with statues of Greek gods, a wine cellar, a theatre, and a club-like space for pole dancing.  Photos also show garish four poster beds adorned with plush cushions and extravagant chandeliers and curtains. Georgy Alburov, a researcher for the Foundation, said the palace was decorated in a style similar to that youaposd expect from King Louis XIV. After the video was released, Russian state TV responded with a second video, supposedly also of the Palace. But it painted a very dferent picture. The ostentatious decor that had been featured in the first video appeared to be gone - replaced with bare walls. Putin denied owning the sprawling palace altogether, saying the Navalny video was boring. But a BBC investigation which spoke to several builders who worked on the palace confirmed many of the allegations in the original video. However, many claimed the palace was undergoing renovation due to mould on the ceiling and walls. £ million yachtThe Russian president often uses press opportunities to flaunt his wealth - particularly in conspicuous assets heaposs owned over the years. And heaposs recently shown off another lavish purchase - a ft super yacht, complete with a swimming pool and a helipad. The Daily Mail reports the multi-million pound vessel, called Graceful, was built in Russia but moved to Germany for modications.  Just a few weeks ago, the yacht was swtly moved out of Germany in a move thought to be an avoidance of economic sanctions against Russia from the West. Snaps of the luxury yacht show a gold spiral staircase, a plush living room and art deco-style bedrooms. Graceful even boasts a gym on the decking of the yacht, for a workout with a sea view. Heaposs also driven to the bottom of the Gulf of Finland in a C-Explorer . Submersible to explore the Soviet Shchuka-class submarine Shch- sunken during World War II.  Bulletproof limos and plane with gold bathroom Putin doesnapost just dominate the waters with his high-end, expensive vehicles - and heaposs rumoured to also own a collection of  cars. In , Newsweek reported the Russian president had ordered the production of a bulletproof fleet of limos in Russia, estimated to be worth  million. The Aurus Senat, which he hoped would become an eastern rival to the Rolls Royce, started to turn heads in the Middle East - although not all the models are as high-tech as his own presidential car. Putinaposs Senat can withstand chemical gas attacks and sniper fire, and also features an advanced communication system, complete with CCTV cameras.When heaposs travelling by plane, he cruises in his £million jet dubbed the aposFlying Kremlinapos.The plane, designed in a neo-classical style, can reach speeds of mph and is laced with gold throughout its interior - even on the lid of the loo. In fact, the bathroom alone is said to be worth £,, reports the . The Sun reports the jet boasts a gym, a fully-stocked bar and three bedrooms - but itaposs also kitted out with al assets you need when youaposre commanding an army. The plane has a full communications room Putin can usehe needs to mobilise troops while heaposs in the air. Mysterious fortune While Putin has no problem showing off how much money he has tied up in assets, heaposs less forthcoming about where the money came from in the first place. Several theories about the Russian presidentaposs fortune have circulated over the years, but no one has ever been able to get to the bottom of his outlandish wealth. Bill Browder thinks the imprisonment of Russian oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky could provide some answers. In , Khodorkovsky, who had an estimated wealth of  billion, was jailed for fraud and tax evasion - something heaposs always denied. But Browder thinks the arrest could have allowed Putin to cut deals with other wealthy Russian oligarchs. He told Forbes: The deal was, aposYou give me  per cent of your wealth and I’ll let you keep the other  per centapos. Another theory is that Putin used his influence to help friends and family earn money over the years - and they have offered him cash and shares in big companies in . Forbes reports there is one more viable theory explaining Putinaposs enormous fortune, called the Bluster Model. Put simply, this theory relies on the belief that the ex-KGB agent doesnapost actually have the enormous wealth he boasts, but just wants people to think he does. Itaposs possible that, despite the sprawling palaces, luxurious yachts and high-tech car fleets, the Russian president is simply playing the role of one of the richest men in the world.

Amongst these is Beinn Odhar # its southern slopes lying firmly in the county of Stirling, whilst its summit stands proudly in Argyll.If approached from the west, north or south you could keep your toes in Argyll all day. Unless on a round of Corbetts # there are five here that make a fine challenge # it is easier to approach the Corbett via its gentler slopes from Tyndrum. This also gives the opportunity to explore the adit # access tunnel # and old lead mine on its higher slopes where the mineral vein continuation from Sron nan Colan is exposed. The Beinn Odhar lead mining venture appears to have been a short one but the views once the summit is reached are tremendous.Leaving the car park, cross the A and head left passing the Tyndrum Inn, the Green Welly Stop and cross the bridge.Turn right immediately after crossing the bridge to join the West Highland Waynorthwards, passing the KeyStore.You will need to stay on the WHW for the next .km as it slowly climbs out of Tyndrum with the A on your left and the Crom Allton your right until you reach the bridges over the burn and railway.Cross the bridges and go through the gate at the north end. You will be heading up on to the open hillside to your right.You now have a choice. Either head straight up in a north easterly direction picking your own route on the grassy slopes or veer slightly right back to the Crom Allt to pick up a faint path. If you use the latter, ensure you head upwards at around NN. Either way you will tend to end up on sections of the old mining path as it zigs zags upwards by default due to the natural line of the slope.Once you reach m # after approximately .km depending on how direct your route was # the ground becomes stonier. The adit and mine are higher to your left, northwest, on the crest of the ridgeline, whereas the faint path runs just under this soyou want to explore them it is worth scrabbling up the rocks to have a look. The bottom of the adit starts at around ms.Heading up from the adit and mine # or path # the route flattens out, passing a lochan and the county boundary to your left. Ahead, the final ascent is best tackled by heading northeast then northwest to follow the hill’s natural line. There are no particular dficulties.The summit views are fabulous and an excellent panorama of Beinn Dorain can be had from the steep northern slopes above Coire Luaidh.It is easiest todown the southwestern slopes you ascended, but other possibilities could include some of the neighbouring Corbetts, especially the longer days in summer.Safety in the outdoorsThe described routes and accompanying information are there to be used as a guide and do not replace the use of map and compass and the skills required to use them.Whilst every effort is made to ensure the route is accurate at the time of going to print,  please be aware track and path closures can happen at any time.

In addition there may also be a possibility of linking into the generation of tidal energy being taken forward by the private sector.#Executive director Kirsty Flanagan said in the report: #[The] key issue for the buses will be meeting revenue implications and there will be a need to match fund this capital bid with  per cent of the capital costs.#It should be noted that Transport Scotland, through its infrastructure partner CMAL, is taking forward a series of transport connectivity projects on the island, most notably the expansion of Port Ellen Ferry Terminal. There is potential to work with this project to add impact to our proposal.#[A] replacement Jura ferry [is planned] to create an increased capacity and resilience. [We are] working with CMAL on small vessel replacement.#[We are] looking to have a common style of vessel, -m long, to provide resilience across the west coast network and reduce upfront costs with a single model.

It was wrong and it should never have happened, and I am sorry that it did.“Last May, Scottish Borders Council agreed to commission an independent inquiry to look at how the council dealt with issues connected to the conviction of a former teacher for assault. The independent inquiry has considered any deficiencies in the handling of concerns that were raised and whether policies, processes and practice were right and appropriate at the time.“Such was the analysis required, and the sheer quantity of information considered, it has taken several months longer to conclude the independent inquiry than initially anticipated. Following a decision of council last Thursday I am pleased to say that the independent inquiry report will be published today in full, and it will be available online on the council’s website later at www.scotborders.gov.uk SBCinquiry.“It is important to read the report in its entirety as it provides a clear picture and timeline of what happened and when..remove“Andrew Webster QC spent time presenting the findings of his independent inquiry at a meeting of full council last Thursday, after which the council agreed unanimously to issue a written apology to the parents of the young people concerned. I can confirm that this has now been undertaken by the chief executive.“On behalf of the council, I am sorry that the matters were not referred to the Child Protection Unit at the earliest opportunity, as they should have been, and I am sorry that the council failed to communicate appropriately with those parents who had raised ious concerns. Most of all, the council apologises wholeheartedly that the incidents of abuse occurred in the first place.“We must now learn from these mistakes and ensure they are never repeated. At last Thursday’s meeting it was agreed that a further full council meeting be held, in public, at the earliest opportunity. This will allow further detailed consideration and discussion on the content of Mr Webster’s report and his recommendations, and of the next steps required by the council.“Mr Webster’s report will be published today as part of the papers for that council meeting, which will take place on Friday  February.”Carol Hamilton, SBC’s executive member for children and young people, added: “The report authored by Andrew Webster QC which will be published today is of acute interest to me and to many people across the Borders. Although the report addresses the response of the council as a whole, I will be considering the detail and paying particular attention to the recommendations as they apply to education.“For my part, I too am deeply saddened by contents of the report. It makes for very uncomfortable reading.“I am clearly sorry that the matters were not referred to the Child Protection Unit early on, and I am sorry that communication with the parents was so clearly wrong. It should never have happened and we should have done much better.“I will be working closely with my fellow Elected Members to fully consider the Independent Inquiry report, and to look at how we ensure the abuse experienced by these young people does not happen again. I offer my heartfelt apologies to these children for what they experienced.“Changes will inevitably follow such a major review, and we will provide further information on these as soon as we are able to do so.”"},{"url":null,"title":"hawick-teenager-appointed-royal-bank-rugbyforce-2021-young-ambassador","story":"A TEENAGE rugby player from Hawick has been appointed as a Royal Bank RugbyForce  Young Ambassador.Stephen Cook will promote the town as a fantastic community focused club for young players with a proud tradition of developing international stars.The programme will involve him utilising his role as a coach and referee of junior rugby across primary school, S, S and Under  levels by engaging with and inspiring the next generation of players.And now the Royal Bank in partnership with Scottish Rugby, are encouraging more ambitious --year-olds across the country to become ‘Young Ambassadors’, tackling the tough issues facing amateur clubs and their local communities.Following on from nationwide success last year, the programme is back for  and Royal Bank are looking to grow their support for the next generation of grassroots leaders with a squad of  ‘Young Ambassadors’, who will take on responsible committee positions at their clubs.Each winning candidate will also receive specialist training and mentoring to develop key skills for effective club management, including seminars and events lead by former Scotland Internationals Jim Hamilton and Rory Lawson.Stephen Cook in action Backing the campaign, Scotland international and Edinburgh Rugby player, Jamie Ritchie said: “Having had the chance to meet last year’s Young Ambassadors and to see first-hand the impact their projects are having, it’s great to see the programme back again for .“This is a really important time for the grassroots game as we recover and rebuild from the effects of the last  months.

today. The First Minister was expected to address Boris Johnsons Living with Covid policyand the scrapping of all Coronavirus restrictions in Englandas of Thursday.This week, Nicola Sturgeon announced her Covid strategic frameworkalso known as a roadmap out of Coronavirus restrictions.Heres what Ms Sturgeon said during her Covid briefing today.Today First Minister @NicolaSturgeonwill give an update to @ScotParlon #coronavirus.Watch live ➡️ https:t.co zWDxpMyAefrom :pm. pic LKTccbDIm— Scottish GovernmentFebruary , What did Nicola Sturgeon say today Boris Johnsons Living with Covid planNicola Sturgeon expressed frustration over Boris Johnsons approach to Covid testing that he outlined on Monday.The Scottish Government is \"determined to retain\" free Covid testing, in contrast to England.The First Minister criticised the decision by Boris Johnson to end universally free testing and said that the Scottish Government was looking for clarity on funding for the testing programme for devolved countries.Ms Sturgeon said: “Current funding arrangements mean that though taxpayers in all four UK nations contribute to the costs, it is decisions taken for England that determine the resources available to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland for testing and other Covid measures.“As of now, we have no clarity on how much of the Covid testing infrastructure the UK government intends to retain no clarity on how much investment will support it in future and no clarity on whether the Treasury will provide additional resources to pay for it or demand instead that funding is taken from where in the health budget.“I hope we get this clarity soon so that we can out in more detail our longer-term approach to testing.“However, and I will say more later, I want to give an assurance that the Scottish Government is determined to retain a robust testing system capable of providing Scotland with strong resilience against future Covid threats, and firmly aligned with public health advice and the principles underpinning our National Health Service.”.removeNew Covid Strategic FrameworkThis weeks announcement coincides with the publication of the Scottish Governments Covid strategic framework.Nicola Sturgeon said the Scottish Government’s strategy was now to “manage Covid effectively, primarily through adaptations and health measures that strengthen our resilience and recovery”.In her statement to MSPs, the First Minister said: “Widespread vaccination coverage and better treatments have reduced the direct harms of the virus.“As a result, using restrictions to suppress infection is no longer as necessary as it once was.“And, given the wider harms caused by protective measures, it is no longer as justiable either.“The strategic framework therefore makes clear that in future we will rely less on legally imposed measures to control the virus – and more on vaccines, treatments, and sensible adaptations and good public health behaviours.”The framework sets out three broad levels on how the Government may respond to potential iants that could see restrictions reimposed, Nicola Sturgeon had said.Setting out the contingency strategy for low, medium and high risks, the First Minister told MSPs: “If a new iant emerged that was more transmissible and more severe, perhaps with the ability to evade vaccine or natural immunity, this would likely be classied as high risk.\"In those circumstances, we might advise people to limit social contacts for a period and to work from home where possible and we may introduce some temporary protections for high-risk settings.“If a new iant was either more transmissible or more severe, but not both, as is the case with Omicron, the initial threat assessment would likely be medium.\"In these circumstances, there may be a legal requirement to wear face coverings in some settings and we might issue guidance for businesses and service providers on reasonable measures to reduce the spread of Covid on their premises.“Lastly, in the absence of a new iant, ora new iant was neither more transmissible nor more severe, andvaccines continue to be effective, the threat classication would likely remain low. Obviously, this is the level we hope to reach and stay at on a sustainable basis.“In these circumstances, there would be no legally imposed protective measures. Instead, we would continue to advise iniduals and organisations to adopt sensible public health behaviours.”Covid isolation to continuePeople who test positive for Covid- should continue to isolate in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed.The legal requirement for infected people to self-isolate in England will be lted from Thursday, Boris Johnson announced on Monday.Although there has never been a legal requirement in Scotland, Ms Sturgeon said the guidance to isolate would remain.In her update to the Scottish Parliament, Ms Sturgeon said: “This new approach will see us resort much less, hopefully not at all, to legally imposed protective measures.“Instead, we will rely predominantly on vaccines, treatments and sensible public health behaviours and adaptations.“However much as we might wish it was not the case, Covid is still a public health risk here and globally and likely to remain so for the foreseeable future so we must also remain vigilant and prepared.”Vaccination updateVaccination appointments for the vulnerable - age group will begin in mid-March.--year-olds with an underlying health condition or who lives with those who with underlying conditions should come forward for their vaccine.Eligible children are being invited for their vaccination by NHS Scotland via letter or phone call.These appointments will be concentrated for evenings and weekends so that parents and s can attend.Visit the NHS Inform websitefor more information.Vaccine Passport SchemeThe First Minister has been under pressure from hospitality bosses to scrap Scotlands vaccine passport scheme for late-night bars and clubs.Leaders in the hospitality industry have been demanding an end to the legal requirement for customers and staff to wear face masks in licensed premises.In her update today, Nicola Sturgeon confirmed that the vaccine passport scheme will end on February .Face covering restrictions to end on March The face-covering legal requirement in shops and on public transport will end on March , Nicola Sturgeon has announced.Ms Sturgeon said: “As of March , assuming no signicant adverse developments in the course of the virus, we expect that the legal requirement to wear face coverings in certain indoor settings and on public transport will be converted to guidance.“However, we will continue to strongly recommend the wearing of face coverings in shops and other indoor public places, and on public transport.”She added: “Even though certain measures, for example face coverings, may not be legal requirements in future, we will still recommend voluntary compliance as part of the range of behaviours that will help keep us safe as we manage Covid in a more sustainable and less restrictive way.”Latest Covid casesToday, , more people have tested positive

did Nicola Sturgeon say today Free PCR testing to continue in ScotlandNicola Sturgeon expressed frustration over Boris Johnsons approach to Covid testing that he outlined on Monday.The Scottish Government is \"determined to retain\" free Covid testing, in contrast to England.Nicola Sturgeon criticised the decision by Boris Johnson to end universally free testing and said that the Scottish Government was looking for clarity on funding for the testing programme for devolved countries.Ms Sturgeon said: “Current funding arrangements mean that though taxpayers in all four UK nations contribute to the costs, it is decisions taken for England that determine the resources available to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland for testing and other Covid measures.“As of now, we have no clarity on how much of the Covid testing infrastructure the UK government intends to retain no clarity on how much investment will support it in future and no clarity on whether the Treasury will provide additional resources to pay for it or demand instead that funding is taken from where in the healthbudget.“I hope we get this clarity soon so that we can out in more detail our longer-term approach to testing.“However, and I will say more later, I want to give an assurance that the Scottish Government is determined to retain a robust testing system capable of providing Scotland with strong resilience against future Covid threats, and firmly aligned with public health advice and the principles underpinning our National Health Service.”.remove: Nicola Sturgeon update LIVE as Covid roadmap published: Covid Scotland: Vaccine passports scrapped and changes to face mask rulesNew Covid Strategic FrameworkThis weeks announcement coincides with the publication of the Scottish Governments Covid strategic framework.Nicola Sturgeon said the Scottish Government’s strategy was now to “manage Covid effectively, primarily through adaptations and health measures that strengthen our resilience and recovery”.In her statement to MSPs, the First Minister said: “Widespread vaccination coverage and better treatments have reduced the direct harms of the virus.“As a result, using restrictions to suppress infection is no longer as necessary as it once was.“And, given the wider harms caused by protective measures, it is no longer as justiable either.“The strategic framework therefore makes clear that in future we will rely less on legally imposed measures to control the virus – and more on vaccines, treatments, and sensible adaptations and good public health behaviours.”The framework sets out three broad levels on how the Government may respond to potential iants that could see restrictions reimposed, Nicola Sturgeon had said.Setting out the contingency strategy for low, medium and high risks, the First Minister told MSPs: “If a new iant emerged that was more transmissible and more severe, perhaps with the ability to evade vaccine or natural immunity, this would likely be classied as high risk.\"In those circumstances, we might advise people to limit social contacts for a period and to work from home where possible and we may introduce some temporary protections for high-risk settings.“If a new iant was either more transmissible or more severe, but not both, as is the case with Omicron, the initial threat assessment would likely be medium.\"In these circumstances, there may be a legal requirement to wear face coverings in some settings and we might issue guidance for businesses and service providers on reasonable measures to reduce the spread of Covid on their premises.“Lastly, in the absence of a new iant, ora new iant was neither more transmissible nor more severe, andvaccines continue to be effective, the threat classication would likely remain low. Obviously, this is the level we hope to reach and stay at on a sustainable basis.“In these circumstances, there would be no legally imposed protective measures. Instead, we would continue to advise iniduals and organisations to adopt sensible public health behaviours.”Covid isolation to continuePeople who test positive for Covid- should continue to isolate in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed.The legal requirement for infected people to self-isolate in England will be lted from Thursday, Boris Johnson announced on Monday.Although there has never been a legal requirement in Scotland, Ms Sturgeon said the guidance to isolate would remain.In her update to the Scottish Parliament, Ms Sturgeon said: “This new approach will see us resort much less, hopefully not at all, to legally imposed protective measures.“Instead, we will rely predominantly on vaccines, treatments and sensible public health behaviours and adaptations.“However much as we might wish it was not the case, Covid is still a public health risk here and globally and likely to remain so for the foreseeable future so we must also remain vigilant and prepared.”Vaccination updateVaccination appointments for the vulnerable - age group will begin in mid-March.--year-olds with an underlying health condition or who lives with those who with underlying conditions should come forward for their vaccine.Eligible children are being invited for their vaccination by NHS Scotland via letter or phone call.These appointments will be concentrated for evenings and weekends so that parents and s can attend.Visit the NHS Inform websitefor more information.Vaccine Passport SchemeThe First Minister has been under pressure from hospitality bosses to scrap Scotlands vaccine passport scheme for late-night bars and clubs.Leaders in the hospitality industry have been demanding an end to the legal requirement for customers and staff to wear face masks in licensed premises.In her update today, Nicola Sturgeon confirmed that the vaccine passport scheme will end on February .Face covering restrictions to end on March The face-covering legal requirement in shops and on public transportwill end on March , Nicola Sturgeon has announced.Ms Sturgeon said: “As of March , assuming no signicant adverse developments in the course of the virus, we expect that the legal requirement to wear face coverings in certain indoor settings and on public transport will be converted to guidance.“However, we will continue to strongly recommend the wearing of face coverings in shops and other indoor public places, and on public transport.”She added: “Even though certain measures, for example face coverings, may not be legal requirements in future, we will still recommend voluntary compliance as part of the range of behaviours that will help keep us safe as we manage Covid in a more sustainable and less restrictive way.”Latest Covid casesToday, , more people have tested positive for #coronavirus, people were in hospital yesterday which is  more than the day before.Sadly  more people who tested positive have died Latest update ➡️ https:t.co YnREdCegvpic WCZTIZVjw— Scottish GovernmentFebruary , The First Minister also updated MSPs on the latest Covid figures., more people have tested positive for Coronavirus today, Nicola Sturgeon said.There were , people in hospital yesterday which is  more than the day before and  people were in intensive care yesterday with recently confirmed COVID-.more people who tested positive have sadly died which brings the total to , in total.Looking towards vaccination, ,, people have received their first dose of a COVID- vaccination, ,, have received their second dose, and ,, have received a third dose or booster.For more information, visit the Scottish Government website."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week january 28 2022","story":"Candlemass, the Scottish Quarter Day, falls on February .It#s  days after Christmas Day, the day we take down our crib.It#s also halfway to the spring equinox.

The light that shines in the darkness and will not be overcome.On Candlemass Day, Christians process into church with lighted candles, which are blessed to represent Christ, the true Light of the World. We hold that Light.An ancient writer said that Christians are like people #facing east in winter#. Our backs are cold in the wintry air, but our faces are warmed by the rising sun and the hope of the coming spring, summer and harvest.We are living through wintry times. I never thought to see our parliament so disgraced or Europe threatened once more with war.I hoped growing international prosperity would feed a hungry world that together we could address climate change. Instead, lies, greed and hate spoil everything.Our backs are cold. Yet our faces are warmed because we trust: Truth cannot be overpowered.Christ is the Rising Light which cannot be conquered.We hope. And transformed by hope, we live truly and living in truth, we too become the Light of the World."},{"url":null,"title":"leader february 4 2022","story":"According to reports, the tenements at John Street, High Street and Dalintober that Argyll Community Housing Association plans to raze are in very poor condition, suffering the effects of water ingress and dampness.The sensible decision, therefore, would probably be to demolish them but that would no doubt be very upsetting for many Campbeltown families who have called the buildings home for decades.Although they are only bricks and mortar, the buildings will hold special memories for many town residents and expats.If the walls could talk, they#d tell of tenants new and old, of birthdays, weddings, the birth of babies and other happy family occasions, as well as many not so happy events.If you have an opinion on the demolition plan, make sure to send a comment to Argyll and Bute Council via its planning portal.Similarly, make sure your voice is heardthere is another consultation held regarding the town centre traffic management system that is causing concern for Councillor Donald Kelly and residents and business owners in the area.Complaints about some of the new traffic measures are made on an almost daily basis, but unless they are officially registered with the relevant authorities, they will never effect change."},{"url":null,"title":"league hopefuls first half double deflates pupils","story":"Campbeltown Pupils put on another battling show last Saturday but were bested again by West of Scotland Football League Division Four hopefuls and former SAFL rivals Finnart.Starting against the wind, a first-half double took the wind out of the Pupils# sails at a blustery Kintyre Park, and despite a sustained effort with the second-half wind behind them, their opponents stood firm to claim three precious league points.A healthy crowd of almost  turned out in dreadful conditions, with gusts topping  miles per hour and intermittent sheets of freezing rain greeting those spectators who arrived to support the team.Refreshingly, though, a group of youngsters were amongst the entourage travelling with the north Glasgow visitors, and they soon felt at home, happily mixing with the Pupils# own young supporters and joining in song.First, an attempted Pupils clearance found its way to Finnart#s number , who kept his composure to slot home a close-range finish and make it two goals in two games against the Pupils.Then, a header from a swirling cross from Finnart#s left-hand side couldn#t be kept out, despite the efforts of Alasdair Ferguson in goal.The Pupils# Rhys Casci did go close with a one-on-one effort in the first half after being freed by a low pass from midfield, but the Tarbert-based player opted to shoot early and the keeper got his body in front of the effort and gathered at the second attempt.After the interval, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils hoped to use the westerly tailwind to put pressure on the visitors# goal, but it was a quieter half than the hosts would have liked.Finnart battled to repel the Pupils, limiting them to two dangerous efforts from outside the box, first from Casci who forced a save from the away keeper to tip his low shot round the post for a corner, and then from Scott Souden whose deflected effort forced the keeper into a save.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils made some changes late on with youngster Andrew Renton and right-back Michael McKinlay making afrom injury, but it wasn’t enough to turn the tide of the game and the visitors took all three points, to leave themselves two points behind leaders Kilsyth Athletic with two games in hand.Conversely, the Pupils are three points adrt at the foot of the ision, but importantly have two games in hand themselves.In the aftermath of the game, the Pupils# management team stated they were satisfied with the effort and performance level of the squad, acknowledging that the dference between the sides on the day, despite the polar dference in league positions, was the conversion of chances.This is something which Finnart has made an art form of in winning games against sides around them who perhaps play more expansive football.Sure enough, this was the case against the Pupils, for the fourth time this season.Tomorrow , the Pupils are on their travels, playing Glenvale FC at Ferguslie Park, Paisley.

He was protected well by right back Conner Brown, left back Burns and central defensive pairing Ross Souden and captain Keith Mitchell.With less than  minutes remaining, McCallum – who had shted into central midfield with the introduction of second sub and debutant Cameron Wylie at right midfield – intercepted a ball from a Glenvale player, his tackle putting Lang one on one with the hosts# keeper.Lang showed excellent composure for his tender years to slot the ball low into the net with his right foot, just inside the box, his teammates joining him in celebration.After seeing out the final five minutes of regulation time, four nervy minutes of added time were played as Glenvale pushed for an equaliser.In the st minute, Ferguson was called upon to make the save of the day, stopping a powerful Glenvale drive from  yards out, before a Pupils defender cleared the danger.The final whistle sounded soon after and the Pupils# squad and management could cheer a hard-earned, much-needed win, especially impressive considering the inexperience of much of the squad, who are still learning at this level, but judging by this showing, are certainly contributing.Tomorrow , the Pupils host high-flying Harmony Row from Govan, at Kintyre Park.Kick-off pm.

Avoid plantingthe ground is frozen or extremely waterlogged.Your planting hole should be no deeper than the roots, but at least three times the diameter of the root ball.It#s a good idea to soak bare-rooted trees for about  minutes before planting.Place the tree in the planting hole so the first flare of roots on the stem are level with the soil surface. If you plant the tree too deep, it can result in rot and disease.You may need to insert a stake for top heavy or larger trees. Refill the planting hole, firm gently and water in.Drought stress is common in newly-planted trees so make sure you keep watering throughout the growing season. The quantity required will y with soil type, but  to  litres per square metre – four to six watering cans – each week in dry weather will do the trick.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to sow lettuce seeds – both under cover and outside.If you start now, it will give you a continuous supply that can be harvested throughout the year.Sow in modules or fibre pots under cover to have lettuces ready to plant outside in four to six weeks.

Bute Council, and Michael Forsyth MP, Secretary of State for Scotland.The future of the band is in jeopardy because Argyll and Bute Council has a shortfall of funding this year of more than £ million.As part of an enormous package of cuts aimed at saving money, the council plans to axe music tuition in all schools which would mean the end of the school band.In a support letter, Sir Paul describes the proposals to axe music tuition as #catastrophic# and urged the council to re-consider.He wrote: #I feel it would be disastrous for the area to lose this essential musical training, not only to the local people whose lives are enriched by music, but also for the tourism on which so much of the local economy depends.#Campbeltown and the surrounding district is famed throughout the world for its traditional music and it would be very unwise even to consider implementing measures which would effectively bring this reputation to an end.#He added: #I am lending my strongest support

If you are sure you know something to be the case beyond contradiction, you don#t need faith.Doubt, on the other hand, is strongly linked with faith because, while you may have faith strong enough to move mountains, there is always the possibility your faith is misplaced.I would argue the existence of God is proven by large amounts of evidence, but in the end that is a matter of faith.The Bible recognises this right at the start where Adam and Eve leave the Garden of Eden and do not see God face-to-face anymore.From now on, they, and we who come after them, must live by faith.This is what it is to be human – and faith is always open to challenge.When suffering occurs, when disaster looms, people ask, #Where was God # and use what has happened to deny God exists.Yet the faithful keep believing. Why There have been many attempts by faithful people to explain unbearable tragedies with faith in a loving God. Few are convincing – at least at the time.For me, the love that people give to one another is God reflected in human goodness.Living by faith is not easy. Sometimes it means being assailed by doubts and I believe we must be honest about our questions.After all, did not Jesus say: #The truth will set you free.# When those most bitter and painful tragedies strike us down, faith can be a consolation – sometimes the only consolation – even as at the time it is tested to breaking point."},{"url":null,"title":"council considers cremation price rise","story":"Argyll and Bute already charges above the Scottish average for exclusive right of burial and coffin interment, but below the average for a cremation.

I met some of my best friends through dancing and travelling, meaning all my friends now live in dferent countries.”She added: “So many highs and lows of each dance through the many competitions are all described in the book.”Nicole also praised her mum June and dad John for their help over the years, saying: “My mum and dad worked tirelessly to help us dance, driving us around constantly to classes, competitions and the airport, as well as keeping us in beautul kilts and brand-new dance shoes at all times.”She added: “My brother Danny was also an inspiration to me. He did not dance but he is one of the best artists you will ever meet and it was inspiration of creativity that made me go for my writing.”Nicole, who works at The Sofa Delivery Company near the Gyle Shopping Centre in Edinburgh, is keen to write more books, adding: “I have many new ideas for either another dancing autobiographical book or fictional story.”"},{"url":null,"title":"lauderdale-park-access-looked-festive-period","story":"Lauderdale Park is used by numerous families but the gates to the park, which is off Bayswell Road, were closed over Christmas.The possibility of keys being given to someone to ensure the park was opened during the day was suggested during a meeting of Dunbar Community Council.Members heard that there would be “no shortage of volunteers to open and close it”.Councillor Norman Hampshire, who is leader of East Lothian Council and represents the town on the local authority, vowed to look into the matter.He said: “Normally, the cafe people have a key but they had it closed over that time as well.“Our ground care team were off and they could have made arrangements, as long as somebody was prepared to open and shut the park.“We have suffered some vandalism in the park and where in the town.“If it is open in the evening, older teenagers go in there and we do not want any vandalism done to the cafe building.“We will try for this year so we have got temporary provision in place so it can get opened and closed.”"},{"url":null,"title":"hygiene-rating-subway-musselburgh","story":"Musselburgh has a branch, meaning you are never far from a Meatball Marinara or Veggie Delite.But with each restaurant there comes a dferent standard to cleanliness and hygiene. And thanks to the Food Standards Agency  we get to look at what each of the hygiene ratings is for the dferent locations. class\"instagram-media\"data-instgrm-captioneddata-instgrm-permalink\"https:www.instagram p CYrMgLXW  utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading\"data-instgrm-version\"\"style\"background: #fffborder: border-radius: pxbox-shadow:   px  rgba,  px px  rgbamargin: pxmax-width: pxmin-width: pxpadding: width: .%width: -webkit-calcwidth: calc\"href\"https:www.instagram p CYrMgLXW  utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading\"style\"background: #ffffffline-height: padding:  text-align: centertext-decoration: nonewidth: %\"target\"_blank\"style\"background-color: #fffborder-radius: %flex-grow: height: pxmargin-right: pxwidth: px\"style\"display: flexflex-direction: columnflex-grow: justy-content: center\"style\"background-color: #fffborder-radius: pxflex-grow: height: pxmargin-bottom: pxwidth: px\"style\"background-color: #fffborder-radius: pxflex-grow: height: pxwidth: px\"style\"display: block height: px margin:  auto px width: px\"width\"px\"\"px\"viewBox\"   \"version\".\"xmlns\"https:www.w.org  svg\"xmlns:xlink\"https:www.w.org  xlink\"\" fill\"#\"d\"M.,.

according to publishers, saw him “revelling in the liberating glories of surf, sand and their sensualities”.He said: “The funny thing is I have spent my le flying and people always ask me to write a book about flying and dferent places in my le.“There is a better story when I was leguarding.“It is more human and ied in some ways so I thought I would write about that, which I did.“Sometimes anecdotes come up when you have got a pint in your hand and somebody mentions something and it reminds you of something.“Often in the book, I draw on these anecdotes that I remember.“When you are younger, things stick in your memory for all your le.”Kenny grew up in Fairlie, in Ayrshire, before swapping Scotland’s west coast for the south-west of England.Water has played a key role in Kenny’s le, from surfing in Cornwall to becoming part of Dunbar Coastal Rowing Club.A director of Dunbar Harbour Trust, he penned All Summer Long during lockdown and described it as “a wonderful coming of age”.Whilst at university, he escaped westwards every summer to be a professional leguard on Sennen Beach in Whitesands Bay, West Cornwall.After graduating, he spent six months as a teacher in Barbados, and three more months hitchhiking through the USA, Canada and Alaska, then overland through Central America to ‘hidden’ Popayan in the Andes of Colombia.He would go on to learn to fly with British Airways and was later a flying instructor, working almost everywhere in the world, including China, Russia, France and India.He said: “When I was about , I said to my mother: ‘We always seem to live in beautul places.’“We have moved around several times and she said: ‘Any fool can live in a horrible place.’“Her attitude was ‘don’t try to get yourself the most wonderful house you can afford but the most beautul area you can afford, even in the most humble dwelling’.”All Summer Long is released at the end of the month, with the author pleased to say he had some positive reviews from family members.The Dunbar resident said: “I’m suffering from imposter syndrome at the moment where I think it is not me and should not be me but the people who have read it say don’t feel bad

contrast to England.Nicola Sturgeon criticised the decision by Boris Johnson to end universally free testing and said that the Scottish Government was looking for clarity on funding for the testing programme for devolved countries.Ms Sturgeon said: “Current funding arrangements mean that though taxpayers in all four UK nations contribute to the costs, it is decisions taken for England that determine the resources available to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland for testing and other Covid measures.“As of now, we have no clarity on how much of the Covid testing infrastructure the UK government intends to retain no clarity on how much investment will support it in future and no clarity on whether the Treasury will provide additional resources to pay for it or demand instead that funding is taken from where in the health budget.“I hope we get this clarity soon so that we can out in more detail our longer-term approach to testing.“However, and I will say more later, I want to give an assurance that the Scottish Government is determined to retain a robust testing system capable of providing Scotland with strong resilience against future Covid threats, and firmly aligned with public health advice and the principles underpinning our National Health Service.”This weeks announcement coincides with the publication of the Scottish Governments Covid strategic framework.Nicola Sturgeon said the Scottish Government’s strategy was now to “manage Covid effectively, primarily through adaptations and health measures that strengthen our resilience and recovery”.In her statement to MSPs, the First Minister said: “Widespread vaccination coverage and better treatments have reduced the direct harms of the virus.“As a result, using restrictions to suppress infection is no longer as necessary as it once was.“And, given the wider harms caused by protective measures, it is no longer as justiable either.“The strategic framework therefore makes clear that in future we will rely less on legally imposed measures to control the virus – and more on vaccines, treatments, and sensible adaptations and good public health behaviours.”The framework sets out three broad levels on how the Government may respond to potential iants that could see restrictions reimposed, Nicola Sturgeon had said.Setting out the contingency strategy for low, medium and high risks, the First Minister told MSPs: “If a new iant emerged that was more transmissible and more severe, perhaps with the ability to evade vaccine or natural immunity, this would likely be classied as high risk.\"In those circumstances, we might advise people to limit social contacts for a period and to work from home where possible and we may introduce some temporary protections for high-risk settings.“If a new iant was either more transmissible or more severe, but not both, as is the case with Omicron, the initial threat assessment would likely be medium.\"In these circumstances, there may be a legal requirement to wear face coverings in some settings and we might issue guidance for businesses and service providers on reasonable measures to reduce the spread of Covid on their premises.“Lastly, in the absence of a new iant, ora new iant was neither more transmissible nor more severe, andvaccines continue to be effective, the threat classication would likely remain low. Obviously, this is the level we hope to reach and stay at on a sustainable basis.“In these circumstances, there would be no legally imposed protective measures. Instead, we would continue to advise iniduals and organisations to adopt sensible public health behaviours.”People who test positive for Covid- should continue to isolate in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed.The legal requirement for infected people to self-isolate in England will be lted from Thursday, Boris Johnson announced on Monday.Although there has never been a legal requirement in Scotland, Ms Sturgeon said the guidance to isolate would remain.In her update to the Scottish Parliament, Ms Sturgeon said: “This new approach will see us resort much less, hopefully not at all, to legally imposed protective measures.“Instead, we will rely predominantly on vaccines, treatments and sensible public health behaviours and adaptations.“However much as we might wish it was not the case, Covid is still a public health risk here and globally and likely to remain so for the foreseeable future so we must also remain vigilant and prepared.”Vaccination appointments for the vulnerable - age group will begin in mid-March.--year-olds with an underlying health condition or who lives with those who with underlying conditions should come forward for their vaccine.Eligible children are being invited for their vaccination by NHS Scotland via letter or phone call.These appointments will be concentrated for evenings and weekends so that parents and s can attend.Visit the NHS Inform website for more information.The First Minister has been under pressure from hospitality bosses to scrap Scotlands vaccine passport scheme for late-night bars and clubs.Leaders in the hospitality industry have been demanding an end to the legal requirement for customers and staff to wear face masks in licensed premises.In her update today, Nicola Sturgeon confirmed that the vaccine passport scheme will end on February .The face-covering legal requirement in shops and on public transport will end on March , Nicola Sturgeon has announced.Ms Sturgeon said: “As of March , assuming no signicant adverse developments in the course of the virus, we expect that the legal requirement to wear face coverings in certain indoor settings and on public transport will be converted to guidance.“However, we will continue to strongly recommend the wearing of face coverings in shops and other indoor public places, and on public transport.”She added: “Even though certain measures, for example face coverings, may not be legal requirements in future, we will still recommend voluntary compliance as part of the range of behaviours that will help keep us safe as we manage Covid in a more sustainable and less restrictive way.”Today, , more people have tested positive for #coronavirus, people were in hospital yesterday which is  more than the day before.Sadly  more people who tested positive have died Latest update ➡️ https:t.co YnREdCegv pic WCZTIZVjwThe First Minister also updated MSPs on the latest Covid figures., more people have tested positive for Coronavirus today, Nicola Sturgeon said.There were , people in hospital yesterday which is  more than the day before and  people were in intensive care yesterday with recently confirmed COVID-. more people who tested positive have sadly died which brings the total to , in total.Looking towards vaccination, ,, people have received their first dose of a COVID- vaccination, ,, have received their second dose, and ,, have received a third dose or booster.For more information, visit the Scottish Government website."},{"url":null,"title":"connect-music-festival-relaunching-edinburgh-summer","story":"The event, from the organisers of T in the Park and TRNSMT, will be held at the Royal Highland Centre, on the outskirts of Edinburgh.The weekend-long festival is set to be held from August  to , with the line-up announced later this week, although organisers DF Concerts and Events have promised a range of bands, DJs, performers and more.Katt Lingard, festival manager, said the company was ‘really excited about bringing Connect to le’.“It’s a very unique site and it gives us a fantastic opportunity to create a truly sustainable approach to the festival experience,” she said.Connect Music Festival comes from the organisers of TRNSMT Festival in Glasgow.

Once you have the correct thickness – roughly the thickness of a pound coin, gently lay the pastry into the case. Using a piece of excess pastry, press the edges into the case corners and trim away any excess pastry around the top. Place in the fridge for an hour to rest.Prick the base of the tart case with a fork then lay a double layer of cling film or greaseproof paper into the case and fill with baking beans. Place in the oven and bake for - minutes. Remove the baking beans from the tart case and brush the inside of the case with the egg wash. Place back in the oven and continue baking for another  minutes until the base is cooked. Remove from the oven and allow to cool on a wire rack. Once cool, remove from the tart tin.For the frangipane mix, cream the butter and sugar together until light and creamy. Add half the eggs followed by half the flour and almonds, add the remaining eggs then the remaining flour and almonds until everything has combined.

Meanwhile, the Scottish Institute for Sport came aboard with funding and coaching help.Defeat at the European Championships in Finland ensured that the team arrived in Salt Lake City as underdogs. All eyes instead were on the men’s squad, who were favourites for a medal. “We were quite happy to fly under the radar,” says Martin.The curling was held in the city of Ogden, some distance from the main events. A small band of supporters, including MacDonald’s father, was there to cheer the women on. “He was the madman with the kilt and the British and Scottish flag,” she says.In the round-robin, Team GB lost to Canada, described by Donnelly as curling’s equivalent to Brazil in football and the All Blacks in rugby. Other defeats followed and it looked like the Scots were on their home early.As it turned out, they had one last chance to get back into the tournament and seized it. Victory in the semi-final against Canada saw Martin and her team lining up against Switzerland in the final.At this point, the UK and world media had caught up with the story. BBC decided to carry the final live on BBC before switching to BBC. Almost six million viewers watched a tense match where it fell to Martin to throw the last stone for victory. “The stone for glory,” whispered Donnelly.The rest was tears, cheers, and a mass welcome home at Glasgow Airport. The team were awarded MBEs, and Martin appeared on Ally McCoist’s team on Question of Sport.“It went a bit crazy,” says MacDonald, “but it was good”.They were hugely popular, says Donnelly. “I think people recognised in the nicest possible way they were just ordinary but extraordinary women.”Debbie Knox’s twin daughters were only young at the time, but now  they call her their “shero”.: Queen sends her congratulationsFor Martin, now a coach and mentor to players, it had been a try, try, and try again experience.“I lost so many Scottish finals, so many bronze medal matches over the years. ButI hadn’t done that I probably would not have won at the Olympics because you learn from these losses. It doesn’t matter what you want to do.

Who could disagree that national unity and harmony based on the outcome of a free and fair referendum is ultimately in the greater Scottish interest Instead, Nicola Sturgeon deliberately turned her face against the outcome of her governments referendum and chose the path of ever deeper and ever more bitter ision and stre. Far from seeking national unity, she could not even be bothered to attend a church service organised to promote reconciliation. One only needs to see the the denigration of commentators such as Sarah Smith and the partisan dismissal of the best available evidenceto witness the results of that decision.The Scotland that we have today was created by Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP. We can only dream of what could be achievedthey worked as hard at creating unity as they have at creating ision. They should never be forgiven for what they have inflicted on us.Peter A Russell, Glasgow.ABUSING THE FIRST MINISTERBEING of a certain age, I am fortunate not to be privy to the goings-on in social media s except through the likes of The Herald and ious other traditional news outlets. Personally, in the unlikely event that I was involved in the same way, I would treat any inappropriate responses with contempt. Sarah Smith strikes me as being well able to take care of herself in this respect and I suspect that her impending departure to the United States is purely a good career move.I presume that Jill Stephensonis including herself as one of your better-educated readers and, as such, she should be aware that the meaning of words is all about context. Having examined Ms Smiths comments regarding Nicola Sturgeon \"enjoying\" the extra powers in relation to the pandemic and studied my Collins dictionary, I can only describe her use of the description was at best an unfortunate choice of word. Also, there is a lack of subtlety in her description of her detractors and she would have been more honest to openly criticise some parts of the supporters of independence.No decent person can excuse the vitriol reported regularly in media sources but Ms Stephenson is deluding herselfshe thinks such remarks are one-sided. While not being involved in these exchanges, I have overheard Ms Sturgeon being subjected to misogynistic and sometimes venomous comment from older men of my acquaintance who should know better.Gordon Evans, Glasgow.BBC ALWAYS PUTS ENGLAND FIRSTTHE point missing in the stooshie over Sarah Smith is that Scotland isn’t represented by the British Broadcasting Corporation. It doesn’t really matter who the Scotland political editor is because the organisation always has to put England first.Former BBC Scotland correspondent Kenneth MacDonald said the BBC dropped the ball with its  referendum coverage and this was because of colleagues from England. The BBC admitted it alienated independence supporters but still has not explained what it’s doing to win back their trust.When you listen to the BBC news, it’s about England, not Scotland. That’s because  per cent of the population lives down south. Power and network commissioning is all centred in England. And it’s well known that the BBC doesn’t spend as much in Scotland as it takes in licence fees. As in the Union, Scotland will never be an equal citizen in the BBC orbit. You loseyou are born in a Celtic nation.The BBC has helped separate Scotland from rUK, as has Brexit and nearly  years of enduring a Westminster Government Scots did not elect.Once Scotland regains its independence, it needs to establish a Scottish Public Broadcasting Corporation to reflect the ersity of opinion, culture and dynamism within Scotland.I’m certain most Scots wish Sarah Smith well in her new position covering the US. I just hope she develops a thicker skin, because over there, she’ll need it.Leah Gunn Barrett, Edinburgh.COULD SCOTLAND EMULATE TEAM GB IT was an uplting experience towards the end of the Winter Olympics in Beijing to be proud to be Scottish and British, as many are, with the men’s curling team, led by Bruce Mouat, winning silver and the women’s team, led by Eve Muirhead, winning gold . One was made proud not only by the sporting prowess of the two curling teams, but also by their demeanour.Team GB received £ million from lottery money and part of that was allocated to curling, which no doubt helped the curlers to reach the high standard of play required to be successful at the top levels. While the expenditure on curling was more than justied by the results, that on some other sports was much less so. In Your Guide To An Independent Scotland Scotland’s Future, published in advance of the  Referendum, the SNP stated: \"On independence the National Lottery will continue to operate in Scotland. People will still be able to play National Lottery games, and the infrastructure enabling them to do so will remain in place\" and further: \"We will ensure that Scotland continues to receive our fair share of funding from the National Lottery.\"Is the SNP, in advance of the admittedly-unlikely event of there being a second independence referendum any time soon, likely to provide assurance, come independence, that adequate funding will be available not only to encourage young people to take up sport and to improve their talents, but also to develop the skills of those with the talent to perform in the top ranks internationally as recently displayed by the Team GB curling teams Ian W Thomson, Lenzie.* AS we enthusiastically congratulate Scotland’s curlers for amazingly delivering gold and silver medals at the Beijing Winter Olympics, which represented GB’s total of two medals, we should also congratulate overall winners Norway.With a similar population to Scotland, the Norwegians miraculously amassed a total of  medals with  gold medals, being four more than Germany, seven more than China, and eight more than the United States. Regrettably and perhaps unsurprisingly given the poor performance of GB overall, the BBC and most of the UK mainstream media provided few,any, updates on the medal table, in stark contrast to coverage of the Summer Olympics held in Tokyo, Rio and London. More importantly, Norway’s hugely better performance raises questions about the financial support for UK sports, and in particular whether the limited and selectively targeted support provided through Lottery funds is sufficient, not only to help win medals across a greater number of sports but to signicantly boost participation levels across all sports, especially those sports where at present there may be few prospects of winning medals.As we all wish for our planet to be made more habitable and we strive as iniduals to become fitter and healthier, is it not time for the UK Government to commit more of its resources to maximising the wellbeing of all of its citizens rather than to maximising the profits of wealthy friends and party donors Stan Grodynski, Longniddry.IN POWER TO STAY THERE have been a number of letters saying that, objective achieved, the SNP will dissipate like snow aff a dyke. I cant think of any countries in the last  years where, on gaining independence, the winner did not remain in power, often for many years.Alistair Tuach, Dumbarton.Read more: Shame on the SNP for its ignorant stance on nuclear power"},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-vaccine-passports-scrapped-changes-face-mask-rules","story":"The Covid certicates, first introduced in October, are currently required for entry into large events such as football matches or concerts, as well as venues such as nightclubs, with customers showing proof of either vaccination or a negative Covid test. The scheme will be dropped from February . Nicola Sturgeon said the approach to Covid in the months and years ahead will \"rely predominantly on vaccines, treatments, and sensible public health behaviours and adaptations\".A legal requirement to wear face masks in indoor settings such as shops and public transport will also be replaced by guidance from March  \"assuming no signicant adverse developments\" in Covids trajectory, but will continue to be \"strongly recommended\" by the Scottish Government.: The truth about claims Covid jabs driving massive infections in vaccinated Scots However, the First Minister told MSPs that access to testing in Scotland will continue \"on broadly the same terms\" for now, with the public encouraged to test themselves for Covid twice weekly using lateral flow devices and to continue to isolate for up to  daysinfected.Ms Sturgeon added that LFDs will remain free of charge during a \"transition phase\" until Spring, and that the Scottish Government will seek to continue to provide them freely in future.\" alt\"HeraldScotland: The Strategic Framework indicates that non-essential venues could be forced to close in futurea new iant with signicant immune escape and which caused severe disease emerged \" class\"editor-image\"The Strategic Framework indicates that non-essential venues could be forced to close in futurea new iant with signicant immune escape and which caused severe disease emergedThe details come as the Scottish Government published its revised Strategic Framework, which outlines how the Covid threat will be gauged and managed in future based on a sliding scale from low to medium to high. A high risk scenario envisions the emergence of a new dominant iant which is both more severe and more transmissible. In exceptional situations - where the iant had signicant immune escape, blunting the effectiveness of vaccines, and also increased disease severity - legal limits on gatherings and forced closure of some non-essential venues could be reintroduced.Source: Scottish GovernmentA medium risk scenario would involve a iant which is either more transmissible or more severe compared to Omicron, but not both. Ms Sturgeon said the current threat level from the highly-transmissible Omicron iant is considered medium, but is expected to be re-assessed as low in the weeks ahead. It comes just  hours after the Prime Minister confirmed that all of Englands legal restrictions will end on Thursday - including the requirement to self-isolate for those who test positive.This has been enforceable through fines in England, but isolation will instead become official guidance from Thursday before shting to a matter of \"personal responsibility\" from April.  : Should Scotland follow England and scrap self-isolation Free mass testing will also stop in England from April , with implications for the resources available to devolved administrations. Scottish ministers have called for clarity about what funding will continue to be available given that mass testing is a UK-wide initiative.Monthly UK spending on PCR and lateral flow testing combined reached a record £ billion in January. Ms Sturgeon said the Scottish Government is \"determined to retain a robust testing system\" including extensive PCR sampling and processing capacity wastewater sampling and genomic sequencing capability.\"This surveillance capacity will help us identy new threats rapidly,\" said Ms Sturgeon.\"It will also help us assess the potential severity of any new threat and quickly determine the appropriate level of response.\"The First Minister said the Scottish Government would set out a more detailed plan in March for how Scotlands Test  Protect regime will evolve, adding that she hopes by then to have \"more clarity from the UK government on available resources\". Ms Sturgeon said it was \"reasonable\" to scale down on mass, population-wide testing of asymptomatic iniduals, but that this had to be done \"in a careful, phased manner\". A future \"targeted system\", she said, will prioritise \"surveillance rapid detection of and response to new iants effective outbreak management, particularly in high risk settings like care homes and hospitals and ensuring access to care and treatment for those who need it\". Lateral flow tests remain free at least until April, when their availability will be restricted in England, but Ms Sturgeon said they \"should remain free of charge for any circumstance in which  government recommends testing\". \"This is a principle we will seek to uphold in our longer term plan,\" she added. Self-isolation support grants of £ for those on low incomes remain in place.: GP patients want phone appointments to continue -

for example,free LFDs are no longer available to all.However, estimates based on comparing confirmed Covid cases in the UK against prevalence of the virus from the Office for National Statistics household surveillance suggest that at present anything from half to three quarters of cases in the community are not being detected. Given that people are unlikely to be isolatingthey have not tested positive, this has led some scientists to question how signicant the impact would now be of ending self-isolation as a rule."},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access as we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive £ for two months offer here. From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expect ground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content – as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far -

The fault for this chaos lies at the door of the SNP government, which has shown themselves to be incompetent. They should be protecting our island communities. Instead, theyre putting them at peril.

For sure, for a player and for a striker, it’s very important to improve, to beat records.“Records are important but, at the same time, it’s also important at the end of your career to lt trophies because onlyyou win and lt trophies can you go into the story of the club. vw,vw,px, px\"Harry Kane celebrates a goal for Spurs “My task in this moment is to try and improve him.

We have to train for these three or four months to try to improve and then continue to build something important.“But I understand then that every single player has to make the best decision at the end of the season.”Kane suffered a knock to his back at Manchester City – where he put in a dazzling display, scoring two goals and having a hand in the other.Kane’s importance to the Spurs side is obvious, even without considering they have no back-up striker, and Conte tapped into his humour to make the point. vw,vw,px, px\"Harry Kane holds his back during the win over Manchester City “He had a hit in his back but he has to play!” the Italian said. “If he has one leg he has to play.“Harry knows very well the importance he has on the squad for his personality, for his experience.

He’s not getting that much pain”.However, Mr Johnson and Downing Street insisted this was only the “first barrage” of measures, where “very high net wealth iniduals” Gennady Timchenko, Boris Rotenberg and Igor Rotenberg – who he described as “cronies” of the Russian president – were targeted.The sanctions, which include UK asset freezes, a travel ban and prohibition on British iniduals and businesses dealing with them, were also tabled against Russian banks Rossiya, IS Bank, General Bank, Promsvyazbank and the Black Sea Bank.But Tom Keatinge, the director of the Centre for Financial Crime and Security Studies at the The Royal United Services Institutesaid the measures were “essentially taking a peashooter to a gunfight”.Ms Truss said Britain will “use every lever at our disposal to stopin his tracks”.Writing in The Times, Ms Truss said: “Nothing is off the table.”She said: “We have a long list of those complicit in the actions of the Russian leadership. Should Russia refuse to pull back its troops we can keep turning up the heat, targeting more banks, elites and companies of signicance.” vw,vw,px, px\"Russian president Vladimir Putin . In Europe, the  EU member states unanimously agreed to a package of measures.In a press conference, the EU’s foreign affairs policy chief Josep Borrell said  members of the Russian State Duma who “votedthis violation of international law” would be sanctioned.He said that in addition “ iniduals and entities who are playing a role in undermining or threatening Ukrainian territorial integrity, sovereignty, and independence” would face measures.In perhaps the most signicant intervention, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz took the step of blocking the certication of the Nord Stream  pipeline that would have supplied gas directly from Russia to Germany.Meanwhile, in a statement from the White House, US President Joe Biden told reporters: “We’re implementing full blocking sanctions on two large Russian financial institutions, VEB and their military bank.“We’re implementing comprehensive sanctions on Russian sovereign debt. That means we’ve cut off Russia’s government from Western financing, it can no longer raise money from the West and cannot trade in its new debt on our markets or European markets either.”At every step, we have shown that the United States and our Allies and partners are working in unison.We are united in our support for Ukraine.We are united in our opposition to Russia’s aggression.We are united in our resolve to defend our Alliance.— President BidenFebruary , He also said there would be sanctions against “Russia’s elites and their family members”.Earlier, Russia’s ambassador to the UK was told his country would “pay the price for its actions” after he was summoned to the Foreign Office.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645089617694.jpg--1_700_people_apply_for_a_life_less_ordinary_with_stena_line.jpg?1645089617000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220217news1 700 people apply for a life less ordinary with stena line","story":"Ferry company Stena Line has been overwhelmed with the positive response from the public to its recent recruitment campaign ‘A Le Less Ordinary’, which aims to fill  vacant positions onboard its Irish Sea ferries. , applications were received from people across the UK and Republic of Ireland.

Forty impact statements from businesses affected have also been forwarded to the council.John Clark of Gordons Chemist told councillors his staff at the Cornmarket store said the High Street entrance was regularly blocked off by street preachers. He said: “Staff talked about how people came into the pharmacy saying they felt threatened, and did not want to come down Cornmarket running that cordon of preachers.”He added: “Myself and the company have absolutely no issue with preaching, we have no issue with there being rules about these sorts of things. But what we are experiencing goes way and above simple preaching. The issues are also about the noise coming from them, from musicians, and mainly, the use of ampliers.”He said: “We operate confidential pharmacy services. We have had many patients and customers leave the pharmacy because they couldn’t actually be heard, between the noise, them and staff wearing masks. Our staff are stressed because of the complaints, and because they can’t hear the customers who are then leaving the store.”He said: “There is an element of confidentiality, anda patient has to speak louder because of the din and racket from outside in Cornmarket, then we can’t be sure that the confidentiality is being honoured. And they feel uncomfortable, there is no doubt about that.”He added: “This is not about religion, it is about noise pollution. But also I think there needs to be immediate action in relation to anybody who is preaching homophobia and anti-Semitism. And that has been witnessed. These people are very cute. They will turn their amplier downthe police neighbourhood officer arrives.”He said: “It has been said to me before that a person doesn’t have to walk past the preacher or musician. Well actually our staff have absolutely no say in that. They have to work  from nine in the morning to six at night and are subjected to this all of the hours it happens. They can’t leave, they can’t go up a dferent street. The council must be cognisant of that fact.”Geraldine Duggan, of Belfast City Centre Management said: “Coming out of those business impact statements very clearly is the effect these activities have on the mental health of employees. It’s not just about the bottom line and profitability, it is about the health of the employees.”Starbucks regional area manager Barbara McMaster added: “The noise level and the impact on staff is horrendous at times. The groups will have a stand-off, the homophobic group will start shouting louder than the preaching group, and it just escalates and escalates,” she added.“We have a very erse staff, and they have to run the gauntlet with all that. They have no choice but to listen, and make their way through it to get into work at Castle Lane. Some of them have been quite upset by what they have been hearing.“We have had staff been told to go back to their own country, simply because they couldn’t be heard, despite their language skills being excellent. That has a very detrimental effect.“We had a leaver last week who said one of the reasons he left was the antisocial behaviour in the city centre and what he has to deal with, and having to listen to the homophobic abuse in the city centre at certain times of the day.“It is intimidating, some of the language that is used is insulting, and it is deafening at times. We need to do something holistically to sort this out.”Sinn Fein councillor Christina Black said: “I think we need to recognise there is an issue with Cornmarket. The atmosphere is negative, and feels confrontational. It is not welcoming presently.“Everyone has the right to protest, to gather, to express their own views, but there are definitely points in the city centre where it is not conducive to a good retail, visiting or even walking experience for people who live in the city.”Alliance councillor Michael Long said: “It has been fascinating to hear how this impacts on staff, and that there is a responsibility here because staff are being traumatised.”He added: “This really is putting off people going into shops close by. It is something very worrying, and there is a depressing atmosphere around it. It is not what we want when we are trying to get people back into our city centre.” Most ReadShow at Lyric Theatre cut short after cast complain about behaviour of audienceMichelle O’Neill criticised over IRA memorial launch at Tyrone GAA clubBelfast’s Cathedral Quarter is a dump, says top chefChristopher Stalford funeral: Service for DUP MLA to be held on SaturdayBow Street Mall Lisburn: Man arrested on suspicion of carrying an imitation firearmTop VideosPlayVideo: Heavily armed police storm Bow Street Mall after reports of man with gun and knePlayBelfast publican hits out at council over state of Belfast Cathedral Quarter areaPlayVideo: The worst Irish accents in film history - Brad Pitt as ‘Mickey O’Neil’ in Snatch - Strong LanguageLatest Northern IrelandLuke Turner helps Cltonville crank up the Irish League title pressure on Linfield and GlentoranTerror at the shopping mall after rampage by ‘armed’ manBoho families feel cut adrt by government as floods prevent access to essential servicesGAA set to issue guidance as Tyrone club is criticised for memorial to IRA menNI health minister warns he will not be rushed into Covid test decisionsLatestJude Law and Mads Mikkn face off in new Harry Potter spinoff filmEx-Crimewatch presenter Nick Ross to pick up CBE at Windsor Castle ceremonyKate to meet Queen Margrethe on final day of Denmark visitWhat the papers say – February Prosecutor: Police ‘chose to do nothing’ as officer kneeled on Floyd’s neck,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

You might have got Niall at a bad day, but this place is not a dump.When askedthe Cathedral Quarter is a #dump#, Mr Jack said the area is not what it once was.It was a lot more artistic before the speculators came in... The council could do more, but too many people are staying at home and are just talking about Belfast, when Belfast needs to be the driver for the province, he said.The people at the top of a lot of organisations are far removed from understanding what Belfast needs. They don#t come down and see it. Certainly,  years ago, it was a lot more artistic and a lot safer, in my opinion.How do we solve it  I think we need join up people coming down at night to actually see what#s going on. We certainly pay enough in rates, we pay almost £, for two premises and we don#t get good value.Flora Herberich of Circusful, the Belfast circus school, said the Cathedral Quarter is a destination for visitors.She said: I wouldn#t call it a dump. Some places have closed down because of Covid and hopefully they#ll reopen again soon. North Street Arcade is lying derelict and there#s the empty Northern Bank building, so there is space to regenerate the area more.”Most ReadShow at Lyric Theatre cut short after cast complain about behaviour of audienceMichelle O’Neill criticised over IRA memorial launch at Tyrone GAA clubBelfast’s Cathedral Quarter is a dump, says top chefChristopher Stalford funeral: Service for DUP MLA to be held on SaturdayBow Street Mall Lisburn: Man arrested on suspicion of carrying an imitation firearmTop VideosPlayVideo: Heavily armed police storm Bow Street Mall after reports of man with gun and knePlayBelfast publican hits out at council over state of Belfast Cathedral Quarter areaPlayVideo: Paula Bradley pays tribute to Christopher Stalford - I have lost a dear dear friendLatest Northern IrelandLuke Turner helps Cltonville crank up the Irish League title pressure on Linfield and GlentoranTerror at the shopping mall after rampage by ‘armed’ manBoho families feel cut adrt by government as floods prevent access to essential servicesBelfast city centre shop staff being ‘traumatised’ by street preachers with ampliers, council toldGAA set to issue guidance as Tyrone club is criticised for memorial to IRA menLatestEx-Crimewatch presenter Nick Ross to pick up CBE at Windsor Castle ceremonyKate to meet Queen Margrethe on final day of Denmark visitWhat the papers say – February Prosecutor: Police ‘chose to do nothing’ as officer kneeled on Floyd’s neckWeird Al Yankovic shares first image of Daniel Radclfe in upcoming biopic,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Everything we did we did together.”Despite being a dedicated politician and DUP member from an early age, his friend said that he was able to unite people of all political beliefs and none.“We never talked about politics, obviously I would have asked about his career and what he wanted to do, but politics never came up,” he said.The -year-old Deputy Speaker of the assembly was married to Laura with whom he had four children.“His wit was unbelievable as was his intelligence, I was in awe of how much information he could retain.“But it was his kids and Laura that were his le.“I remember when he and Laura started dating in school and it was just an instant attraction. We all knew after about six months of them dating that was it, that was who Chris was going to end up with.“In the last few days people have said what a devoted family man he was, but Laura was equally devoted to him.“They were a team, she was his support, she was his rock. Whatever he wanted to do with his career she backed him. They were teenage sweethearts, they were destined to spend their entire le together. they were a team both at home and professionally, she was his biggest supporter.”Mr Caughey-Rogers said the death of his closest friend “still hasn’t set in”.“I have spoke to a few of our old friends, to be honest we are still not at the point of being able to deal with the fact that he’s not going to be here.“The type of person Chris was, he could bring anyone together and you could see that in the unity in the response to his passing. “It’ll be strange going back home and not arranging to go out for a drink with him. Any time I knew I was coming home I would have messaged and arrange to meet up, I can’t imagine coming home and not seeing my friend. He is such a loss, to his friends, his family and his community”.Read MoreMark Bain:OpinionPolitically ided, but Stormont parties unite in grief and respect for Christopher StalfordRelated topicsChristopher StalfordKeir StarmerNorthern Ireland AssemblyMore On Christopher StalfordChristopher Stalford funeral: Service for DUP MLA to be held on SaturdayAnti-Protocol rally postponed as ‘mark of respect’ following death of DUP’s Christopher Stalford PremiumPortrait showed how important family’s love was for ChristopherKey dates in le and political career of the late DUP politician Christopher StalfordWarm tributes paid across political benches at Stormont to Christopher StalfordMost ReadShow at Lyric Theatre cut short after cast complain about behaviour of audienceMichelle O’Neill criticised over IRA memorial launch at Tyrone GAA clubBelfast’s Cathedral Quarter is a dump, says top chefChristopher Stalford funeral: Service for DUP MLA to be held on SaturdayBow Street Mall Lisburn: Man arrested on suspicion of carrying an imitation firearmTop VideosPlayVideo: Heavily armed police storm Bow Street Mall after reports of man with gun and knePlayBelfast publican hits out at council over state of Belfast Cathedral Quarter areaPlayVideo: The worst Irish accents in film history - Brad Pitt as ‘Mickey O’Neil’ in Snatch - Strong LanguageLatest Northern IrelandLuke Turner helps Cltonville crank up the Irish League title pressure on Linfield and GlentoranTerror at the shopping mall after rampage by ‘armed’ manBoho families feel cut adrt by government as floods prevent access to essential servicesBelfast city centre shop staff being ‘traumatised’ by street preachers with ampliers, council toldGAA set to issue guidance as Tyrone club is criticised for memorial to IRA menLatestJude Law and Mads Mikkn face off in new Harry Potter spinoff filmEx-Crimewatch presenter Nick Ross to pick up CBE at Windsor Castle ceremonyKate to meet Queen Margrethe on final day of Denmark visitWhat the papers say – February Prosecutor: Police ‘chose to do nothing’ as officer kneeled on Floyd’s neck,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Party politics was set aside. Only one item was on the agenda. The House paid its respects and heard the fine words of tribute to Christopher Stalford.One by one his colleagues and rivals stood to deliver the words they did not wish to say. And it was, in a strange way, lovely to hear them say these words and know they meant every one of them.Gone were the tones of bitterness. Gone, too, the cutting cross-party interjections, those with which Christopher Stalford was so prolic during his time in the Assembly.Speaker Alex Maskey opened the Assembly and told of how their backgrounds came from dferent perspectives of le here, but how they had formed a very positive working relationship.But it will be among the ranks of the DUP that Christopher Stalford will be most missed by those who knew him best.As Mr Maskey gave way to DUP deputy leader, Paula Bradley, she stood, wearing black and clutching a handkerchief. You could tell tears were not far away as she began by saying she wished to “honour and give thanks for the le of our much-loved friend and esteemed colleague”.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseAn emotional DUP deputy leader Paula Bradley pays her respects FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueAn emotional DUP deputy leader Paula Bradley pays her respectsShe added: “Words cannot adequately explain the sense of pain and loss that is felt on these benches. Christopher’s joy came not in holding office but in how he could use that office to improve the everyday lives of those he was honoured to represent. It was a mark of the man that he had friends on all sides of this chamber.”Very quickly that became apparent. Across the chamber, Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey led the tributes from Sinn Fein due to the absence of Michelle O’Neill, who’s self-isolating at home due to Covid.She said: “Sadness has fallen upon this chamber. No words can describe the shock, anguish and pain his family is feeling.“I first met Mr Stalford at Belfast City Council and instantly thought he was older than me due to his mannerisms and the attire of his pinstriped suit, initially thinking this was the instructed unorm of all DUP councillors at that time.“He enjoyed the cut and thrust of debate in committees and the debating chamber. While our politics dfered, we shared similarities, growing up in working-class communities in south Belfast.”Mrs O’Neill later tweeted: “I’m struck by the shared sense of loss across the political spectrum. I am reminded that there is far more that unites us than ides us. Rest in peace Christopher.”For almost two-and-half hours, tributes came from all corners of the house, and MLAs also stood respectfully in a minute’s silence.From the SDLP, Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon said: “This is a very sombre day for our Assembly, but particularly for Christopher Stalford’s friends and colleagues in the DUP.“I got to know a man who was challenging, argumentative, ambitious, some may even say combative, during debates, but also a man who was kind, quick-witted, fiercely intelligent and very funny. Christopher Stalford was unique.”Ulster Unionist leader Doug Beattie echoed what many in the Assembly had felt when they heard the tragic news.“My heart sank,” he said.“I have no quick quip to truly outline the person that we all knew, that we all had interactions with. Christopher was unique, absolutely unique. He was a fierce debater. I didn’t just like Christopher Stalford, I was jealous of Christopher Stalford.”There was none of the usual passion from TUV leader Jim Allister, a man rarely lost for words. In fact, they struggled to come today.The tributes continued throughout the session, but perhaps most enlightening was the insight into the person behind the political mask worn in public.The anecdotes from committee rooms and back corridors of power, even the tales of casual conversations between rivals MLAs. Not agreeing about something doesn’t always mean the respect, even the friendship, of those from rival parties doesn’t exist.Alliance leader Naomi Long said: “I did not expect this morning, that I would be standing here paying tribute to him in these circumstances. But it doesn’t surprise me at all that my last conversation with him was about his children and his family, because they were at the heart of everything he did.”Those on the sharpest end of his tongue will miss his presence too.Sinn Fein’s Emma Sheerin added: “You knew that when you met him outside you’d be met with warmth, a bit of craic, good humour, and a genuine friendly comment.”Her party colleague, John O’Dowd, said: “Christopher Stalford was a formidable political opponent.

When it was announced that the new curator would be serving both Newry and Downpatrick this caused great consternation.ldquoWe can understand that frustration and since our local councils were brought together seven years ago where parity should have existed between Newry, Mourne and Down, it has felt that the legacy Down area has been left behind somewhat.ldquoWe have to be straightforward about the facts and Downpatrick is the county town. This carries major signicance. The historical and ecclesiastical heritage of Downpatrick is equally signicant, as is our links to St Patrick. The museum in Downpatrick is the Down County Museum and must be treated as such.The SDLP politicians say while they appreciate the local authorityrsquos need for a curator that serves both Downpatrick and Newry, they are firmly on the view that the curator must be based in Downpatrick.Cllr Enright confirmed that he and Cllr Brown have also been meeting with the Friends of the Museum over the past few weeks and will be calling for a special motion on the restructuring plan to be debated publicly at next monthrsquos full council meeting.ldquoThe council proposal makes no sense whatsoever at all to promote the relatively insignicant Bagelrsquos Castle in Newry over the Down County Museum which is one of the premier professional conservancy and historical centres in Northern Ireland, added Cllr Enright.Cllr Brownrsquos motion calls for a full-time curator to be based at and responsible for the Down County Museum and that the existing curatorial posts of keeper and assistant keeper of collections are permanently filled and not downgraded, with the vital and highly skilled role of the museumrsquos technician photographer also retained and not downgraded.ldquoI am calling for council officers to develop, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, a new, long-term strategic plan for how the council can most effectively invest in museums across the district, he confirmed.ldquoCouncillors are highly concerned by the plans to downgrade staff provision at the Down County Museum and to base the only full-time museum curator in Newry.

Arrested in Belfast in September , he was a prisoner in Dublin when the Rising raged in  and was despatched along with other State prisoners to Fort George in Scotland the following year.Liberated in , Russell threw himself back into revolutionary politics in support of Robert Emmetrsquos ill-fated coup by attempting to raise once again the standard of rebellion in Co Down. After an anticlimactic call to arms in Loughinisland in July , Russell escaped the county only to be arrested in Dublin and ed to Downpatrick for trial and execution.One of the earliest collections acquired four decades ago by the fledgling Down County Museum was a small parcel of documents relating to the trial of Thomas Russell.The documents include the order from the viceroy, Lord Hardwicke, to initiate proceedings against Russell and the list of jurors who would decide his fate, not that it was ever in doubt. Also contained within the collection is a series of fascinating depositions sworn before local gentry which condemned not only Russell, but two Co Down men, James Corry and James Drake, to execution.The improbability of success for the  Rising is revealed in the deposition of Patrick Doran from Annadorn, who said that ldquonone but fools andmadmen would endorse a Rising so soon after the sobering experience of . Doranrsquos deposition goes on to describe Russellrsquos green Generalrsquos coat, decorated with gold lace and rich epaulettes.Another deposition, from Hugh Magennis, of Ballydugan, provides us with the vivid impression of Russellrsquos ldquomilitary step and appearance, while William Cosby of Saintfield described the mysterious stranger of Wilsonrsquos ballad as a ldquolarge handsome looking man.Such witness statements helped to deliver a guilty verdict and Russell was executed outside the County Gaol, now Down County Museum, on Friday, October , . He was buried in the parish churchyard his gravestone arranged and paid for by the indomitable Mary Ann McCracken of Belfast.These documents held in Down County Museum shed considerable light on an episode of local history that had profound national signicance. Scholars of th century Ireland have visited the museum to consult its rich archive and conferences staged there to discuss the sitersquos deep imprint on Irish history and memory.The size and quality of its collections and the historical importance of its buildings underpin the importance of the internationally-recognised Down County Museum.The ongoing depletion of its highly-qualied and committed staff, which under Newry, Mourne and Down Council proposals now appears to include only a part-time curator, the replacement of the keeper of collections and an assistant with two new positions at a signicantly lower grade, and the removal of the important position of a photographer technician, reflects a disregard for the heritage industry in the county and represents an insult to the hundreds of donors who presented valued family possessions to Down County Museum in the good faith that the Council would preserve, celebrate and cherish them.The fear of many is that the downgrading of the Museum mdash for that is what this is mdash will lead to a reluctance among the public to donate artefacts to the collection and undermine applications for the funding of future projects.The public knows exactly what kind of jewel we have in Down County Museum. One can only hope that a broader awareness of the worrying impact of the Councilrsquos vision will create a clamour whereby the lsquoWrong should cease and the Right prevailrsquo..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Drumaness A and B square off  ","story":"THE ladies of Drumaness B, still buoyant from their win over Strangford B, were unable to repeat another giant killing act against their club-mates, Drumaness A.But in a good glamoured match attended by the league secretary, they can be pleased with their team performance while the result was never in doubt.The title holders conceding  points to the B teammade sure that they got enough points in every game to stay ahead of the have-a-go opposition.Pat Mulholland started the ball rolling with a  pointwinning margin against Philomena Rogan before Charlie Murray added another  points in his match with Katy Rice and Hugh Scott collected a similar winning margin over Norma Gilgunn for an overall score of  points.The ladies were more resolute in the next round of matches and were more content in their performance than points and finished the match with a respectable score overall..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"East Down AC  ","story":"LAST Wednesday some of the East Down AC juniors headed to Mallusk for the Ulster Schoolsrsquo Cross Country Championships.On this occasion they were running in school colours rather than the red and yellow of East Down AC but several of the club coaches were in attendance and watching with interest.The athletes had to qualy for the honour of racing at this level through an inidual top  place or as part of a team that came in the top three at the district qualiers.Although the course was fairly flat and the ground mostly firm underfoot, the long flat stretches were interspersed with a sharp, slippy rises and muddy turns so runners had to choose whether to run wide for safer footing or risk slipping by following the shortest route.The squally showers and very strong gusty winds were an added challenge.Jessica Martinrepresenting Victoria College Belfast over a distance of m came th out of a field of  runners in a time of ..Year Nine girlshad four EDAC runners in the pack Erin Moore, Cara Napier and Charlotte Barr.

A summer festival could focus on this heritage which can be linked with the increase in walking in the Mournes.Cllr Clarke believes there should also be a nautical aspect of a new summer festival, celebrating the rich maritime history of the area.He added: ldquoThere is potential to build on the resortrsquos outdoor water sports or perhaps launch a regional dish competition, opportunities which present the chance to showcase everything is good about Newcastle for visitors and locals alike..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Final four spot for Down High  ","story":"DOWN Highrsquos first XV entertained familiar rivals Omagh Academy in Downpatrick on Saturday morning for their quarter-final tie in the Danske Bank Subsidiary Shield.The two sides met in the opening fixture of the season with Omagh winning - on that occasion.The game didnrsquot get off to an ideal start for Down High when in the first minute, number eight, Rhodri Phillips, made an uncharacteristic error that provided Omagh with a  to cross for an unconverted try in the corner.Within minutes Phillips had made amends when he finished off an excellent Down High multi-phase attack scoring under the posts and leaving himself with a straightforward conversion which he duly slotted over.Omagh, who were playing with the strong wind on their backs in the opening half, applied most of the pressure for the next period of the game and after Joseph Dooley was carded for an accumulation of penalties by the home side, Omagh opted for the posts and added three points to regain the lead.In the th minute, a Down attack that was reminiscent of the one that had led to their opening score, brought play deep into Omagh territory where captain, Cameron McCaughey, showed great footwork and power to e over under the sticks for a try which Phillips easily converted.Omagh were not to leave the first half without reply.

Nineteen other councillors, from the SDLP, Ulster Unionists, DUP and Alliance voted in favour.A lively debate was sparked by the SDLPrsquos Mr John Doris and involved  other councillors.Mr Doris said while he was keen to support the charity which will benefit from the drag hunt the council has money invested in Delamont and he felt it was ldquoinappropriate for the horses and hounds to go across the council track of land.He said the Delamont country park is taking shape very well and it would be ldquovery unwise to allow it to be used in this way.Mr Doris told councillors it would be ldquofoolish even to allow a drag hunt on an experimental basis.He said there is no guarantee that the hunt will stay on the periphery of Delamont.Party colleague, Mr Cathal O Baoill, argued in favour of permitting the hunt. He said the type of person who is a hunting, shooting and fishing man, like something from the Irish RM, is a major tourist attraction. It is a section of the countryside and a major cultural aspect which should be preserved.He pointed out thatthe hunt is successful, it will result in a smelly bag being torn apart.DOWNPATRICK ndash An alternative line has been suggested this week for the poundm Downpatrick town centre by-pass.Down Ulster Unionist councillor, Mr William Biggerstaff, is suggesting that the road could be constructed along part of the route of the former railway line.Mr Biggerstaff believes thatthe line is adopted by the Department of Environment, it will considerably reduce the costs of the provision.ldquoI would envisage incorporating part of the old railway line embankment as the foundation for a new roads system, said Mr Biggerstaff.He expressed concern that the Government-backed regeneration of Downpatrick will be hampered by the failure to resolve the traffic problem.ldquoThere will be no point in regenerating Downpatrickthere isnrsquot road network facility to make use of, she said.ldquoAfter meeting officials of the Department, it is my view that the by-pass will eventually go ahead. Indeed in the view of many people the road will have to go ahead.Another councillor has already suggested a dferent potential line which is understood to cut through part of the Down High School playing fields.CLOUGH ndash Clough Presbyterian Church Hall was built in , is being demolished to make way for a car park beside the new hall which is nearing completion.However, not all of the historic structure is being discarded. The original pitch pine rafters, Bangor Blue slates and main entrance doors have been kept. The congregation formally bade farewell to the hall during a recent thanksgiving service which church minister, Rev Robert Craig, pointed out its important to the congregation over a period of almost  years.The new hall will be officially opened by the Moderator of the Presbyterian Church, the Rev Rodney Sterritt, in April.NEWCASTLE ndash Health chiefs have voted ldquoin principle for the closure of a Newcastle holiday home for mentally handicapped people.A proposal to close Navan House, on the Tollymore Road, has been overwhelmingly backed by the Southern Health Board.A final decision on the homersquos future will be taken after a period of consultation likely to last a couple of months.Navan House is the second public sector home in Newcastle to be earmarked for closure. The Eastern Health Board has announced that intends closing Mourne House residential home for the elderly, despite a strong protest lobby.A spokesman for the Southern Board said last weekrsquos vote was ldquototally unanimous and followed preliminary discussions with staff and patientsrsquo relatives.The two-storey building, which was built in the rsquos, was turned into a holiday home for the mentally handicapped in . At one stage it provided holiday accommodation for  patients.With the Board running down its holiday operations at Navan House in recent years, it is now being used as an extension of the Boardrsquos mental health hospital in Armagh and contains  patients.The spokesman said the decision to close is in line with Board policy aimed at ing people to the community.ldquoNavan House costs around pound, a year to run. The Board believes this money could be better spent developing community services, he continued.The spokesman said a final decision will only be taken following consultations with patients, staff, local councillors and community groups.ldquoThere is a general recognition that we should have fewer long-stay patients in mental hospitals. There is no need to retain a facility which is  miles away from the main hospital in Armagh, the spokesman added.CROSSGAR ndash SDLP MP, Mr Eddie McGrady, has reported success in his campaign to have the mains water system in the Crossgar Killyleagh area improved.The South Down MP pointed out that after serious supply problems just before Christmas  he took the meter up with the Minister, Mr Richard Needham.ldquoI am now pleased that the Department having considered a study is designing a scheme to lay a waterman from Raleigh to New Line, Crossgar, which will increase the reliability of the supply to the Killyleagh and Shirley areas. This work should commence later this year, said Mr McGrady.ldquoThis study also identied the need to replace two watermains in Killyleagh. One of these on the Downpatrick Roa has already been replaced and work to replace the other at Kerry Drive should be completed by the end of this month.ldquoThis is indeed welcome news and hopefully the new waterman will enhance the standard of supply in these areas, added Mr McGrady.SAINTFIELD ndash A lamb processing plant providing up to  jobs is being planned for Mid Down.A facility handling , lamb carcasses a year could be up and running within twelve months, it was announced this week.A number of green-field sites in the Saintfield, Crossgar and Ballygowan areas are being considered, with construction work could begin in August.The main behind the scheme is Mr Alex Waugh, a director of the Newtownards-based company, Milltown Livestock and Meats.A separate company led by Mr Waugh is currently involved in discussions with the Industrial Development Board, the Department of Agriculture, the Planning Service and other government agencies.ldquoThere are a lot of hurdles to cross, but I am confident the factory will be built. Initially, we would hope to employ  people, rising to around  with two years, Mr Waugh said.ldquoThis will be an ultra-modern processing plant in the provincersquos main sheep producing area. I have spoken to many farmers and I am encouraged by their remarks, he continued.ldquoWe do not have a sheep processing plant in Northern Ireland and only three abbatoirs have slaughtering facilities for sheep. At present, less than half of our lambs are processed in the province.Mr Waugh said the plant will provide an opportunity for the sheep industry to gain a larger shore of the important British and European markets.Mr Waugh added: ldquoWe are progressing as quickly as possible and hope to get started by August or September. If that happens, there is no reason why we cannot be in production by next April..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Kilcoo win All Ireland  ","story":"KILCOOrsquos triumphant senior footballers ed home to jubilant scenes on Saturday night after their dramatic extra-time win over the much-fancied Kilmacaud Crokes in a pulsating All-Ireland Club final at Croke Park.Hundreds of supporters gathered outside the clubhouse at Paacuteirc Eoghan Rua as the Andy Merrigan Cup was proudly laid on the village pitch for the first time ever.Indeed it was the first time that the coveted All-Ireland title was back in Down since the all-conquering Burren side brought it home in .After one of the most dramatic finals in recent history last weekend, Kilcoo players finally got their hands on the trophy, confirming the sidersquos place as the best in Ireland.After going so close in  when the Galway-based Corofin snatched the cup from the locals in extra time, there was no heartache last weekend with Kilcoorsquos late late show securing victory.Amid wild celebrations at the final whistle, assistant manager Conleth Gilligan spoke of an ldquoenormous sense of relief.He continued: ldquoWe are delighted to get over the line, for so many reasons.

They say residents have been looking for a modern leisure complex for over two decades.Council chairwoman, Cathy Mason, was one of a number of local politicians provided with a progress report on the Newcastle project last week by senior council directors.She described confirmation of plans for new leisure facilities in Newcastle as really welcome news.She continued: ldquoThese new local amenities will be of great benefit to local residents, their families and tourists alike and I am delighted that the plans are in the final stages. The plans will include a new leisure pool and state of the art gym facilities.Cllr Mason also reaffirmed the view that the rear of the Newcastle Centre is no longer fit for purpose and, as a result, will be demolished in the near future.She continued: ldquoFor too long, the people of Newcastle have had to put up with substandard facilities. I hope to see the finalised plans for the new leisure complex and site approval in the coming months so that contractors can start working on the project as soon as possible.The council chairwoman said it is essential that the local authority ldquomoves in a timely manner to ensure the leisure centre project comes to fruition so that Newcastle residents can access the new facilities as soon as possible.Cllr Mason said Sinn Feacutein will continue to do all it can to ensure the new leisure facilities are delivered, insisting that she will continue to stand up for rural families across South Down to provide essential services in the heart of their respective communities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Roads officials urged to address pedestrian safety in Darragh Cross  ","story":"ROADS officials have been asked to consider providing a new pedestrian crossing in Darragh Cross as part of a series of measures to make the village safer.The appeal was made by Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown when he met with a local roads official in the village last week to discuss increasing concern about pedestrian safety as a result of the speed of vehicles.The Department for Infrastructure has said while there will not be a mph zone implemented in Darragh Cross due to current legislation, it has been asked to extend the current mph in force outside the villagersquos primary school and the nearby Barnamaghery Road.Cllr Brown has also asked the districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership to locate one of its electronic speed indicator signs in the village.He said the devices have helped reduce speed in other areas and believes that one in Darragh Cross would be effective with a decision on his request expected next month.ldquoA speed indicator device will help address speeding concerns in an area where children are particularly vulnerable and I would like the sign in place as soon as possible, he continued.ldquoI have also discussed with roads officials the potential opportunity for a pedestrian crossing near the main shop which would be funded by the government departmentrsquos active travel department, which would be another welcome measure for pedestrians in Darragh Cross.Cllr Brown said that as a result of his recent meeting which he described as ldquoconstructive, roads officials gave a commitment to assess safety railings in place a Manse Road.ldquoThis particular issue was raised with me last month as damage to part of the railings is adding to residentsrsquo safety concerns.

Thus it is important to be vigilant about how tensions and localised disputes can unravel in disastrous ways.There is another respect in which to be very anxious right now: the possibility that three nations that are at best wary of Europe and America, at worst positively hostile — Russia, China and Iran — could take advantage of current events in order to achieve long cherished regional goals through aggression.And evena Russian invasion of Ukraine does not lead to a wider war, it will on its own be a completely unacceptable precedent of a major international country invading, or taking territory by force, in the nd century.One of the most benign possible outcomes now is that Russia merely seizes the pro Russian enclaves in Ukraine, as it did Crimea — and even that is an utterly unacceptable abuse of power to change borders unilaterally.The immediate announcement of sanctions by a range of countries including the UK is a necessary first step but it is far from clear whether these initial penalties are enough, or whether they will even cause President Vladimir Putin much concern.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

We have to train for these three or four months to try to improve and then continue to build something important.“But I understand then that every single player has to make the best decision at the end of the season.”Kane suffered a knock to his back at Manchester City – where he put in a dazzling display, scoring two goals and having a hand in the other.Kane’s importance to the Spurs side is obvious, even without considering they have no back-up striker, and Conte tapped into his humour to make the point. vw,vw,px, px\"Harry Kane holds his back during the win over Manchester City “He had a hit in his back but he has to play!” the Italian said. “If he has one leg he has to play.“Harry knows very well the importance he has on the squad for his personality, for his experience.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe Prime Minister is likely to come under fire in the Commons on Wednesday over the punishment doled out to Kremlin-linked oligarchs and banks by the Government in response to Russian aggression.Writing in The Times Liz Truss, the Foreign Secretary, said she had held a call with G allies to “agree the next package” of sanctions, while No  insisted there was more to comeRussia did not back down from manoeuvres in eastern Ukraine where troops had been sent into the Donbas region under the guise of being “peacekeepers”. vw,vw,px, px\"Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said “nothing is off the table” to stop Putin But the PM faced criticism from all sides for not going far enough when he announced his clutch of measures on Tuesday.The Prime Minister announced that three billionaire allies of the Russian President and five Russian banks would face punitive measures.Similar sanctions have been announced by allies in the European Union and the United States.Calls have also been held between UK ministers and their counterparts in Baltic states which may feel under threat by Russia’s actions, as the US sent troops already stationed in Europe to Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in what was called a “defensive” move.But the British sanctions offering was branded as “gruel” by the Liberal Democrats’ Layla Moran, and Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said “we must be prepared to go further”.On his own benches, Mr Johnson was told by former Prime Minister Theresa May that “the battle in which we must now engage is nothing more or less than the defence of democracy itself”.Former Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that “Putin will have predicted and discounted western sanctions long ago, so does heagree thatwe are not to be behind in the diplomatic chess game, we need to do some things that he is not expecting ”..removeTobias Ellwood, Conservative chairman of the Defence Committee, said: “Sanctions alone will not be enough, indeed untargeted sanctions may play into Putin’s plan to pivot Russia ever closer to China.”Conservative former minister Mark Harper asked for assurances that Boris Johnson will implement “further and stronger measures evenPresident Putin does no more”.In the Lords, former Navy chief Lord West of Spithead said the UK and US should be preparing to make Putin’s “eyes water”.The Labour peer, a member of Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee, said Putin had “made a calculation the pain isn’t that much and I have to say at the moment I would rather agree with him. He’s not getting that much pain”.However, Mr Johnson and Downing Street insisted this was only the “first barrage” of measures, where “very high net wealth iniduals” Gennady Timchenko, Boris Rotenberg and Igor Rotenberg – who he described as “cronies” of the Russian president – were targeted.The sanctions, which include UK asset freezes, a travel ban and prohibition on British iniduals and businesses dealing with them, were also tabled against Russian banks Rossiya, IS Bank, General Bank, Promsvyazbank and the Black Sea Bank.But Tom Keatinge, the director of the Centre for Financial Crime and Security Studies at the The Royal United Services Institutesaid the measures were “essentially taking a peashooter to a gunfight”.Ms Truss said Britain will “use every lever at our disposal to stopin his tracks”.Writing in The Times, Ms Truss said: “Nothing is off the table.”She said: “We have a long list of those complicit in the actions of the Russian leadership. Should Russia refuse to pull back its troops we can keep turning up the heat, targeting more banks, elites and companies of signicance.” vw,vw,px, px\"Russian president Vladimir Putin . In Europe, the  EU member states unanimously agreed to a package of measures.In a press conference, the EU’s foreign affairs policy chief Josep Borrell said  members of the Russian State Duma who “votedthis violation of international law” would be sanctioned.He said that in addition “ iniduals and entities who are playing a role in undermining or threatening Ukrainian territorial integrity, sovereignty, and independence” would face measures.In perhaps the most signicant intervention, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz took the step of blocking the certication of the Nord Stream  pipeline that would have supplied gas directly from Russia to Germany.Meanwhile, in a statement from the White House, US President Joe Biden told reporters: “We’re implementing full blocking sanctions on two large Russian financial institutions, VEB and their military bank.“We’re implementing comprehensive sanctions on Russian sovereign debt. That means we’ve cut off Russia’s government from Western financing, it can no longer raise money from the West and cannot trade in its new debt on our markets or European markets either.”At every step, we have shown that the United States and our Allies and partners are working in unison.We are united in our support for Ukraine.We are united in our opposition to Russia’s aggression.We are united in our resolve to defend our Alliance.— President BidenFebruary , He also said there would be sanctions against “Russia’s elites and their family members”.Earlier, Russia’s ambassador to the UK was told his country would “pay the price for its actions” after he was summoned to the Foreign Office..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title:  uNothing is off the table u to stop Putin, says Foreign Secretary article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_baffabcbebe   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_aaeadabe   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645089617694.jpg--1_700_people_apply_for_a_life_less_ordinary_with_stena_line.jpg?164508961700","title":"  people apply for a life less ordinary with stena line ","story":"Ferry company Stena Line has been overwhelmed with the positive response from the public to its recent recruitment campaign ‘A Le Less Ordinary’, which aims to fill  vacant positions onboard its Irish Sea ferries. , applications were received from people across the UK and Republic of Ireland.

The positions available are part of the Onboard Sales and Servicesteam, with vacancies for service assistants and chefs. With January being the traditional time of the year when many people look for a new career, Stena Line had hoped for a favourable response but even the most optimistic of predictions could not have expected it to be so over-subscribed. Stena Line has now undertaken the initial stage of the selection process and, for the first-time, is hosting two Open Days for prospective candidates on Monday th February, where they will get a chance to meet members of Stena Line’s crews. The Open Days are taking place in Belfast and Birkenhead with the latter being held onboard one of Stena Line’s newest ferries, Stena Edda, giving candidates a chance to get a first-hand taste of le onboard on the Irish Sea. Stephen Bryden, Stena Line’s Head of Onboard Sales and Services, commented on the success of the campaign: “I am astonished by the public’s response to the A Le Less Ordinary recruitment campaign. We have never received so many applications. It really goes to show how many people are attracted to a le at sea with a company like Stena Line.

The damage done to local food production will require a reliance on food imports that would exacerbate global emissions and increase prices for the consumer. The impact would be particularly felt in rural towns and communities who depend on the sector for their livelihoods. They are calling on Assembly MLAs to recty the Bill by making meaningful amendments that are in line with the scientic evidence and that support their local communities who rely on the sector for their livelihoods. The organisations behind this warning are the Dairy Council for Northern Ireland the Northern Ireland Food  Drink AssociationNorthern Ireland Grain Trade Association , Northern Ireland Meat Exporters Association , the Livestock and Meat Commission , the Ulster Farmers Union . Speaking on behalf of this supply chain alliance, Conall Donnelly, Chief Executive of NIMEA said: “To be very clear, our collective members are in support of Climate Change legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We want to play our part. We are already investing in and implementing carbon-reducing technologies right across our supply chain and will continue to do so. Because of our natural grass advantage, we already have a world-class reputation for sustainable food production. Our high-quality beef, lamb and dairy produce is reared with care on small family farms utilising natural grass and is the envy of many countries around the world. We believe Northern Ireland has the potential to be a shining light in sustainable food production. We want to work with policy makers to get this right for the environment and the local economy. That means having realistic and science-based climate change targets relevant to Northern Ireland so that we can continue to be part of the solution to climate change.” David Brown, Deputy President of the UFU said, “ passed without further amendments, this legislation would not follow the expert advice from scientists that make up the International Panel of Climate Change and the UK’s Climate Change Committee. It could unnecessarily obliterate tens of thousands of jobs as well as threaten consumer access to affordable, quality food. Perversely, food may need to be imported from where which would simply increase global emissions. “This Bill also has the potential to damage rural towns and communities who depend on our sector for their livelihoods. But it will affect us all as consumers when we are no longer able to access local fresh food that is produced to high environmental and animal welfare standards. We are asking politicians to work with us. We want to tackle climate change in a way that helps protect the environment and maintains the unique economic and social role that agriculture and food production has on this island.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dbaacbe   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_abbeeaafafc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645454612923.jpg--covid_19___mon_21st_february_figures.jpg?164545461200","title":"covid  mon st february figures ","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows four further coronavirus related deaths and , new positive test results.
