The project was conceptualised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a memorial to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.It is intended to \u0027remind every inidual of our great nation\u0027s freedom struggle\u0027 and to \u0027inspire the people of our country to inculcate Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel\u0027s visionary ideologies of unity, patriotism, inclusive growth and good governance,\u0027 the Statue of Unity website reads. \u0027This monument will not just be a mute memorial like the rest, but a fully functional, purpose-serving tribute that will spur all round socio-economic development, in the form of better connectivity, healthcare and education infrastructure, research centre for agriculture development and various tribal development initiatives.\u0027 However, many have criticised the project for being a waste of money and some political parties have argued the expenditure for the statue should have gone towards other priorities like women\u0027s safety, education and agricultural schemes. Vishal Shah wrote on YouTube in response to a promotional video: \u0027This is ridiculous project, what would we achieve from it?\u0027 While Surya Vanka mused: \u0027Besides being an enormous waste of resources, this is a rather tasteless and gaudy project.\u0027Others feel the project is an important reminder of the nation\u0027s past when Patel united the 565 semi-autonomous states and British-era colonial provinces to form a united India.Patel led the Indian National Congress which forged the Indian movement for independence, following World War II when the party put pressure on the British government to pass an independence bill in July 1947.The party declared that India would not support the war until it had been granted complete independence.In January 1950 India’s constitution as an independent state took effect.            Construction workers move tonnes of cement and steel. The statue is a mixture of concrete and steel framework for the core, covered by an exterior cladding of bronze          Chinese workers finish for the day after working on the statue\u0027s construction.

Ms Sturgeon has said her party had not received any complaints about her predecessor\u0027s conduct - and that it had not carried out the investigation - but the matter would be reconsidered if the situation changes (pictured together in 2011)\u0027In summary, the party has no legal basis at this time to suspend Alex Salmond\u0027s membership.\u0027Of course, should that situation change, the matter will be reconsidered, as it would be for any member.\u0027The party\u0027s rules apply to all members and no one is above them.\u0027The claims about Mr Salmond\u0027s conduct towards two staff members in 2013 - while he was in office - have been handed to Police Scotland.Leslie Evans, Permanent Secretary at the Scottish Government, said the complaints were raised in January and Mr Salmond was notified in March about an investigation.She intended to make a statement regarding the complaints but the move was halted after the former first minister initiated legal proceedings. On Thursday Mr Salmond admitted that he is \u0027no saint\u0027 but denied allegations of sexual misconduct towards two female members of staff while he was Scotland\u0027s first minister.The former leader of the Scottish National Party allegedly carried out one assault at Bute House in Edinburgh, the first minister\u0027s official residence, in December 2013. Mr Salmond, 63, told the BBC he \u0027had made many mistakes\u0027 in his life, \u0027political and personal\u0027, adding: \u0027I\u0027m no saint, I\u0027ve got flaws – I understand that.\u0027But he insisted: \u0027I have not sexually harassed anyone and I certainly have not been engaged in criminality.\u0027    Alex Salmond pictured at a news conference after he denied allegations of sexual misconduct towards two female members of staff while he was Scotland\u0027s first ministerThe allegations are understood to have been passed to police by Scottish government officials after an internal inquiry.

Mr Salmond claims he has been prevented from properly challenging the allegations by Scottish government procedure and intends to take court action to contest the complaints process against him (pictured at a kilt fashion show in New York in 2006)Asked by the BBC if Mr Salmond was still a member of the SNP, she said: \u0027These matters will be considered in the fullness of time. This has not been a party investigation.\u0027I have limited information – for legal reasons that information I am not able to pass to the party, so the situation will undoubtedly develop as more information becomes available.\u0027As news of the claims emerged in Scotland\u0027s Daily Record newspaper on Thursday night, Mr Salmond issued a lengthy statement on Twitter denying any wrongdoing and revealing that he was seeking a judicial review of the internal inquiry.He said that for \u0027many months\u0027, on the advice of senior counsel, he had been trying to persuade the permanent secretary to the Scottish government, Leslie Evans, that she was \u0027behaving unlawfully in the application of a complaints procedure introduced by her more than three years after I left office\u0027.He added: \u0027This is a procedure so unjust that even now I have not been allowed to see and therefore to properly challenge the case against me. I have not been allowed to see the evidence.\u0027Miss Evans said yesterday that Mr Salmond\u0027s statement contained \u0027significant inaccuracies\u0027 and that the Scottish government will defend its position vigorously.She confirmed two complaints relating to Mr Salmond were received in January. They came after an internal review of Scottish government procedures on workplace complaints was launched in November 2017 in the light of wider concerns about harassment in Westminster and the Scottish Parliament.          Alex Salmond and his wife Moira arrive for a national service of thanksgiving for the Queen\u0027s Diamond Jubilee at St Paul\u0027s Cathedral in London on June 5, 2012As part of that review, a new procedure on handling harassment complaints involving current or former ministers was introduced.Miss Evans said: \u0027Mr Salmond was notified of the complaints in March and the details of the procedure under which the complaints would be addressed.\u0027At a news conference yesterday in Linlithgow, Mr Salmond\u0027s home town, the former first minister said his wife, Moira McGlashan, a former civil servant who is 17 years his senior, remains firmly behind him.Asked if he had done anything to warrant an apology to her, Mr Salmond said: \u0027I will tell you one thing that has encouraged me – friends and family, today and in the case of Moira over the last few months, have been incredibly supportive.\u0027Asked if he had been drinking before the incidents that led to the complaints, he said: \u0027I think we will just not answer that question.

In 1999, he was photographed on the campaign trail in Stirling giving a 17-year-old student a lick of his Solero ice lolly as he draped his jacket over his shoulderThen, turning back to his interviewer, he sweetly reminded her of the time and the place where they last met.Not once in the long career of the totemic figure of Scottish nationalism has any allegation of infidelity ever appeared in print.But that Mr Salmond, 63, comes to life in the company of women – preferably with a glass in his hand – no one, not even he, could deny. How the Press and political rivals tittered when, in 1999, he was photographed on the campaign trail in Stirling giving a 17-year-old student a lick of his Solero ice lolly as he draped his jacket over his shoulder.\u0027I remember that Mrs Salmond wasn\u0027t pleased,\u0027 he shuddered years later. \u0027I tried to hide those newspapers.\u0027          How much fun was had on Twitter in 2015 when he was pictured with the SNP\u0027s Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh taking a ride in a hot air balloon – as Mrs Salmond remained firmly in the background at the couple\u0027s Aberdeenshire homeAnd how much fun was had on Twitter in 2015 when he was pictured with the SNP\u0027s Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh taking a ride in a hot air balloon – as Mrs Salmond remained firmly in the background at the couple\u0027s Aberdeenshire home.Now Mr Salmond faces allegations more serious than the innuendo, rumour and speculation about women and wine which has peppered much of his political career.He is accused of sexual misconduct towards two members of staff during his time as first minister, in his then- official residence, Bute House in Edinburgh – claims which he describes as \u0027patently ridiculous\u0027.What is undeniable is women have been a prominent fixture in Mr Salmond\u0027s life. It was a political argument with a girlfriend at St Andrews which prompted him to join the SNP in the first place.It was a partnership with one – his wife – which helped make him electable. And a close working relationship with another – Nicola Sturgeon – nearly resulted in the dismantling of the United Kingdom.After that failure, a working relationship developed with married Mrs Ahmed-Sheikh as both won seats at Westminster in 2015. At Mr Salmond\u0027s behest, Mrs Ahmed-Sheikh travelled to the Bahamas to meet Sir Sean Connery and help record a plug for the Alex Salmond autobiography, The Dream Shall Never Die.          Alex Salmond is pictured at North Berwick Golf Club with professional golfer Kylie WalkerBut what of Mrs Salmond? At 81, is she not anxious to have her husband home in Strichen, Aberdeenshire, more often?The days when either one would speak openly about their marriage are long in the past, but what is clear is he is fiercely protective of her and, in his own way, utterly devoted. \u0027I am public property,\u0027 Mr Salmond used to say when asked about her. \u0027She is not.\u0027 They met in the late 1970s when West Lothian-born Mr Salmond was working in the Scottish Office. Moira French McGlashan, already past 40, was his boss, yet somehow they clicked and were married within three years.According to Mr Salmond\u0027s biographer David Torrance: \u0027Everyone who knew either Alex or Moira at this time recalls them being a perfect match, while their 17-year age gap was barely perceptible. Yet political contemporaries regarded the Salmond marriage with \u0027bemusement\u0027.\u0027It was so out of character, so out of style with Alex,\u0027 said Mr Torrance. \u0027This young radical working-class person marrying someone not only 17 years older than him but, by her own admission, of a more Conservative-leaning background and so much more proper than he was.\u0027By choosing to marry a woman of 43, Mr Salmond appeared to have turned his back on the prospect of fatherhood – and so it proved. Some in his party believed that children would have made him a more rounded, patient man, but perhaps a less effective leader.Few doubt, however, it was the behind-the-scenes work of Moira – as a sounding board, hostess, wardrobe consultant and more – that helped mould Mr Salmond into an electable MP.But it was clear from the beginning she preferred to be in the background. Only once, in 1990, did the couple agree to a joint interview and the immediate impression was both regretted it.          It was a partnership with one – his wife – which helped make him electable. And a close working relationship with another – Nicola Sturgeon (pictured) – nearly resulted in the dismantling of the United Kingdom\u0027He hasn\u0027t a clue about the colours of ties, shirts or socks,\u0027 Mrs Salmond said. \u0027Sometimes I switch on the six o\u0027clock news and I\u0027m horrified by what he is wearing.\u0027 And when oh when, she went on, was he ever going to put up that new pole for her curtains?It was her first and last interview. But later in Mr Salmond\u0027s career, as the SNP became a more powerful force, a clear picture of Mrs Salmond\u0027s power over her husband and, by extension, the political landscape emerged. Mr Salmond, who had resigned from his first term as SNP leader in 2000, said he would never have entered the party leadership race four years later if his wife had said no. Perhaps she realised, as his friends and foes alike do, that Mr Salmond cannot bear not to be where the action is.Much as he plays the dutiful husband in his converted mill house in Aberdeenshire, he is no less at home in a Westminster cafe with a glass in his hand turning on the charm.And it is not only in the company of women that the alcohol flows. Weeks before the May 2015 General Election, he was demanding flutes of pink champagne during interviews with the Spectator and New Statesman magazines. Red wine, meanwhile, was his preferred tipple before an interview with Sky News\u0027s Adam Boulton in 2014.According to a Scottish journalist who has socialised with him: \u0027He certainly likes his wine. He\u0027s not a massive boozer, but certainly knocks them back when he does drink.\u0027On the rare occasion I\u0027ve had a drink with him, he literally pours it down his throat. And it\u0027s always wine or champers, never anything as common as beer.\u0027For all the alcohol-fuelled bonhomie and occasionally grating attempts at charm, Mr Salmond is rarely comfortable discussing his emotions or private life.And if gossiped-about friendships with flavour-of-the-month SNP women have raised eyebrows in the past, there have been bitter enmities too.Chief among them was his toxic relationship with Roseanna Cunningham, who seemed destined to lead her party in 2004 before Mr Salmond spiked her guns by throwing his lot in with her opponent, Miss Sturgeon, who romped to victory. The pair barely spoke to each other for years.In all, the out-of-work politician, accused of two counts of sexual misconduct, is something of an enigma.Is he an incorrigible ladies\u0027 man, the SNP\u0027s resident roué, now more often than not soaked in fine wine and chandelier light?Those who know him well think not. The real Alex Salmond, says one who has known him for decades, is a political anorak – a man without many meaningful friendships and few hobbies beyond the odd flutter on the horses.Little wonder, when defeat came last year, that Mr Salmond did not take it lying down. No gentle retirement to Aberdeenshire and Moira for him.Instead, a defiant speech and a typically Salmond-esque quote from a Walter Scott poem. \u0027So laugh, false Whigs, in the midst of your glee, you have not seen the last of my bonnets and me,\u0027 he promised as his fiefdom in north-east Scotland fell to the Tories.How humiliating for this deeply proud man to find himself in his current predicament."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/26/18/4F68526500000578-0-image-a-16_1535304143980.jpg","title":"Man ate chicken chips finally tucking fruit veg","story":"Ryan Howarth suffers from a rare food disorder which meant his diet was staggeringly limited from the age of four (pictured left as a youngster and right today)          Ryan\u0027s mother Christiane, 45, has been helping him overcome his food fears and try new things\u0027I just ate the foods I wanted to,\u0027 said Ryan.\u0027When someone asked me to eat something else I reacted in the same way most people would react if I asked them to eat an exotic food, like insects.\u0027Ryan, from Andover in Hants, said his family were worried his diet could cause him health problems later in life.One in 4 people are waiting more than a WEEK for a GP...Why sleep really is the best medicine: Neuroscientist...Share this articleBut after undergoing some sessions with a therapist, he can eat almost anything.\u0027Now I\u0027m eating so many different things,\u0027 he said. \u0027It\u0027s amazing how I am enjoying foods I never expected I would like.\u0027          Ryan, from Andover in Hants, with his mother Christiane.

Pre-decimalisation (until 1971), pennies were still in circulation that dated back to the 1860s in Victoria’s reign.In a tradition that ended years ago, babies born on the same day as a future monarch were given a silver penny struck with the year of their birth. This was seen as a way of wishing them health — and wealth — for their whole life.Under the Coinage Act 1971, the 1p coin is legal tender for amounts only up to 20p. So shopkeepers don’t have to accept the sale if you offer 21 pennies or more. An Essex mother, Laura Pulley, fell foul of this law when she wasn’t allowed on a bus because she tried to pay the 60p fare in 1p and 2p coins. (The 20p limit applies to 2p pieces, too). Three years earlier, in 2012, an accountant sued a difficult client who tried to pay an £804 debt in coppers — and won.Baffling pensions are incomprehensible for ordinary savers...Biggest Roman villa to ever be discovered in Britain dating...Share this articleAccording to the Royal Mint, there are 11.278 billion pennies in circulation and 6.557 billion 2ps.Millions of pounds-worth of pennies must be lying down the back of sofas or stashed in piggy banks — but not as much as the estimated £169 million of old pound coins believed still to be abandoned there .Production of 1p and 2p coins by the Royal Mint has fallen sharply, with 288 million minted in 2016-17 compared with around 500 million the year before. Even so, that’s still more than nine pennies made every second.          Pennies last, on average, for more than 40 years, according to the Royal Mint, which monitors how many are damaged or lostSince 1975, all British coins have been made at the Royal Mint in Llantrisant, Wales. Previously, the Mint was in the City of London — originally at the Tower of London. The words ‘mint’ and ‘money’ come from the Roman goddess, Juno Moneta, the ine protector of money.The pre-decimal penny was originally minted in silver and got smaller as silver’s price rose. When silver became too expensive, in 1797, pennies began to be minted in copper by Matthew Boulton at his Soho Mint, Birmingham. A penny’s worth of copper was in each coin, which was significantly bigger than its silver predecessors. Because of their thick rims, they were called ‘cartwheels’. After 1860, the penny was minted in bronze (97 per cent copper, 2.5 per cent zinc and 0.5 per cent tin).At the start of decimalisation in 1971, the new penny was one of three new copper coins, along with the half-penny and the 2p piece. To avoid confusion with the old coins, all had the word ‘NEW’. This was removed in 1982.In the early-Nineties, copper prices soared — making bronze too expensive. Indeed, the coins were worth up to 1.5p — more than the value of the coin itself. Scrap dealers could make money by illegally melting them down. So, in 1992, the first copper-plated steel pennies were introduced. The steel core makes them magnetic. For security reasons, the Royal Mint won’t disclose today how much it costs to make a penny.          The Bank of England\u0027s says if the penny were scrapped and retailers rounded up prices to the nearest 5p, it would create hardly any inflation — just 0.07 per centSince 1971, there have been four different portraits of the Queen on the ‘obverse’ side of the coin (above). They are by artists Arnold Machin (1971-84), Raphael Maklouf (1985-97), Ian Rank-Broadley (1998-2015) and Jody Clark (2015 to date).The ‘reverse’ side has had two designers: Christopher Ironside (from 1971 to 2008) and Matthew Dent (from 2008 to date). Dent’s penny features a fragment of the Royal Shield. When placed together with the 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p and 50p coins, the penny’s design completes the full shield. The earlier Ironside design (right) was a version of the Badge of Henry VII, now the Badge of the Palace of Westminster: a crowned portcullis with chains.On all pennies since 1971, the inscription is ELIZABETH II D.G.REG.F.D. plus the year the coin was minted. The initials are short for Dei Gratia Regina Fidei Defensatrix — Latin for ‘Elizabeth II, by the grace of God, Queen and Defender of the Faith’.          Since 1975, all British coins have been made at the Royal Mint in Llantrisant, WalesWhen referring to a group of the coins, it’s right to call them ‘pennies’. But when talking about them in monetary terms, they’re called ‘pence’ — as in ‘two pounds and 30 pence’. To say ‘one p’ is regarded as poor English — it should be one penny.There were 240 pre-decimal pennies to the pound, with 12 pennies to a shilling and 20 shillings to a pound.The pre-decimal penny was abbreviated to ‘d’ (as in 1d, 2d etc). The ‘d’ was taken from the Roman silver coin, the denarius — from the Latin ‘deni’ (‘containing ten’), because there were ten asses (another Roman coin) to the denarius.The ‘d’ combined to make ‘L.S.D.’. The L. stood for libra, Latin for ‘pound’, as in weight — which is where we get our pounds from, both in weight and currency. The S. stood for solidus, a Roman gold coin.Edward VIII was on the throne for such a short time before he abdicated in 1936 that only a few Edward VIII pennies exist. In fact, they are so-called pattern coins, produced to receive official approval. They are dated 1937, the year after the Abdication. They show the king’s preferred left profile — breaking the convention that monarchs changed the direction of the previous monarch. Edward VIII’s vanity is thought to have brought bad luck and, in turn, the Abdication.The British penny was introduced by Offa, King of Mercia, in the mid-8th century AD. They were called denarii, after the Romans practice.Anglo-Saxon silver pennies had considerable buying power, the equivalent of £20 today. Back then, five pennies could buy a sheep, ten pennies a pig, 20 a cow and 30 an ox.The value of the penny has been driven down by inflation. A pre-decimal penny’s buying power was equivalent to 6p today. In 1951, it would be worth 13p today. In 1901, a penny was worth the equivalent of 46p today.          In New Zealand, they stopped making their cent and two-cent pieces in 1990. Many retailers rounded down prices to the nearest 5c as a gesture of goodwillIn the Sixties, a cigarette could be bought for a penny. In 1840, a stamp — the Penny Black — could be purchased for a penny. These days, a strip of six Penny Blacks can sell for £250,000 and a second-class stamp costs 56p.The penny and a ‘pennyworth’ are mentioned 15 times in Shakespeare’s works. In Henry IV, Part 2, the magistrate Robert Shallow says: ‘A friend in the court is better than a penny in the purse.’It cost a penny to watch the Bard’s plays at the Globe Theatre as a ‘groundling’ — standing on the ground rather than seated. These groundlings were mockingly called ‘penny-stinkers’.Canada got rid of ‘pennies’ in 2012, when it cost more to produce the coin than they were worth. To stop people cashing on the change and causing inflation, retail prices were rounded down or up to the nearest five-cent figure. The Canadian Government saved £6 million a year by the change.In New Zealand, they stopped making their cent and two-cent pieces in 1990. Many retailers rounded down prices to the nearest 5c as a gesture of goodwill."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/25/20/4F6546DC00000578-0-image-a-19_1535226225049.jpg","title":"Six ten plane journeys listed taking LONGER did decade ago","story":"Carriers are sometimes adding an extra twenty minutes to flight arrival times.

Pre-decimalisation (until 1971), pennies were still in circulation that dated back to the 1860s in Victoria’s reign.In a tradition that ended years ago, babies born on the same day as a future monarch were given a silver penny struck with the year of their birth. This was seen as a way of wishing them health — and wealth — for their whole life.Under the Coinage Act 1971, the 1p coin is legal tender for amounts only up to 20p. So shopkeepers don’t have to accept the sale if you offer 21 pennies or more.

Even so, that’s still more than nine pennies made every second.          Pennies last, on average, for more than 40 years, according to the Royal Mint, which monitors how many are damaged or lostSince 1975, all British coins have been made at the Royal Mint in Llantrisant, Wales. Previously, the Mint was in the City of London — originally at the Tower of London. The words ‘mint’ and ‘money’ come from the Roman goddess, Juno Moneta, the ine protector of money.The pre-decimal penny was originally minted in silver and got smaller as silver’s price rose. When silver became too expensive, in 1797, pennies began to be minted in copper by Matthew Boulton at his Soho Mint, Birmingham. A penny’s worth of copper was in each coin, which was significantly bigger than its silver predecessors. Because of their thick rims, they were called ‘cartwheels’. After 1860, the penny was minted in bronze (97 per cent copper, 2.5 per cent zinc and 0.5 per cent tin).At the start of decimalisation in 1971, the new penny was one of three new copper coins, along with the half-penny and the 2p piece. To avoid confusion with the old coins, all had the word ‘NEW’. This was removed in 1982.In the early-Nineties, copper prices soared — making bronze too expensive. Indeed, the coins were worth up to 1.5p — more than the value of the coin itself. Scrap dealers could make money by illegally melting them down. So, in 1992, the first copper-plated steel pennies were introduced. The steel core makes them magnetic. For security reasons, the Royal Mint won’t disclose today how much it costs to make a penny.          The Bank of England\u0027s says if the penny were scrapped and retailers rounded up prices to the nearest 5p, it would create hardly any inflation — just 0.07 per centSince 1971, there have been four different portraits of the Queen on the ‘obverse’ side of the coin (above). They are by artists Arnold Machin (1971-84), Raphael Maklouf (1985-97), Ian Rank-Broadley (1998-2015) and Jody Clark (2015 to date).The ‘reverse’ side has had two designers: Christopher Ironside (from 1971 to 2008) and Matthew Dent (from 2008 to date). Dent’s penny features a fragment of the Royal Shield. When placed together with the 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p and 50p coins, the penny’s design completes the full shield. The earlier Ironside design (right) was a version of the Badge of Henry VII, now the Badge of the Palace of Westminster: a crowned portcullis with chains.On all pennies since 1971, the inscription is ELIZABETH II D.G.REG.F.D. plus the year the coin was minted. The initials are short for Dei Gratia Regina Fidei Defensatrix — Latin for ‘Elizabeth II, by the grace of God, Queen and Defender of the Faith’.          Since 1975, all British coins have been made at the Royal Mint in Llantrisant, WalesWhen referring to a group of the coins, it’s right to call them ‘pennies’. But when talking about them in monetary terms, they’re called ‘pence’ — as in ‘two pounds and 30 pence’. To say ‘one p’ is regarded as poor English — it should be one penny.There were 240 pre-decimal pennies to the pound, with 12 pennies to a shilling and 20 shillings to a pound.The pre-decimal penny was abbreviated to ‘d’ (as in 1d, 2d etc). The ‘d’ was taken from the Roman silver coin, the denarius — from the Latin ‘deni’ (‘containing ten’), because there were ten asses (another Roman coin) to the denarius.The ‘d’ combined to make ‘L.S.D.’. The L. stood for libra, Latin for ‘pound’, as in weight — which is where we get our pounds from, both in weight and currency. The S. stood for solidus, a Roman gold coin.Edward VIII was on the throne for such a short time before he abdicated in 1936 that only a few Edward VIII pennies exist. In fact, they are so-called pattern coins, produced to receive official approval. They are dated 1937, the year after the Abdication. They show the king’s preferred left profile — breaking the convention that monarchs changed the direction of the previous monarch. Edward VIII’s vanity is thought to have brought bad luck and, in turn, the Abdication.The British penny was introduced by Offa, King of Mercia, in the mid-8th century AD. They were called denarii, after the Romans practice.Anglo-Saxon silver pennies had considerable buying power, the equivalent of £20 today. Back then, five pennies could buy a sheep, ten pennies a pig, 20 a cow and 30 an ox.The value of the penny has been driven down by inflation. A pre-decimal penny’s buying power was equivalent to 6p today. In 1951, it would be worth 13p today. In 1901, a penny was worth the equivalent of 46p today.          In New Zealand, they stopped making their cent and two-cent pieces in 1990. Many retailers rounded down prices to the nearest 5c as a gesture of goodwillIn the Sixties, a cigarette could be bought for a penny. In 1840, a stamp — the Penny Black — could be purchased for a penny. These days, a strip of six Penny Blacks can sell for £250,000 and a second-class stamp costs 56p.The penny and a ‘pennyworth’ are mentioned 15 times in Shakespeare’s works. In Henry IV, Part 2, the magistrate Robert Shallow says: ‘A friend in the court is better than a penny in the purse.’It cost a penny to watch the Bard’s plays at the Globe Theatre as a ‘groundling’ — standing on the ground rather than seated. These groundlings were mockingly called ‘penny-stinkers’.Canada got rid of ‘pennies’ in 2012, when it cost more to produce the coin than they were worth. To stop people cashing on the change and causing inflation, retail prices were rounded down or up to the nearest five-cent figure. The Canadian Government saved £6 million a year by the change.In New Zealand, they stopped making their cent and two-cent pieces in 1990. Many retailers rounded down prices to the nearest 5c as a gesture of goodwill."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/25/20/4F6546DC00000578-0-image-a-19_1535226225049.jpg","title":"Six ten plane journeys listed taking LONGER did decade ago","story":"Carriers are sometimes adding an extra twenty minutes to flight arrival times.

People perceive you as either black or white, and you’re not – you’re mixed.”Working in London, Attoh heard similar stories from other mixed-race people, and soon she began publishing her images online (at mixedracefaces and on Instagram) alongside small texts that allowed her subjects to share personal thoughts on identity, race and self, something they couldn’t do elsewhere. Following the death of her mother, to whom the series is dedicated, the project helped Attoh dissect her own multiracial experience – what it means to be connected to two worlds at once, and how society perceives that condition – but it has also sparked an open forum on ersity. “It’s not a topic people usually talk about,” Attoh says. “So the website has become a platform for people with mixed heritage. It’s given a lot of them a sense of belonging.”When she was starting out, friends and family corralled subjects for Attoh to shoot. (She is indebted to her family, she says, for the work they’ve contributed for free: the space in which the portraits are taken is co-run by her son the 90 or so hour-long interviews were transcribed by her daughter-in-law, often late at night.) Now subjects, keen to share their personal histories, approach Attoh directly, and she notices themes reoccurring. Many subjects celebrate the benefit of being able to flit between cultures while embracing both. Others talk of the strain inherent in not being of one place – of being from neither here nor there, tugged between one identity and another. Some find it easy, others less so.Attoh has now taken more than 90 images, a selection of which are published here. Those photographed represent great portions of the world – Japan, Jamaica, Malaysia, Sweden, Iran, China, South Africa – but also provide a portrait of contemporary Britain. In the 2011 census 1.25 million people identified as mixed race, making it the fastest-growing ethnic group in the UK. “A mixed-race girl just married a prince!” says Attoh. But discrimination persists. “It’s 2018, and mixed-race people are still asked the question, ‘Where are you really from?’”Later this year Attoh will organise an exhibition of the photos she’s made so far. In the meantime she’ll turn her lens on subjects in Holland, to examine differences in the mixed-race experience. But mostly her project is meant to raise public awareness. “I’m hoping it will become a platform for wider discussion,” Attoh says. “To help people understand these different points of view, these different experiences.”I grew up in Moscow until I was about nine and then we moved to the UK. I feel Russian, really. I speak Russian at home. Culturally I don’t have any real Korean connections if anything, I feel more British than North Korean. When I was younger I didn’t want to be Asian at all I was embarrassed by it. It doesn’t bother me now, but then I alternated between thinking it was something interesting about myself and hating the fact that I looked different. I really wanted to have lighter hair.I’m Irish on my dad’s side, mixed Jamaican and Indian on my mum’s. There are times I feel like the odd one out, especially at family functions. You’ll see a sea of white faces, and then there’s me and my brother. It can be isolating there aren’t many people I can relate to. In my adult years I’ve learned to appreciate where I come from. I can’t tell people I’m one race because I’d be disrespecting the other. I try to maintain the balance.I was born and raised in San Francisco. My mother is Colombian and my dad is mixed Scottish and English. They met on a blind date 14 days later they were married. When I was little I was very dark, but when I turned seven I became very fair. There was an awkward time when people thought my mum was my nanny. Because I was so light-skinned I would embrace being English rather than being Colombian. My son is a blond-haired, blue-eyed child, but I want him to know he is mixed Colombian.I was born in London but lived in Mexico until I was eight because of my disability – I was born deaf. I went to live with my grandmother in a small village. We had a pet donkey called Jesús. We also had chickens, pigs, goats, you name it. It was a great childhood. But in school in Mexico, I was always seen as being different. In Mexico people call each other by nicknames. My family’s nickname was ‘Japonicitos’ – Japanese. In Mexico they’d never really seen an Oriental person before, apart from what they’d seen on TV, on Dragon Ball Z.I’ve spent my whole life in England so I’ve always identified as British. My mother is half-Jamaican and half-Indian my dad is half-English and half-Irish. I appreciated visiting people on both sides of the family each time I could learn and experience different and unique things about the cultures I was connected to: food, music, traditions, stories. It was interesting to hear from those who spoke patois, while others spoke with London accents. Though sometimes the middle ground felt like a lonely place.I’m a teacher, I spend a lot of time with younger people, and I’m hearing so many younger mixed-race people interrogating what they call their ‘privilege theory’. What are their privileges as a light-skinned person? How does their status relate to that of their darker-skinned friends, or people who look more African or more European? It’s a hell of a thing to navigate, and I think there’s a pressure on younger people to understand it. But your identity can be about many things. It doesn’t have to be just about race. It could be about being a parent, a cyclist, a musician.Dad and Mum met in Lesotho. Dad worked for NGOs. I was born in Wales, but I didn’t live in the UK until I was 13. When we were young we lived in many countries: Ghana, Uganda, Mali, Kenya. I loved the food in Ghana. Even for a mixed-race person I’m quite fair, so until I was 13 I thought of myself as white (every African country has a word for ‘white person’.) When I came to the UK I was told I was black. It highlighted a lot about race: how so much of your identity is what other people put on you.My mum’s family are from Cyprus. My dad’s family are Jamaican, with African heritage. But I grew up in northwest London. When I was the president of the African Caribbean Society at university, one of my friends who ran the society with me told me I wasn’t really black because I had a white mum. I think from that point onwards I’ve always referred to myself as black – very intentionally. I stand in solidarity with all black people. I don’t think being mixed makes me any less black. Whiteness is set up to exclude all those who are not white."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d93ad5b0dfb9fc54cb8e1d87c66b97f6fb41c769/0_285_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=edef29894d751399a78fbcdb59d67e01","title":"fishing for business how angling direct tackled the uk high street","story":"Keen angler Darren Bailey left school at 16 in the hope of making money doing something he loved.Thirty years on from taking a job in a fishing tackle shop in Norwich, he is chief executive of Angling Direct, a rapidly growing retail business that made its stock market debut a year ago. At a time of great uncertainty on Britain’s high streets, with some of the best known names in retail struggling or going bust, Angling Direct is opening more shops. Its 23rd shop will open its doors to customers in Guildford on 1 September, soon to be followed by a 24th store in Peterborough. The company has identified another 20 other popular fishing locations for future stores.“It’s a tactile product,” Bailey explains. “People like to see it, touch it, feel it. They might wait until a later date to buy it online but they still want to see the products in the shops.”Angling Direct sells a vast assortment of more than 21,500 fishing tackle products, ranging from a £1 bag of hooks to poles that will set you back nearly £4,000.The company does not sell through Amazon and, as yet, has not suffered at the hands of the online retailer. Bailey says that while it is always wise to keep an eye on what Amazon is doing – it does sell some fishing tackle – he’s not too concerned: “Customers want specialist service and advice, and you can’t get that from Amazon.”For a business that began with fishing tackle shops in Norfolk, Bailey now has ambitions beyond UK shores. Angling Direct already exports to more than 40 countries and launched a German website in June, with other European websites to follow later in the year.The company floated on the Alternative Investment Market in July last year, to fund the expansion that Bailey is now seeing through. Shares have risen from 64p to 107p over the period.The rapid growth in sales is thanks to that expansion and investment, both in stores and online, rather than an explosion of people taking up fishing as a hobby.As for his own hobby, Bailey doesn’t get out fishing as much as he would like to these days. He went fishing for the first time in 2018 last week, on the River Trent.The ideal weather for a spot of fishing and a further boost to sales? “I’m hoping for an Indian summer and a normal British winter,” Bailey says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d3f7b7a1b11d191ab7ffc64f2bcdb1933764190/0_0_4734_2841/master/4734.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26f28f529c146400dda66324c5249b2f","title":"calm amid the concrete britains best urban green spaces","story":"From shopping centre beehives to grand hidden gardens, there’s respite from the madding crowds in Britain’s towns and citiesDalston Eastern Curve Garden, LondonThis leafy lifeline, situated slap bang in the middle of Dalston’s lively chicken shops, boutique bars and technicolor nail salons, is a vital addition to one of London’s most densely populated boroughs, where few people have access to their own garden. Created in 2010 on the site of the old Eastern Curve railway line, it has a vegetable and herb patch, a pizza oven and a greenhouse used for workshops in the winter months.Bedford Fields Community Forest Garden, LeedsDespite the name, Hyde Park in Leeds has one of the lowest ratios of green space to grey (built-up environments) in the UK, which is why the Bedford Fields Community Forest Garden is so loved by students and locals alike. Whether edible or medicinal, all of the plants here have a use, and visitors are encouraged to take what they find – with a request that they give something back to the initiative in their spare time. A word of advice: take one of their foraging courses before you go picking the mushrooms.Crook Hall, DurhamFirm favourites of Dorothy and William Wordsworth, and John Ruskin – and those guys knew a thing or two about nature – the wild garden of one of the oldest houses in Durham has two hectares of wildflower meadows, an ivy-hung courtyard, a maze, and even a moat. There’s also the Shakespeare Garden, planted entirely with flowers from the Bard’s time. Don’t leave without finding the actual secret garden (no need for a robin to let you in though – it’s all open for you).Kingstanding Beacon, BirminghamWith Spaghetti Junction and The Bull Ring, Birmingham has a reputation for being a sprawling concrete jungle. But nestled between housing estates off an unmarked path is Kingstanding Beacon. Known locally as The Pimple, the second-highest point in Birmingham has a panoramic view of trees, hills and more trees. Just the place for getting up and away from it all.Pure Land Japanese Garden, NottinghamshireIf you thought the closest you’d come to Japan in Nottingham was a maki roll at Yo! Sushi, swing by this soothing meditation garden, complete with Japanese-inspired water features, pagodas, crystals and koi-carp-filled ponds. Created more than 30 years ago by Buddhist monk Maitreya, who still runs personal meditation classes, the garden is the setting for magical events, from Japanese tea ceremonies to lamplit evening concerts.St John’s Gardens, ManchesterFormerly the site of a graveyard, this mini oasis for city workers, visitors and locals boasts an urban orchard of crab apple trees, manicured flowerbeds and Manchester poplars to shade under. There are also plenty of benches for you to recuperate on after you’ve wandered around the Museum of Science and Industry next door.Goldney Gardens, BristolThis ornate 18th-century garden, tucked behind Goldney House in Clifton Wood, is hiding some big secrets behind its ordinary-looking stone walls. And what might those be, you ask? There’s a heritage orchard, an ornamental garden, an orangery, a rotunda and bastion, for starters. Then you can check out the Corinthian columns and explore an elaborate, shell and fossil-lined grotto, complete with lioness and river god – a perfect spot for your very own Jane Austen moment. Tours of Goldney Gardens are run on various dates throughout the summer till 23 August and can be booked online.Bonnington Square Pleasure Garden, LondonOnce part of the 17th-century Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens, this plot of land became a bombsite, then a derelict playground dominated by dog poo, before it was imaginatively re-designed in the 1990s by a group of local residents, led by film-maker Evan English. It now features a 9-metre-high Industrial Revolution iron waterwheel, a huge Helping Hand sculpture and lush sub-tropical plants. And zero dog poo.Cambo Gardens, FifeWith winding paths, fast-flowing streams and swarms of butterflies, the walled, wild gardens of Cambo House seem straight out of a storybook. Eclectic in design – think cascades of roses and carpets of more than 300 varieties of snowdrops – the garden has been specially planted to reward the visitor no matter what season it is. Views of the sea at sunset are particularly Instagrammable.Rooftop of the Dolphin Shopping Centre, PooleThis shopping centre in Poole has a bit of a buzz about it recently, thanks to a new sustainable roof garden, complete with two beehives. Not only do bees here help with local pollination, they also produce the honey that is sold in the centre, with all the proceeds going to charity. Tended to by shopping centre staff, the garden has been made entirely from recycled materials, and there are big plans to grow veg up there too.Aimed at shielding skin from environmental assaults like pollution, Clinique’s Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly works to hydrate, strengthen and protect skin for 24 hours.

In this age of Trump, who channels Barnum, and would have delighted Mencken, the uses\u0026nbspof “overestimate” and “underestimate” invite a\u0026nbspbrief reflection.Confusion is common, as readers often remind me.  style guide aims to reduce it: “underestimate, understate – take care that you don’t mean overestimate or overstate. We often get this wrong – a typical example from the paper: ‘Qian’s contribution to China’s space and missile programme\u0026nbspcannot be underestimated’ (the writer meant the opposite).”Recently one writer’s view was that the “impact of the recent snow and subzero temperatures on these children’s lives cannot be underestimated”. Another believed it was “not an understatement to say” a politician had revolutionised the politics of the left.Can we overstate the imagined attraction of witnessing a Trump v Mencken stoush on Twitter? A fixture at the party conventions that produced presidential nominees, Mencken could be creatively harsh, on candidates and voters. He thought that candidates of “vigorous mind and stout convictions” were “gradually shouldered out of public life”, leaving the field to “intellectual jellyfish and inner tubes”, so that “on some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their heart’s desire, and the White\u0026nbspHouse will be adorned by a downright moron”. To Mencken, Warren Harding, the Republican candidate in 1920, was “of the intellectual grade of an aging cockroach,” records Marion Elizabeth Rodgers in Mencken: the American Iconoclast. Harding won, and his lower taxeshigher tariffsfewer immigrants administration bred corruption. After Harding died in office in 1923, Mencken thought the successor, Calvin Coolidge, could not “arouse any more enthusiasm than a spittoon”. ‘Silent Cal’ was president until 1929.President Franklin D Roosevelt met fire with fire when in 1934 he and Mencken addressed a Washington dinner where tradition required that the president respond to an opposition speaker. A guest recalled that in his speech Mencken, no fan of FDR’s New Deal policies, was “cleverly cynical, as usual, but he wasn’t particularly ill-humoured”. In reply, Roosevelt savaged Mencken with a series of entertaining denunciations of journalists, which the president disclosed at the end of his speech had been taken from Mencken’s own writings. The effect was devastating. Guests roared. Said one, the president had “smeared him all over”.As Roosevelt left, in his wheelchair, he passed Mencken’s table. Mencken offered a handshake, and sportingly said: “Fair shooting.” Roosevelt later wrote that he “did not really intend to be quite so rough on Henry Mencken, but the old quotations which I dug up were too good to be true, and I felt that in view of all the amusing but cynically rough things which Henry has said in print for 20 years, he was entitled to 10 minutes of comeback!” Rodgers records that, privately, Mencken felt humiliated.

In the poorest countries, its primary means of damage is through TB as\u0026nbspcountries grow more developed (and drink, on average, more) the damage shifts to cancer and heart disease. It is the trade-off between cancer and heart disease which leads the researchers to reject the notion that moderate drinking has health benefits compared with abstinence: they find that the increased risk of cancers outweighs the diminished risk of heart disease among middle-aged moderate drinkers.Perhaps the most startling single finding is that two-thirds of the world’s population don’t drink at all. They manage without a drug apparently essential to civilised life in the west. The question is whether those of us in the other third should try to emulate them. The researchers are unequivocal. They want concerted government action to deliver lower alcohol consumption, using many of the same mechanisms that have been successfully deployed against tobacco: price rises, restrictions on advertising limiting the availability of the drug. Some of these look like common sense: the Blair government’s relaxation of the licensing laws has not had the good effects hoped for at the time.But the report’s concentration on the physical ill effects of alcohol consumption leaves two important questions unanswered. The direct physical effects of the drug are not the reasons for its popularity or use. It is the effect on mood and even intellect that many people take it for. This isn’t an entirely benevolent one. Drunken drivers, and drunken physical violence, cause immense suffering. The emotional damage that\u0026nbspeven high-functioning alcoholics do to their families is profound and lasting. Alcohol is bad for judgment and can promote a destructive solipsism. But it can also stimulate imagination, courage and friendship in a way that is hard to achieve otherwise. These are gifts that make life worth living. There is a reason why wine is tightly linked to paradise in religious poetry. Almost all human societies have used drugs for social purposes as well as inidual pleasure. A\u0026nbspworld without drink might find itself poorer as well as richer.The report is right that many people should drink less than they do. Almost everyone should drink less than they want to. Perhaps the real benefit of moderate drinking is not that it protects the heart, but that it requires a little self-discipline.

It is real. We need to act now or the consequences will be catastrophic. In the interests of “balance”, the media often feels the need to include those who outright deny the reality of human-triggered climate change.Balance implies equal weight. But this then creates a false equivalence between an overwhelming scientific consensus and a lobby, heavily funded by vested interests, that exists simply to sow doubt to serve those interests. Yes, of course scientific consensus should be open to challenge – but with better science, not with spin and nonsense. We urgently need to move the debate on to how we address the causes and effects of dangerous climate change – because that’s where common sense demands our attention and efforts should be.Fringe voices will protest about “free speech”. No one should prevent them from expressing their views, whether held cynically or misguidedly. However, no one is obliged to provide them with a platform, much less to appear alongside them to give the misleading impression that there is something substantive to debate. When there is an article on smoking, newspapers and broadcasters no longer include lobbyists claiming there are no links to cancer. When there’s a round-the-world yacht race we don’t hear flat-earthers given airtime: “This is madness they’ll sail off the edge!”There’s a workable model for covering fringe views – which is to treat them as such. They don’t need to be ridiculed, just expected to challenge the evidence with better evidence, and otherwise ignored. As campaigners and thinkers who are led by science and the precautionary principle, and who wish to debate the real and vital issues arising from human-triggered climate change, we will not assist in creating the impression that climate denial should be taken seriously by lending credence to its proponents, by entertaining ideas that lack any basis in fact. Therefore we will no longer debate those who deny that human-caused climate change is real. There are plenty of vital debates to be had around climate chaos and what to do about it this is simply no longer one of them.

Viktor Irle, a market analyst at the group, said: “A stock of one million electric vehicles is an important milestone on the road to electrification and meeting emission targets but it is of course not enough.”The figures include fully electric cars and vans, plus plug-in hybrid ones, which can travel a short distance off a battery before switching to a conventional engine.However, rapid growth in Germany means Europe’s biggest car market is set to overtake Norway by the end of the year for total sales.The Netherlands and Denmark also posted good growth but the UK had only moderate growth because of what EV-Volumes called a lack of compelling models from domestic manufacturers Ford and Vauxhall.

Combining the stylistic slickness of 25th Hour with the controversial potential of Bamboozled, it’s a stranger-than-fiction tale (“based upon some fo’ real, fo’ real shit”) of an African American cop infiltrating the Ku Klux Klan in the early 1970s. Produced by the team behind Get Out (it was Jordan Peele who brought the story to Lee), BlacKkKlansman slips seamlessly from borderline-absurdist humour to all-too-real horror, conjuring an urgent blend of sociopolitical period satire and contemporary wake-up call.John David Washington gives a wonderfully wry and nuanced central performance as Ron Stallworth, an afro-sporting idealist who becomes “the Jackie Robinson” of the formerly all-white Colorado Springs police force. Graduating swiftly from records to intelligence, Stallworth answers a newspaper ad for the KKK, posing on the telephone as a budding white supremacist. When face-to-face meetings are required, Stallworth’s Jewish colleague Flip Zimmerman (a brooding Adam Driver) is drafted in to press the flesh at meetings where homemade terrorism is served up with cheese and crackers, the tension heightened by the weird domesticity.Soon, a relationship is being built with grand wizard David Duke (Topher Grace), the “smiling future” of “the organisation”, who plans to lead it from cross burnings into politics under the banner of putting “America First!” and making it “great again”. “The United States would never elect somebody like David Duke,” says Ron, prompting an accusation of naivety from his boss and a ripple of ghoulish guffaws from an audience who know how this cruel joke ends.With its long-lensed, long-take shots, captured on 35mm by cinematographer Chayse Irvin, and note-perfect production and costume design, BlacKkKlansman elegantly evokes the cinema of its setting (Lee has cited The French Connection, Serpico and Dog Day Afternoon as tonal touchstones). There are playful conversations about Shaft v Super Fly and the relative merits of Richard Roundtree and Ron O’Neal, while Terence Blanchard’s sparse score blends guitar-and-drums funk with classical thriller strings. Yet there’s nothing nostalgic about this evocation of a (not so) bygone age as it juxtaposes historical racial hatred with shocking news footage of Charlottesville in 2017, and Trump’s astonishing “blame on both sides” response to neo-Nazi attacks. As with his use of the Rodney King footage in Malcolm X, Lee efficiently conflates the struggles of the past and present into a powerful cinematic continuum.What’s most remarkable is how well Lee balances the tonal shifts, provoking both laughs and gasps with a film built upon dualities: fact and fiction (Stallworth’s story is heavily fictionalised, yet rings “true”) past and present inside and outside. Just as our central figure becomes two characters folded into one (Flip explicitly questions whether his former rejection of his Jewish heritage was a form of “passing”), so BlacKkKlansman revels in mirror images. Ron’s relationship with student activist Patrice (Laura Harrier) is shadowed by creepily affectionate scenes in which a white supremacist couple cuddle while conspiring to kill. A declaration that police officers are “family” who “stick together, right or wrong” chimes with the Klan’s own twisted code, echoing a central debate about whether change can be effected from within or without the system. Angry cries of “white power” and “black power” are pointedly intercut, ricocheting around the film’s mediating message of “all power to all the people”.Alongside his trademark dolly shots, fans of Lee’s films will find threads that lead right back to the director’s 1980 short The Answer, a biting response to The Birth of a Nation that nearly got him thrown out of film school. In BlacKkKlansman, Lee returns to DW Griffith’s Klan-aggrandising epic, using it as a backdrop for a sobering lesson about the power of movies to mould attitudes, from the heroically fluttering confederate flags of Gone with the Wind to the racist stereotypes of the Tarzan serials. Yet Lee also clearly believes in cinema’s power to change people for good, lending a passionate, proselytising edge to BlacKkKlansman.From a brilliantly bilious opening appearance by Trump-scourge Alec Baldwin to the statesmanlike gravitas of Harry Belafonte, the ensemble cast packs a weighty punch, aided by standout turns from supporting players such as Ashlie Atkinson and Corey Hawkins. Yet the real star here is Lee. After the uncertainties of Oldboy and Chi-Raq, it’s great to see this admirably unruly film-maker back at the height of his provocative powers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0781239e1d6c4af828a98c88292dd54a70f0ce26/86_64_1518_911/master/1518.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b75ac1a8d13c0aaf65266dd7567b4239","title":"arsenal unai emery mesut ozil","story":"The midfielder missed his team’s win over West Ham due to illness but there is growing tension between him and EmeryUnai Emery’s English is not very good. That is not a criticism but a fact and something the Spaniard freely acknowledges. If anything he deserves credit for trying hard to speak in a foreign language during these nascent days as Arsenal’s head coach but it has led to him often struggling to get a clear message across. There are times, though, when Emery expresses himself perfectly well – so long as those listening are prepared to read between the lines.Which brings us to Mesut Özil’s absence from Arsenal’s 3-1 victory against West Ham United. What should have been a moment for Emery to immerse himself in celebration of a first victory in charge of a new club in a new country has instead become dominated by talk of a rift between manager and player.Emery denied such claims on Saturday, insisting Özil was not part of his matchday squad because he had been struck by illness – catarrh, to be precise – in training a couple of days earlier and not because he had thrown a strop after being told he would be starting on the bench. That line was maintained when the 46-year-old then spoke to a small group of journalists in private surroundings, and even after it was put to him that allowing a sick person to enter the dressing room before a game, as Emery said was the case with Özil, was strange bordering on negligent. “He felt better so he is with us, and I prefer that,” the manager said and that was that. Move on. Nothing to see here.Sometimes less really is more and from that one-word answer and accompanying gesture came the definite sense that for all of Emery’s insistence otherwise there is tension between him and Özil and that, for the latter, breaking point was reached when he was told he would not be lining up as Arsenal’s principal playmaker – a No 10 in the No 10 role – in a game of genuine importance for Arsenal. According to a tweet from the ESPN journalist João Castelo-Branco, Özil “had an argument with Emery at practice and came out screaming. Information from more than one source linked to the club”.Arsenal will continue to insist that Özil’s absence at the weekend was down purely to illness but, if so, it would be the sixth time since December 2016 that the German has been sidelined for that reason. It is an astonishing statistic for a supposedly healthy athlete and naturally leads to suspicion, especially given Özil’s somewhat flaky displays for Arsenal since joining the club in September 2013 and the nature of his relationship with Emery since he arrived in May.Arsène Wenger’s successor has called on Özil to be more involved in games, started him in a wide‑right position against Manchester City on the opening day and then, having deployed the 29-year-old as a No 10 at Chelsea, hauled him off on 68 minutes. Emery insisted after the 3-2 defeat that he was pleased with Özil’s performance but only after again making a reference to his somewhat lightweight approach to proceedings. “I took him off to stop Chelsea progressing easily with the ball,” Emery said in the Stamford Bridge press room.What happens next is fascinating. Having signed a contract extension in January that increases his salary to an estimated £350,000 a week, Özil is in a strong position. But as the man brought in to lead Arsenal in the post-Wenger era, Emery is in an even stronger position and, having had to deal with the politics of Neymar at Paris Saint‑Germain, he simply may no longer be in the mood to tolerate an awkward star and certainly not one who appears an ill-fit for his high‑intensity approach. Aaron Ramsey looks a more Emery-like No 10, as seen by the way his forward sprints and aggressive pressing unsettled West Ham at the weekend.All eyes then are on Arsenal’s training sessions this week and the team Emery picks for the visit to Cardiff on Sunday. For the sake of harmony Özil may want to leave his sickbed as soon as possible."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/deb815479f0a2576ef8df4c6497f09581a8c6d34/0_65_2289_1373/master/2289.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a19549fcf747c6eae33444ef491858c3","title":"jose mourinho wants fans to lift manchester united for tottenham visit","story":"• United manager expressed his happiness at loyal support• Fans stood by club in defeat at Brighton after a poor displayJosé Mourinho wants Manchester United to be inspired by the loyal support the team received despite the disappointing 3-2 defeat at Brighton \u0026amp Hove Albion last week.On Monday night United host Tottenham, who have won both their matches this season, hoping to bounce back from the shock defeat on the south coast. But though Mourinho’s side were dismal at Brighton they received a good reception from the fans, just as they did at Old Trafford for their victory in the opening match of the season – a situation their manager hopes will be repeated on Monday evening.“The supporters were fantastic in both matches. Not for me, for the team, which is the only thing that matters. In my career I was never selfish and thinking about myself, I was always a club man. That’s what I am. I am really happy when the supporters support the team.”United’s defeat against Brighton was the latest loss to a side that are not a direct competitor, following last season’s reverses to the same opposition and to Huddersfield, Newcastle and West Brom. Yet despite boasting a better record against the other top-six teams, defeating them all, Mourinho accepted that United will always be subject to criticism.“It is not a frustration because it would also be a frustration if we win every match against the non-top-six team and don’t win against the top six, that would also be a frustration,” the Portuguese said. “We want to win all the time. We want to play well all the time. We don’t want to make mistakes. That is what you always want.”United finished second last season but Mourinho would not be drawn on whether this would represent success this term. “I’m not in May,” he said. “I cannot answer to that, I am not in May – I’m in August.”He was also reluctant to detail his ideal playing style for United. “Winning style,” he said. “Don’t make defensive mistakes. Be dominant. Chances, score goals and go home with the three points.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a106f6a9d929064e54b8c8d8a8e5e6ef4faad49/0_323_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31ebb0d58760d8c70513a2af95b1d435","title":"mourinho vs the world and a book writers special football weekly extra","story":"Max is joined by Barry Glendenning, Jonathan Wilson and Michael Calvin to discuss Liverpool’s perfect start, José Mourinho’s issues with everyone, books, plane banner protests and the joy of chancing across a game in the parkRate, review, share on Apple Podcasts, Soundcloud, Audioboom, Mixcloud, Acast and Stitcher, and join the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

Now it has reached the tiny Baltic islands of Aland. It is protected by EU law – but who’s protecting the locals? Patrick Barkham reportsEarlier this year, two unexpected guests crossed the sea to reach the largest of the Åland Islands, an archipelago of 6,700 mostly tiny isles between Sweden and Finland. The long, hard winter had frozen the Baltic more extensively than for many a year. A daring few among 30,000 Åland islanders drove their cars over the ice to Finland. In the other direction came two or possibly three wolves.Europe’s most feared carnivore was first seen padding over the sea ice by a ferry passenger in February. When islanders conducted their elk census during the March snows, they found wolf tracks heading west across the main island of Åland, a uniquely autonomous region of Finland. By the start of April a wolf had been sighted. By the end of the month, two were filmed together. In June a sheep was killed with ruthless precision, its skin covered in tooth marks – the work of a wolf, said experts. A few days later, a camera trap set over a carcass captured footage of the chief suspect returning to feed.The Eurasian wolf is marching back into western Europe. It first flourished after the Soviet Union’s collapse, slipping west into Poland, Finland and Germany and then wandering, recolonising densely populated landscapes where it had been absent for a century or more: northern France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Denmark. People with no memory of living alongside wolves are having to learn how to, because under European Union law the wolf is a protected species. Åland islanders exterminated their last wolf in 1883. But now they want to shoot wolves again, and they are prepared to challenge the EU to do so.During endless summer days, these undulating islands look an improbable site for the wolves’ latest conquest. Surrounded by bright blue water, most islands are minuscule, sun-kissed skerries, where stunted pines grow from crevices in the pink granite. They contain coves of grey sand, little wooden jetties and modest red wooden summer houses. But on the largest (50km by 80km) island there are also dark spruce forests, carpeted with blueberries. And, somewhere, a wolf or two.Most people have retired to their summer houses but a few officials remain hard at work in the government building in the Åland Islands’ tiny capital, Mariehamn.“I am a lonely wolf here,” says Hanna Kondelin, laughing. Kondelin works for the island’s environmental agency, overseeing its plan to tackle the wolves. Islanders, she says, are almost unanimously opposed to the wolves. The naturally secretive animals are now sighted almost every day. Are the wolves seen close to homes? “It’s impossible not to be close to houses and farms because this is a small-scale place,” she says. “We don’t have big forests like they do in Sweden and Finland.” She hears islanders criticising the government for inaction but she and her colleagues have spent “many hours” drawing up a plan.As a conservationist, Kondelin admires the EU Habitats Directive which provides legal protection for rare species, but it is now “causing us quite a lot of headaches”. The Åland Islands must adhere to EU law and are thus legally obliged to protect its wolf population. Finland has run into trouble with the EU in recent years for permitting the seasonal killing of a significant proportion of its 150-strong wolf population. And now Åland’s government wants to go further. It is proposing a system where islanders won’t require a licence before shooting a wolf. Officials say a wolf can only be shot if there is an “immediate” risk of an attack but, under its proposals, an islander could simply retrospectively claim a wolf threatened them or their livestock. “Our politicians are very much agreeing that wolves do not belong here,” says Kondelin. This autumn, she hopes Finland’s government will endorse Åland’s plan. But couldn’t this stance see the islands hauled before the European Court of Justice? “It’s even probable,” she says.Alongside Kondelin is Robin Juslin, a bright young civil servant who heads up the island’s hunting unit. “In almost every household there is a hunter,” says Juslin. “It’s part of the subsistence lifestyle here that you rear your own meat and you hunt and fish.” But the European Commission took the islanders to court over Åland’s spring shoot of 2,000 male eider ducks. Despite the court case, the islanders have restarted the spring shoot, and their dispute with the EU continues. “People thought that the Commission would change their attitudes after Brexit and be more considered about local opinions, but it doesn’t seem that way,” says Juslin. “Now people in Åland are saying ‘exit’. It comes up a lot in the wolf discussion. People in general favour the idea of the EU but the EU can’t take into account the fact that we have had these strong traditions for hundreds of years, and haven’t exterminated the bird population. They can’t trust us to manage our own birds and wolves.”Juslin was visiting Denmark earlier this year when a video emerged of a wolf being illegally shot there. The Danish authorities, he says, “have the same problems as everywhere else. Their government is controlled by the EU and can’t do everything the way that they want. And they can’t get local acceptance for the wolf.”Beyond the tranquillity of Mariehamn, the islands stretch peacefully for miles. Pine forests grow on thick carpets of pale lichens pine cones scattered on pink stone highways are undisturbed by cars. Small fields are squeezed between rocky outcrops potatoes grow well in the sandy, grey soil.Åland is a singular place. Islanders speak Swedish but in 1921 the League of Nations decided it would be part of Finland. Despite ties to Finland, Åland has its own stamps, its own internet domain (.ax) and its own flag, as well as more sunshine hours than anywhere else in northern Europe, a vineyard, a crisp factory and no McDonald’s. It’s within the EU but outside its tax border, and its economy is dependent on duty-free ferries. I take the ferry and people are drinking before 8am. Disco dancing starts at 11am. Many visitors to Åland only see the ferry terminal before hopping on the next ferry back to Sweden or Finland.Åland’s villages are little more than family farms. House martins dip over meadows beside pretty wooden windmills. By a big red barn, beside several long-dead Skodas half-buried in undergrowth, Berit Sjöberg’s five sheepdogs lie obediently on the track. Sjöberg runs an organic farm with 80 ewes. This is her daily routine now: bringing her sheep from pasture to barn each evening because of the wolves. Like everywhere in northern Europe, small farms are going out of business or being agglomerated into large farms. Is it harder to make a living than 20 years ago? “Twenty years!” exclaims Sjöberg. “It’s harder than last year.” This is her toughest season in farming: the grass hasn’t grown during the north European drought, and now there are the wolves. “I take the sheep inside every evening and put them out every morning. I thought it would be OK but I am quite tired. The sheep must be tired of this wolf situation too, because they are getting slower and slower every day. Only the dogs are happy.”What do islanders think about wolves? Sjöberg puts her forefinger across her throat in a slitting motion. “People who like the wolves and would like to have them will say that Åland is not the best place for the wolves,” she says. Conservationists argue that people will tolerate these carnivores if governments fund more shepherding, deterrents (such as big dogs) and wolf-proof electric fencing. But Åland’s rocky terrain gives it paddocks that are small, wild and unfenceable. Ultimately, even if the government provides compensation for wolf kills, Sjöberg argues it never covers the cost of raising the sheep, or the value of its bloodline, or lost future productivity.The wolf has been within 100 metres of Sjöberg’s farm. “I don’t believe he will wait there and not take my sheep,” she says. Can’t people learn to live alongside wolves, as they did in the past? “Yes, maybe there were more predators in the past but there are more people now. We have to save the forest for the wolf but we can’t have the wolf living like this, beside us.”Near the village of Samuelstorp, where a wolf killed a sheep, Börje Jansson is tidying his open-sided wooden barn. “I don’t think the wolf belongs to Åland. It’s too small,” he says. What should islanders do? His wife, Riitta, standing with their four-year-old grandson, is forthright. “Shoot them,” she says. “We haven’t got the space. There is a house every 500m. There are no wild areas. I am scared when my grandchild is here and they attack our neighbour’s sheep.” She thinks the wolf was here the previous day. “Suddenly our two horses became uneasy. It must’ve been something, and then we had to take them in.”The problem, say the Janssons, is that the EU’s rules are too broad for small and unusual places such as Åland. “They can’t make a rule and include every country because we’re all so different, with different circumstances,” says Riitta. “When the shooting season here starts in the autumn, if the wolves come, they are going to shoot it.”Börje makes a grave face. “It would then be murder,” he says. “We can go to prison!” exclaims Riitta, eyes wide at what she sees as the ridiculousness of this situation.Is anyone in favour of the wolf? “No, I don’t think so,” Börje smiles. “In Helsinki, maybe.”Opposition to the Åland Islands’ determination to shoot their wolves has indeed come from conservationists in Helsinki. “There should be space for wolves on Åland, there are lots of roe deer for them,” says Sami Säynevirta of Luonto-Liitto, a Finnish wildlife charity. “Killing a wolf should be a last resort. They should try other alternatives, like trying to scare a wolf away or building an electric fence. There should not be any exceptions for the Åland Islands.” Säynevirta suggests relocating the Åland wolves, ideally to Sweden, where ecologists are concerned that its wolf population is becoming inbred because the wolves’ route from Finland to Sweden is blocked by Lapland. There are no wolves in Lapland because they are shot to protect reindeer-herding in the region.According to Guillaume Chapron, associate professor in ecology at Sweden’s University of Agricultural Sciences, our notion of the wolf as an icon of wilderness and best-suited to wild areas is profoundly wrong. “The reason we say the wolf is a creature of wilderness is that the only place where we couldn’t easily eradicate them was in the wilderness. That was the only place they could survive. Then we made the emotional association – wolf equals wilderness. This artificially restricts the wolf, keeping it in areas where there are no people.”In fact, says Chapron, we should consider the wolf to be like a carnivorous roe deer, or a big fox – it’s an adaptable species that lives everywhere from Israeli deserts to the high Arctic. Wolf territories are dependent on food supply and the 750sq km of the Åland Islands might be big enough for a few territories, according to Chapron. “At the same time, I don’t want to be more royalist than the king,” he says. “If there were no people on these islands, we would have some wolves but would we really have more than two or three inbred packs? From an ecological point of view, it’s difficult to imagine a thriving Åland wolf population. The future of the wolf here is probably regular solitary animals passing by in the winter.”Chapron believes the relevance of Åland’s struggle with the wolf is not whether its newcomers survive or are slaughtered but whether the islanders’ approach becomes a template for the rest of Europe. Increasingly, he says, there is an assumption that predator populations have gone “too far” and proactive measures must be taken before wolves damage our best economic interests. Germany’s new coalition agreement includes a provision to ask the European Commission to review the protection of the wolf and bring about a “necessary” population reduction. “We don’t want ideas from Åland recolonising Europe,” says Chapron. “I don’t see why we need to reduce the population size of the wolf. We are stuck on a very low baseline. We almost eradicated the wolf and now there’s a modest recovery. Finally, we have a conservation success – predators are back. What’s the first thing the politicians start to talk about? Reduce the population.”Every islander I meet says the same thing: Åland is too small for the wolf. I’m sure I won’t find a single pro-wolf islander. Finally, I reach the Åland Hunting and Fishing Museum near the faded wooden fishing sheds of Käringsund. Inside stands an enormous taxidermised elk, a wall of taxidermised eider ducks and a taxidermised wolf, commemorating the last beast shot on the islands. There’s a net, too, that shows how the wolves were hunted to extinction here: a big hole was dug in the ground and covered by the net before a gang of islanders harried the wolves towards their trap.“I think it’s really interesting to find that people are still so afraid of the wolf, even though islanders haven’t met them since 1883,” says the museum manager, Åsa Hägg. Amazingly, in this sea of dead animals, I find a wolf enthusiast. “That’s because I’m a biologist,” says Hägg. “I think it’s good that we get new species. Of course there are a lot of sheep farmers and I can understand their fear, getting sheep killed by the wolf.”The last Åland lynx was shot in 1910 but in 2012 lynx were seen again on the island a few now appear to be living here, preying on the island’s thriving population of introduced wild roe deer. “When the lynx came back, it was, ‘Oh God, it is going to kill all the roe deer,’” says Hägg. “Now with the wolves it’s, ‘Oh God, it is going to kill all the sheep.’” She wonders whether her fellow islanders might live alongside wolves as Alaskans live alongside wolves and bears. But she fears they won’t.“I don’t think a wolf population is possible with the farmers here,” she says. “I have noticed the more we urbanise, the further we get from nature and the forest. In the past, they lived closer to nature and they knew it better. When we don’t have knowledge about nature and the forest and the animals, we get more afraid.”Germany There was broad public acceptance for Germany’s burgeoning wolf population after a public education programme for children and the introduction of ‘wolf commissioners’ who provided farmers with electric fences and guard dogs. But the latest coalition agreement includes a pledge to regulate the wolf population – currently against EU policy.Denmark A wolf pack arrived in Denmark for the first time in more than 200 years in 2017 when a young female wolf padded 500km from Germany. But one wolf was illegally shot dead last May.Belgium The last mainland European country to have no wild wolves finally recorded a wolf in January this year when Naya, a female from Germany, reached Flanders via The Netherlands.UK Britain’s last wolf was officially killed in 1680 in Killiecrankie, but one hunter claimed to see a Highland wolf in 1888. Rewilders want to reintroduce them farmers and most landowners are fiercely opposed. An exception is Paul Lister of Alladale wilderness reserve in the Highlands. He hopes to release wolves into a fenced area of 50,000 acres.USA After a 70-year absence, 41 wolves were reintroduced to Yellowstone Park in 1995-7. By 2015, there were more than 500 in the greater Yellowstone area. A popular video credits wolves with reshaping rivers, but scientists say wolves’ ‘ecosystem engineering’ is not quite so simple."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29ee81a1616ee993286fbe102aef80b389256ea0/1521_1862_3056_1834/master/3056.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d3f4b44973e1be6e91f45f58966bb608","title":"i admitted feelings for a friend why is he deleting my emails mariella frostrup","story":"We both know you are lingering when you should have moved on, Mariella Frostrup tells a woman who says she is still sending flirty emails to a man who says he has no romantic feelings for herThe dilemma Last year I accidentally told an old friend I liked him. He said he had no romantic feelings for me, which of course I accepted. Fast forward to now. I recently wrote to him asking for some help with my PhD idea. We messaged each other over it for about an hour and a half. Nothing wrong with that – but I noticed a few hours later that half the messages we exchanged were deleted by him. The content was flirty. He has a girlfriend but it’s complicated. What I don’t get is why did he delete the messages? It’s not unusual for us to be flirty. What’s going on?Mariella replies  Do you really need me to tell you? I’ve realised after two decades in the job (yes, yes, slow learner I know!) that often people write to me so I can spell out clearly what they already suspect but aren’t ready to accept. You certainly back up my theory, as the first part of your letter pretty succinctly sums up what’s causing the problems outlined in the latter half of it.It’s fair enough for me to be cast as the baddie, sitting here, emotionally removed, making my pronouncements on the lives of others. But perhaps that’s exactly why, two decades later, people are still writing. Advice from a stranger comes with an absence of judgment that’s hard to access from a close friend and hopefully makes the unpalatable element of self-realisation that bit less of a personal attack. If you don’t like what I have to say, you can conclude that I’ve misinterpreted you, or failed to understand the nuances of your situation because I don’t know you. I’m sure on occasion that’s a fair assumption, but on a good day what you’ll get back from this column is confirmation that what you suspect is the reality.The closer you are to someone, the harder it is not to use your privileged knowledge of them to offer wisdom based on the person you judge your friend to be. Our interpretation of relationships, like history, depends a lot on who is recounting the story. Laying your emotional life bare to a total stranger has to have some advantages. I don’t know you, I can’t use past history against you or form a prognosis based on it and so, in the best of cases, have an unimpeded picture of what’s being ulged.I answer only what I’m asked by my correspondents and on occasion that causes ire. I understand such misgivings but I also feel that mine is a privileged and advantageous vantage point. Ironically it’s far easier to find a clear path in complicated emotional territory from a stranger than during a night of wine-fuelled confessions with a close friend. Friends are a great sounding board but most of us turn in times of need to the one we hope will tell us what we want to hear.When you write to me you have no such luxury, but there is the possibility that the process of setting down your dilemma and having it evaluated on that basis will offer confirmation of what you already know, deep in your heart. Friends and family can be compromised by their knowledge of us and although past mistakes can provide great learning opportunities, at other times they merely muddy the water.You probably won’t like me for what I’m about to say but I’m sure you’ll come to see that there was no other way to read your dilemma. You and this male friend have been admirably honest with each other, which is to both your credit, even if on your part your admission was by mistake. It’s terrifying to own up to having feelings for someone we already know, braving the possibility that the relationship may be damaged beyond repair. He certainly didn’t string you along, which can be judged as either a chivalric or cowardly choice, depending on how forgiving your nature.Your mate has been crystal clear and I hope you expressed appreciation to him for honouring you with his honesty. Now, time has passed and yet you seem to be wishing it had stood still. When the possibility of a romance has been broached and rejected, the time for flirty emails also passes.You say this man’s relationship with his girlfriend is complicated, offering that as an excuse for why a flirtation isn’t unreasonable, but it won’t be improved by your emotionally convoluted interchanges. I imagine he’s deleted your conversations because they allude to a form of relationship he doesn’t want with you and doesn’t want to have to justify to her. Either way the signal he’s sending loud and clear is that yours is a platonic friendship and he is otherwise preoccupied.I know that’s hard to accept and the very nature of love is to inspire hope and optimism in the unrequited lover. We both know that you are lingering when you should have moved on and this man, if he’s to remain your friend, needs to stop being reminded that you wished otherwise. Advice on your PhD is a perfectly good reason to be in touch but not if you’re still scrutinising every word from him for potential weakening of his desire to keep things platonic.

They have all been rejected multiple times – and, what’s more, they’re proud of it.Vardalos revealed that she was dumped by her agent for “not being pretty” and told by her manager “actors can’t be writers”. A year later, she starred in her first screenplay, My Big Fat Greek Wedding.Blackman said she received 82 rejection letters before she was published. Later, she was told that her novel Noughts \u0026amp Crosses had been rejected for a literary award because “it would have shown more insight if a white author had written it”.Harris was sent rejection letters for what would become her bestselling novel Chocolat that described her manuscript as “too parochial” and “too European”, advising her to set it in the US and “dump the food”. Wright revealed: “I was passed over for a TV commercial to be done in the style of Spaced, even though I was the actual director of Spaced.”Usually, the connection between rejection and success is kept private. But a public outpouring recently on social media – not only by celebrities but by others using the #ShareYourRejections hashtag – questions why this is so. What is there to fear from rejection? And why do some people seem to cope with it better than others?Jia Jiang spent 100 days seeking out rejection and then wrote a book about his experiences, Rejection Proof: How to Beat Fear and Become Invincible. “I realised my fear of being rejected was worse than the rejection itself. I started losing my fear and having fun instead,” he said.He thinks everyone should practise getting rejected for unimportant things that don’t hurt too much. “It’s a skill to be able to handle rejection in a way that helps turn a ‘no’ into a ‘yes’. Practising being rejected when the stakes are low sets you up for success when it’s more serious. Persistence and tenacity can get you far. If you want to be successful and make an impact while you are on earth, you’re going to have to face rejection. If you run away from it the whole time, you’re going to have\u0026nbspregrets.”Clinical psychologist Dr Jessamy Hibberd says that the way you interpret rejection is important. “Most things worth doing take time and patience. Instead of telling yourself a rejection means ‘I’m not good at this’, you could interpret it as: ‘I’m not there yet’ or ‘this is just one person’s view’. Times when you’ve been rejected and felt disappointed but coped with it fine can be helpful to hold on to, because it makes you fear rejection less in the future and go for things more. You feel like you’ve got less to risk.”The young adult author Shannon Hale, who busts all the gender stereotypes about princesses with her latest illustrated series The Princess in Black, received a letter every week for two years rejecting her multiple award-winning first novel, The Goose Girl. “If you’re a man and you write about boys, you have a much better chance of getting published, because those books are marketed at everyone, while women who write books about girls are often marketed solely at girls.”Similarly, books by white authors about white families are perceived to have a universal appeal by publishers, while books by writers of colour featuring BAME characters are seen as niche, she says, resulting in smaller publishing quotas for more erse writers. “We want to believe it’s a meritocracy but everyone has unconscious biases. Not everyone’s going to love what you do, and that’s not necessarily anything to do with how talented you are.”When visiting schools, she talks to children about coping with rejection. Under #ShareYourRejections, she posted a photo of herself in a school assembly hall, laying down all her rejection letters in a long, laminated line. “There were times I wanted to give up but I had people in my life who believed in me – their support was crucial – and I felt writing was the only career that would make me happy.” Rejection was good for her, she thinks. “It can be motivating. It’s such a good feeling when you prove them wrong. I feel like I can weather just about everything now.”Nadia Latif, 34, associate director of the Young Vic, is equally positive about the fact that she was rejected from hundreds of directing jobs and bursaries in her 20s. “Being rejected has made me incredibly clear and uncompromising about who I am and my creative practice. It’s given me a sense of defiance. I want to make work that sticks it to power.”Every time she received a rejection, she would fire off three emails pursuing a new connection or opportunity. “I didn’t take it too personally. Everyone knows that being part of a creative industry means dealing with rejection, and I wasn’t going to let it get to me. I’ve wanted to be a director since I was at school. I’m the eldest of six so I was the family trailblazer – and I have dogged self-belief.”As a black Muslim woman, she often found it difficult to put her finger on why she was rejected, however. “Any oppressed group brings an extra level of baggage into the process. already got an anxiety about being ‘other’ before you get rejected.” Systemic racism, she points out, can be really subtle. “There are very few black female theatre directors with visible careers. If more erse people were doing the interviews, maybe you’d get more ersity getting through.”Jiang agrees that minorities get rejected more than majorities, and thinks that being white and male enables an advantageous mindset. “If you’re in the majority, no part of you thinks you were rejected because of your race or sex. It may be easier to think creatively about how to improve and overcome each rejection, instead of feeling rejection is inevitable and insurmountable.”When Jeff Ollerton, professor of bioersity at the University of Northampton, had a paper rejected by a journal for being “not very interesting”, he was one of the many #ShareYourRejections Twitter users who refused to take no for an answer. “I got quite cross,” he says. “I knew from my own experience there would be interest in it and that we all make bad judgments. I wrote to the editor that the reviewers were wrong and the rejection was shabby.” The journal eventually backed down and published the paper, which has since been cited more than 1,110 times.On social media, University of Glasgow professor Jo Sharp revealed that she had a paper rejected once because she “didn’t seem to know the work of Jo Sharp well enough”. “I found it quite funny. I was relieved I clearly wasn’t too dependent on self-citation.”Some rejections can be especially personal. Patrick Gilmore, a brand strategist, tweeted that, when he first asked out his wife five years ago, she told him she only wanted to be friends. He had received a rejection letter that day for a book he was writing. “I thought: I’m not being turned down twice in one day. I’ve often been described as a stubborn bastard. I knew I really liked her and I figured I had nothing to lose except my pride.” He agreed to meet up “as friends” and was optimistic the date would go well – which it did. The couple now have a two-year-old son and another baby on the way. “I sometimes think about what my life would be like if I had just accepted my wife’s rejection. I feel very lucky.”• Remember that no rejection is final, says Jiang – nor should it be the end of a conversation. “Always ask why you’ve been rejected and then ask for something else: explain why what you’re offering is valuable, tell them why you really want to do this, and ask them who can help\u0026nbspyou.”• Give yourself time to succeed, says Hibberd. “Don’t expect to get it right first time. More often than not, you’re going to take a few wrong turns before you work out the right turn.”• Consider the way you talk to yourself about rejection. Knowing why you failed is not useless information, Hibberd argues. “The more you keep going, the more helpful information you’ll get about how to succeed. Find a way to think: ‘Right, I’m going to show them.’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48f1bd1bc4b552a4338cc0cce09f2e3d53f6dc2e/0_228_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40e48d7d96c7e2b2e90d802939bdf01a","title":"unlike on screen dads i can hold a baby the real horror is in my head","story":"Feckless film dads are neither accurate nor interesting. The reality of fatherhood is seeing every new toy as a life-threatening weaponOne of the big surprises about having a baby is how amazing I am at it, compared to the world’s most famous men. Like so many others, a fair bulk of my expectations about fatherhood came from screen portrayals of feckless dads. These posit that babies are near impossible for men to supervise for more than 45 seconds at a time, difficult to even hold without them squirming and spraying like a startled squid. You will know this if you have watched a cinematic depiction of a man changing or feeding a baby for the first time, during which you’d be forgiven for thinking it was also the first time he had ever used his own hands.You can see the montage in your head already. Tom Selleck grimaces as he opens a nappy. Seth Rogen squints in horror at the instructions for a crib and Michael Gambon ends up showered in turds while wearing a nappy on his head. All of this repeats until Arnold Schwarzenegger collapses, weeping, in a heap of talcum powder, plastic wrapping and not-yet-dried baby piss.Later, Channing Tatum’s wife returns home to find that beautiful lunk she married, passed out in the cartoonish pile of plastic bottles he’s crushed with his big, muscular arse. Her husband, Zac Efron, still holds his phone on a snoring chest, its last Google search - ‘What is a baby?’ – dimly illuminating the gentle dark. What’s important, she thinks, is that her darling Charles Laughton has done his best: he’s looked after a child for half an afternoon, and both have survived.In reality, changing and bottle feeding are neither remotely difficult nor particularly unpleasant, just repetitive and, over time, a bit boring. Depicting this stuff as uniquely and inherently difficult for men bears the implication that we are stupid and, more insidious still, that parenting really should be left to women. Neither is accurate, or more importantly, interesting.It’s not like the horrors of fatherhood are difficult to find. I cringed through the boy’s first days, dementing myself over every ill that could befall him. All the cutesy things we bought have now taken on the appearance of spinning, skin-piercing choke hazards. This is because every object on Earth is now a spinning, skin-piercing choke hazard.Buttons might as well be Stanley knives, and keys shrapnel from a hand grenade. A cousin bought a stuffed rabbit so luxuriantly soft it’s almost a gas, and I spent 20 minutes imagining its small, hard nose bursting his perfect little eye. This pattern kept repeating me receiving a harmless item manufactured specifically for children, and reacting like I’d been posted a nail bomb dusted with Sars.I want to see Ryan Gosling, wracked with thoughts about his sleeping daughter swallowing her entire blanket and pillow set. Or Paul Rudd, unable to step within five metres of a window because he imagined his son being snatched from outside by a passing, stilt-wearing thief. Until then, screen dads will have to settle for being clueless dolts a hapless cohort of idiots being literally, and figuratively, shat on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47a0082deec05d5044877a3c6c056df7670a04d4/0_0_1960_1180/master/1960.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab1d5c18036e12c668799fa9229ccbaf","title":"greece in 10 audiobooks a listeners literary guide","story":"Myths, magic and mandolins feature in these stories about one of Europe’s oldest and grandest culturesIf you’re planning a summer vacation to Greece, the good news is it’s hard to get it wrong. From the stunning coastlines of Crete, to the lively festivals of Thessaloniki and the sacred sites of Delphi, the country combines beautiful landscapes with rich mythology and literature. Go on a sunset wine tour beside the bright-blue seas and domes of Santorini, believed to have been the home of the mythical land of Atlantis. Or visit Delos, where Apollo, the god of poetry, truth and prophecy, is said to have been born. Travel to one of the world’s largest natural harbours in Ithaca and you’ll see why Odysseus is intent on returning here in Homer’s Odyssey. Literature is inescapable in Greece. Athens offers its own tour of the spots where writers from all over the world once spent their time keen cyclists can take a three-hour bike tour around historic Athens and Plaka. Families with teens can be led around the city by a street-art expert, exploring the graffiti and urban art of a thriving creative scene. And if it’s great food you’re after, why limit yourself to eating when you can learn how to make it too? Join one of the city’s cooking lessons designed to give tourists a chance to recreate seven traditional Greek dishes, before heading home with a recipe book.If you’re in the market for a lazy holiday of sun, sand and sea, Crete could be the place for you. With its secluded bays and pink-sand beaches, Greece’s largest island is stunning and hospitable. Elounda is perhaps the fanciest part – a good spot if you’ve got a bit of cash to spend, or for the honeymooners. Alternatively, you could take the heart-stopping drive through narrow roads on steep cliffs to Stefanou Beach, an incredible cove of turquoise water. Elafonisi Beach is the place for pastel-pink sand. It is near a national park where tourists are known to come and do a five-hour hike through the gorge. Nature lovers might also enjoy Pátmos, designated as the “Holy Island” of Greece. Its settlement, Chorá, is a world heritage site, where white houses sparkle under the Aegean sun between historical streets leading from the island’s port, Skála, to the famous monastery. This is where John the Apostle wrote the Book of Revelation, having been banished to Pátmos by the Roman authorities. Ultimately, Greece’s extraordinary literary legacy is evident almost everywhere you look. Whether you’re exploring the inner cities or taking time out on the beach, a holiday in Greece is a great chance to familiarise yourself with the abundance of literature written about this ancient, mythical and beautiful country. And you might want to start with any number of the audiobooks listed below, perfect for listeners heading there this summer.The Magus by John Fowles, NaxosNicholas Urfe is a young Brit teaching English on a fictional Greek island, based on Spetses. Bored and consumed by his loneliness, he stumbles on to a wealthy estate and its Greek owner, Maurice Conchis, a man who may have collaborated with the Nazis. The two develop a friendship, and Nicholas is drawn into Conchis’s mysterious ways and psychological games, becoming a performer in re-enactments of the Nazi occupation and obscene parodies of Greek mythology. This is a chilling thriller, as well as a postmodern classic, in which the narrator, Nicholas, grows unsure of what is real. Many of its settings exist, however. The Lord Byron School, where Nicholas teaches, is the Anargyrios and Korgialenios School of Spetses, and Villa Bourani is a private house on the south side of the island, overlooking a popular public beach.The Names by Don DeLillo, MacmillanDeLillo knows how to write a dense and elusive novel. And he doesn’t miss the mark in this tale about the mythological world. The characters are bizarre, yet well realised, and the author uses their story to look at family loss and language. It’s classic DeLillo, in so far as all the players are smart and eloquent, including the children, and it is stylish throughout – much more than just your average exotic thriller. Set in Athens, this is a story that moves away from conventional plot to focus on politics, culture, religion and mythology.Murder in Mykonos by Jeffrey Siger, HachetteWhen a backpacker goes missing on the island of Mykonos, no one is sure if it is her body that is found in the ancient church. Andreas Kaldis, the new chief of police, recently arrived from Athens, is faced with an island of locals who are used to doing things their own way. The case reminds him, and veteran homicide investigator Tassos Stamatos, of the ritualistic murders of a few years ago, but the suspect has since killed himself. So who could the killer be? The book reveals its author’s intimate knowledge of Mykonos, with very visual descriptions and lots of information about the historic churches. Perhaps it’s no surprise this was a bestseller in Greece.Exit West by Mohsin Hamid, PenguinIn the newest novel by the author of The Reluctant Fundamentalist and How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia, Hamid tells a story about migration, in which the refugee journey happens through a portal. While living in an unnamed country taken over by war, Nadia and Saeed hear of “doors that could take you elsewhere, often to places far away”. The couple pass through a portal and find that they are on the Greek island of Mykonos, in a refugee camp. Here, “everyone was foreign, and so, in a sense, no one was”. Exit West is a timely tale about the global refugee crisis, much of which Greece has witnessed first hand. This modern history of the country is just as compelling as its mythology.Captain Corelli’s Mandolin by Louis de Bernières, AudibleSet on the Greek island of Kefalonia, the novel follows Antonio Corelli, an Italian army captain who comes to the island in the early days of the second world war. Corelli begins a love affair with Pelagia, the daughter of local doctor Iannis. Their relationship is complicated, as is to be expected in wartime, and atrocities mount around them, in both their personal lives and the life of the island itself. This is a love story and a war story – a tale of an island that is occupied first by the Italians, then the Germans. The characters are gloriously rendered and Captain Corelli’s Mandolin uses its magical setting to tell a now-famous story about romance and courage.Shirley Valentine by Willy Russell, Laughing StockYou’ve probably seen the film, adapted from the play of the same name. Shirley is a lonely middle-aged Liverpudlian woman in a loveless marriage. When her friend offers to take her on holiday to Greece, she packs her bags and heads for the sun. The gorgeous island of Mykonos is a strong attraction for both tourists and, seemingly, many of the writers who go there. And it’s the same for Shirley, who rediscovers herself here, along with the happiness she’s been longing for. Hers is a story of finding self-confidence, and recognising it’s never too late to start again.Zorba the Greek by Nikos Kazantzakis, Recorded BooksMaybe you’ve seen the film too? Written by Cretan Kazantzakis, the novel tells the story of a Greek intellectual who befriends working man Alexis Zorba. Zorba is a larger than life and unpredictable, unlike the narrator, who is modest and reserved. The two become friends, and the passion in Zorba’s character reminds both narrator and reader of the joys of living. Set in Crete, the tale captures the island’s passionate spirit – full of its smells, tastes and wines.The Song of Achilles by Madeline Miller, IsisThis is The Iliad skilfully told from another perspective. Writing from the point of view of Achilles’s best friend, Patroclus, Madeline Miller convincingly reimagines the relationship as a romance, casting a different light on the Trojan War. Achilles is given a human touch. He is gentle and capable of love. It’s a new side to an ancient story and it’s super smart. The men are not positioned as brothers in arms, but as the soul mates that Homer hints they might be. Greece’s wealth of mythological and classical literature is complemented by this masterful modern interpretation.My Family and Other Animals by Gerald Durrell, AudibleThis autobiographical work tells the story of British zookeeper, conservationist and TV presenter Gerald Durrell’s childhood on the Greek island of Corfu, where he discovered his interest in the natural world. Home-schooled during this period, Durrell became friends with a Greek doctor, Theodore Stephanides, who acted as a mentor to the boy and kindled his fascination with local fauna. The book is as much about the author’s family experiences as it is about Corfu. “It was originally intended to be a mildly nostalgic account of the natural history of the island,” wrote Durrell, “but I made a grave mistake by introducing my family into the book in the first few pages.” My Family and Other Animals is as charming as it is full of sunny olive groves and cypress trees, and all the more enjoyable for it.Mythos by Stephen Fry, PenguinAncient Greek literature has inspired creators from Shakespeare to Walt Disney. The Greek myths are told to you here by the ever-soothing voice of Stephen Fry, who takes you from Zeus to Athena with his typical humour. The Greek gods of the past become relatable, as pop culture, modern literature and music are woven into their stories. It is joyfully informal, yet full of the literary legacy threaded through so much of the tapestry of contemporary Greece.Your first audiobook is free with a 30-day trial from Audible – £7.99 a month after 30 days.

The move comes at a time when the company faces multiple investigations into its affairs in Europe.The Competition and Markets Authority warned the company in April that it was risking legal action for suspected breaches of consumer law, and National Trading Standards launched a separate investigation into “misleading” pricing just days later.A source familiar with developments at Viagogo told the  the company began notifying senior staff in London of plans to move their jobs to New York in May. “Several senior developers have already relocated, but they’re mostly people that have been at Viagogo since nearly day one and so are probably invested in the company,” said the source. “A few others are moving in the next couple of months, and others are leaving very soon.”A recruitment page on Viagogo’s website features multiple job adverts seeking staff to join its New York team, as well as some for other parts of the world.But the company is not recruiting for its office on London’s Fenchurch Street, where nearly 100 staff worked in customer services and website development last year, according to Companies House filings.The progress of the CMA and Trading Standards investigations is not expected to be affected by Viagogo moving staff overseas. But it could make life more difficult for MPs seeking to persuade Viagogo executives to attend a select committee hearing scheduled for next month.The company, whose headquarters are in Switzerland, refused to attend a hearing last year, in an almost unprecedented snub to a parliamentary committee. A spokesperson declined to say whether the company would attend the new evidence session.Sources in the ticket touting world told the  that Viagogo has also started paying them for their sales through a US company rather than Viagogo AG, its Swiss head office.Payments now arrive from Viagogo Entertainment Inc, registered in the US state of Delaware, which is known for its financial secrecy.Delaware is also the location of Viagogo’s ultimate parent company, Pugnacious Endeavors, which is owned by founder Eric Baker.The changes are thought to herald an expansion into US, where ticket resale has attracted less public criticism than in the UK and Europe.Baker co-founded rival ticket resale firm StubHub in the US, after realising the huge potential for “secondary ticketing”, where people can resell tickets for gigs and sporting events online.Most secondary ticketing sites claim they are simply providing a service for fans to recoup money for tickets they no longer want or can’t use.But they have been criticised for providing a platform for professional touts who harvest tickets in bulk when they go on sale, in order to resell them at a vast mark-up.The Competition and Markets Authority launched an investigation into suspected breaches of consumer law by secondary ticketing sites last year. It later singled out Viagogo for failing to bow to its demand to comply with consumer laws about information provided to customers, warning the company it faced legal action if it did not comply with demands to make changes.The Advertising Standards Authority referred Viagogo to National Trading Standards earlier this year over “misleading” pricing information.Switzerland’s secretariat for economic affairs launched civil proceedings against Viagogo over suspected unfair business practices last year, while Fifa lodged a criminal complaint against the company over unauthorised sale of tickets for the 2018 World Cup in Russia.Viagogo has elicited fierce criticism in the UK on multiple occasions, including a call from digital minister Margot James to boycott the company.As well as investigations by the CMA and Trading Standards, the site has faced accusations of “callous profiteering” from charity events. It has also been accused of withholding refunds from consumers, while a  investigation revealed that touts were using the site to resell football tickets, which is illegal in the UK.With scrutiny of secondary ticketing intensifying, Ticketmaster has said it would shut its own resale sites, GetMeIn and Seatwave, leaving StubHub and Viagogo as the only major players in the UK."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f02cec286c7e1c65e2ecdeb045af06b9dcf5de0e/121_426_4876_2926/master/4876.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f5aa2bb6d364d6b660adc6f608017a2d","title":"best photos of the day flying f1 car storm surfer","story":"’s picture editors bring you photo highlights from around the world including a dramatic crash at Spa, the Pope’s visit to Ireland and the Notting Hill carnival"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4671a58f90fa0ce003d006dabf59084b411b0ce2/153_326_5074_3044/master/5074.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f2bbcc0ff2e92f830f16952115860f3","title":"have people inspected at irish border after brexit says jacob rees mogg","story":"Critics deride suggestion of return to arrangements ‘as we had during the Troubles’Jacob Rees-Mogg has sparked a fresh row about the status of the Irish border after Brexit after a video emerged in which he suggests a return to checks “as we had during the Troubles”.The Conservative MP is seen on the footage from the public meeting suggesting the government could “keep an eye on” the border.“Ireland would not be a free for all. It would be perfectly possible to continue with historic arrangements to ensure that there wasn’t a great loophole in the way people can get into the UK, to leave us in as bad a position as we are already in,” Rees-Mogg says.“There would be our ability, as we had during the Troubles, to have people inspected. It’s not a border that everyone has to go through every day, but of course for security reasons during the Troubles, we kept a very close eye on the border, to try and stop gun-running and things like that.”The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, was sharply critical of his comments. “This man knows nothing of Northern Ireland,” he said.Rees-Mogg has previously been criticised for saying he did not need to visit Northern Ireland to understand the challenges Brexit posed for communities on the border.His comments, earlier this year, were described as arrogant and judgmental by people living there. In an interview with BBC Northern Ireland, he said: “I don’t think my visiting the border is really going give me a fundamental insight into the border beyond what one can get by studying it.”The Sinn Féin politician Mártín Ó Muilleoir, South Belfast MLA, said Rees-Mogg’s comments on the border after Brexit showed “contempt and complete disregard for the people of Ireland north and south, through the ridiculous suggestion of a ‘technological border’.“Anyone labouring under the misapprehension that the Tories care a jot about the north is living in a fool’s paradise.”The status of the Irish border remains one of the toughest sticking points in the UK’s negotiations on a withdrawal agreement with the EU.Theresa May has said no UK prime minister could accept the EU’s proposal, for Northern Ireland effectively to remain in the customs union and the single market, with the rest of the UK outside – requiring a border in the Irish Sea.The EU for its part regards Britain’s solution of a “facilitated customs arrangement”as unworkable.The Cabinet Office minister, David Lidington, acknowledged on Friday that the October deadline once regarded as the end-date for the Brexit negotiations could now slip to November.Tensions among senior Conservatives in cabinet were also exposed at the weekend, as the Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, played down the significance of Treasury forecasts suggesting a no-deal Brexit would blow an £80bn hole in public finances.“I’m always wary of any forecast, because most of them have been proved to be wrong,” he told the Sunday Times.As May battles to complete a deal, Rees-Mogg is leading a vocal group of Conservative MPs calling on the party to “chuck Chequers”, the negotiating position painstakingly agreed by cabinet at their July awayday.They are keen to play down the significance of avoiding a hard border in Ireland, which they believe has driven the logic of the push toward a softer Brexit.Boris Johnson told MPs in his resignation speech, after he rejected the Chequers deal: “We allowed the question of the Northern Irish border, which had hitherto been assumed on all sides to be readily soluble, to become so politically charged as to dominate the debate.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa2db7efb9645b770dde26c1cff05ce07e65c54a/0_17_4712_2829/master/4712.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0167680df87b59dc00306a0c991c935e","title":"nicola sturgeon says snp is not able to suspend alex salmond","story":"Scottish first minister says party has not received a complaint for it to act uponNicola Sturgeon has said the Scottish National party is not legally able to suspend Alex Salmond over allegations of sexual harassment after facing calls from other parties to take action.The first minister and SNP leader said the complaints were being investigated by the Scottish government, which was unable to share details of the complaint or the names of Salmond’s two accusers to third-party organisations.Salmond, a former SNP leader and first minister, has repeatedly denied he is guilty of harassment or criminality, but opposition parties insist that since the claims have been passed to the police, the party should suspend his membership.The Daily Record, which first broke the story, has alleged that, in one of the incidents under investigation, Salmond touched the breasts and bottom of a female civil servant at Bute House, his then official residence in Edinburgh, in December 2013.Two women lodged complaints against Salmond in January 2018 using new anti-harassment procedures introduced for the Scottish government by Leslie Evans, the Scottish government’s chief civil servant, in the wake of harassment scandals at Westminster.In a statement issued on Sunday, Sturgeon said: “In this case, unlike in some previous cases, the investigation into complaints about Alex Salmond has not been conducted by the SNP and no complaints have been received by the party.“Also, for legal reasons, the limited information I have about the Scottish government investigation cannot at this stage be shared with the party – and rightly it is the party, not me as leader, that has the power to suspend membership.”Sturgeon added: “In summary, the party has no legal basis at this time to suspend Alex Salmond’s membership. Of course, should that situation change, the matter will be reconsidered, as it would be for any member. The party’s rules apply to all members and no one is above them.”Salmond has already retaliated against the Scottish government by lodging a judicial review of its handling of the complaints against him, accusing them of breaching his confidentiality by leaking details of the investigation – a charge the Scottish government denies.He welcomed Sturgeon’s statement on Twitter, saying: “I agree with Nicola that every single person in Scotland, regardless of who they are, should be treated fairly and equally. That included being given confidentiality and treated with fairness.“Clearly it has not been maintained in this case but subject to sustained leaking of the most unfair kind. That helps no-one but harms everyone. It is therefore crucial to find out who in government was responsible.”Rhoda Grant, for Scottish Labour, demanded that the Scottish government reveal all details of meetings between Salmond and Sturgeon where the complaints were discussed. Salmond said he had met her face to face three times, and implied they had had other contacts too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa50f0e1d82295315880fe4b7bbf152ab551f0ed/0_291_4781_2869/master/4781.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=541cdd1e0db2ff9f1e8947bf54fb8327","title":"no deal brexit uk legal vacuum keir starmer theresa may","story":"Exclusive: shadow Brexit secretary says Theresa May would face race to pass lawsTheresa May and the government would face a race against time to pass a slew of new laws, or risk creating an “unsustainable legal vacuum”, if Britain plunged out of the EU without a deal, Labour’s Keir Starmer has warned.Dominic Raab insisted last week that the government had the legislation in place to cope, if Britain is forced to leave in March 2019 without a withdrawal agreement.“Our laws will be on the statute book, the staff will be in place, the teams will be in post and our institutions will be ready for Brexit – deal, or no deal,” the Brexit secretary said.But Labour’s analysis suggests new legislation would have to be passed hastily in four key policy areas:The government has long promised an immigration bill – but has not yet even published a white paper.Several new regulators or other public bodies would also have to be created, including in medicines and aviation, Labour claims. The withdrawal bill gives ministers some powers to do this, but they are tightly curtailed.Starmer described last week’s release of 24 technical notices on how the government is preparing for a no deal as a “poorly executed PR stunt designed to convince Tory MPs to back the prime minister’s discredited Chequers proposal”.He said the government has “barely scratched the surface” of what would need to be done to prepare the UK for a no-deal scenario, and there was a serious risk of an “unsustainable legal vacuum”.The withdrawal agreement with the EU is intended to allow for most existing laws and institutions to remain in place during a transitional period of almost two years, while the government negotiates the details of its future trading relationship with the EU.But if talks break down – or MPs reject the deal – it is unclear what would happen next. Given the March deadline created by triggering article 50, one possibility is that Britain could end up leaving without any agreement in place.Joe Owen, of thinktank the Institute for Government, said that in theory parliament could pass legislation rapidly in an emergency but it is unclear whether MPs would cooperate. “Parliament could hold it up, if it wanted to,” he said. “Whichever avenue you go down, there’s going to be a bunfight in parliament.”Hardline Brexiters on the Conservative backbenches are keen to play down the risks of a no-deal outcome, with some believing it would be preferable to the Chequers position, with its “common rulebook” and single market for goods.They reacted angrily to chancellor Philip Hammond’s decision to release a letter last week highlighting Treasury forecasts that the hit to GDP under a no-deal scenario could be £80bn.Former Brexit secretary David Davis used an article in the Sun on Sunday to urge the public to “ignore the misery merchants of the Treasury, stop fearing things that will never happen, and start planning for the real opportunities that this great country can grasp when it sets its mind to it”.With another week to go before MPs return to Westminster from their long summer recess, campaign groups on both sides of the Brexit ide are gearing up to try to influence the outcome of what promises to be a tense six months.People’s Vote, a cross-party pressure group that hopes to secure a referendum on the final Brexit deal, is urging its members not to attack the Labour leadership, as they seek to secure a vote at the party’s conference on the issue.In a leaked memo seen by the , its director of communications, Tom Baldwin, says: “This campaign is not about Jeremy Corbyn and we must not – will not – use it to damage or undermine the party’s leadership or attack them personally.”Baldwin also seeks to shut down recent rumours that the People’s Vote campaign could be used as a vehicle for a breakaway group of Labour MPs to form a new political party.A hard Brexit would take Britain out of the EU’s single market and customs union and ends its obligations to respect the four freedoms, make big EU budget payments and accept the jurisdiction of the ECJ: what Brexiters mean by “taking back control” of Britain’s borders, laws and money. It would mean a return of trade tariffs, depending on what (if any) FTA was agreed.\u0026nbspSee our full Brexit phrasebook.“The looming prospect of a botched Brexit is too important for anyone to use it for the pursuit of any other political objective,” he says.Labour has edged closer to backing a referendum on the final deal, if parliament rejects it – though the leadership would prefer the opportunity to challenge May in a general election.“The EU Withdrawal Act is a crucial piece of legislation that will ensure there is a functioning statute book on exit day, irrespective of the outcome of negotiations.”Meanwhile Leave Means Leave, which counts Nigel Farage among its prominent backers, has set itself a £5m fundraising target in a bid to persuade May and her cabinet to ditch the Chequers position and press ahead with a “clean Brexit”.“Leave Means Leave have the fight of our lives ahead of us. We are the David to the establishment’s Goliath but we are committed to winning this fight,” said its chair, John Longworth.The government’s technical notices on a no-deal Brexit – the first batch of more than 80 expected to be released before the end of next month – warned that tariffs could be imposed on UK exports, credit card payments to the EU would become more expensive and Brits living abroad could lose access to payments from their bank accounts.However, ramping up preparations for a no-deal outcome was one aspect of the agreement reached in Chequers in July. May has scheduled an extra cabinet meeting, on 13 September, to discuss the government’s readiness, with some ministers complaining not enough is being done."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4aa79b9567452dc74bd8ab4ed201851bc41133c6/0_122_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83821c47cb579b2c805386c8546d23d0","title":"vince cable radical reforms lib dems","story":"Allies deny reports party leader will trigger leadership contest next monthVince Cable has told his MPs he will not remain Liberal Democrat leader in the long term, but hopes to push through radical reform of his party’s rulebook before stepping aside.Cable is due to make a speech on 7 September, a week before party members gather for their annual conference in Brighton.He is expected to outline proposals for sweeping changes to his party’s rules, including introducing a new category of registered supporter, similar to the hundreds of thousands who signed up to back Jeremy Corbyn in Labour’s 2015 leadership contest.Another rule change under consideration is to allow non-MPs to stand for the party’s leadership – a measure that would spark speculation about whether Cable wants to make the Lib Dems a vehicle for realignment of the centre ground in British politics.Allies denied reports that Cable would use the occasion to trigger a leadership contest in the near term, saying that he would not announce a date. They did acknowledge, however, that while Cable would continue as party leader for an early general election – if Theresa May is forced to call one next year, for example – he would be unlikely to stay on until 2022, when the next general election is due if parliament runs its course.Other Lib Dem sources suggested there was a widespread assumption, including among MPs, that Cable would step down once Britain had left the EU. Some MPs believe his authority will start to drain away once it becomes clear he plans to step aside.Cable was business secretary in the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition government. He lost his Twickenham seat in 2015, but regained it in last year’s general election, and took over as party leader from Tim Farron.Farron, who remains an MP, stepped aside in the aftermath of last year’s general election after he was repeatedly pressed during the campaign about his personal beliefs on issues including homosexuality. That year the Lib Dems performed below expectations in what many thought would be a Brexit-focused campaign, returning 12 MPs against the eight of two years earlier.Cable has made keeping Britain in the EU the centrepiece of his policy platform, calling for an “exit from Brexit”. He has also made speeches on other major policy issues, including suggesting a breakup of giant tech companies. Some activists, however, express private concern about his low media profile.The former energy secretary Ed Davey could stand in a future leadership contest, after declining to do so last year for family reasons. Cable’s well-regarded deputy, Jo Swinson, who is currently on maternity leave, is also widely seen at Westminster as a potential successor.Daisy Benson, the party’s former prospective parliamentary candidate for Yeovil, highlighted the Lib Dems’ gains in May’s local elections, in which they took councils including Richmond and Kingston in London, and said she welcomed reforms that could broaden the party’s supporter base.“Our council results are really excellent, but we do need to be a lot more ambitious,” she said.The package of party reforms under consideration has been partly inspired by Justin Trudeau’s Liberal party in Canada. Trudeau broadened his party’s supporter base as he swept to power."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2f882fca9c32772e194950bd0fd5d2100161c59/154_32_1522_913/master/1522.jpg?width=500\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=03e1c44b477f794fbbb1bfebf342f059 1000w","title":"silver coins detectorists yorkshire reveal early roman settlement","story":"Detectorists who found silver treasure led archaeologists to high-status site in 2015One of the earliest Roman settlements ever to be discovered in the Yorkshire region has been unearthed by a group of crowdfunded archaeologists.The exact location of the high-status settlement has been kept a secret to protect it from night hawkers (illegal metal-detectorists) and looters, but archaeologists have described it as astounding.The first sign that there may be something worth exploring at the site came three years ago when some metal detectorists uncovered a hoard of 2,000-year-old silver coins.Friends Paul King, Robert Hamer and Robin Siddle found the hoard of 18 silver coins in 2015, but the discovery has been kept secret until now, to enable archaeologists to explore the area, which appears to be a high-status Roman settlement.Last week more silver coins were uncovered, with hundreds of Roman pottery sherds and a tiny brooch, found on one of three neonatal burials.Lisa Westcott Wilkins, who has been managing the excavation, said: “This is one of the earliest Roman settlements in the north that we have discovered to date. It has felt like a Richard III moment in terms of excitement,” referring to the discovery of the remains of the Plantagenet king under a car park in Leicester in 2012.“Some of the items we have found have been very exciting. These people were burying infants with jewellery – there was a beautiful brooch – which would have been for a cloak. This suggests to us that it was high status.”The excavation is being conducted by DigVentures, founded by archaeologists in 2012 to fill the gap left by severe cuts to research archaeology by universities and local authorities.King and his friends reported their discovery to the Portable Antiquities Scheme, which encourages the recording of archaeological objects found by members of the public. A coroner will decide ownership of the treasure.“Archaeologists and detectorists historically have a fraught relationship. However, we were very lucky with Paul and his friends contacting the scheme and we were able to protect the site,” Wilkins said.She added: “It is such a rare find. We have many settlements from later periods – 3rd and 4th centuries – but this one is much earlier and much higher status. This is why it is so rare.”Dig teams have found post holes and foundation trenches, with the remnants of stone walls that once stood there and evidence suggests there were also one or two villas, possibly belonging to rich families. Fine pottery including decorated bowls and amphorae, which would have transported olive oil and wine from the Mediterranean, have also been discovered.Wilkins said the site’s location would be kept secret for a while longer due to the danger of night hawkers. There is a high level of surveillance on the site.She said: “We have to protect the site’s heritage value. The landowner has already had someone arrested. The night hawkers and some metal detectorists are unscrupulous and when they raid these sites a lot of the stuff ends up on eBay without any care for its historical value.”The project has been partly funded by a £61,100-grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund. DigVentures said an important part of its work was accessibility and added it would present the finds at various public events.The public has also been encouraged to get involved through the DigNation festival, which takes place in September in Lindisfarne, with lectures and the chance to experience excavations among the events planned."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9063f875855c73042052054c064f123f3171c624/0_136_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=280222ab96db1c35e4821854224a8fe6","title":"paralympian left stranded on stansted flight after staff delay","story":"Anne Wafula Strike had to wait on board her disembarked flight for 45 minutes despite having booked assistanceParalympian and disability rights campaigner Anne Wafula Strike was left stranded at Stansted airport on her return from the world para athletics European championships in Berlin after airport staff failed to meet her flight to take her off the plane.She said that being abandoned on the plane left her “profoundly distressed”.“As a wheelchair user, it’s very frustrating and caused me great inconvenience to be forgotten and stuck on a plane,” she stated. “It also meant that other passengers were held up too. Not good at all. As a disability rights campaigner, I feel that this is an area that needs serious attention. It is happening to far too many disabled travellers.”Wafula Strike was left on board Ryanair flight 146 from Berlin to Stansted after her journey home to Harlow following the championships in Berlin. Her flight’s departure from Berlin had been delayed due to storms in the south of Italy, from where the aircraft eventually arrived. It left Berlin late, and landed at Stansted just before 9pm on Friday evening almost two hours after it was scheduled to arrive.There was a delay of 20 minutes before the doors opened at Stansted but once all the passengers had got off the plane, Wafula Strike was left on the aircraft with Ryanair cabin crew after previously having booked assistance at the airport several weeks before she travelled.Wafula Strike, who had to wait for around 45 minutes for ground staff to arrive to help her off, said: “Being left alone on the plane after all the hassles of flight delays and depriving myself of fluids to avoid needing to go to the toilet, I felt neglected and desperate as well as profoundly distressed.“My other worry was whether or not my wheelchair was OK. Was this incident just a mistake or was it negligence and sheer lack of care for disabled passengers?Wafula Strike received media coverage last year when she went public about an accessible toilet on a train being out of order, forcing her to wet herself because she was on a long journey.That incident happened in December 2016 and involved a three hour train journey from Nuneaton, also to Stansted Airport.Following the incident, for which she received compensation from the train company, she was asked by then transport minister Paul Maynard to advise on how to make transport more accessible for people with disabilities.Wafula Strike was awarded an MBE for her services to disability sport and is a board member of UK Athletics as well as the patron of several disability charities. She said the train incident completely robbed her of her dignity.When Wafula Strike was finally taken off the plane she was forced to wait more than an hour in the luggage hall before she could retrieve her luggage – longer than the duration of the Berlin to Stansted flight.“I had to cancel two taxis that had been pre-booked, then was forced to pay for another taxi,” she said.The BBC’s Frank Gardner has been stranded on flights at Heathrow Airport twice in the last six months because of failures of airport ground staff to help him off the plane.Dr Philippa Whitford, SNP MP and surgeon, tweeted: “This is shocking. Travel is about expanding our world. Do Ryanair and Stansted airport think that should not be available to those with mobility issues?”Wafula Strike lodged a complaint with Ryanair on Saturday and received an automated acknowledgment from the airline.A spokesperson for the airport said: “We are disappointed to hear about Anne’s experience at Stansted on Friday evening. We are in the process of investigating how such a situation arose and have asked Omniserv, the company responsible for looking after passengers with reduced mobility, for a full explanation of why Anne had to wait for such a long time on the aircraft.“On Friday evening, bad weather across Europe unfortunately resulted in significant delays to some aircraft landing at Stansted and had a knock on impact on the baggage handling delivery times for a number of our passengers.”Ryanair has been approached for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa9dec00a2f0f81b53646b40fafdbe4bcb017aed/0_0_3064_1838/master/3064.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=842e7dd3e5cc9641508513a1b5e4f8e2","title":"lgbt activists victoria atkins minister women trans comments","story":"Victoria Atkins said she is ‘a little cautious’ about use of gender reassignment The minister for women has been condemned by transgender campaigners for saying that young people are having their gender reassigned as “an answer to questions they are perhaps not asking themselves”.Victoria Atkins cited an increase in the number of teenagers who were being referred to undergo gender reassignment surgery and declared: “We need to get down to the reasons why this is happening.”The remarks provoked criticism from leading LGBT rights activists who said it was “damaging to imply that trans teens are being given treatment lightly”.“It may simply be a case of greater awareness, it may be that for some they see it as an answer to questions they are perhaps not asking themselves. We need to be particularly alert to this with regard to young people.“The treatments are so serious and life-changing. I’m a little cautious of the use of those treatments because of the potential for the rest of their lives.“Lots of questions are rightly being asked about how we treat young people. People whose bodies perhaps haven’t developed yet.”Fox Fisher, a patron of the LGBT+ helpline, said: “The women’s minister’s concerns need to be put into perspective and she needs to look into the actual reality of treatment given to trans people, and she needs to consult with trans organisations and people that work on the ground.“It is damaging to imply that trans teens are being given treatment lightly, as behind it are decades of research and best practice. Trans people’s lives are at stake here, and we know what we need.”James Morton, the Scottish Trans Alliance manager, said the number of transgender young people was very small and there was an “obsession with their existence” within sections of the media.“Transgender young people remain very rare, despite the current media obsession with their existence. The NHS requires people to be adults before they can get any irreversible gender reassignment treatment.“As Victoria Atkins explores this topic in more depth, I’m confident that she will see through the anti-trans campaigners’ scaremongering and be reassured that the NHS assistance trans youth receive is actually very carefully provided and safe.”Figures released by the Tavistock Clinic, the UK’s main centre specialising in gender issues, show that 2,519 referrals for its young persons’ gender identity development service were received during 201718, around a quarter more than the previous year which had 2,016 referrals.At the time that the figures were disclosed, Dr Polly Carmichael, gender identity development service director at the clinic’s Gender Identity Development Service, said there was “no single explanation for the increase in referral figures”, adding: “There has been significant progress towards the acceptance and recognition of transgender and gender erse people in our society.“There is also greater public knowledge about specialist gender clinics and the pathways into them, and an increased awareness of the possibilities around physical treatments for younger adolescents.”They said: “Why isn’t there a public outcry over the fact that a vulnerable group of children are suffering because we as a society are failing to give them the support that they need?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/231cbbd04c923477b70cb95ecb08d185dc6bd9b7/0_234_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ce26a3e22d2fe275f3d585087a5396d","title":"alejandro valverde turns back clock second stage vuelta","story":"• 2009 winner beats Michal Kwiatkowski in uphill sprint• Team Sky’s Kwiatkowski takes leader’s red jerseyThe 2009 red jersey winner, Alejandro Valverde of Movistar, rolled back the years at the Vuelta a España on Sunday, beating Team Sky’s Michal Kwiatkowski in an uphill sprint to be crowned king of the Caminito del Rey.However, Kwiatkowski’s second runners-up placing in two days was enough to see him take the overall lead, as a dominant Team Sky looked untroubled by the absence of Chris Froome and Geraint Thomas.Valverde’s win was his 10th Vuelta stage since he made his Grand Tour debut here in 2002. The triumph consolidated the 38-year-old’s status as one of the most successful riders of his generation. “I love La Vuelta,” the Spaniard said afterwards. “The Giro is a beautiful race, the Tour is a beautiful race. But for me La Vuelta is the most beautiful. It’s my home country and winning here is always special.”Kwiatkowski was magnanimous. “The fans enjoyed a Valverde win,” he said with a laugh.The 163.5km stage two began amid the opulence of Marbella, with its marina and countless golf courses. Under a warm sun the 176-rider peloton headed inland, passing picturesque hillside hamlets and imposing wind turbines. A Thomas De Gendt-led breakaway animated early proceedings up the Puerto de Ojén climb, establishing a lead that at one point stretched past three minutes.The time gap diminished as the peloton ascended the sunburnt summit of the Caminito del Rey, famous for a path pinned to the sheer walls of El Chorro gorge – popularly known, until recent repairs, as the world’s most dangerous walkway. The lead group’s numbers dwindled as it headed towards the base of the Caminito for a second and final attempt, ultimately being swamped by the peloton with 19km remaining.The catch precipitated a series of attacks, as Movistar and Sky jostled for position ahead of the decisive climb. Laurens De Plus made an audacious late solo move, but could not hold off Valverde and Kwiatkowski on the final ramp.The general classification contenders Simon Yates, Nairo Quintana and Thibaut Pinot finished safely in the bunch while the pre-race favourite Richie Porte lost over 13 minutes. The Australian was hit by gastroenteritis on the eve of the Vuelta and was in evident pain in the closing kilometres.The Vuelta continues on Monday with a 178.2km stage departing from Mijas on the Andalusian coast. An early category one ascent of the scenic Puerto del Madroño provides the first major climbing test of the Grand Tour, before a false-flat finish in Alhaurín de la Torre offers an opportunity for sprinters and punchers alike."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67a7efddd7379f3ede83ebb5d450a20f9f97a52b/0_94_4889_2933/master/4889.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef6657a6a32e59575d6a90cecd9a4d73","title":"anthony van dyck aidan obrien futurity curragh","story":"Aidan O’Brien has endured a poor summer by his record-breaking standards but after Anthony Van Dyck spear-headed a one-two-three for the Ballydoyle stable in the Group Two Futurity Stakes at the Curragh on Sunday it was a positive sign that things are on the up again.The Galileo colt galloped his front-running stablemate, Christmas, into submission with something to spare and cemented his place at the head of next year’s Derby betting.After welcoming back his runners O’Brien said: “I’m delighted. I would imagine they will all come back here for the National Stakes. I’d say Anthony Van Dyck will get a mile well. We always viewed him as a horse that would get middle distances next season.

Garcia, the stylish French player identified a few years ago by Andy Murray as one to watch, represents a serious threat.Konta beat her in the fourth round during her wonderful Wimbledon run in 2017, having lost to her in three tough sets at Indian Wells that year, and leads their rivalry 3-2.It has been hard to gauge Konta’s game this year, as good performances have not always been rewarded with victory, and some of her losses have been against the game’s best players – including Elina Svitolina, twice, Angelique Kerber, Caroline Wozniacki, Petra Kvitova, Ashleigh Barty, Venus Williams and Jelena Ostapenko. But she also lost against the world No 98, Yulina Putintseva, in the first round of the French Open and had shock setbacks against Fanny Stollar (219), Bernarda Pera (123) and Marketa Vondrousova (54).Then came what should have been a kick-starter win to end them all: 6-0, 6-1 against Serena Williams in the first round in San Jose a month ago. It was the heaviest defeat of the American’s career but Konta’s victory was somewhat diluted when Williams later revealed she had learned 10 minutes before the match that the killer of her half-sister in 2003 had just been released from prison.Konta, obviously unaware of her opponent’s state of mind, said: “I don’t know what goes on in her personal life, so I went out there and did the best that I could. It’s unfortunate if she’s going through something that’s obviously difficult but I didn’t take it as anything negative on myself.”As she correctly pointed out, she can only take care of what happens on her side of the court. The only stage she could meet Serena again in this tournament would be in the final and the path there for both of them looks equally challenging.Nevertheless, while Williams has gone back into cliche mode, talking about obstacles and striving and climbing mountains, the rest of the field are eyeing her with their customary trepidation. If she builds up momentum with a good early run, even though the world No 1, Simona Halep, lurks in her section of the draw, she will be dangerous on her return after two years away.If there is to be a new champion, it is not inconceivable that it could be Aryna Sabalenka, the emotional 20-year-old Belarusian who beat Konta in the first round in Cincinnati this month and lit up Connecticut on Saturday when she won her first WTA title by outclassing Carla Suárez Navarro. That followed fine recent wins against Wozniacki, Karolina Pliskova and Julia Görges. All of a sudden the women’s game is alive with talk of the next rising star.Sabalenka, who serves and hits off the ground with awesome power, enters a main draw here for the first time, seeded 26. She starts against the American Danielle Collins on Tuesday and could play Kvitova in the fourth round.While Konta’s progress has stuttered, Heather Watson’s season has brightened up considerably in recent weeks. She reached the final in Vancouver and she plays on Monday against Ekaterina Makarova after a fine run in the qualifying tournament.“I’ve been focusing on myself and being happy. I’ve been doing a lot of things off the court at tournaments such as sightseeing. It has kept me fresh rather than just practising and then going to bed.“Even now I feel fresh and motivated for my next match. I went canoeing in a river in Vancouver which was very peaceful and relaxing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/953fcd8f7dab9f606cda27c1c46a86c7ef5052a3/0_310_5200_3121/master/5200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3dba2cceb2f56be97a426fb3dd77026f","title":"neil simon appreciation broadway theatre stage","story":"From his early years working for Sid Caesar, the gifted, prolific New Yorker became a Broadway institutionThe last of Neil Simon’s 30 plays or musicals to open in America’s main theatre district was called 45 Seconds from Broadway (2001). It was a suitable climactic title. For the preceding four decades, Broadway theatregoers had rarely been more than a minute or so from a Simon play.The first productions of his works achieved around 18,000 performances between them, making, at the usual rate of eight shows a week, a combined 44 Broadway years, a total further swollen by revivals of several hits. Given the decrease in the number of openings and increase in ersity of voices, it seems unlikely any dramatist will ever better Simon’s Broadway statistics. His status as American commercial theatre’s de facto writer in residence was recognised in 1983, when the Alvin Theatre on Manhattan’s West 52nd Street was re-named The Neil Simon Theatre.Simon’s longest runners were Barefoot in the Park (1963) and Brighton Beach Memoirs (1982), typically autobiographical spins on respectively his first marriage (of five) and his 1930s childhood, and The Odd Couple (1965), one of several comedies in which living together exposed tensions between an optimist and a pessimist. Marvin Neil Simon was born in a celebrated American place – New York City – on a celebratory date – 4 July – and these fates of birth can be seen to have shaped his writing.Almost all of his stage plays were set in Manhattan, the Bronx or further upstate. And, in aiming for comic fireworks, Simon struck a note of festive independence from the classically influenced tragic tone of the other major 20th-century American playwrights: Eugene O’Neill, Tennessee Williams, Arthur Miller and Sam Shepard.Simon’s focus on comedy routinely led to his being marked down by the adjudicators of theatrical greatness, a common fate for literary wits. He would often be described as “the American Alan Ayckbourn”, just as the Scarborough-based dramatist was routinely introduced to US audiences as “the British Neil Simon”.In fact, their work is very different, Simon favouring formal gags and wisecracks while Ayckbourn’s humour arises from intricately achieved changes in situation and staging. But the two men overlapped in being critically underrated and having most success at home. While Simon had several West End hits – including a tremendous version of The Sunshine Boys, with Danny De Vito and Richard Griffiths in 2012 – he was essentially a Broadway institution. Simon’s apprenticeship had been in radio and television in the 1950s, primarily serving as a gag-writer on Sid Caesar’s Your Show of Shows, an experience mined in his 1993 stage play, Laughter on the 23rd Floor. In common with many of the personnel in comedy broadcasting – including Caesar himself, and writers Woody Allen and Mel Brooks – Simon was Jewish American, and stands as a key representative of that dominant voice, laughing against the darkness of life, love and death, in modern American writing. Of his near-contemporary Jewish New Yorkers, Philip Roth chose the novel, Allen and Brooks cinema. Simon always planned a route from TV to the theatre.The crucial influence of television remained, though, Simon’s favoured form being a stage version of that small-screen staple, the situation comedy, and, in particular the staple TV sub-genre of the awkward housemates. Simon’s first three Broadway hits put uncomfortable couples in a living room. In Come Blow Your Horn (1961), a nervous virgin man moves in with his playboy brother Barefoot in the Park (1963) features newly-weds adjusting to their marital home and The Odd Couple (1965) sends a husband kicked out by his wife to stay with a bachelor friend. Another of these scary pairings spawned The Sunshine Boys (1972), in which a comedy duo, not on speaking terms for 11 years, reluctantly get together for a gig.Simon frequently drew inspiration from recent events in his own life, so that Chapter Two (1977), where a man’s second wife has to help him to come to terms with the death of his first, explicitly reflected Simon’s marriages to Joan Baim (who died from cancer in 1973), and the actor Marsha Mason who, quadrupling the double-take, played her surrogate character on both stage and film.It was the farther personal past, though, that gave the writer his greatest later acclaim, through what became known as “the Eugene trilogy”, premiered over four years in the mid-1980s. Eugene Simon, played in each stage premiere by Matthew Broderick, is a lightly-disguised version of Simon, seen in adolescence in the Bronx (Brighton Beach Memoirs), second world war military service (Biloxi Blues), and then as an aspiring comedy writer (Broadway Bound). Whereas earlier characters had often been deracinated – the super-Wasp Robert Redford had starred in Barefoot in the Park – the trilogy was specifically Jewish American.Brighton Beach Memoirs heavily channeled Simon’s own unhappy childhood as one of two sons of a cloth salesman during the Great Depression of the 1930s. At a technical level, the memory-play formats allowed Simon, until then known for snappy dialogue, to exercise his monologue muscle, while the three double-Bs in the titles reflected a tidy mind. His acceptance of the brutal rules of American commercial theatre was shown by the second and third chapters only being written once their predecessor had become a proven hit. This strain of family history continued affectingly in Lost in Yonkers (1990), in which young brothers, after their mother’s death, are billeted with their dragonish grandmother. Another Broadway long-runner, it brought Simon the higher literary recognition that his work had been denied, with the award of the Pulitzer prize.In Rewrites (1996), the first of two volumes of memoir, Simon explained his theory that a play should ideally start from some triggering event that is happening for the first time. Although the narrative of Hamlet seems to rise from the backstory of the Danish prince’s father’s murder and his uncle’s hasty marriage to his mother, Shakespeare only has a play, Simon pointed out, when the father’s ghost first appears to his son. Learning from this, his apartment-share dramas begin on the first day of living together or, in The Sunshine Boys, the comedians’ nervous reconciliatory handshake. Broadway Bound kicks off with Eugene discovering an infidelity that threatens his parents’ marriage.This understanding of dramatic mechanics earned Simon much early work as a Broadway “play doctor”, tickling up struggling comedies by others, and as he revealed in the second autobiography, The Play Goes On (1999), even adding some emergency last-minute gags to the musical A Chorus Line.Respect for Simon’s script-craft was such that, in Hollywood, where screenplays are notoriously prone to pass through multiple hands, he achieved 20 solo writing credits, mainly for adaptations of the plays, receiving four Oscar nominations, between 1968 and 78, for The Odd Couple, The Sunshine Boys, The Goodbye Girl and California Suite. His key movie muse was Walter Matthau, who played both one of the odd couple and one of the sunshine boys.Simon always emphasised that his comedies had dark roots, once summarising the “common themes” of his plays as: “The abandoned child, a father with a failing heart (my father died of one), and a mother dying of cancer … Always abandonment in one form or other.”And, as is common with comic writers, he was drawn to more solemn models. For Woody Allen, it is the Swedish director Ingmar Bergman. For Simon, the great Russian playwright Anton Chekhov. This enthusiasm was not as counterintuitive as it might seem – Chekhov always classified The Seagull, The Cherry Orchard and other plays as comedies – but Simon struggled to sell his homage products to the Broadway public. His two plays set in Russia – The Good Doctor (1973) and Fools (1981) – were rare flops, the latter managing only 40 performances. Such more serious subtext reflected Simon’s long-term struggles with depression and illnesses, including a chronic renal condition resolved, in 2003, by a transplant kidney from his long-time publicist, Bill Evans.In earlier years, that extraordinary gift of friendship would have triggered a play, but Simon had retired from theatre that same year with Rose’s Dilemma, seen only in a small off-Broadway theatre in a production disrupted by the sudden departure of star Mary Tyler Moore, reportedly after a letter from Simon imploring her to learn the words.The 2009 flop of a Broadway revival of Brighton Beach Memoirs and Broadway Bound showed Simon was not immune to the sudden unfashionableness that afflicted Miller and Williams in the latter part of their careers. But The Odd Couple had yet another afterlife as a Matthew Perry CBS sitcom from 2015 to 2017, suggesting that Simon’s rare ability to depict the behaviour of relatives, friends and lovers in a pressured situation will endure."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a935e51114ed92dc5c1250685c6005944d7938d/0_730_2902_1740/master/2902.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5167bc8d45d6fac35b5f2d972014d412","title":"the league of gentlemen review stage tour","story":"Sunderland Empire Exhilarating new material joins favourite vintage sketches as Mark Gatiss, Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton bring their chilling creations to life again on tourTV tie-in live tours aren’t always artistic successes. Sometimes, they’re more about nostalgia than comedy sometimes it’s just a thousand people shouting out catchphrases. Neither applies in the case of this cracking League of Gentlemen stage outing, the group’s first for 12 years. Perhaps it’s because they clearly delineate old material, in the first half, and new, after the interval. Maybe it’s because (with Sherlock, Inside No 9, and all that) their careers beyond the League are flourishing they’re doing this not because they need to, but because they want to. Mainly it’s because what’s on show is just brilliantly written and performed.The first half couldn’t be simpler, as the performing trio – Mark Gatiss, Reece Shearsmith, Steve Pemberton – zip through a selection of their vintage sketches. There’s the Go Johnny Go Go Go card game with its impossible rules, the dating agency run by a woman who despises her clients, and Pamela Doove’s feral audition for an orange juice commercial. The feel is old-school: the performers wear tuxedos and there are blackouts between sketches. But the performances throb with life. There’s real hatred in Charlie and Stella’s bickering over Trivial Pursuit, real resentment when Olly Plimsolls rails against the theatre industry – and when Gatiss’s “Mordant Mick” leads us on a Royston Vasey terror tour, the twist generates real chills.And laughs, too, of course – playing it straight (and all three are terrific actors) heightens the comedy only if the situation is comical in the first place. And these ones – social proprieties forever flouted inner demons loosed at unlikely moments – always are.Things get more expansive in Act Two, which picks up where the team’s 2017 Christmas specials left off, with local shopkeeper Tubbs held captive in Papa Lazarou’s “wife mine”. Her plight, and that of her husbandbrother Edward, is here expressed in lush musical-theatre form, and it’s an exhilarating moment, promising to pitch the League’s canon of characters into a whole new theatrical dimension. That doesn’t quite happen – but this second act is looser, more knockabout affair, with costume changes, pyrotechnics, decapitated animals and projectile body fluids a-go-go.It’s a treatment that pares the sharper edges off the League’s twisted comedy, and can leave it looking surprisingly old-fashioned. Pemberton’s camp German teacher Herr Lipp has a section to himself, plying the crowd with shameless (if pleasingly tortuous) gay innuendo like Julian Clary in his pomp. Reece Shearsmith as Rev Bernice treads a delicate line with dismissive responses to the supposed “woke” anxieties of her audience. But the show (with recent criticism in mind, presumably, about the League’s approach to trans issues) heads off protest at the pass, when an audience member rebels and Bernice silences him in the most brutal way possible.There are only a few wobbles. Tech issues undermine a scene featuring Mr Chinnery the murderous vet. A song from ageing rocker Les McQueen is comedically low-wattage. Far more often, the show burns brightly. As Harvey chastises Benjamin for “forever regrouting the bathroom tiles with your own readymix paste”, the League showcase their flair for baroque phraseology. And well-loved characters develop their on-screen stories: Geoff Tipps delivers another best man’s speech Jobcentre bully Pauline attends her own funeral. But there’s no last rites required for the League of Gentlemen: on this evidence, they’re not just alive but kicking.

Those who could not, or would not, volunteered their time in community service instead.The scheme was abolished in 2011, but the belief that young people should dedicate a year to national service persists in many conservative circles. Now, the CDU leadership, keen to reunite the party around traditional core values, is revisiting the concept.Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer,the CDU general secretary, suggested earlier this month that all young men and women should complete a compulsory “service year”. The plan, if implemented, would also apply to all adult asylum seekers and refugees, she added. The programme would see some young people join the military or the fire service, or help with disaster relief. The CDU hopes others would choose to volunteer as care workers, thereby helping address chronic staff shortages in care homes and hospices.The proposal came after Kramp-Karrenbauer – among the favourites to succeed Merkel as the head of the party – conducted a “listening tour” of the CDU grassroots, gathering ideas for a new manifesto to be presented at the forthcoming party conference in December.“Many CDU members mentioned reintroducing the draft or general compulsory service,” Kramp-Karrenbauer told the Funke Mediengruppe news group on Saturday, adding that she still remained undecided. She also explained the suggestions she had heard often mentioned including migrants, something she thought “worth considering”.“If refugees complete such a year, which could be voluntary or mandatory, it would help to integrate them into the country and society,” Kramp-Karrenbauer said. “It would also increase the acceptance of refugees among the population.”Her comments were immediately dismissed as “populist” by the Social Democrats and the proposal has so far found no support from the Greens, the leftwing Die Linke, or the liberal Free Democratic party (FDP). Only the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) supports reintroducing military service.A look at the main priorities set out in in the German coalition agreement, which will guide policy-making for the next four years.Efforts to reform the EU will top the incoming government\u0027s agenda as the bloc grapples with rising nationalism, security concerns and an unpredictable US ally in Donald Trump.As well as agreeing to bolster EU foreign and defence policy, the parties say they are ready to raise Germany\u0027s contributions to the EU\u0027s budget once Britain leaves. They also support the creation of a European Monetary Fund, but offer only cautious backing for Emmanuel Macron\u0027s idea of a eurozone investment budget.Smarting from the backlash over Merkel\u0027s decision to open the country\u0027s doors to hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers in 2015, the government now aims to cap the annual intake of people seeking safe haven to about 200,000.At the EU level,\u0026nbspMerkel\u0026nbspsays she continues to expect member states to take in their allocated share of refugees. The chancellor has also reiterated the need to tackle the root causes of migration with development aid for the countries of origin, while better securing the bloc\u0027s outer borders.Europe\u0027s powerhouse economy is booming, with workers enjoying high wages and record-low unemployment, but that has done little to assuage concerns about globalisation and automation in the workplace, as well as growing inequality.With its flush public coffers,\u0026nbspMerkel\u0027s government aims to address these fears through investments in infrastructure, an offensive to improve the nation\u0027s creaking internet networks, pension reform and more funding for education and life-long learning.Meanwhile, Ursula von der Leyen, the German defence minister, has categorically rejected the idea that military service would return in its previous form – mostly because the army is not equipped to deal with the number of fresh recruits.The German military, the Bundeswehr, currently gets enough volunteer foot soldiers but is lacking specialised soldiers willing to invest in a long-term career with the armed forces.Still, the idea of a compulsory “service year” has a long way to go. It is possible it would require a change to Germany’s constitution, which forbids all forms of forced labour.But for the CDU, the renewed debate has had the desired effect of rallying the party around a common cause. If the idea is adopted as policy, the party hopes it will have a similar effect on the electorate.A compulsory service year would “strengthen social cohesion in Germany,” CDU’s minister-president of Saarland, Tobias Hans, told newspaper Bild am Sonntag. German youth get free school education and enjoy high social standards, he added. The nation “should be able to expect young people to give something back to their country” in return.

Some carry their earthly possessions in suitcases or backpacks, others plastic bags containing water and snacks for the long journey ahead. All share a dogged determination to escape. “Food became so expensive that for months we weren’t able to eat three meals a day,” says Harry Flores, 41, who has been queuing for nine days with his family in the hope of boarding a bus to Peru.When he does secure those seats, Flores, an unemployed computer engineer who sold his car to bankroll the trip, will join a historic exodus from what was once one of South America’s wealthiest and most stable societies. Hundreds more made it into Peru through its northwestern border on Saturday despite new rules preventing Venezuelan migrants from entering without passports, which many lack because of the upheaval in their country. “We must act humanely with this vulnerable population,” said Abel Chiroque, the local ombudsman. Last week the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, vowed to reverse the country’s slide into hyperinflation and deprivation with what he called a visionary plan for recovery, growth and economic prosperity. “This is my economic recovery programme. It’s mine! And when I say it’s mine, I mean: it’s the people’s,’” Maduro tweeted on Wednesday, a day after his country was rocked by a 7.3-magnitude earthquake that some interpreted as a political metaphor for his teetering regime. Few experts believe Maduro’s measures will produce the economic miracle he promises. “There is zero chance it will work,” said Javier Corrales, a professor of political science at Amherst College in the US and the co-author of a book on Venezuela’s political and economic decay called Dragon in the Tropics.In Venezuela, the plan has added bewilderment to the growing sense of despair.“When I went to the market today some prices had almost doubled,” complained Edelia Zambrano, a 31-year-old risk analyst from Caracas. Sandra Campos, a 32-year-old accountant, suspected she had been overcharged for her breakfast because of the befuddling new system. “The clerk charged me 50 times the price, because she confused the numbers. There’s too much confusion.” Just this year two plots to bring Maduro down have reportedly been foiled – one in May when a conspiracy involving top military officials codenamed Operation Constitution was thwarted, and another in early August when two explosive-laden drones failed to reach their target during a rally in Caracas. Many of the Venezuelans fleeing abroad are adamant a peaceful solution is no longer possible. “We’ve got to get him out: to eliminate him,” said Carlos Briceño, a 37-year-old from Maracaibo, as he queued to cross from the Colombian border town of Ipiales into Ecuador last week. Harold Antanas Trinkunas, a Venezuela specialist at Stanford University, said such scheming would inevitably persist, meaning Venezuelan and Cuban spies would need to be on constant guard against “outlandish” if amateurish attempts to kill Maduro.If, as seemed likely, Maduro’s economic plan failed to stop the rot an Arab spring-type uprising was also possible which could lead to “a very unpredictable outcome as we saw in the Middle East and North Africa”. Trinkunas added Maduro might also be purged by his inner circle and replaced with “a more competent strongman” such as longtime rival Diosdado Cabello. Corrales also saw the most likely challenge coming from within but said Venezuela’s leadership had proved surprisingly resilient. Maduro is the president of Venezuela. He served as the interim president upon the death of Hugo Chávez in March 2013, and won a hastily arranged general election in April 2013, narrowly defeating opposition candidate Henrique Capriles.Maduro was previously a bus driver and trade union leader.

There are none at his department’s Loughrea, Shannon or Killarney offices.Minster for Agriculture Michael Creed said his department has one charging point at the National Seafood Centre in Clonakilty, Co Cork.Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government Eoghan Murphy said his department also has only one e-car charging point at the Custom House in Dublin and “will keep the matter under review as the use of electric cars increases”.Staff working at the Dublin headquarters of Minster for Health Simon Harris and Minister for Children Katherine Zappone share two charging points at Miesian Plaza, Baggot Street, but there are none at any other departmental offices around the country.Sinn Féin TD John Brady, who obtained the figures, criticised the Government for “failing to lead by example” in promoting more people away from fossil fuels into electric cars.“The statistics are startling,” he said. “I was contacted by a number of staff who work in different government departments, they thought it was bizarre that they were so badly served in their particular departments.“The Department for Communications, Climate Action and Environment have a whole range of incentives to promote electric cars through the likes of the home charger grant and purchase grants, yet in their own department there is only one charging point,” he said.“Despite all the rhetoric, it speaks volumes that the government, as the largest employer in the State, has such a low level of charging points.”Mr Brady said Government Ministers should be driving electric cars and their staff given the option to do the same. “We need to get beyond the PR. No-one buys into that and the figures bear that out,” he added.Government policy published in May 2017 set a target of banning any new petrol or diesel cars or vans by 2030.In a joint statement last year, Mr Ross and Mr Naughten said they believed “an even greater level of ambition must be set” so that Ireland “becomes a leader in the take-up of electric vehicles”."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Firm earlier admitted it had agreed to underwrite the cost of submitting the lettersDespite the rain, thousands turn out to greet the pope at the Marian ShrineEstimate puts attendance at Phoenix Park Mass at 130,000, far less than expectedMost departments have no chargers despite urging others to go greenPope dismissive on flight from Ireland to Rome of claims by Archbishop Carlo Maria ViganoBefore leaving Ireland, Pope tells bishops they must address clerical abuse with honesty, courageStand For Truth rally at Garden of Remembrance began at same time as the papal MassAlison Nevin took snap when at Croke PArk as representative of Traveller communityNames of 796 infants buried in Tuam read aloud at site of former Mother and Baby homePeople may have come into contact with antibiotic resistant CPE while in hospitalItalian government had not let group leave the Diciotti unless other EU countries took themSimon Coveney says it is hard to believe a senior politician is so ill informed about IrelandMarie Collins asked pope why Church is still allowing disgraced church leaders resign instead of being firedPontiff tells single mothers separated from children that to seek them is \u0026lsquonot a mortal sin\u0026rsquoScience and religion make strange bedfellows, one big clash being the central issue of faith\u0026lsquoNone of us can fail to be moved by the stories of young people who suffered abuse\u0026rsquoDelight among crowd of over 40,000 as pope tours Knock shrine and acknowledged \u0026lsquoopen wound\u0026rsquo of abuseLarge number of roads are closed until 11pm including routes alongside Phoenix Park25-year-old mother was thrown from back window of car in Bundoran in crash that left two deadDavid Walsh (27) was the second person in a decade to drown in such circumstances at Newport Pier"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3608307.1535304362!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"an early start for the faithful who make it to knock shrine on time","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Pope Francis lights a candle as he visits the Knock shrine on Sunday.

Photograph: EPAWMOF2018Maxwell PhotographyAfter as good a summer as most of us can remember, the day dawned with misty rain and a stiff breeze which left many early arrivals to see Pope Francis in Knock stoically shivering in their flimsy ponchos. It was an early start for all concerned with the pope due to arrive at 9.45am. Few had much sleep many got none at all so as to get the best viewing spots. This event, the only one outside Dublin, was reported to have been booked out and many were disappointed, but there were empty seats in front of the main stage which were not filled by the time the pope arrived. Presumably, many of the 45,000 people expected were put off by the weather forecast which was bad, but worse than what actually transpired. Those on Calvary Hill, their views obscured, might as well have watched it at home for all they could see of the main stage, but they were rewarded for their perseverance when the popemobile snaked around the whole arena giving everybody a glimpse of a smiling pontiff. For Yvonne McGuire from Athlone, being in the presence of the pope was enough. “I found a great grace in coming to know Jesus Christ in my life and that has brought great healing.” Her sister-in-law Caroline Falls produced a photograph of herself and her husband Gary. They met Pope Francis in Rome just three days after they got married in 2016. Both were wearing their wedding outfits. “As the head of the church, there is a special grace, a special blessing when he comes and he (Pope Francis) represents Jesus,” she says. “We would have come a week before if we had to wait here a week. We have often travelled to World Youth Days to see him, but we also love Francis personally.” The crowd was exhorted to say nothing while the pope spent time in prayer in the chapel where Mary is said to have appeared in 1879 to 15 local people. A silence descended on Knock as it did the previous afternoon at the Pro-Cathedral in Dublin, where the pope prayed at the perpetually-lit candle of innocence for children who were victims of clerical sex abuse. The crowd was respectful rather than ecstatic. They clapped and cheered loudly when he spoke of the hurt of child abuse. They have had their faith tested to destruction, but they still turned up. There were many in wheelchairs who would have found Knock either difficult or impossible to navigate. They were aided by the “handmaidens” – women dressed in immaculate blue or white uniforms who have been helping out at Knock for generations. One of them, Mary Connolly, helped to distribute communion on Calvary Hill. “I would have been preferred to have been a bit closer to the stage,” she said. “It’s been a damp day. I think it has dampened people a little bit.” Twins David and Micheal Cregan left Derry at 2am to be present at Knock. Sunday was also their 67th birthday. “People say I look like I’m 47,” said David. “I call it Vitamin G – the G is for God.” He contracted polio in 1953 at the age of 18 months and has spent his life using a wheelchair. “I have experienced a lot of hardships, but I’ve also been blessed with a lovely wife and six beautiful children. I’m very happy to be here on my birthday,” he said. He felt Francis’s short address to the crowd “covered every detail about the brokenness of the church at this particular time. We have to move on for the healing of everybody. Anybody who says the faith is dead, you just have to look around you today.” Sister Mary Olivia Kelly had the shortest distance to travel. She is in the Carmelite Community, an enclosed order, in Knock. She holds up two hands to denote the number of times she has been out of the convent since she entered it 8½ years ago. “We can go out for doctors and dentists, but thank God, I am never sick and my teeth are perfect.” She made an exception for the pope’s visit. “It is so inspiring for Pope Francis to come. I have read his writings. He radiates such joy, such tenderness. He is going to the homeless, to the prisons. That is what the Gospel of Jesus is about. We embrace everyone. Everyone is a child of God.” Pope Francis to preside over the closing ceremony of World Meeting of Families in Dublin.

File photograph: Simon DawsonReuters Jacob Rees-Mogg has sparked a fresh row about the status of the Irish border after Brexit after a video emerged in which he suggests a return to checks “as we had during the Troubles”.The Conservative MP is seen on the footage from the public meeting suggesting the government could “keep an eye on” the border.“Ireland would not be a free for all. It would be perfectly possible to continue with historic arrangements to ensure that there wasn’t a great loophole in the way people can get into the UK, to leave us in as bad a position as we are already in,” Mr Rees-Mogg said.“There would be our ability, as we had during the Troubles, to have people inspected. It’s not a border that everyone has to go through every day, but of course for security reasons during the Troubles, we kept a very close eye on the border, to try and stop gun-running and things like that.”The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, was sharply critical of his comments. “This man knows nothing of Northern Ireland, ” he said.Minister for Foreign Affairs, Simon Coveney, tweeted: “It’s hard to believe that a senior politician is so ill informed about Ireland + the politics of the Irish border issue that he could make comments like these. We have left ‘the troubles’ behind us, through the sincere efforts of many + we intend on keeping it that way”.Mr Rees-Mogg has previously been criticised for saying he did not need to visit Northern Ireland to understand the challenges Brexit posed for communities on the border. His comments, earlier this year, were described as arrogant and judgmental by people living there. In an interview with BBC Northern Ireland, he said: “I don’t think my visiting the border is really going to give me a fundamental insight into the border beyond what one can get by studying it.”The status of the Irish border remains one of the toughest sticking points in the UK’s negotiations on a withdrawal agreement with the EU.Theresa May has said no UK prime minister could accept the EU’s proposal, for Northern Ireland effectively to remain in the customs union and the single market, with the rest of the UK outside - requiring a border in the Irish Sea.The EU for its part regards Britain’s solution of a “facilitated customs arrangement”as unworkable.The Cabinet Office minister, David Lidington, acknowledged on Friday that the October deadline once regarded as the end-date for the Brexit negotiations could now slip to November. Tensions among senior Conservatives in cabinet were also exposed at the weekend, as the Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, played down the significance of Treasury forecasts suggesting a no-deal Brexit would blow an Stg £80bn hole in the public finances.“I’m always wary of any forecast, because most of them have been proved to be wrong,” he told The Sunday Times.As Mrs May battles to complete a deal, Mr Rees-Mogg is leading a vocal group of Conservative MPs calling on the party to “chuck Chequers”, the negotiating position painstakingly agreed by cabinet at their July awayday.They are keen to play down the significance of avoiding a hard border in Ireland, which they believe has driven the logic of the push toward a softer Brexit.Boris Johnson told MPs in his resignation speech, after he rejected the Chequers deal: “We allowed the question of the Northern Irish border, which had hitherto been assumed on all sides to be readily soluble, to become so politically charged as to dominate the debate.”"},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

Australia has endured a turbulent period in politics that has seen six changes in the top job in 11 years.This new Liberal-National team is a next-generation team, Mr Morrison told reporters in Canberra of the governing coalition between the Liberals and the rural-based Nationals party.What we have done today in pulling this team together is provide for stability... it does begin the process of healing.But there was no room for ex-PM Tony Abbott - a vocal critic of Mr Turnbull after Mr Turnbull ousted him as leader in 2015.Mr Morrison said he was open to Mr Abbott, who had supported Mr Dutton, being involved in government decisions in an advisory capacity.Marise Payne, the former defence minister, was given the foreign affairs portfolio.Ms Bishop became foreign minister in 2013. Renowned for her steely gaze dubbed the death stare, Ms Bishop\u0027s highlights as foreign minister include her strong condemnation of Russia\u0027s role in the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines MH17 in 2014.Victoria Atkins interview: ‘We are in a much better place than we were\u0026#39 – what the Tories are doing to move Britain forwardJacksonville mass shooting: \u0026#39Gamer\u0026#39 kills two and injures 11 after opening fire at Madden NFL video game tournament in FloridaLack of toilets and water at school puts girls\u0026#39 education at risk Women\u0026#39s minister \u0026#39cautious\u0026#39 over the number of teenagers undergoing gender reassignment treatment Bodyguard, episode 1: a flawed hero, a controversy-baiting home secretary and a spectacular opening sequenceBattle of Bosworth Field: historians fight to stop construction of test-track where Richard III died Nicola Sturgeon urged to reveal details of meetings with Alex SalmondFake or Fortune? episode 3, review: a story that ended in fist-clenching delightInside the controversy-ridden Youtube boxing match watched by millions  of young fansComment: Jamie Oliver has nothing on Leonard Bernstein Iran\u0026#39s parliament impeaches economy minister in latest blow to embattled President Hassan RouhaniPossible Merkel successor criticised for saying aslyum seekers should serve a year of community service Former presidents lead tributes to John McCainChinese ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing suspends carpooling after driver rapes and kills woman Paul Gascoigne arrested on suspicion of sexually assaulting a woman on a train\u0026#39Holy Grail\u0026#39 diet pill could help millions lose weight in middle ageSyrian refugees fear they are being lured back to arrest and conflict despite regime charm offensiveBreakfast cereal boxes criticised for depicting portions that are too bigOne in three bobbies on the beat have been axed since 2015 despite a surge in violent crimeShock and awe: we\u0026#39ve been on front line for years, say women, as Royal Marines open up commando course to allWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/08/24/TELEMMGLPICT000172394332_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"former presidents lead tributes john mccain","story":"John McCain served six terms as senator and made two failed bids for the presidencyFormer US presidents from across the political ide led tributes to Senator John McCain after his death on Saturday at the age of 81.The Republican Senator passed away with wife Cindy and family by his side at his home in Hidden Valley, Arizona on Saturday afternoon, a day after it was announced he would not seek further treatment for glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer.Hours after the death of her husband, Mrs McCain wrote: My heart is broken. I am so lucky to have lived the adventure of loving this incredible man for 38 years. He passed the way he lived, on his own terms, surrounded by the people he loved, in the the place he loved best.Although a lifelong Republican, Mr McCain was held in high esteem by political rivals from both sides of the aisle, a rare feat in the increasingly bipartisan world of Washington.Yet the former naval aviator will also be remembered for being a thorn in the side of President Donald Trump, who horrified many when he stated Mr McCain was not a war hero, despite being captured, tortured and held for five years in a Vietnam prisoner of war camp.McCain was one of Mr Trump\u0027s most vociferous critics throughout his campaign and presidency. Barack Obama and George W Bush are expected to give eulogies at a full dress funeral at Washington National Cathedral, but his family have said they do not want Mr Trump to attend. Vice president Mike Pence is expected to be present.  All five living former presidents -- Mr Obama, Mr Bush, Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush and Jimmy Carter -- paid tribute to McCain\u0027s courage and character.President George W. Bush called John McCain \u0026#34a man of deep conviction and a patriot of the highest order\u0026#34John McCain and I were members of different generations, Mr Obama said. But we shared, for all our differences, a fidelity to something higher - the ideals for which generations of Americans and immigrants alike have fought, marched and sacrificed. We saw our political battles, even, as a privilege.Few of us have been tested the way John once was or required to show the kind of courage that he did. But all of us can aspire to the courage to put the greater good above our own.Mr Bush wrote: Some lives are so vivid, it is difficult to imagine them ended. Some voices are so vibrant, it is hard to think of them stilled. John McCain was a man of deep conviction and a patriot of the highest order.Tributes also came from political leaders around the world, including Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron.Prime Minister Theresa May said: John McCain was a great statesman, who embodied the idea of service over self. It was an honour to call him a friend of the UK. My deepest sympathies go to his family, and the American people.Members of the Honor Guard stand guard in front of A.L. Moore-Grimshaw Mortuaries Bethany Church where memorials for late U.S. Senator John McCain have been set up in Phoenix, ArizonaThe six-term senator will become one of only a handful of people to lie in state at the Capitol Rotunda, a gesture reserved for the country’s most eminent citizens.After the funeral his body will be buried at the US Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland from where he graduated in 1958.The White House lowered the American flag to half mast on Saturday and Mr Trump was one of the first to send his sympathies to his family.My deepest sympathies and respect go out to the family of Senator John McCain. Our hearts and prayers are with you! he tweeted.Mr McCain made two failed runs at the presidency during his political career, most recently in 2008 when he won the Republican nomination teaming up with Sarah Palin but eventually losing out to Mr Obama.During a town hall meeting, he memorably challenged an audience member who referred to his opponent as an \u0027Arab\u0027, implying he was untrustworthy and not an American. “No ma’am,” the father of seven told her. “He’s a decent family man, a citizen that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues, and that’s what this campaign is all about.”John McCain | Death of a US political greatThe governor of Arizona said he does not plan to announce whom he will appoint to replace McCain in the US Senate until after his burial.State law requires the governor to name an appointee of the same political party who will serve until the next general election in 2020.McCain\u0027s wife, Cindy, has been touted as a possible replacement. McCain\u0027s death brings to 50 the number of Republican-held seats in the 100-member US Senate, with Democrats controlling 49.Victoria Atkins interview: ‘We are in a much better place than we were\u0026#39 – what the Tories are doing to move Britain forwardJacksonville mass shooting: \u0026#39Gamer\u0026#39 kills two and injures 11 after opening fire at Madden NFL video game tournament in FloridaLack of toilets and water at school puts girls\u0026#39 education at risk Women\u0026#39s minister \u0026#39cautious\u0026#39 over the number of teenagers undergoing gender reassignment treatment Bodyguard, episode 1: a flawed hero, a controversy-baiting home secretary and a spectacular opening sequenceBattle of Bosworth Field: historians fight to stop construction of test-track where Richard III died Nicola Sturgeon urged to reveal details of meetings with Alex SalmondFake or Fortune? episode 3, review: a story that ended in fist-clenching delightInside the controversy-ridden Youtube boxing match watched by millions  of young fansComment: Jamie Oliver has nothing on Leonard Bernstein Iran\u0026#39s parliament impeaches economy minister in latest blow to embattled President Hassan RouhaniPossible Merkel successor criticised for saying aslyum seekers should serve a year of community service Australian foreign minister resigns as new prime minister announces \u0026#39peace-making cabinet\u0026#39Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing suspends carpooling after driver rapes and kills woman Paul Gascoigne arrested on suspicion of sexually assaulting a woman on a train\u0026#39Holy Grail\u0026#39 diet pill could help millions lose weight in middle ageSyrian refugees fear they are being lured back to arrest and conflict despite regime charm offensiveBreakfast cereal boxes criticised for depicting portions that are too bigOne in three bobbies on the beat have been axed since 2015 despite a surge in violent crimeShock and awe: we\u0026#39ve been on front line for years, say women, as Royal Marines open up commando course to allWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/films/2018/02/09/TELEMMGLPICT000022507955_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqZjHC1CawyhCYfmdoGgKrwKuDNcRwDcUUAWFSJ29Xwak.jpeg?imwidth=45","title":"jamie oliver has nothing leonard bernstein","story":"Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim, two Jewish New Yorkers, wrote West Side Story, which is about Italians and Puerto RicansIf you’re going to steal,” Leonard Bernstein told a person who said that West Side Story was full of Stravinsky, “steal classy.” People have borrowed, lifted and stolen since Moses was found in a basket: Shakespeare from Plutarch, Rembrandt from Titian, Yeats from Shelley, and everybody from Bach.

It was a fairly low-key event, with a portable stage not much bigger than the park’s bandstand. The lineup was comprised of mainly tribute acts.Fast forward to 2018, and Bingley Music Live, as the event evolved into, is preparing for its biggest three-day festival yet, on the weekend of Friday 31 August. This time the roster is a little more impressive: Noel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds, Jake Bugg, Public Image Ltd, Shed Seven, former Spice Girl Melanie C… and all on a stage that wouldn’t be out of place at one of the summer’s big-name festivals.But, so what? Festivals are big business in the UK, and the summer calendar is stuffed with internationally-renowned acts zipping between fields across the country. Just down the road from Bradford, the Leeds Festival is twinned with its more venerable cousin Reading, and together they form the apex of the festival pyramid with old-stager Glastonbury (when it’s not having a fallow year, like this summer).But also on the calendar is Latitude, the Isle of Wight Festival, RiZE (formerly the V Festival), Wireless, Creamfields, BBC Music’s Big Weekend, Bestival… it seems that no matter where you are in the country, sling a 12in picture disc like a frisbee any time over the summer and you’re almost certain to hit a music superstar on the head.But what makes Bingley Music Live a slightly different beast is that just like the inaugural Music at Myrtle\u0026nbspevent in 1991, it is still run by the local authority. No longer free, of course, because you don’t get Noel Gallagher out of bed on the sort of money you can make up by adding a few quid on the council tax bills. But value for money certainly, compared to the big commercial festivals, and certainly pulling its weight in the ring with many of them.A spokesperson for Bradford Council said\u0026nbspthat when Music at Myrtle was set up in 1991, nobody really expected that it would become the major player it is now. She says:\u0026nbsp“When we held our first small free concert few could have envisaged that the festival would grow to attract such big names as Pet Shop Boys, Kaiser Chiefs, Manic Street Preachers, Chic and Nile Rogers, All Saints, Jess Glynne\u0026nbspand James who have all played over recent years.”The key, though, is that Bingley Music Live has grown organically. Bradford Council never set out to make a full-blown festival, it expanded a little bit year by year. She adds:\u0026nbsp“Although it has come a long way from its humble beginnings and it is unusual for a council to be involved in such a big festival we have grown it gradually and now it sees 15,000 people a day flock to the town for festival weekend.”\u0026nbspIn its early years, Music at Myrtle was split into themed days, with old rockers such as Bradford’s own Smokie on the bill, newer bands for the younger audience, and jazz. In 1998 Bradford Council partnered with local radio station Pulse to make the event a two-day festival, with Pulse using their clout and contacts book to bring in bigger names such as Liberty X, McFly, Rachel Stevens and another Bradford boy-done-good, Gareth Gates.That continued into the 2000s, until what was then billed as the Party in the Park hit its first major bump in the road. In February 2007, the event was summarily cancelled. Rising costs and declining audiences were blamed, and the Pulse’s station director, Tony Wilkinson, told the local paper,\u0026nbsp and\u0026nbspArgus, that support from the music industry for such small festivals was on the wane. He said that the record labels did not have “as many artists out on promotional tours to provide a top class running order”.Despite its small size, the festival has attracted larger, mainstream acts such as Maximo ParkWhat nobody envisaged in 2007, though, was that the music industry was in the throes of a massive shakeup. Downloading and streaming of music was in its infancy then, and music acts still made the majority of their money from physical album and single sales. However, a decade on, that situation is reversed nowadays it’s the touring of live shows and pounding the festival beat that earns pop and rock bands a crust.It would be nice to think that Bradford Council was playing something of a blinder back in 2007, but the chances are that it was pure serendipity. Either way, within a couple of months of the announcement that the Myrtle Park festival was dead, it rose from the ashes.The original plan was to scale back on the A-listers and give more of a platform to unknown, local bands. The rescue package had been put together wholly by Bradford Council, and they were obviously mindful of the budgetary restrictions of putting on a big festival but still wanting to provide residents with a music event of some description.Indeed, it was the residents of Bingley in particular who lobbied the council to save the festival in some form. This was at a time when the financial crisis was just bubbling over, and it’s fair to say that Bradford had been hit harder than most cities. Neighbouring Leeds had stolen a march on city centre development and by the mid-2000s had a thriving retail and leisure sector that put it in a stronger position to weather the credit crunch.aren’t too far removed from its neighbouring Leeds\u0026nbspBefore the financial collapse, Bradford had been on the up as well. Large swathes of the city centre had been demolished to make way for a brand new shopping centre built by Westfield. The majority of the work on taking down the tired, old buildings began in 2004, but by 2007 everything had stalled, leaving Bradford with an infamous hole in the ground that made it look as though it was ground zero of a meteor strike. It wasn’t until 2015 that the centre was completed and opened… and, to be fair, did help to kickstart a much-needed revitalisation of Bradford.So it was understandable in that atmosphere in 2007 that people wanted some form of entertainment, and Bingley Music Live was it. That year’s festival was indeed\u0026nbsppared down, but still attracted some recognisable names – Bruce Foxton’s post-Paul Weller “From The Jam” outfit, the Charlatans, the Bluetones. The following year brought the Happy Mondays, Echo and the Bunnymen, and local heroes Terrorvision.\u0026nbspBy the time the first headliners the Charlatans returned in 2012, the festival had added a third day on the Friday, and the festival was really on an upward curve.But can a local authority really justify the cost? There are partners of course, including Ticketline, Mercure Hotels and Carlsberg. But surely it doesn’t make any money?According to a Bradford Council reply to a freedom of information request last month asking for income and expenditure on Bingley Music Live over the past three years, in 2015 there was income of £946,000 against just over £1m in costs. In 2016 income was down at £822,000 against very similar costs, but last year, with costs standing at £1.15m, there was gross income of £1.3m… leaving a net surplus of £222,000.Having attended the event last year, those figure’s aren’t surprising. It was packed and money was flowing over the bars and food concessions. It’s also a very family-oriented event. And with ticket sales ensuring 15,000 come through the gates every day this year –\u0026nbspwhich the coup of booking Noel Gallagher has certainly helped with –\u0026nbspit looks likely that Bingley Music Live is on an upward trend.Being in the middle of one of the Bradford district’s big towns as well, rather than in splendid isolation on a field somewhere in Hampshire, there are extra benefits. My council spokesperson says: “The event is a big thing for Bingley’s businesses, with its many excellent pubs, bars, shops and places to eat all busy with people for the full weekend. The festival is also embraced by the local Bradford and Bingley Sports Club who provide camping for festivalgoers on their fields.”Ariana Grande and James Corden perform hit-filled version of TitanicWhy drag queen Vicky Vox is starring in Little Shop of HorrorsCamp Bestival forced to close early due to poor weather conditionsWhile Bingley Music Live might be unusual in being local authority-run, its model of being an “urban festival” is one that is becoming increasingly popular… and can pay idends for local economies.Journalist Claude Lynch, writing in CityMetric earlier this year, said that while the big, camp-out-all-weekend festivals were declining, smaller, urban festivals were thriving… and possibly because of a sense of community. He wrote: “Multiple studies into the dynamics and economics of festivals make similar arguments about how to drive ‘re-patronising’ – in other words, how to make festivalgoers want to come back next year. Evidence suggests that ‘social identification’ – having something in common with other festivalgoers – is often just as important as the quality of the music or the food. Festivals can capitalise on this boon of social identification by offering a self-contained event designed\u0026nbspwith both locals and tourists in mind. Locals are more likely to patronise events that emphasise community spirit while tourists are enthused by events that symbolise and epitomise the local culture.”From very humble beginnings 27 years ago, Bingley Music Live has survived and thrived, often against the odds, and when international superstar Noel Gallagher takes the stage in a couple of weeks’ time, it will be the culmination of the dogged determination that gets things done in this part of the world… and looks like providing the template for the future of live music.For more information go to bingleymusicliveMusic at MyrtleEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Despite its small size, the festival has attracted larger, mainstream acts such as Maximo Park"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/10/16/south-africa-school.jpg","title":"south africa corruption president ramaphosa mabuza zuma anc","story":"Created with Sketch.The ruling African National Congress pledges education and opportunity\u0026nbspfor black people\u0026nbsp– but embezzlement in the\u0026nbspdeputy president’s province has left schools so decrepit that children plunge to their death in toiletsClick to followThe IndependentSchool at Orange Farm, near Soweto: one of the ANC’s policies is to improve education for black South African childrenZiyanda\u0026nbspNkosi hated going to the bathroom at school. The pit toilets were so dark, dirty and crumbling. Many children were so afraid of them that they simply relieved themselves in the schoolyard to avoid the ordeal.But as she played with her best friend during recess, the little girl, a six-year-old first-grader, really had to go. She stepped warily inside the closet-like latrine.Even with the gentle pressure of her tiny frame, the floor caved in. Ziyanda flailed wildly, clinging to the edges of the hole, frantically trying to keep herself from falling in and drowning in the fetid pool below.“Mommy! Mommy!” she screamed, managing to hold on long enough for an older boy to run in and save her.Hundreds of parents, enraged that their warnings about the dilapidated school had been ignored for years, burst into protest a couple of days later, upending their quiet rural town for two weeks last August. They burned tires, blocked roads and demanded justice from the provincial government led by David Mabuza, a former maths teacher who had become one of the most powerful figures in the African National Congress (ANC) and was positioning himself to become South Africa’s deputy president.One of the party’s historic promises had been to provide a good education for black people, who had been deliberately denied the opportunity under apartheid. ANC leaders like Nelson Mandela often spoke about freeing black South Africans through school\u0026nbspand Mabuza, whose first big post in the province was education minister, got his political start by promising just that.But under the ANC the education system has been a\u0026nbspshambles, so gutted by corruption that even party officials are dismayed at how little students are learning, in schools so decrepit that children have plunged to their deaths in pit toilets.The rage in Ziyanda’s town grew so intense that protesters hurled stones at a local ANC leader, who narrowly escaped by whipping out his handgun and shooting randomly into the crowd, wounding two children and roiling the community all the more.Mabuza never came to the school or met with the parents –\u0026nbspand for good reason, local officials contend. The dangerous conditions were a clear reflection of his control over the province, where millions of dollars for education have disappeared into a vortex of suspicious spending, shoddy public construction and brazen corruption to fuel his political ambitions, according to government records and officials in his party.But the uprising and allegations against Mabuza did not crimp his political rise. To the contrary, only a few months later, as the ANC tried to quash national outrage over misrule by its leaders, Mabuza scored his biggest triumph by far. He was picked to become second-in-command of the entire ANC, launching him into an even more prominent post\u0026nbspas South Africa’s deputy president, second only to the nation’s leader.Mabuza may seem an odd choice, especially at a time when the ANC is desperate to purge its reputation for graft and restore its image as the rightful heir to Mandela’s legacy. After all, Mabuza’s rural province, Mpumalanga, is fairly small, has little economic clout and is widely regarded as one of the country’s most corrupt.But that is the vexing secret behind Mabuza’s spectacular climb, current and former ANC officials say: he siphoned off money from schools and other public services to buy loyalty and amass enormous power, making him impossible to ignore on the national stage and putting him in position to shape South Africa for years to come.Mabuza (second right) (AFPGetty)“He didn’t become what he is now because of his political capability,” says\u0026nbspFish Mahlalela, a senior ANC figure in the province and a national lawmaker.“No, no, it was out of money and\u0026nbspmanipulation,” he adds. “Nothing else.”Perhaps more than any other member of South Africa’s new government, Mabuza undercuts the promise of a “new dawn” in the country after the removal of President Jacob Zuma this year.Besieged by scandals that have hacked away at the ANC’s legitimacy and electoral prospects, the party installed a new president, Cyril Ramaphosa, in February. From the start, he pledged to root out corruption and finally deliver on the promise of a just South Africa for all of its citizens.But to seal his new post, Ramaphosa first had to secure the backing of Mabuza, 57, who built such a formidable political machine that he became kingmaker in the back-room negotiations to choose South Africa’s new president. After campaigning for a rival, Mabuza abruptly switched sides and joined forces with Ramaphosa, helping the two emerge from a pivotal party conference last December as the country’s undisputed leaders.Then, to the surprise of many in his province, Mabuza gave a speech just weeks after being sworn in as deputy president this year, lamenting the poor state of the schools and the “tragedies that take away the innocence of our children”. He spoke movingly of a kindergartner electrocuted at school. Of a toddler who drowned after falling into a broken pit latrine. And of a five-year-old boy whose body was discovered by his mother at the bottom of another dilapidated pit, his hand sticking out of a pool of faeces.Such deplorable conditions were all too common, he noted, symbolising the failure to provide black South Africans with a decent chance at life.“Where is our care?” Mabuza said in the speech. “What has gone wrong with our nation?”Yet under Mabuza’s leadership, millions of dollars for schools in his province have been misspent year after year, according to the national government. His province routinely spent less on poor students than required\u0026nbspand school construction projects have been riddled with inflated costs, government records show.Nearly a quarter of the primary schools in Mabuza’s province still have only dilapidated pit toilets, despite ample government funds to fix them. And during his tenure, his province was caught fabricating the passing rates on the annual national exam, enabling him to claim big leaps forward that never happened.The schools Mabuza did champion provided an easy way to funnel large amounts of money into politics, according to ANC officials, high-ranking defectors and anti-corruption groups. He pushed to build big boarding schools whose costs tripled\u0026nbspfor unexplained reasons\u0026nbspto $30m (£23m) each, alarming education experts. Some construction was so shoddy that roofs sprouted leaks soon after being finished, toilets barely worked, students lacked water, retaining walls collapsed and dormitories were missing doors, according to a provincial report.Over the years, Mabuza’s province also became known as one of South Africa’s most dangerous. Nearly 20 politicians, most from inside the ANC, were assassinated in the past two decades, some after exposing graft in public works projects.All the while\u0026nbspMabuza’s political career flourished. He attracted legions of new ANC members with government contracts, cash handouts and even KFC meals, according to current and former party officials.His sweeping recruitment drive turned his relatively insignificant province into the ANC’s second biggest voting bloc. Under the party’s delegate system, his territory became more influential than even Gauteng, the province that includes Johannesburg and Pretoria\u0026nbspwith a population three times the size and an economy nearly five times as big.Now, critics contend, Mabuza’s role as the country’s second most powerful politician casts doubt on the legitimacy of the new government and its assertions that the ANC is turning the page on corruption.Under the ANC, Mandela’s once-heralded liberation movement, tens of billions of dollars meant to lift poor black South Africans have been stolen by party leaders. Strong institutions like the tax agency have been hollowed out by party officials bent on shielding their illicit activities.But the nation’s poor schools are perhaps the ANC’s greatest betrayal of the dreams of black South Africans – some of whom have turned to burning down such institutions in protest.Mabuza, who declined to be interviewed, built his political career on the schools. Unlike other, more celebrated anti-apartheid leaders, he did not go into exile he was not imprisoned on the infamous Robben Island. Instead, he fought for the right of black South Africans to receive an equal education, a call he echoed in his recent speech.As many South Africans pin their hopes on Ramaphosa’s pledge for a fresh start, analysts say that much of the country is looking past an unpleasant truth: the new president owes his victory in part to corruption, and much of his administration’s future – as well as the country’s – rests in the hands of Mabuza.“If there is any powerful person whom Ramaphosa’s presidency actually relies on, it is Mabuza,” says\u0026nbspRalph Mathekga, the author of Ramaphosa’s Turn: Can Cyril Save South Africa?“We are being reluctant as a nation to face the reality of Mabuza,” he adds. “If Ramaphosa gets hit by a bus, Mabuza is going to be the president.”Scandal from the startThe numbers just didn’t add up, even at the beginning.After apartheid ended in 1994, Mabuza got his first big break: he became Mpumalanga’s education minister, a chance to shape the schools and generations of students attending them.He had the perfect resume. The son of farmers, Mabuza grew up here in the province, walking miles from his village to the only primary school in a nearby town. Though he often had no shoes, he always tucked in his shirt and buttoned it up to the neck, recalls\u0026nbspReginah Mhaule, a childhood peer.“He was never late,” says\u0026nbspMhaule, a longtime ally who recently became one of South Africa’s two deputy foreign ministers.A bright student, Mabuza ultimately took one of the few jobs available to black South Africans back then. He taught maths at the local high school and later became a founding leader of a teachers’ association.Poor schooling was a major spark in the anti-apartheid movement, most notably in Soweto in 1976, when thousands of students protested the introduction of Afrikaans as the language of instruction. In Mabuza’s province, teachers and students began organising against white minority rule in the early 1980s.The teachers were at the centre\u0026nbspof the movement, says\u0026nbspSandile Sukati, a teacher who recruited Mabuza into the main student organisation. Mabuza quickly stood out, he says, travelling far and wide to build ties among anti-apartheid groups.Museum of London  Henry GrantMuseum of London  Henry GrantA United Nations photograph by Kay MuldoonCourtesy of the News LineCourtesy of the International Defence and Aid Fund for Southern AfricaSATIS (Southern Africa - the Imprisoned Society)Museum of London  Henry GrantMuseum of London  Henry GrantA United Nations photograph by Kay MuldoonCourtesy of the News LineCourtesy of the International Defence and Aid Fund for Southern AfricaSATIS (Southern Africa - the Imprisoned Society)“He was a leader in his own right,” Sukati says.But after apartheid ended, Mabuza quickly ran into trouble, leading to the province’s first big scandal of the democratic era.\u0026nbspIn 1997, three years into his tenure as education minister, the schools were performing poorly, especially on the national obsession: the annual matriculation exams that determine whether students graduate from high school. The passing rate in his province was 46 per cent that year, slightly below the national average.Mabuza was feeling the pressure, particularly as powerful ANC leaders returned from exile, often with military credentials that overshadowed his own, several current and former ANC officials say.Sukati, who worked under Mabuza at the education department, recalls Mabuza\u0026nbsptelling some of the teachers: “I am in a tight situation.”\u0026nbspThe next year brought a stunning improvement. The passing rate inexplicably jumped to 72 per cent – an incredible turnaround that catapulted Mpumalanga to second place\u0026nbspamong the nation’s nine provinces.“I was suspicious,” says\u0026nbspSukati, who is now a senior education official. “It couldn’t just happen like that.”A whistleblower exposed the cheating a few weeks later. The real passing rate, authorities announced, was under 53 per cent. Moreover, the doctoring had taken place inside Mabuza’s residence, where he met with a small circle of bureaucrats, some of whom were later fired.An investigation was never completed. Mabuza never admitted wrongdoing or suffered any significant consequences. Dropped as education minister, he was named head of housing instead.Ever since, Mabuza’s career has been remembered for that scandal, one that helped establish the kind of culture of impunity in his province that has tarnished the ANC across South Africa..“I think\u0026nbspthe man, he had to be charged, but unfortunately I don’t know what went wrong,” says\u0026nbspRonnie Malomane, an ANC official who was taught maths by Mabuza in the early 1980s. “They were just giving him position after position.”Nationally, Mabuza’s standing kept rising, propelled by his success at attracting new party members. In 2009, Zuma appointed him premier of all of Mpumalanga province.But Mabuza raised more red flags, stripping some of the decision-making power over government projects from local officials and concentrating it in his own office. He justified the move – called the “Rapid Implementation Unit” – as a way to act quickly. Others had a different explanation.“That’s how he managed to loot,” says\u0026nbspCollen Sedibe, a former ANC leader who grew up on the same street as Mabuza and worked under him in the provincial housing department.Treasury officials in the province say they are now investigating the irregular expenditures “incurred through the contracts arranged centrally by the Office of the Premier”.But parents, officials and educators had warned about the damage from corruption and neglect for years, pointing to the painfully overcrowded classrooms and decaying, apartheid-era schools.‘They wanted to kill me’It took four days of rage before the local ANC councillor showed up.The councillor, Justice Twelve Siboza, explained that he had been busy the week Ziyanda fell into the toilet, tending to another corner of his ward. Other activities had also drawn his attention: he is a gospel singer with his own radio show, so he crisscrosses the region to perform at weddings and funerals.By the time he got to Ziyanda’s school, hundreds of parents had closed off the unpaved roads, furious that their grievances had been met with near silence from the ANC’s leaders.Siboza made sure to bring a gun. Politics is dangerous in South Africa, sometimes lethal, he says.The ANC has a grip on the area around the school because most residents, aside from the lucky few working at the sugar cane plant, are poor and rely on the party for government jobs, contracts or monthly welfare grants.It is an area Mabuza knows well. He began his ascent inside the ANC as the head of this part of the province. It was once part of a homeland set aside for black people by the apartheid government. To this day, several ANC officials say, Mabuza has kept a hold on it through powerful proxies.Some see a deep cynicism behind the conditions in the schools. When black South Africans become educated and move into the middle class, their loyalty to the party tends to wane, recent elections have shown. So by perpetuating a culture of dependence, critics contend, the ANC ensures its dominance.But Mhaule, the childhood peer of Mabuza, rejects\u0026nbspany suggestion that the ANC had failed to prioritise education.Officials like Mhaule say the rising pass rate on the national high school exam provides clear evidence of progress. But the figures can be misleading. The number of students taking the exam has declined in the past two years. Weaker students who would drag down the rate are being held back, education experts say.About 600 protesters gathered at the school that cold Friday morning when Siboza, the local ANC councillor, arrived with a police escort. As he moved to talk to the parents, demonstrators showered him with rocks.“They wanted to kill me,” the councillor says.Siboza made a run for it, reaching for the hip holster under his brown overcoat. He took out his gun – firing three times and hitting two teenagers, a girl and a boy.Agreement Mashele, the school board chairman, was shocked. “This man is a church member,” he says.A few days later, the ANC councillor visited the children he had wounded.“The councillor said he was very sorry,” says\u0026nbspthe girl, Siphesihle Ngobeni, whose left leg was grazed by a bullet. The councillor pleaded with her not to press charges and gave her about $15, she says. She used the money to buy sanitary pads.The boy’s injury was more severe. His father, Petros Thobela, who had gone to the same primary school and did not have a job, accepted a similar apology and compensation of, according to the councillor, about $150.The boy’s mother, Nobuhle Ndlovu, who does odd jobs, deplores\u0026nbspthe state of education.“They promise,” she says, “and they just disappear.”Still, she would remain loyal to the governing party.“Yes, of course, I vote ANC,” she says. “It’s our freedom.”‘He always had money in his house’The protests spilled into September, but the country’s attention was fixed on another battle: the national push to replace Zuma as South Africa’s president.The all-important ANC party election was only a few months away, and officials in Mabuza’s province were bracing to see whether his years of hard work had paid off.In early October, the ANC released the delegate breakdown, with good news for Mabuza: his previously low-ranking province was now the ANC’s second most powerful.Mabuza owed his outsize influence to a single feat. In the past decade, ANC membership in his province had skyrocketed nearly 190 per cent, eclipsing the national increase of less than 60 per cent. No other province came close to matching Mpumalanga’s explosive growth.But Mabuza’s numbers were as cooked as his high school passing rates, current and former ANC officials contend.In South Africa, taxes are collected by the national government, which distributes the money to provinces. The provinces then use the money – with little oversight from above.Treasury officials in Mpumalanga say that “irregular expenditures” more than doubled in the previous two budget years, particularly in education, housing and health.Wages account for most of the education and health budgets. So money is usually siphoned off by politicians and business allies through contracts for services or construction, ANC officials say. When costs are suspiciously high, schools are poorly built or facilities are badly maintained, they say, it is often a warning that money is being skimmed, at the students’ expense.Thousands in Israel protest draft law that would ‘exclude’ ArabsGrenfell victims were subject to ‘social apartheid’, says Diane AbbottSouth Africa is the most unequal country in the world, says World BankMandela’s letters chart his heartbreaking struggle from behind barsAs premier, Mabuza promoted the construction of big boarding schools, or mega-schools, in farm areas to improve rural education. Since 2012, the province has completed five, with two more in the pipeline.For reasons that have not been explained, the price of each school has ballooned from $11m to around $30m.Asked whether Mabuza wanted the mega-schools to facilitate the theft of public funds, Mhaule, his former education minister, laughs\u0026nbspand says:\u0026nbsp“I don’t know.”But other officials say the mega-schools were overpriced projects to reward Mabuza’s allies and finance his ANC membership drive.Mabuza\u0026nbspwas sworn in as deputy president in February. “His passion,” reads his official biography, “still remains in education.”Minutes after the swearing-in, he faced questions about corruption and political killings in his province. “There’s nothing to set straight,” he told the national public broadcaster.“I’m here to serve South Africans,” he added. “Let’s give this government a chance.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click

participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchThe highly prestigious ERC and MSCA make up the biggest chunk of funding from the EU, and losing them would be a major hit to the UK’s scientific community.Professor Lisa Bortolotti, of the University of Birmingham, and whose mental health research s psychology, psychiatry and philosophy, said\u0026nbspthat without the\u0026nbspprogrammes, “projects like mine could not be pursued in the UK”.“Losing ERC funding is mad,” she added.Olivier Stephan, who coordinates grants at the Francis Crick Institute, said the ERC drives some of the country’s most important science, citing its work fighting cancer.While, he said, the institute was\u0026nbspworking on the basis ongoing grants are safe, there are fears for the future of British scientists and the country’s ability to attract foreign talent.On top of a hit to UK science, the SME Instrument programme provides £143 million to small, innovative UK businesses, funding around 17 per cent of their research and development.The government has said it will step in to replace any lost funding if necessary, but the effects of third country status go deeper than monetary value, according to some experts. \u0026nbsp“Throughout my career I have had many, many grants, but none as transformational as the ERC grants,” said Professor Carlos Frenk, a cosmologist at Durham University. “Access to these grants to a very large extent determines where the very best researchers in the world want to go.”“In short, it’s a mess,” said Dr Mike Galsworthy, programme director at Scientists for EU.Besides the “chilling effect” the possibility of a no-deal Brexit is having on grant applications and hiring in the sector, he noted people who received EU grants were having to register with the government “just in case”.“So it’s devastation if it does happen, and just lesser damage, red tape and waste if it doesn’t,” he said.According to Scientists for EU, third country status would also mean UK researchers in European projects could no longer take leading roles, as the EU will not be willing to put them in charge of the money.\u0026nbspThat\u0026nbspis why Dame Anne Glover, president of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, says it is essential the government arrives at some kind of deal.“If that doesn’t happen, there is a danger of us being a sort of lame duck, just looking at what the opportunities are and trying to become partners in research consortia without driving anything,” she said.The Tories’ plan for a no-deal Brexit is not looking so sunny any more‘Not realistic’ for UK to trade on WTO rules straight after BrexitDespite assurances, Dame Anne said she felt “we are really no further forward” with understanding the status of science after Brexit.“In March next year if there is no deal, the EU is not going to scrabble around to help researchers in the UK,” she said.“There may be an accommodation reached for a period of time, but there will be a hiatus, and research does not work well with a hiatus.”Professor Frenk added, unlike some of the predicted effects of a no-deal Brexit, the loss of scientific funds would not change the country overnight.“The effects won’t be seen tomorrow, they won’t be seen next year – they will be seen gradually over the years as we see a general decline in the scientific excellence of the UK,” he said.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as

have queued up to see Pope Francis visit the Knock Shrine where villagers claim to have seen an apparition of the Virgin Mary and the Lamb of God nearly 140 years ago.The pontiff was due to spend an hour at the holy site in County Mayo on Sunday morning on the second day of his historic trip to the Republic of Ireland.Around 45,000 people were expected to attend the ticketed event.The significance of the site goes back to the evening of 21 August 1879, when Knock was a small, rural village.At around 8.30pm, 15 people saw a light coming from the parish church so they made their way over to the gable wall to see what it was, said Maria Casey, marketing and communications manager at Knock Shrine.Pope feels \u0027pain and shame\u0027 at failure of church to tackle sex

Evangelist and a lamb.They said the apparition lasted for two hours.News of the apparition spread quickly and a commission of enquiry was set up to hear testimony from the 15 witnesses.People began to descend on the area as newspaper reports spread across Ireland, England and America, and the shrine became known for miraculous cures.Soon after the vision it was claimed that Delia Gordon, a 12 year-old deaf girl who suffered severe pain, recovered her hearing after a piece of cement from the gable wall was placed on her ear.\u0026nbspPeople started to come here in the hope of receiving cures, and Knock became synonymous for that, said Ms Casey.And people came to the spot of the apparition to get some clay or holy water to send to abroad.It has developed over the years and it has a very unique story in the sense that it\u0027s the only shrine in the world where the Lamb of God has appeared.As well as being a Marian shrine, it is a Eucharistic shrine. People have a special affinity with the place.An estimated 1.5m pilgrims travel to the Knock Shrine each year.Pope Francis visits Ireland – in picturesPope Francis celebrates the Holy Mass at the Phoenix Park, in Dublin Pope Francis arrives at Phoenix Park for a Papal Mass of the World Meeting of Families in DublinA vigil takes place at the site of the mass grave which contained the remains of 796 named babies from the Bon Secours Mother and Baby home in Tuam.

followIndy PoliticsThe Treasury is warning of a 7.7 per cent hit to GDP from a no-deal Brexit - and an £80bn black hole in the public financesBrexit secretary contradicts government forecast of economic hit from no-deal EU exit, setting up clash with HammondDominic Raab has dismissed his own government’s forecast of huge economic damage from crashing out of the EU without a deal, insisting most such predictions “prove to be wrong”.The Brexit secretary set up a clash with Philip Hammond, the Chancellor, by rejecting his warning of a 7.7 per cent hit to GDP and an £80bn black hole in the public finances.The projection is the Treasury’s own analysis of the impact of a no-deal Brexit over the next 15 years – because of the loss of market access to the EU and chaos at Britain’s borders.But, asked about the stark warning, Mr Raab said: “I\u0027m always chary of any forecast because most of them have been proved to be wrong.”Speaking to The Sunday Times, he added: “We need to treat some of the forecasts with a measure of caution”, before claiming that estimates of economic growth next year “have been revised up”.In fact, the Bank of England has cut its GDP forecast for 2019 to 1.7 per cent – well below the pre-referendum growth rate – and warned “the economic outlook for the UK remains clouded by Brexit uncertainties”.In the interview, Mr Raab also brushed off polling evidence of growing public unease about the prospects for Brexit, as the negotiations remain deadlocked.“The majority of people think Britain will be better off\u0026nbsplong term\u0026nbspfor leaving the EU. People think, just get on and deliver it. That\u0027s what we\u0027re going to do,” he insisted.Last week, Mr Hammond triggered renewed Tory infighting – and Brexiteer calls for him to be sacked – when he confirmed the Treasury’s fears about a no-deal exit.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchIn a letter to the Treasury committee, he said the analysis showed “GDP would be 7.7 per cent lower (range 5.0 per cent to 10.3 per cent) relative to a status quo baseline”.And he added: “GDP impacts of this magnitude, were they to arise, would have large fiscal consequences.”Nicky Morgan, the committee’s Tory chairwoman, leapt on the conclusions, saying: The chancellor has confirmed that the government forecasts a disastrous hit to our economy and living standards in the event of a no-deal Brexit.”But the intervention came just hours after Mr Raab attempted to reassure the public over a disorderly exit, even citing “opportunities” that could arise.\u0027University research projects at risk of collapse amid no-deal Brexit\u0027No-deal Brexit \u0027will be blocked by at least 40 Tory MPs\u0027Scientists fear loss of half a billion pounds of funding after no-dealThe Tories\u0027 plan for a no-deal Brexit is not looking so sunny any moreIn the interview, Mr Raab hinted at warm relations with Michel Barnier, the EU’s Brexit negotiator. After meeting again this week, he will have spent more time with him than the seven hours David Davis, his predecessor, did this year.“I think he\u0027s a steely interlocutor he knows what he\u0027s seeking to achieve,” the Brexit secretary said.“Equally, behind closed doors he\u0027s very warm. We talk about family. I do think getting to know the other side on a personal level helps. You have to understand what the other side is thinking, what the pressures on them are.“He\u0027s a very personable guy –\u0026nbsphe\u0027s invited me and my wife, Erika, down to his farm.

It’s a huge question.”Pressed on whether he believed the prime minister could get a deal through the chamber, he added: “I think it’s very unlikely she’ll get a deal through the House of Commons.”Lord Heseltine said that for months he has been saying there “had to be a second test of public opinion” either through a general election or a second EU referendum.“I think probably a referendum,” he said when asked which he would prefer. “It’s one or the other.

If people like him start using language that stimulates the worst elements of racism, it licences people to go further with impunity. ‘If Boris can say it, I can say it’. It becomes the sort of slogan of the racist element of the right wing.”He suggested there could only be two explanations for the contentious column that attracted widespread criticism. “One is that it’s a mistake and if it’s a mistake he could say so. The other is that he calculates it would advance his street cred with the right wing of the Tory party. And I think it’s possible he’s right with that judgement.”Asked whether he believed it was likely Mr Johnson would challenge the prime minister for leadership of the Conservative Party, Lord Heseltine added: “I think it’s much more likely that events will dictate the pace of change.“I would not expect him to make a decisive move – the move may be made inevitable by vacuums or by other people signing letters of no confidence, all these sorts of things, or by losses of votes in the House of Commons.“There has never been in my view such an unpredictable, calamitous set of events facing us.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"url beyonce jay z on the run tour 2 concert gig tickets stage invasion","story":"Created with Sketch.A concertgoer jumped on the stage to chase after the couple at their Atlanta concertClick to followThe Independent CultureBeyoncé and Jay-Z On the Run II Tour concert thrown into chaos after stage invasionBeyoncé\u0026nbspand Jay-Z\u0027s Atlanta stop on their On the Run II Tour took a surprise turn in its closing moments, as a concertgoer jumped on stage and attempted to chase after the famous couple.\u0026nbspFootage shared on social media of the incident shows the duo end their performance and turn to leave the stage, right before a man is seen sprinting across the stage towards them.Thankfully, the backing dancers still on stage are quick to realise what\u0027s going on, immediately rushing towards the stage invader to intercept him.\u0026nbspBeyonce trips down stairs in show, but handles it \u0027like Queen she is\u0027You can now buy Beyoncé\u0027s Coachella outfitsIt seems as if they\u0027re quick thinking helped to apprehend him long enough for the full force of the security team to take control of the situation.\u0026nbspMeanwhile, at the tour\u0027s Nashville show,\u0026nbspBeyoncé\u0026nbspdemonstrated her otherworldly ability to maintain poise and grace under any circumstance, after she managed to save herself from falling down the stairs during the gig.\u0026nbspFollow\u0026nbspIndependent Culture\u0026nbspon Facebook for all the latest on Film, TV, Music, and more.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2017/07/18/12/jw-ru-appeal-hearing-back.jpg","title":"jehovahs witness russia finland asylum seekers religion","story":"Created with Sketch.The religion is banned in Russia, and labelled an \u0027extremist\u0027 group, akin to IsisClick to followThe IndependentAn appeal hearing at Russia\u0027s Supreme Court over the ban on Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses as an \u0027extremist\u0027 organisation on 17 July 2017Hundreds of Jehovah’s Witnesses fleeing Russia have applied for asylum in Finland, its immigration\u0026nbspauthorities have said.\u0026nbspThe Scandinavian country has become a favoured destination for the religious group\u0026nbspever since Moscow outlawed its activities last year.\u0026nbspThe denomination was labelled “extremist” in March, equating the pacifist movement\u0026nbspwith terrorist organisations such as\u0026nbspIsis. A month later, Russia’s Supreme Court upheld the decision and ordered the group’s official representation to disband. \u0026nbsp“It doesn’t matter where in Russia they try to worship – in their meeting houses, which the state is beginning to confiscate, or in private homes,” said\u0026nbspGeraldine Fagan, author of Believing in Russia – Religious Policy after Communism. “It\u0026nbsprepresents the worst roll back of religious freedom since the fall of Communism.” \u0026nbspIt is unclear exactly why the Kremlin chose to use its broad extremist laws against the movement. Initially\u0026nbspthe Russian Justice Ministry’s moves against the group appeared to be\u0026nbspa response to an aggressive leafleting campaign.\u0026nbspSome have suggested the group’s opposition to overt patriotism and violence played a role. The influence of the Russian Orthodox Church, which views Jehovah’s Witnesses as a dangerous sect, is also apparent.\u0026nbspIn the 17 months since the ban was enacted, dozens of Russian Jehovah’s Witnesses have been arrested. Most of an\u0026nbspestimated 175,000 members of the denomination\u0026nbspin Russia no longer advertise their faith. Many, it seems, are looking for new lives elsewhere.\u0026nbspAccording to the Finnish Immigration Service, the number of applications from Russian Jehovah’s Witnesses grew from five in 2016 to more than\u0026nbsp100 in 2017 and 2018. The number of asylum applications also grew, from 193 in 2016 to 309 in the year to date. The\u0026nbsplatter figure\u0026nbspincludes all kinds of groups – from opposition activists to refugees from the northern Caucasus.Finnish immigration officials told The Independent the vast majority of Jehovah’s Witnesses applications have yet to be processed. There had been only a “handful” of accepted applications and a “handful” of negative decisions, officials\u0026nbspsaid with nearly all of those rejected since appealing.\u0026nbsp“Each of the cases is dealt with on an inidual basis,” The Independent was told. “Persecution of these groups has not been systematic across Russia, and the approach of the ministry has taken this into account.”\u0026nbspWorld news in picturesRohingya refugees during a protest march after attending a ceremony to remember the first anniversary of a military crackdown that prompted a massive exodus of people from Myanmar to Bangladesh, at the Kutupalong refugee camp in UkhiaUS President Donald Trump sits with children during a tour of Nationwide Children\u0027s Hospital in Columbus, OhioAustralian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull speaks to the media during a press conference at Parliament House in Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, AustraliaHigh waves hit Jeju Island, South Korea, as powerful Typhoon Soulik gradually approaches the Korean PeninsulaA Palestinian man throws his child in the air following morning prayers marking the first day of Eid al-Adha celebrations on the compound known to Muslims as al-Haram al-Sharif in Jerusalem\u0027s Old City.

While shared widely on social media over the past day, it appears to have been recorded in the run-up to the 2016 Brexit referendum.The Irish border, which zig-zags for more than 300 miles across the north-east of Ireland and is crossed by 200 public roads, has been the biggest issue facing Britain as it leaves the EU.During the Troubles, the period of civil unrest in Ireland during the late-20th century, major border crossings were blocked by British Army checkpoints, with some smaller routes closed completely.Fears of a return to a hard border and a return to bloodshed have grown since England and Wales voted to leave the EU in June 2016. Northern Ireland, like Scotland, voted heavily in favour of Remain.                Varadkar warns May \u0026lsquoGET ON WITH IT\u0026rsquo - and LAUGHS OFF Rees-Mogg                Ireland turns screw on May as Varadkar warns of STOCKPILINGThe UK government remains unable to explain how cross-border trade and the movement of goods will continue after Brexit without the establishment of customs checkpoints or even CCTV cameras - which would constitute a hard border, a red line issue for Dublin, Belfast and Brussels.And while Prime Minister Theresa May has repeatedly promised to avoid a return to a hard-border, the newly-emerged video shared widely on social media yesterday shows Mr Rees-Mogg calling for physical inspections.He said the style of border checks in place \u0026ldquoduring the Troubles could be brought back, before dismissing the border itself as not something \u0026ldquoeveryone has to go through every day.In reality, any sort of physical check would be deemed unacceptable in Brussels and among politicians on both sides of the Irish border, which is crossed daily by 30,000 workers.Brexit news: Ireland\u0027s foreign minister has hit out at Jacob Rees-Mogg (Image:   TWITTER)But Mr Rees-Mogg claimed: \u0026ldquoIt is perfectly possible to continue with historic arrangements to ensure that there wasn\u0026rsquot a great loophole in the way people could get into the UK, which would leave us in just as bad a position as we are currently in.\u0026ldquoThere would be our ability, as we had during the Troubles, to have people inspected.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos not a border that everyone has to go through every day.Brexit news: Jacob Rees-Mogg said people could be inspected when crossing the Irish border (Image: TWITTER)\u0026ldquoOf course for security reasons during the Troubles we kept a very close eye on the border to try and stop gun-running and things like that.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos not inconsistent to have a border that people can pass through but that you are keeping an eye on.His comments have sparked a furious response, with Ireland\u0026rsquos deputy t\u0026aacutenaiste (deputy prime minister) Simon Coveney hitting out.Brexit news: Ireland\u0027s foreign minister Simon Coveney with his former UK counterpart (Image: )Mr Coveney, who is also the country\u0026rsquos foreign minister, Tweeted a link to the video this afternoon.\u0026nbspHe added: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos hard to believe that a senior politician is so ill informed about Ireland and the politics of the Brexit Irish border issue that he could make comments like these.We have left the Troubles behind us, through the sincere efforts of many and we intend on keeping it that way.

But that’s where we have got it so wrong.It comes as no surprise that nearly 50 per cent of UK schools are failing to achieve the target 25 per cent of A-level entries in STEM subjects — science, technology, engineering and mathematics.The nation is crying out for STEM skills. It is estimated there is a STEM-worker shortfall of 40,000 — and it is set to rise. We are facing a national crisis.Yet schools are rewarded on delivering grades, not different subjects. And this relentless focus on grades means youngsters are potentially being deprived access to high-paid and fast-growing careers.Research shows interest in maths and science dramatically declines during secondary school.When it comes to gender, there is a big difference. Interest in STEM subjects drops by 56 per cent among boys and 74 per cent among girls.Quite often girls underestimate their performance and, although they get better grades in maths and physics at GCSE, fewer of them take the subjects at A level than boys.There is this perception that you have to be a genius to do maths or science, but that is not true.Often teachers will say unless you get a grade A in maths or science at GCSE, don’t even bother taking it for A level. The reality is, even if you get a lower grade in the subject, it is still viewed very well by employers. Even if you take just one STEM subject, it will open up so many more doors.This is one of the reasons I created Future Finder, a free app to show young people the relationship between subject choices and their career pathway.After all, this is about preparing them for a job, not getting them to the top of the school system.Science is also fun, it is creative. It’s not dull and nerdy, which is how it is often perceived.We need to tell youngsters there are such jobs as autonomous vehicle engineers, gamification designers and carbon capture technicians, because you can’t be what you can’t see.Sixty-five per cent of children entering primary school now will end up working in jobs that don’t yet exist. And unless young people are learning the right skills, they’re not going to get them.Nearly 30 years ago, when I set up a data analysis company with my husband Clive, people threw data away because it was too expensive to keep. We went on to create Tesco Clubcard, the world’s first supermarket loyalty card.We were only a small business, but we had the skills to figure out something Tesco couldn’t on its own — exactly what its customers were buying.It revolutionised the way we shop, the supermarket doubled its market share within the year and we went from employing 30 staff to 1,500.We were at the forefront of a new science and it was an amazing time.I’m incredibly lucky and I’ve had a brilliant career. Now I want to help give back by preparing tomorrow’s talent.I was the chair of Your Life, a national campaign to encourage youngsters to consider careers in STEM.As a result of that movement, the Government now gives schools an additional £600 per pupil studying maths at A level.Figures also show that STEM subjects are becoming more popular. More than a third of all A-level entries in 2018 were in these subjects and more girls are taking STEM subjects.But we are already far behind countries such as America and China. That gap is only going to get wider too, as we estimate we will need 1.3million more science professionals by 2030.If schools are the talent factory then we need to deliver the skills the nation needs. We must start by giving extra weighting to maths and physics when it comes to measuring a school’s success.We are defined by the talent coming through our schools. That’s our future, that’s who we will be.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And since 2000 our population has soared by more than seven million — more than 80 per cent of it directly due to immigration, according to Migration Watch.The Sun is not criticising the migrants themselves. Quite the reverse. The vast majority come for a better life and a decent job and integrate perfectly.Our objection is to short-sighted politicians who failed to foresee the cost.Now wages are depressed, houses and rents unaffordable, schools overcrowded, the NHS and our transport system under massive strain.Migrant numbers should be tied to our economic need — but it is vital, with the annual net increase still at 280,000, that we build the infrastructure to match.What’s being done? Precious little.WHAT credibility can Labour’s promises over the freedom of the media possibly have when their single biggest financial backer is the odious Max Mosley?Leave aside that he is a former fascist who was present as his father Oswald’s thugs marched through a Jewish area of East London chanting “Jews out”.He now bankrolls Corbyn’s mob, to the tune of £300,000 last year alone, because he knows they will try to crush the popular Press given the chance. His apparent sole motivation being revenge after his lust for Germanic sado-masochistic hooker orgies was exposed.This, then, is the rancid state of Labour:A cesspit of a party, run by public schoolboy Marxist class warriors, infested with anti-Semitic racism and funded by one of the most unimaginably unpleasant individuals in public life.How proud its MPs must be.IT’S far too easy for banks to blame ­customers conned out of their savings.Most of us are still too savvy to give our details to cold-callers or emailers. But the scams grow more and more credible and sophisticated. It’s easier than ever to be taken in and plenty are.The Financial Ombudsman argues that it’s unfair to assume victims are “grossly negligent”, and we agree.The onus must be on banks to beef up their security processes and software to keep our funds safe — as well as to keep hammering home to all customers the risk in handing over information.Last year only a quarter of the £240million stolen got refunded.That represents a shameful shirking of responsibility.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Corbyn’s speech was full of cuddly sounding expressions.But the real message was clear: Never mind all that freedom nonsense — let’s nationalise the news.So, the Labour leader says he wants to invest taxes in public-interest journalism.Who would want journalism that goes against the public good?But the question is: Who decides what the public interest might mean?Government ministers? High court judges? Simon Cowell and Cheryl? Jeremy Corbyn’s press office?Look a little closer and it is clear there is no consensus on what qualifies as public-interest journalism.It is just an ethical-sounding excuse for imposing your own interests on what are really matters of personal taste and political preference.One thing seems certain: It will not be the British public deciding which sort of public-interest journalism taxes should finance.Corbyn wants his state-backed media fund to be “independent”.A buzzword that should raise the question: Independent of what?There are no independent angels floating above the grubby political battles below, with only the public interest at heart.Everybody has interests and agendas of their own.Labour’s independent media funding body would be another government-backed quango, stacked with placemen from the political and cultural elites.Corbyn had the nerve to protest that the media today is “unaccountable”.Yet his independent media board would be less accountable to the public than newspapers, which must respond to their readers who pay their hard-earned money for their newspaper of choice.As for taxes funding journalism to create a more informed public — informed by who, peddling which line?It is not hard to imagine the sort of information Corbyn wants the media to feed us, it would be like the old Russian Communist party paper Pravda.It is no coincidence that the Labour Party’s biggest individual donor last year was the odious, Press-hating Max Mosley.The Labour leader singled out something called the Bureau Of Investigative Journalism as an example of an independent outfit that should be given charitable status and tax perks.Would that be the same self-righteous bureau that prompted the BBC’s flagship Newsnight programme to throw its ethics overboard a few years ago and falsely inform us that a Tory lord was a paedophile?Newsnight never recovered its reputation in the wake of the debacle.When Corbynites talk about wanting a more “diverse” media, one thing they do not mean is diversity of content and opinion. They want a conformist media that will report what it is told and not ask awkward questions.Even the BBC — bastion of the Remainstream media establishment — is too insolent for Labour’s tastes.If you want to see the real face of Labour’s attitude to journalism, just look at Corbyn’s smirking response to a Sky News reporter who asked him some straight questions about the recent wreath-laying controversy.His contemptuous reply basically said, “You have no right to know what I do or think” — in which case, neither do the mass of viewers.Labour’s track record gives the lie to any notion that it is interested in a more open media.The non-Corbynite deputy leader, Tom Watson, is an even more embittered Press-hater.Who does Jeremy Corbyn think he is, to be laying down the law on what a free Press should or should not investigate, and protesting to regulators when they report facts or express opinions not to his liking?Yet Corbyn’s quasi-Stalinist vision of State-approved journalism seems to go down well with his cultish fan club, who ensured that #ChangeTheMedia was trending on Twitter even before he spoke in Edinburgh.Perhaps they should more honestly have made it #ChangeTheMedia-OrElse.“Just because it’s on the front page of The Sun or The Mail,” Corbyn claimed yesterday, “doesn’t automatically make it news.”If he had his way, it would be more a case of: “Just because it’s news, doesn’t automatically mean it should be allowed on the front page of The Sun.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Remainer sabotage? Or just another tone-deaf blunder?Either way, he left the Government looking even more chaotic than usual.Will No Deal happen? Consider this:Britain has offered “unconditional” security cooperation with the EU post-Brexit. In response, Brussels vows to CHARGE us to access its databases.They want capitulation, not a deal.JEREMY Corbyn’s sole motive in “changing the media” is to silence a hostile Press.The giveaway was when he attacked broadcasters yesterday for following up Sun stories. “Just because it’s on the front page of The Sun or Mail doesn’t automatically make it news,” he whined.Could this be because recent front pages have exposed Labour’s racism? That IS news, as page one stories in the two biggest daily papers tend to be.Britain already has the world’s most vibrant media. Corbyn is feigning some high-minded interest in improving it. But the last thing he wants is it holding a future Labour Government to account.He detests scrutiny, as his tantrums sparked by tricky questions prove.As for his plan for a state-run Facebook rival, can you imagine anything more ridiculous or pointless?The ­Austin Allegro of social media, making ­gargantuan losses for taxpayers?And how about his “Netflix levy” to fund the BBC?Is there no limit to the costs he wants to pile on ordinary people?NOW, by contrast, is the time for the Tories to CUT taxes.There is depressing talk of a new hike to fund the NHS. But the public finances are in unexpectedly good shape, the deficit plummeting and growth on the up.Corporation tax should be as low as Ireland’s, stamp duty slashed to get the housing market moving, fuel duty lowered, and income tax cut too.With No Deal Brexit more likely, we need to boost the economy and lure investment with a low-tax regime as never before.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was a horrible time.”In light of his apology, some people might talk about rehabilitation. He’s said he’s sorry and he won’t do it again.People have to be given a ­second chance — right?Before I answer that, let me flag up a few other stories that caught my eye this week.There’s the tale of Sean Simmons, 28, a domestic abuser from Hull who waterboarded one of his ex-partners, tying her to a bath before covering her face with a towel and pouring cold water over her, saying: “This is what I do to people who lie. I’m going to make you tell the truth.”Later, he produced a knife and said he’d “have to kill her”.And Darren McKie, a 43-year-old police inspector who was jailed for life after strangling his wife Leanne, 39, at their home in Cheshire, then dumping her body in a lake.And Glyn Leedell, 39, who threatened to kill a woman with a kitchen knife within hours of meeting her in a Rotherham pub.Oh, and the news that Ian Stewart, 57, who was jailed for 34 years after smothering his wife, children’s author Helen Bailey, is being questioned over the death of his first wife, Diane Stewart, who died after collapsing in the garden of the couple’s home in Cambridgeshire.I could go on, but it’s too depressing.If you read the same stories you may have taken a moment to despair that the papers are full of similar stories every day — of women being killed, brutalised and attacked by the men who purport to love them.Or, you may have barely noticed because these stories are so ­commonplace.Of course, not all men who threaten to kill their partners go on to do so.But you can be sure that most of the women above had probably suffered years of traumatic intimidation and abuse before their partners actually acted on their threats.Meanwhile, those women were ­living in fear — that’s what these chumps get off on. They want to make their victim feel helpless and powerless.So, let’s talk about forgiveness and rehabilitation.Do I think people who really regret being a perpetrator of domestic violence deserve a second chance? Yes, I do.If someone is genuinely ­repentant about anything they’ve done wrong, you can’t refuse ­forgiveness forever.Do I think that Dan Osborne’s second chance should take the form of a public platform on which to rehabilitate his image and, no doubt, earn a pretty penny or two into the bargain?No, I really, really do not.Sure, it was three years ago and no, he didn’t actually go on to act on his threat to knife his ex.But by letting him into the CBB house, Channel Five are sending a strong message that domestic violence allegations are a trivial affair, not to be taken seriously.By welcoming him in, despite his “scandal”, they are normalising and turning a blind eye to the kind of behaviour that too often ruins — and sometimes ends — women’s lives.People on TV are role models. And to allow a man who has made verbal threats to kill his girlfriend to become a role model is irresponsible in the extreme.ITV recognised this when they decided to boot him off Towie.Channel Five should have done the same.SHIRLEY BALLAS has revealed she weighs herself every day in the run up to Strictly in order to get “telly ready”.You might think that sounds extreme but, believe me, the only way to get telly ready is to take very seriously the old adage that the screen adds a stone.I don’t exactly weigh myself before filming The Apprentice or Give It A Year but, in the three months leading up to filming, I always manage to lose – by hook or by crook – a stone.In fact we all do – Lord Sugar and Claude Littner are watching what they eat as well.Then, as soon as filming stops, we all immediately put the weight back on again as normal life resumes.And, let me tell you, it’s a lot harder to take it off than it is to put it on.I’M a big believer in benefits being available to people who need help because they can’t help themselves.But the story of Bangladeshi immigrant Abdul Jalil, a father of six who came to the UK in 1969, really makes a mockery of the system.Jalil, who is 64, hasn’t worked since 1988 for “health reasons”.But a probation officer found the only problem he had is a slightly tender right knee.In 2008, he exceeded the amount of cash that claimants are allowed to have when he was loaned £25,000 to buy his council house.He did not notify the Department for Work and Pensions and continued wrongly claiming more than £28,000 over the next eight years.He then lied to the DWP about his assets as he filled out his benefits review form in 2012.He had re-mortgaged his council flat in May that year for roughly £148,000 and given the money to his children so they could purchase their own properties keeping around £86,500 for himself.Then at court this week he was spared jail – in favour of community service and even had the cheek to say he would do it if it was “light work”.I know that some people need benefits to get back on their feet, and I’m proud to live in a country that provides that.But once a person is back up, they need to actually stand on their own two feet – rather than abusing the system that helped them.Like all benefit cheats, he should pay the money back or go to jail and never be allowed access to benefits again.AS taxpayers we give almost £14BILLION a year away in foreign aid of which almost £1billion goes to the EU, and this week the Government was threatening to withdraw our cash if there was no-deal Brexit.Why wait until Brexit? Just stop it now.We need this money to fix our own country – our NHS, our police forces, our schools, benefits and housing all need it desperately.And the worst part of all this is that we have to borrow the money to give it away.Our country has almost £2TRILLION of debt, which costs around £50billion a year to service in interest.Borrowing money to give it away, it’s the economics of the madhouse.I KNOW our prisons are full, but it beggars belief that Allan Williamson, 45, was let off with a two-year community order and 30 days rehabilitation.When police raided his flat in Hulme, Manchester, they found more than 600 images – including 68 films classed as Category A, the highest level of children being sexually abused.To be clear, the images showed children as young as seven being sexually abused by adults.Still, Judge Elizabeth Nicholls,  decided prison wasn’t necessary, saying Williamson had been “open and frank” with the police about his behaviour and because the man has allegedly taken “tentative steps to address these issues”.So the guy was in possession of 600 images including many of the worst kind of paedophilia – and he’s still in the community?Who in their right mind would want this guy in their community?I know the prisons are buckling, so let’s just build more – even if that includes sending prisoners out to sea in containers.When is the justice system going to start thinking about the victims as opposed to the perpetrators?I BET the boyfriend of Kay Longstaff – the air hostess who spent ten hours in the water after plunging from a cruise liner – is feeling a bit embarrassed.Longstaff was miraculously rescued ten hours after falling – or jumping – from the Norwegian Star, 60 miles off the Croatian coast last week.It’s not quite clear what happened beforehand but other passengers and crew claim to have seen Ms Longstaff in several arguments with her partner Craig Rayment, above with Kay, on the evening of the incident.Once she’d been rescued, Mr Rayment’s estranged wife Kelly offered Ms Longstaff some unsolicited support, saying: “If I was on a ship with him, I would get off any way I could.”Oh dear.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

with this and accepted, regardless of the fact I have never fiddled my expenses or taken cash for ­questions, some of those who come before me have damned all politicians to the sin-bin.I do, however, think there is one very simple thing all politicians could agree to do that would help rehabilitate us to the public.We could answer a straight question with a straight answer.This week doing the rounds on Twitter was a clip of Jeremy Corbyn on Channel 4 News being asked six times: “Do you honestly believe Britain will be better off outside of the EU?”Each time he answered with a variation of, “Labour wants to maintain good relations with the EU to protect jobs”.His words are not bad — it is certainly the answer he and his team would have practised.But it is not an answer to that question and that’s the problem.To the average punter it just looks like politicians can’t be straight.The answer, as far as I’m concerned, is a big fat no.Gavin Williamson, the Defence Secretary, suffered a similar cringeworthy encounter with Richard Madeley in May.The question in the wake of the Salisbury poisonings was: “You told Russia to ‘shut up and go away’.Do you regret that now?Do you think it was too informal?”He started by answering an entirely different question about paying tribute to healthcare workers, which had absolutely nothing to do with what he was being asked.God only knows why he didn’t just say: “Yeah, it wasn’t my finest hour but I guess I was just really cross that people in Britain were being poisoned.”He could then have gone on to say all the nice things about Salisbury health workers.Instead, Madeley savaged him and all that anyone remembers of the encounter is that Gavin Williamson should avoid interviews.Mind you, at least both Corbyn and Williamson gave an answer.At least they bothered to take part.Boris Johnson would just have offered his questioner a cup of tea as if he was Mrs Doyle from Father Ted.I honestly despair.I’m not sure when the art of just repeating the same message over and over again, even if it in no way answers the question, started.Most people put it down to the Tony Blair years of slick media management, but times have surely got to move on.Politicians spend too much time hedging their bets, trying to keep all the people happy and end up pleasing no one by waffling through an answer that is basically six of one and half a dozen of the other.I get that it is hard when your job is basically a massive popularity contest, but I am not sure we are made more popular by dodging questions and refusing to give our own opinions.People contact me every single week telling me they don’t always agree with me but they appreciate that I stand up for what I believe.I honestly don’t think the British people want politicians to say an approximation of a safe answer, or to try to be pals with everyone.People have a damn sight more respect for people when they say what they think, even if they disagree.For too long politicians have been especially scared of upsetting working-class people, without recognising that most people don’t even think of themselves that way any more.I have absolutely no idea where the idea came from that the average member of the public can’t stand a bit of discussion and disagreement, or are so fragile that they will all fall apart if someone says something not to their liking.I have never once voted for someone who I agreed with 100 per cent of the time.I didn’t marry someone I agreed with a 100 per cent of the time and, frankly, if he tried to please me, placate me and pander to all my views I would no longer stay married to him, because it would be dishonest.Don’t get me wrong — saying what you think is not a universally appreciated characteristic and some do get in touch with me to tell me to shut up and go away.Much like Russia probably felt when Williamson said it to them, I pay little mind to this and crack on.Journalists do sometimes ask stupid questions.Politicians do have to be careful about what they say as it can sometimes get twisted and misrepresented.Things are not always simple, and giving a quick answer on a complex issue takes some skill.All that said, it has got to be time to stop the waffle and give the public a break from shouting at their telly each night: “For God’s sake, answer the bleedin’ question!”IT’S that time of year where slow news weeks turn to how much wine we should drink and if swearing at work should be banned.Apparently no amount of alcohol is safe, which will change absolutely no one’s behaviour, and swearing at work is bad for morale.I cannot agree on the swearing front.I am not advocating we all run around barking sweary orders and aggressive expletives at our colleagues but I find sometimes, especially in times of high stress in the office, nothing will quite explain it like a collective FFS.I have seen how a bit of good old Anglo Saxon can be used to break down barriers between me and my constituents.It stops me seeming like some lofty bureaucrat who cannot understand their problems.In some cases it makes them physically relax if we get a bit sweary about their crappy landlord or their benefits being stopped.We all swear, and most of us drink, I doubt that’s going to change.PADDY DOHERTY of My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding and Celeb Big Brother fame was in the papers this week, leading the funeral procession for his nephew.A sad affair, of course, but the diamond-encrusted funeral casket is reported to have cost £100,000.I remember organising my own mother’s funeral and balking at spending around £2,500 for an event I’d rather have not had to attend.I could hear her voice in my head saying, “How much?” as we wrote out cheques for cars and coffins. My wedding only cost £3k and I thought that was a bit much.When my time comes, I implore my family to keep their cash. I wouldn’t be thankful for money being literally burnt.THIS week’s, in fact this year’s, feminist icon goes to the unlikely Stormy Daniels.There is, of course, no reason why feminism would not extend to women performing in pornography but there are few crossovers.Stormy Daniels is a hero.World leaders across the globe pander to Trump, few are brave enough to publicly call out his racism, sexism and terrible decision making.Our own PM holds his hand, allowing him to make her look weak and feeble.Ms Daniels has been brave enough not only to take on the most powerful man in the world but also some pretty tooled-up lawyers too.After apparently receiving payment and signing a non-disclosure agreement to hush her up about an affair she had with Trump in 2006, she broke rank.This was not just a kiss and tell, this was a story that has caused Donald Trump’s lawyer Michael Cohen to plead guilty to breaking election campaign rules.He explicitly stated that he was told to pay her the money by “the candidate” meaning Trump. Donald Trump will probably get away with this misdemeanour, but it is the closest he has come to being in real trouble.Without Stormy Daniels and her courage to face down legal threats, vicious hate mail and a campaign to discredit her, powerful men would continue to use women as playthings and just pay them off when they are done.Stormy Daniels is every woman who has been messed about and we salute her for fighting back.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Project Fear forecast dramatic downturns in the economy if the people were so unwise as to vote for Brexit. Wrong again.Since then, we have had record levels of employment, huge investments from the likes of Google, Microsoft, SoftBank and a long list of other companies.They demonstrated their confidence in the future of this great country in the best way possible — with their money.This time round the wise insight came from Andy Haldane, the best economist at the Bank of England.Ruefully he said “economic forecasting is having a Michael Fish moment”.Michael Fish was the weather forecaster who completely mispredicted the huge 1987 storm that struck Britain.If only economic forecasters were even as good as weather forecasters, we would be a lot better off. But they are not, and they are at it again.This week Chancellor Philip Hammond predicted the Treasury would need to raise an extra £80billion in 15 years’ time in the event of a no-deal Brexit.And yet the Chancellor insists on ­trotting out yet another bogus forecast, on the very day that my successor as Brexit Secretary, Dominic Raab, is ­presenting the first set of preparation for no deal.Coincidence? I do not think so.The great departments of state are very careful about what they put in the public domain, and exactly when.For nobody is this more true than the Treasury, which has to judge the public perception of everything it does, if only because of its effect on the markets. So this was either spectacularly incompetent, or deliberate. I know what I think.And even more disgraceful, by doing so it will undermine the Government’s hand in striking a deal with the EU.If they do not think we dare walk away, then they will give us the worst deal they can think of. Bear in mind that the Chequers deal already concedes enormous amounts to the EU.It would not be long before our world-leading position in life sciences, gene technology, artificial intelligence, self-driving cars and a whole range of other modern industries would be being actively undermined by the Europeans.As for being out of reach of the ­European Court, pull the other one.But now the Treasury is beginning to fear that even these spectacular concessions the Government has made in the Chequers deal will not deliver agreement from the European Commission — or if it does, the Commons will turn it down.In that event you can expect attempts by the Remainers in Parliament to try to scupper our departure by delaying it beyond the General Election, or offer some other enormous raft of concessions to give back control of the EU.Hence the ridiculous suggestion that the Army would be used to move food around the country.Why? What conceivable aspect of European policy would handicap British hauliers moving British products from Kent to Cumbria?None of course, but it was just the bogus nonsense some of our Remainer media is only too happy to carry ­completely uncritically. Similarly, we have heard suggestions of all sorts of shortages, based it seems mostly on the idea that the French might impede the flow of goods between Calais and Dover.It would not be the first time we had dealt with such issues. We had about 30 days of such delays in 2015. I remember queues of lorries, but I do not remember shortages of food or medicines.And on other issues, are the Europeans really going to pick a fight on data with the biggest IT power on the continent, on banking are they going to refuse to cooperate with the greatest financial ­centre in the world?Are the Greeks, Italians and Spaniards going to disadvantage the UK residents on whom many of their local economies depend? Or stop tourism? I think not.I suspect we are quite likely to have the odd hiccup when we leave the EU, but we will be able to cope, which is what Dominic Raab was demonstrating this week. And any problems we have will be over in months not years.So in 15 years’ time, far from worrying about Mr Hammond’s £80billion bill, the country will have trouble remembering what all the fuss was about.The biggest question will be whether we have made the most of the opportunities created by Brexit.And that is what we should worry about today, creating the circumstances where this great country can take its proper place in the world. We will only be able to do that if we allow ourselves the freedoms a clean Brexit will deliver.So my advice to all my old colleagues in Cabinet is simple: Ignore the misery merchants of the Treasury, stop fearing things that will never happen, and start planning for the real opportunities that this great country can grasp when it sets its mind to it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There is a real concern about safety.”One of the region’s MPs is Luciana Berger, the Parliamentary chair of the Jewish Labour Movement, has repeatedly been targeted for abuse.The former shadow minister for public health said she felt “unwelcome” in her own party after Mr Corbyn’s recent “inexcusable comments”.In response to the official complaint a party source told the Observer they were not aware of it, but a Labour spokesperson said: “The Labour party’s complaints procedure operates confidentially in the interests of fairness to all concerned.“This is to ensure protection of the personal data both for any members who make complaints, and for those to whom complaints relate.“This enables procedures to be followed properly.

We can be the catalyst for a worldwide Commonwealth trade deal with none of disadvantages of the EUs attempt to run Britain from Brussels.”The country’s former Vice President added: “My sincere belief is that Brexit can be a great force for good.

But leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg dismissed the “delusional”.He hit back at Brussels, telling The Sun: “It is wishful thinking by a EU establishment that has failed to notice that its grand scheme has failed economically, is devoid of democratic support and is increasing unpopular across the continent.EU sources also questioned Brexit secretary Dominic Raab’s upbeat assessment of how the UK would cope in the first few weeks of a no deal outcome. One said they “wouldn’t count on” his reassurance that Brits will still be able to enjoy a BLT sandwich in such a scenario.Last week the Government published a slew of notices warning people and businesses how to prepare for a crash out situation in March next year.Announcing them, Mr Raab dismissed suggestions the army and Air Force would have to be deployed to secure food and medicine supplies as “scare stories”. And in a bizarre pledge, he said Brits will “still be able to enjoy a BLT after Brexit”.But asked whether the UK Government could survive the first few days of a no deal exit, an EU ambassador told The Sun: “It’s not possible to have a no deal. There would be a massive outcry.“With even a no deal for one week, with no flights to and from the UK, no ships, imagine the economic loss of one week of no economic activity, no personal activity, no financial transactions. That would already be a disaster.”The diplomat added that Britain’s sluggish economic growth over the past year meant it was already “falling behind more and more” compared to the rest of the continent.The EU Commission has slashed its growth forecast for the UK to just 1.3 per cent for 2018, the joint lowest rate alongside struggling Italy.And EU officials believe that business pressure on Ministers to reach a compromise and avoid a crash out will crescendo in the next few months.A senior EU official told The Sun: “The moment the markets understand this is going in the wrong way, the cycle of negotiations and the political dynamics will be taken over by the real world.“In a few months the UK will have a credibility issue. The moment economic operators understand this is going wrong there will be events on the ground.”Meanwhile a former EU chief sparked outrage yesterday by claiming a no deal Brexit would trigger the break-up of the UK.Former European Council President Herman Van Rompuy said: “We could end up with a situation in which the EU27 becomes more united and a United Kingdom less united. This talk about a ‘no deal’ is the kind of nationalist rhetoric that belongs to another era.”THE Eurocrats are losing the plot.We’re used to their regular predictions that Britain will turn into the 10th circle of hell once we leave the EU. But even we’re taken aback by the ridiculous warning that we’ll have “no economic activity” the day after a clean break Brexit.These bizarre forecasts show the arrogance of those who rise to the top of the European tree.They genuinely believe that without their flag, their bureaucracy and their anthem that the continent will just fall apart.And it reveals their motives in the Brexit negotiations. To punish us, and send a message to anybody thinking of heading for the exit door – no matter how disastrous it is for the European economy.How are we supposed to negotiate in good faith? They can barely conceal their hope that the UK is going to slip into anarchy.The Government must continue to plan for a clean break. And treat everything Brussels says with not so much a pinch but a whole bucketload of salt.Meanwhile, for all their cocksure bravado, the EU is in all sorts of trouble.Unelected bosses in Brussels are in open warfare with the elected leaders of Poland and Hungary and are now fixing for a fight with Italy, too.Even the EU’s so-called ‘triumph’ in Greece will ring hollow to the 40% of youngsters there who are still out of work.Some ardent Remainers at home are still hoping that Britain might change its mind on leaving.But Brussels keeps proving that we’re better off out. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But despite this, the pensions are unfunded - meaning the whole bill has to be paid out of general taxation.Government liabilities for all exisitng unfunded pension obligations was a staggering £1.7 trillion in 2017. This is nearly as much as Britain’s official national debt of £1.8 trillion.The Taxpayers’ Alliance has called on ministers to stop raiding private pension pots and start funding public sector pensions to narrow the gap.Total pay in the public sector - including the value of pension contributions and bonuses, is on average 23 per cent higher than the private sector for comparable workers.Taxpayers’ Alliance boss John O’Connell blasted: “Workers in the private sector are paying for their public sector counterparts to enjoy a retirement they can only dream of, and that disparity has been brutally compounded over the years by politicians continuously launching raids on private pensions.“What’s more, pension promises made to public sector workers are unfunded and will continue to be paid out of general taxation - that is unsustainable as people are living a lot longer than when these schemes were cooked up.“To stop kicking the can down the road, reforms must ensure that new public sector pensions are properly funded and not paid for by the taxpayers of the future, namely our children and grandchildren.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Negotiations would be made more difficult if the EU takes a hard line in the event of a fractious no-deal Brexit, it adds.There are also three “reasons for optimism” that the worst-case scenario would not be realised, it found.The UK is a world leader in aviation, which means it has “plenty of leverage” as the largest market in Europe and the third largest in the world.The report also says there are strong mutual interests in a beneficial arrangement: “Grounding UK airlines would be hugely damaging for the EU economy, particularly in areas like tourism.“And, of course, foreign airlines presumably want to continue to fly to and from the UK as well.“Since these agreements are reciprocal, it is unlikely that other countries would deny the UK the most important rights when they would then almost certainly lose them too.”It continues: “Third, even if this is left to the last moment, there are several quick fixes.“In particular, the UK and EU [or a third country like the US] could agree at least a temporary extension of the current arrangements by something as simple as a memorandum of understanding.“The key question for the EU is whether the necessity of keeping planes flying outweighs any threats to the integrity of the single market or the risks of giving the UK special treatment - the answer must surely be ‘yes’.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The former PM was seen accompanied by 10 security guards on his day out at Polzeath. His personal protection officers wore bum bags and arrived behind his Range Rover in a motorcade. An onlooker told how he seemed keen to strike a pose for a photographer, and he was pictured with his thumbs up. Mr Cameron, 51, was seen taking a dip with his children - but without wife Samantha, 47. He owns a \u0026pound2million holiday home in the village of Trebetherick - less than a mile from the beach.  An onlooker said: “Mr Cameron had loads of politan Police Personal protection officers with him on the beach - they must be paid a fortune to look after him. “There was 10 of them and they arrived in a motorcade of some sort which is unusual as he was just going to the beach. “Mr Cameron was really keen to strike a pose for a photographer. “He seemed like a very happy chappy after he just vacated the water at the beach alongside his children but Samantha was not present.”  David Cameron set up a pet project for teenagers which has swallowed hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayers’ cash with only a small take-up by youngsters, town hall chiefs have previously warned. Council leaders launched a bid for a slice of the funding pumped into the National Citizen Service, which the former Prime Minister has boasted was “one of my proudest achievements”. He hoped it would become “a rite of passage” for 16 and 17-year-olds.

The BHA said a hard Brexit would also threaten the Tripartite Agreement that allows horses to move between the UK, France and Ireland with minimum paperwork. Ross Hamilton of the BHA said: “If the Government chose to immediately put up borders and tariffs, then it would make it extremely difficult for thoroughbreds to move.  He said of the March 2019 Brexit deadline: “It would only be about a month ahead of the Grand National, which would be quite an impact, a threat to Irish horses’ participation.” Since 1999, eight Irish-trained horses have won the Aintree race, including Tiger Roll this year.

Thousands have demanded cash from the controversial payday loans firm over astronomical interest rates. Wonga had charged up to 5,853% before being ordered to stop. Labour’s Meg Hillier said: “There will not be many tears if Wonga goes.” The firm, which lends to the needy, said it was “assessing all options”. Wonga could call in administrators this week as it buckles under a flood of customer compensation claims, it was reported tonight. Tens of thousands of people are seeking payouts after getting loans that dragged them further into debt.  The Financial Conduct Authority imposed a cap on payday lending charges in 2014 and ordered firms to make amends to borrowers charged sky-high rates on short-term loans. But the Mirror revealed recently millions of pounds in payouts has yet to be claimed with lenders such as Wonga accused of dragging their heels on paying back customers. An FCA investigation found between 2008 and 2010 Wonga sent threatening letters to customers in arrears from non-existent law firms. At one point the firm was charging an annual percentage interest rate of up to 5,853%. But it is on the brink of collapse, despite raising \u0026pound10million from shareholders in a bid to stay afloat. Labour’s Stella Creasy, who has led a campaign against payday lenders, said: “Wonga’s demise shows these businesses were built on exploiting cash-strapped Brits and why \u0026shyregulation was needed to protect them.” Vincent Vernon of Pay Day Refunds has said it is handling 32,000 customer claims, a quarter of them from Wonga. He added: “There could be in excess of a million customers who have suffered from \u0026shyirresponsible lending and are owed money. Three of the poorest- responding lenders are Wonga, Curo and Quick Quid. They are continuing to ignore UK consumer rights. They’re fast to lend and extremely slow to repay.”  Labour MP Meg Hillier added: “There will not be many tears shed if Wonga goes.” The FCA cap on interest rates sparked a decline in the fortunes of the once profitable business which employs 500 staff. In 2015 its losses more than doubled to \u0026pound80.2million and it made a loss of \u0026pound65million the following year. Wonga is reported to have been in talks with the FCA to discuss the company’s options and could appoint Grant Thornton as administrators. If it goes bust, customers owed cash will be covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. The FCA refused to comment.  The lender said: “Wonga recently raised \u0026pound10million from shareholders to address the \u0026shysignificant increase in legacy loan complaints. The number of complaints related to loans taken out before the current management team joined in 2014 has accelerated. “The Wonga Board continues to assess all options regarding the future of the Group and its entities.” Wonga was founded in 2006 by South African businessman Errol Damelin. Its adverts feature “cuddly” puppets of elderly people. It once sponsored Newcastle United shirts. Britain’s biggest payday lender, in 2012 it made four million loans to more than one million customers. Good riddance, says friend of \u0027victim\u0027  By Matthew Young  The best pal of a teenager who killed himself when Wonga emptied his bank account has welcomed news the payday loan firm is likely to go out of business. Kane Sparham-Price, 18, was left penniless when the firm withdrew cash in 2013 under a lawful debt agreement. He took his own life that day. Speaking to the Mirror tonight, pal Stefan Williams, 23, said: “Thank God it’s looking like it will go bust.

Snoozing in their bedroom lies Chitty, the first dog the pair ever adopted when they arrived in the country 10 years ago, and Polly, a feisty pup with just one eye.   Chitty and Polly soon join the couple’s other 96 dogs in the garden for breakfast. Some of the disabled ones need feeding individually to make sure they eat properly, and then there’s Joey, the Doberman, who is the couple’s biggest dog and requires one extra meal per day. After brekkie it’s nap time.  \u0027It’s so humid, the dogs spend most of the day snoozing in the shade, says Mary.   While this might not sound like everybody’s cup of tea, Mary couldn’t be happier.  Steve and I met in a pub when I was 26. I beat him in a game of pool and we clicked, explains Mary.  We built a life together. I worked in HR, Steve, now 59, was in manufacturing. We owned our own home in Bradford. We weren’t stinking rich, but 10 years ago we were comfortable enough to take a risk. We decided to go for early retirement and explore the world while we were still young enough to enjoy it.  A friend suggested they start their adventure in Kerala, India, home of palm tree-lined beaches overlooking the Arabian Sea. The pair rented out their home, sold most of their belongings on eBay and gave everything else to friends, family and charity shops. Then, in March 2008, they bought a two-week package holiday and jetted off.  While there we volunteered at an animal sanctuary and we fell in love with Chitty and Legsy, two puppies that had been found on the street. says Mary.  They’d wait for us to arrive each day and we couldn’t bring ourselves to leave them. The big move  So instead of leaving Kerala after the two weeks, Mary and Steve made the huge decision to stay put, checking out of their hotel and renting acommodation so they could take Chitty and Legsy home with them.  In those first few weeks we realised Kerala had a big problem with street dogs, explains Mary.   People here don’t treat dogs with the same affection we do. It’s not uncommon to throw stones at them. One of our dogs, Podge, came to us after her previous owner tied her back legs with wire, simply because she used to gnaw furniture. Shocked by what they saw, Mary and Steve started feeding the street dogs, and they hired a rickshaw with a driver to carry the food. The driver, Kukku, would slam on the brakes and dive into bushes, returning with a stricken dog he’d spotted.  We were kindred spirits, smiles Mary. In the dog house After four years, the dog lovers had adopted so many street dogs that they now shared their home with 40 rescues, and they decided to upsize.  Our new house is actually smaller, but the outdoor area is five times bigger, which means we could help more dogs, says Mary.  I never wanted kids, which baffled the locals. They thought there must be something wrong with me and asked if I’d been to hospital! It was soon after this that Mary and Steve set up a rescue centre called Street Dog Watch, and asked Kukku, their driver, to be clinic manager.  We realised we couldn’t keep taking in dogs without trying to get to the root of the problem, says Mary.  While it’s illegal to kill strays in Kerala, the fine is 50 rupees, which equates to 50p.  It’s not enforced anyway, says Mary. Before every tourist season, a barbaric culling programme would begin, with dead  dogs all over the streets. Locals put out poison too.   So Mary introduced the Animal Birth Control (ABC) programme, spaying and neutering street dogs, and giving them an anti-rabies vaccination.  PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) calculates that by sterilising 2,000 dogs, the ABC programme could have prevented the birth of over 60 million street dogs over the years.  The figure is staggering. It’s better that 60 million dogs never lived, than lived a life of suffering, says Mary. Four years ago, the couple sold their UK home to help fund their projects.  We’ve spent over \u0026pound300,000 of our own money, but it still doesn’t cover all our costs. Lots of animal lovers, both locally and in the UK, sponsor dogs or donate money. It costs \u0026pound15 to sterilise a street dog and \u0026pound25 to feed our dogs each day. All of Mary’s dogs are either injured street dogs or puppies found abandoned. They all have names too. Joey doesn’t like going outside, Podge is lazy, and Iolo was thrown over the clinic wall in a plastic bag. While he’s one of the smallest dogs, he’s also the most confident. Saving lives  Street Dog Watch continues to rescue, feed, vaccinate and sterilise. Healthy dogs are returned to the street or adopted, although locals only adopt males, thought to be better guard dogs.  Mary says, We have 89 females. Our five males can’t guard for toffee! They hide behind our legs.   People abroad often want to adopt the dogs, but Mary doesn’t recommend this.  It’s traumatic for a dog to travel a great distance and can cost \u0026pound5,000, she explains.  I encourage Brits to sponsor or donate towards our vaccination and feeding programmes instead. Better to adopt a dog already in the UK – there are plenty in need.  Mary is also in talks with the local government to agree funding for the ABC and anti-rabies programme. She has met with local authorities to dissuade them from a plan to build a cage in the forest to throw street dogs in.  They hadn’t thought about how they’d feed them, or what they’d do when they started breeding. I convinced them it was a terrible idea, explains Mary.  Mary and Steve’s retirement pot is dwindling, but the couple are happy to live frugally.  Our crockery is cracked and I rely on hand-me-downs from friends. I wear dresses until I wear them out then shred and plait them into dog toys. Old clothes also make great bedding and bandages, says Mary.  We don’t go out much – you can’t when you have 98 dogs! I don’t like to spend on myself when I know how much further money can go for the dogs.

But wait, it\u0027s not over yet, we\u0027ve got one last bank holiday to go and it\u0027s really worth being prepared for it. By this point, we\u0027ve all had enough of cowering from the heatwave sun so the end-of-summer cooldown is most welcome. That means it’s the ideal time to get out and enjoy some activities. Below we\u0027ve pulled together some great ideas for making the most out of the last bank holiday before Christmas... Get out on a family cycling adventure  If you\u0027ve been putting off taking the kids out to practise cycling, this last bank holiday is the ideal time to get out for a ride. Head out to some quiet woodland, or check out the Halfords widget below to find your nearest cycling route.   If you want to head further afield, then don\u0027t forget that it\u0027s easy enough to add a bike rack to your car.  The Thule ProRide 591 Roof Mount Bike Carrier (above) is \u0026pound75 (save \u0026pound35) and useful because you can add more than one to a roof rack - making it perfect for growing families. Halfords also sell a wide range of roof racks - and will fit them for you too. Enjoy a camping trip to Scotland  One of the great things about Scotland - aside from the stunning countryside - is freedom to roam. It means camping is allowed on public, unenclosed, land for no more than two or three nights. Your other option is to visit one of the many existing campsites across the country, such as at Loch Lomond (try Ardlui), Loch Ness (consider Borlum), or one of the many along the coast (check out Clachtoll Beach Campsite at Sutherland).  For camping, we suggest the Halfords 4 Person Double Skin Tent (above) which is now just \u0026pound40, save \u0026pound60, and takes just 15 minutes to pitch. If you\u0027re driving with all your camping gear, you\u0027ll also want to consider boot space.  It\u0027s surprising how much stuff you need to take the kids away for a couple of nights and you don\u0027t want to be uncomfortable in the car.  For added space, grab the Exodus 470L Black Roof Box Fully Fitted Bundle (above) from Halfords. It\u0027s \u0026pound389 (save \u0026pound98) and includes the fitting and a roof rack suitable for your car. Find the perfect spot for a picnic  Take a picnic out with you and you\u0027ll have everything you need for a great day out. You could even pack the Halfords Portable Gas Stove (below), which is now \u0026pound8 (save \u0026pound12). But don\u0027t forget to pick up the correct Campingaz CP250 (A4) Gas Cartridge to go with it - these are just \u0026pound2 each or four for \u0026pound5.  Just make sure you\u0027re allowed to cook at your destination – many beaches only allow barbeques and small stoves after most people have gone home. It\u0027s well worth checking with the local council if you\u0027re not sure. Go on a great road trip!  A day trip or staycation break by road could be perfect for your family. Avoid queues by bagging a handy sat nav - which will also keep you on route and give you a pretty reliable answer to the \u0027are we there yet?\u0027 question. The Garmin Drive Sat Nav (below) - priced \u0026pound89.99 (save \u0026pound10) comes with lifetime map updates so you\u0027re never going to find yourself driving down a newly-closed street or down a disused road.  Also be sure to check your car is in good shape before heading out as there\u0027s nothing worse than planning a great bank holiday trip only to be thwarted by vehicle trouble. There are some simple things to keep an eye out for. Firstly, how is your car battery doing? Telltale signs that something is wrong include trouble starting the engine and lights that are dim when the engine isn\u0027t running - simple enough to check when you\u0027re parked up. Also, be wary that the hot summer months have a big impact on your car battery.

Kay Longstaff’s partner, Craig Rayment, 43, had his assets frozen by Spanish authorities as they sent him notice of a tax debt, it is reported.  Banks have reportedly been warned not to lend Mr Rayment, who runs a business for Brits in Costa del Sol, any more money because of his allegedly poor credit rating.  Mr Rayment, an electrician, was reportedly given a fortnight to settle his finances. It is unclear whether he has managed to yet or not, according to The Sun .  The news comes recently after it emerged Ms Longstaff, 46, who had claimed she had accidentally fallen off the deck of the Norwegian Star, had actually purposely lunged into the Adriatic Sea, according to investigators.  Ms Longstaff had told Croatian TV in the aftermath of the ordeal last Saturday night that she had fallen accidentally and her yoga had given her the skills to resist as she waited for rescue teams to fish her out. But according to Italian and Croatian authorities, the woman voluntarily went overboard as she did so in a determined fashion. However, what caused her to jump remains unknown. CCTV images show the air hostess was alone when she went overboard at 11.45pm on August 18. Mr Rayment was reportedly in bed when the incident unfolded and did not report her missing until 2am.

Birmingham Live reporter Stephanie Balloo decided to find out exactly what the family holiday camp is really like. During her trip, she found chewing-gum trodden into the carpet and saw dirty towels and empty crates of booze dumped in the entrance at the Brean Sands holiday park in Somerset. The choking stench of stale cigarettes filled an apartment and the toilet seat had been left broken with razor-sharp edges. It transpired a major mix up by staff meant she was given the spare key to a family\u0027s occupied flat, exposing all their belongings. One horrified dad she spoke to revealed images of what he believed to be \u0027human faeces\u0027 smeared on his paid-for bedding. Another told how their child had cut their feet on loose tiles in the swimming pool. Stephanie kept a detailed account of her short stay - here is her diary...  3.30pm: Popular destination with Midlands families The taxi driver tells me that Pontins Brean Sands is a popular camp with families from the Midlands. 3.55pm - Surrounded by caravan parks Driving through it seems there are plenty of other options for holidaymakers wanting to enjoy Brean Sands beach. The camp is surrounded by a number of caravan parks. I arrive at Pontins Brean Sands in a taxi and give my details to security who hand me a form to fill out. 4pm - Musty smell in chaotic arcade As I opened the door to what I imagined was a quiet reception desk, I was immediately plunged into chaos. Dozens of arcade machines all ringing simultaneously, children racing around and a musty lingering smell like an old-fashioned pub. One staff member mans the entire reception and I join the queue of around seven families - all waiting to check-in to their rooms as key collection starts from 4pm. The arcade carpet is stained with filth and blobs of chewing-gum are trodden into the disgusting flooring at reception.  4.25pm - Friendly staff The young receptionist is polite and friendly enough - calling me \u0027babes\u0027 and handing me a map with the route to my apartment. She also explains how I\u0027ll have to put at least \u0026pound5 of electricity into the meter on top of the \u0026pound139 I paid for two nights in a one-bed apartment. There is no Wifi apart from in the main building, I discover. I was directed to the fun factory to find out what entertainment the night had in store for me. Surprisingly, it seems quite an extensive list, despite previous complaints from families there is nothing for the kids. Though judging by the week\u0027s schedule, the entertainment is largely the same every night, with a Pontins character kicking off the evening, different Blue Coats performing and a disco to finish.  4.40pm - Cigarette butts and litter Walking through the holiday park to my allocated apartment I realise the reception isn\u0027t the only filthy area. Cigarette butts and rubbish is dumped all over the park - especially near the benches outside the main entrance. En route to my accommodation, I passed a neglected skate park, a strangely quiet adventure play area and a Nisa Local. The grassy areas around the play parks - dotted within the accommodation - were littered with discarded cigarettes as well.  4.45pm - \u0027Sick\u0027 on the steps I\u0027m first greeted to my apartment block with the sight of what appears to be someone\u0027s vomit. I try to dodge this as I haul my suitcase up the steps. But nothing could prepare me for what I was about to experience.  4.46pm - Horrifying scenes at my apartment A full to the brim bin, burnt trodden-in popcorn and two damp towels - one strewn across the filthy corridor floor and another hung up on the rail. There was a empty crate of beer abandoned and a mug full of cigarettes and ash dumped on the floor outside too. And this was just the exterior of my allocated apartment. I was horrified but despite everything I\u0027ve heard about Pontins, I thought surely this can\u0027t be right. But from the window I thought someone had genuinely left my room in this state, so I double checked the door - number 60. And double checked my documents - number 60.  4.48pm - Spare key to somebody\u0027s apartment To my surprise the key worked, but as I tried to enter, a rubbish bag full of half-eaten food and cans erupted and spilled out - blocking the entrance. A blast of stale cigarette smoke hit me and I begged internally to escape this hell. Inside, soiled underwear appeared stuck to the floor, sausages in thick grease on the oven and a bowl of what I can only describe as green slime. I spotted a mobile phone and pairs of shoes and realised Pontins staff had made a very worrying mistake.  4.54pm - Displeased neighbour The guest next door tells me the people in number 60 have been staying there for days and have just popped out for the day. It begs the question, why was the apartment all set for me to check-in? Nevertheless, the neighbour doesn’t seem surprised and tells me lots of families have had problems. They’ve lost the plot running this place, she says, as she explains how her room had no running water and a broken TV. She adds that her fire alarm keeps going off too. 5pm - Room mix-up not \u0027uncommon\u0027 When complaining to reception about my apartment, the formerly chirpy lady now seems inconvenienced and replies agh okay before calling the manager. She explains that there is two sets of keys and suggests the family should have checked out. What may have happened was they were meant to have booked out but obviously the system hasn\u0027t updated that they\u0027ve booked an extra night or something like that. It doesn\u0027t happen too often. It\u0027s just that crossover - it has happened before though. She is unapologetic for the inconvenience caused, as is the manager - who says somebody had gone into a room they shouldn\u0027t have been in. He claims he was off to find out who they were and sort the situation. 5.10pm - New apartment damp and reeks of smoke I get my keys to the new apartment, no 61, and it is relatively clean save for the broken toilet seat with the sharp edges. The harsh smell of smoke makes me choke slightly as I enter and there\u0027s dripping damp all over the ceiling too. A bucket has been placed underneath to collect the condensation. Small yellow blobs stick to the inside of the bath, though I\u0027m unsure what these are.  5.31pm - Faulty smoke alarms sounding The smoke alarm has randomly started ringing and refuses to stop even though there is no smoke present. There\u0027s no way to turn it off and fifteen minutes later it is still sounding. I think it is time to get out of the room. But as I leave, I realise it is the whole block and guests are furious. They say it has been going off constantly all week in the entire block every time anyone tries to cook for their children. They claim Pontins staff have not done anything to resolve the situation. 5.45pm - Furious guest says \u0027never again\u0027 Reacting to the fire alarm issue, a guest staying in my block says it\u0027s the first time I\u0027ve ever been here and the last time too. Another guest says there was no water to bath his children and he entered the apartment to find other people\u0027s food still in the fridge. 6pm - Hidden costs Dozens of families have flocked to the fun factory as the evening entertainment kick starts with a paparazzi session with Chuckles the monkey. The bluecoats are admittedly very enthusiastic and seem to excite the children. There are huge queues of families waiting to see the favourable monkey mascot, but these extras for the kids all cost more money. It costs \u0026pound5 for the children to have a photo with the monkey while outdated cheesy 80s music plays in the background. 6.30pm - Litter-plagued leisure area There is litter everywhere and young kids are running around without a parent nearby. Towards the rear there’s an \u0027inflatable zone\u0027 consisting of just two pieces of equipment, but the kids seem to be enjoying it. In the leisure zone there seems to be plenty to do, with go karting, paddle karts, a play area with swings, an \u0027urban gym\u0027, a skate park, trampolining and the pool. However, all of which is outdated and will cost more money in the form of tokens purchased from the leisure centre.  7pm - Pleasant beach nearby Brean Sands is just a three minute walk and is perhaps one of the few selling points for the camp. The long stretch of beach is soft and clean, perfect for young children staying in the nearby Pontins.  7.20pm - Buffet on dirty plates The evening meal at the Queen Victoria pub for those who opt for self-catering is \u0026pound8.95 and consists of some salad, grated cheese, \u0027vegetable pie\u0027, cod fish cake and chips. There\u0027s also some sliced potato with \u0027mince-meat\u0027 underneath. Some of the plates have spots of food from previous meals clinging on and the food smells are a bit overwhelming. There\u0027s food squashed into carpet and on the floor and the dessert fridges are a mess. I force a little bit of food down but it is largely tasteless just like the squash which misleadingly brands itself as 100% juice.  7.35pm - Dirty fridges Dirty fridges full of bashed up bits of cake is the offer for dessert. Crumbs of pudding spill out from the fridges and onto the floor - ready to get squashed like everything else on the food hall floor. Though admittedly what was left of the pudding was surprisingly tasty.  8pm - Bluecoat entertainers The fun factory is packed out with hundreds of parents, young babies, toddlers and even teenagers. The blue coat entertainers are up on stage and encouraging the kids and parents alike to be silly - including dancing around like various animals and being soaked with a water gun. Chuckles the monkey comes out on stage and pantomime style jokes are made, leaving the children in fits of giggles. Everyone seems to be having a great time - especially the children.  8.30pm - Staff selling toys During the performance, Pontins staff try to squeeze more money out of the guests by offering light up batons to the kids for a set price. There is also a shop at the front selling Pontins branded toys and another store at the side of the main hall. 9pm - Non-stop evening entertainment The entertainment is non-stop and as soon as \u0027party time with Chuckles\u0027 ends, the children are up on their feet once more dancing to classic school disco songs. The jam-packed line up is great to see and clearly has most people enjoying themselves. 9.15pm - Scantily-clad dancers as children watch With the children still present, the parents continue to drink and the adult entertainment begins. Female dancers in crop tops dance around the stage and sing loud rock songs in the \u0027I wanna rock\u0027 show. As the concert gets underway, the Blue Coats dance seductively as rows of children sit looking up at them.  9.35pm - Bouncers on patrol There are four bouncers currently manning the bar area and entrance for the fun factory. 9.45pm - Young children play while parents drink Children as young as around six play in the parks outside the apartment blocks with no parental supervision in the pitch black as adults continue to drink inside the main hall. 10.30pm - Chaos as fire alarm clears hall Families cling onto each other and ask whether they have all their belongings as they are evacuated from the building. All the while the children are screaming about their abandoned slush puppies and toys. Everyone is told to move away from the building after what seemed like a serious fire. However, it is believed a drunken guest had smashed the fire alarm.  11pm - Doors banging, kids screaming As I try to sleep, the bass from the main hall can be heard among children screaming and doors slamming shut. I\u0027ve brought my own sleeping bag after hearing horror stories of blood-stained mattresses and filthy linen. Every breath I take I am inhaling more and more of the lingering second-hand smoke which clings to the walls, furniture and very atmosphere of the musty apartment. 3am - Parents squabbling with children I was awoken to the sound of what I thought was a fight kicking off outside my apartment. As I looked out into the corridor, parents were arguing loudly with their children in the doorway to their room. The row lasted around an hour before they eventually returned to their rooms. 4.10am - Screaming girl The sleepless night in hell continues as I\u0027m woken by the short sharp scream of a young girl. It seems to have come from near the squabbling, restless family - who to my annoyance refuse to sleep. 8.45am - Average breakfast The Queen Victoria is fairly quiet and there seems to be no staff in sight. It is a buffet again, which is all the camp offers in terms of cooked food. Segments of oranges, a fruit cocktail, toast, cereal or the main fry up in silver trays are the options available. But the sausages are spotted with transparent blobs of fat which are chewy to eat. Nothing tastes fresh, and it is fairly average.  10.15am - Huge queues for swimming pool Around 50 families are queuing for the swimming pool and have been for more than an hour with their children in just swimwear and a towel. One frustrated child - who clearly doesn\u0027t understand time yet - says why are they not open yet, it\u0027s stupid. The families are forced to wait a total of an hour and a half to be let into the swimming pool for their turn. The long wait was due to no lifeguards being present at the pool. 10.30am - Rammed pool The pool is rammed full of parents and children - each with around two square metres to swim and play and yet more are piling in. It has a capacity of 120 people, which is far too many for the size of the pool, in my opinion. The much-anticipated Flume feature of the pool is out of action due to a technical fault.  11.30am - Child cuts foot on broken pool tile A young child is hopping around in her swimming costume and towel with toilet paper wrapped round a bloody foot. Her father claims she had cut her foot on a broken, loose tile at the bottom of the pool. In images it appears many of the tiles on the bottom of the pool are either dirty or missing.  11.45am - \u0027Faeces\u0027 smothered on duvet I speak to another unhappy guest who is disgusted by his experience at Pontins. He shows me images of what he claims are human faeces on a duvet supplied by Pontins for a sum of \u0026pound8. Their mattress, he reports, also had smears of poo all over it. The family, who have come from Cardiff, claim they waited from 4pm until 11pm at night for clean bed linen for their children to finally go to sleep in. He says 99.9 per cent of people are unhappy here and have complained too.  12pm - Claims of mice and second pool injury Another family, living at the other side of the park in the chalets, claim mice have chewed through the furniture in their room. While a third family say their child lifted one of the loose tiles above his head in the swimming pool after cutting his foot on it. 1pm - Haven is the Ritz compared to this A pair of unhappy mums - who brought their kids down together - explain how they had bought bleach to clean their chalet themselves. We got bleach flash, wipes, everything to clean as the smell was like rot, damp, festering bodies. We had a conversation last night saying overall there\u0027s plenty for the children to do, entertainment\u0027s fine, but the smell of cigarettes was disgusting. We\u0027ve stayed in a lot of holiday parks, Butlins, Haven and this is the worst. Haven is like the Ritz compared to this. 2pm - Same activities, different day On the surface, there seems to be plenty of activities for the children and the whole family in the day time including Curling, Cine Racing, a Disco Bingo and photo opportunities with Pontins characters. However, when dissected this is nearly exactly the same as yesterday\u0027s daytime entertainment. And most of which needs to be paid for on-top of the accommodation price. When speaking with families at the end of my stay, many say there is not much to do for the kids in the day - and every day is the same.

The nurse from Leicester Royal Infirmary took it upon herself to usher patients to safety as a man ran through the waiting room with a weapon in January. She then approached knifeman Yusuf Aka before security guards tackled him to the ground. Despite going above and beyond her duty, Caroline has said that she was just doing her job.  Speaking for the first time about the horrifying incident, she said to the Mail on Sunday : When you sit at that desk you don’t know what’s going to come in, you get everything.  You just take it in your stride. It’s only afterwards you think, oh crikey. It doesn’t bear thinking about what might have happened.  The chilling CCTV footage was only revealed to the public once the 22-year-old was convicted last week. It shows how he stabbed a man in the back in a random attack and then began to tear apart the waiting room at the hospital. Caroline, who had been working a night shift on January 16 was assessing patients waiting to be seen as Aka walked in, wielding an eight-inch knife. Dressed in a hooded jumper and sunglasses he had walked up to the front of the building and stabbed a man in the back with the hunting knife.  As soon as he walked into the waiting room he threw his weapon at a member of staff and then launched a computer across the room. In the chaos of Aka grabbing pieces of hospital equipment to throw, Caroline tried to ring security. But she realised that she needed to act fast in order to protect the patients. She shouted Everybody out, go! and lead them to the room where security guards were based.

Jordan Payne, 23, was horrified to discover that he had the suprasellar germ brain tumour, where testicular cancer cells grow in the brain\u0027s pituitary gland. The piling operative from Ripley, Derbyshire, was hit by rubble after a pipe he was working on ruptured. His helmet was struck by a piece of debris but he walked away unscalthed. But little did he know that this was the beginning of the growth of the cancerous mass the size of a golf ball that was growing under his skull.  Shortly after the incident on site, his girlfriend at the time began to notice dramatic changes in Jordan\u0027s personality. He began to forget peoples names and appeared lethargic, - prompting his family to encourage him to have a CT scan. After the scan in March 2017, Jordan and his family were given the devastating news of the cancerous mass, which doctors say is the size of a golf ball on his pituitary gland. Jordan\u0027s mum Ellen Payne, 40, said: In the womb the last thing to form are the testicles The seeds to form the testicles travel from the brain to the spine and genitals. In Jordan\u0027s case, not all of the seeds travelled from the brain and remained for years, eventually becoming cancerous. When doctors told us they\u0027d found the tumour, it was just pure shock.  It was the worst day of my life. If he hadn\u0027t have had the accident at work we wouldn\u0027t have found the brain tumour. But it\u0027s just been horrific. It\u0027s changed me, and it\u0027s burned a whole in all our hearts. It\u0027s absolutely devastated us, and we don\u0027t have a choice, we just have to face what\u0027s coming. He\u0027s changed a lot since the accident due to the side effects of the medicine and he\u0027s a lot quieter than he used to be. But he\u0027s still got his amazing sense of humour. I still treat him the same which is how he wants it. Jordan\u0027s scan showed his brain had swelled up, almost covering the whole surface area of his skull. He now also suffers from short term memory loss and epilepsy and is unable to remember most of his ordeal apart from a few fragments.

Now, 100 days on from that spectacular big day, Prince Harry and wife Meghan are embarking on the next stage of their lives together. Monday marks not only a significant milestone but also the countdown to an autumn packed with new engagements and their first major international tour. Dickie Arbiter, former spokesman for the Queen, says: “I think Meghan has been on a tremendous learning curve.” But he added: “It’s another thing entirely getting to grips with everything involved with royal duty.” In three months the couple have celebrated a series of firsts, as the new Duchess of Sussex adapts to life in the global spotlight. She has been welcomed and celebrated by everyone she has met, keen for her to succeed as the latest addition to a family known as The Firm.  However her first steps have been marred by constant insults and abuse from her side of the family, leading to the saga dubbed The Markle Debacle. Meghan, 37, has chosen to remain silent since the very public fallout with her father Thomas Markle. He and the ex-Suits actress have not spoken since her May 19 wedding, after he staged pictures with a paparazzo, for which he was allegedly paid a large fee. He then apparently had a heart attack and pulled out of the wedding, leading to Prince Charles walking Meghan down the aisle and her mum being the only representative of her family by her side.  Since then Meghan, who had wanted to “hit the ground running” with her royal duties, has been a huge success – by Harry’s side at Trooping the Colour, Prince Charles’ birthday celebrations and a mini-tour of Dublin. She wowed crowds with the Queen at her first official joint outing with the monarch, 92. Observers noted fantastic chemistry between them as Her Majesty was pictured laughing and joking with the Duchess. Mr Arbiter adds: “With the Duchess of Sussex being from the US the concept of monarchy is a bit alien, so it’s been a great learning curve she has taken in her stride and managed incredibly well.  “The prime example was when she went to Cheshire with the Queen. “There seemed to be a tremendous rapport between them, a lot of laughter and that would give a clear indication that the Queen is very relaxed in her company and she became relaxed in the Queen’s company. “She and Harry have shown they are getting on incredibly well and always look so fantastically in \u0026shylove. “With experience will come confidence and in the next few months I have no doubt we will see her come out of her shell even more and start to be more vocal for causes and charities she wishes to support.”The two-and-a-half-week autumn tour of Australia, Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand will be a huge test for Meghan but royal sources say that she has been “preparing for months”.  The couple will open the Invictus Games in Sydney on October 20, the event Harry devised in 2014 for injured service personnel. Mr Arbiter calls the tour “the litmus test”. He says: “She’s had a taste of the Invictus Games in Toronto last year but she was Harry’s girlfriend. Now she is his wife there will be much more expectation. “She’s a good communicator, she’s good at talking to people but it will be a real baptism of fire. They will have a very demanding schedule and the Duchess will have to get used to local customs with the eyes of the world on her. But no doubt she will come through with flying colours and they will show they will be a force of good for the Commonwealth and the Royal Family on the global stage.” Before then the couple have several public engagements. Next week they are at a gala West End performance of the musical Hamilton in support of Sentebale, Harry’s charity for young people affected by HIV in Africa.  They then attend the WellChild Awards in London on September 4, and 100 Days To Peace, a music event on September 6 marking the centenary of the end of the First World War. It is thought they will first spend time in Balmoral with the Queen and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge for the start of the Highland Games. Joe Little of Majesty magazine, said: “Everything Meghan is experiencing over the last 100 days and indeed for the first year will be for the first time. “Once she gets to grips with how the royal calendar works she will be more relaxed, but already we’ve seen her take to royal duty very well.

Rachael Kin, 28, was hospitalised for six weeks and had her large bowel removed after contracting ulcerative colitis - an inflammation of the colon. She felt that after the surgery she was judged for her appearance and began to feel isolated, so decided to challenge herself and take part in a beauty contest and be a role model for others with the same condition. Those feelings changed for her when she was announced the winner of the regional contest, and now she prepares to compete in the national leg of the competition. The funeral care worker said: I want to be the first contestant with a colostomy and hope to inspire anybody struggling with body confidence issues.  If I can help to prevent one person from going through what I did mentally then that for me is the real crown. Rachael, from High Wycombe, Bucks, was training for the London Marathon when she was rushed to hospital in July last year, leaving her nine-year-old daughter Maja in the care of her family. She said: I went from being fiercely independent to totally vulnerable. I couldn\u0027t walk unaided, couldn\u0027t brush my teeth, or have a shower independently. The IV steroids made my body unrecognisable and I lost all confidence. The former lingerie model said she didn\u0027t know anyone her own age who had an ileostomy, where a hole in the stomach is made to divert waste from the intestine into a special bag. Racheal said: I\u0027d lie awake at night questioning myself. Could I wear the same clothes, could I eat the same food, could I swim in a bikini, would I ever model again? The mother-of-one, who volunteers for a food bank charity, said she experienced discrimination, including from an acupuncturist who refused to treat her because it wasn\u0027t hygienic.  She added: My partner of four years struggled to accept what had happened, and discouraged me from embracing the change, seeing my ileostomy as something that should be kept private. It was heartbreaking to watch my relationship come to an end. My mental health deteriorated rapidly, and from a once confident young woman, I found myself hiding away from the world outside.

As it becomes easier than ever before to get something within days - or even hours - of making a purchase, more than one in five admit they want instant gratification. One in 10 would expect an online order to arrive no later than the next day with some impatient shoppers not happy unless they can get what they want that same day they buy it. Just two per cent expect to wait longer than a week for an online order to arrive. And the survey of 2,000 adults attributes this increased impatience to online shopping (78 per cent) and the influence of social media (70 per cent).  Holidays, cars and clothing are among the top three items Brits find it hardest to wait for. Consumers now commonly expect food shopping within an hour, clothes and furniture by the next day, and tailored goods such as cars within a week. One in five adults would not wait for longer than a week for a new car to be shipped to them, and almost half would expect it within a fortnight. Stuart Foulds, Chairman and Chief Executive of TrustFord, said: “The always-connected nature of today’s world means we expect to get things done much faster. ‘Now’ is the new normal and this has caused an unprecedented shift in the retail landscape. “Our research casts doubt over Britain’s age-old reputation as a nation happy to wait in line. “The automotive industry must adapt to work at the pace modern consumers demand. That’s why we’re leading the way by delivering on Britain’s call for speed and convenience with the launch of TrustFord NOW.”  Almost a third also think companies should reply to social media comments within the hour while six in 10 watch TV on demand so they don’t need to wait for it to be aired. The average adult will also only wait for an average of 11 minutes in a queue before giving up and walking off. And 76 per cent of adults think this ‘want it now’ culture is showing a creeping influence on many Brits – with those aged 55 or older most likely to believe it. A third of the population now describe themselves as ‘particularly impatient’. It also emerged many also aren’t prepared to wait to save up for something they want. If an expensive and desirable item comes up, only half of the nation will save up for months – or years if necessary – to buy it.

The Vatican estimated that 300,000 pilgrims braved the rain for the religious event at the World Meeting of Families closing mass. Pope Francis was driven in a Popemobile as well-wishers waved flags, cheered and reached out to touch the pontiff. After the event the Pope met with Irish bishops before he was met by Minister for Defence and Leader of Fine Gael Taoiseach Leo Varadkar at Dublin Airport ahead of his departure back to Rome. Many visitors at Phoenix Park said despite the weather and the long walk they wanted to show young people that faith is strong in Ireland, and to set an example for younger generations.   Pope shares feelings of pain and shame at failure of church authorities to tackle clerical abuse in Ireland  Led by a 3,000 strong choir, the crowds joined in song after the Pope completed his lengthy journey through the congregation. All focus then turned to an altar below a huge white Papal Cross, as the pontiff - wearing a specially designed green vestment - began conducting religious proceedings. Addressing the crowd, the Pope referred to his meeting with eight survivors on Saturday evening and said he wanted to take up what they had said to him and seek forgiveness. He listed a litany of different types of abuse and mistreatment inflicted on Irish people by church figures, including industrial laundries and clerical cover-ups of sex crimes. On each occasion he asked for forgiveness.  The crowd applauded each time. We ask forgiveness for the abuses in Ireland, abuses of power, of conscience, and sexual abuses perpetrated by members with roles of responsibility in the church, he said. In a special way, we ask pardon for all the abuses committed in various types of institutions run by males or female religious and by other members of the church, and we ask for forgiveness for those cases of manual work that so many young women and men were subjected to. We ask forgiveness. The Pope continued: We ask forgiveness for the times that, as a church, we did not show the survivors of whatever kind of abuse the compassion and the seeking of justice and truth through concrete actions. We ask for forgiveness.  He gave his speech after the first day of his historic visit to Ireland was dominated by the bitter legacy of historical scandals linked to church abuse and mistreatment. While the Pope conducted his service, Belfast singer Brian Kennedy performed the John Lennon classic Imagine at the Stand for Truth rally in Dublin. Before a crowd of thousands, Kennedy revealed he had written a new verse for the song - which he said he was singing in the direction of the Phoenix Park. The new verse began: Imagine there\u0027s no paedophiles, I wonder if you can. No need to rape or vilify, all of these thousands can. A large crowd had also gathered for a silent vigil in Co Galway, organised by a Manchester woman whose sister vanished from a mother and baby home, is taking place in Tuam. More than 100 people assembled at the Town Hall and planned to walk the 30-minute route to the former site of the Tuam Mother and Baby Home. The Say Nope To The Pope campaign, which includes survivors of clerical abuse, also gave emotional accounts of their lives.  Youth worker Orlagh McGlade travelled to the papal mass from South Armagh along with friends, both religious and secular. I was struck by the amount of young people who are here, it\u0027s great to see, the 23-year-old said. It\u0027s just unreal to see everyone coming together, and sometimes you think the faith in Ireland has been lost but when you see everyone here today its clear the faith is still alive and well. The Mass was the concluding showpiece of the World Meeting of Families (WMOF) - a church-run event focused on promoting family values. Following the event he left for a meeting with Irish bishops ahead of his flight back to Rome a little later. During his meeting with the Bishops, the Pope noted that the scandals had also caused hurt and discouragement to current members of the priesthood. The Pope said that was often ignored or underestimated. He said: A recurrent theme of my visit, of course, has been the Church\u0027s need to acknowledge and remedy, with evangelical honesty and courage, past failures with regard to the protection of children and vulnerable adults.  He said the bishops had resolutely moved forward with steps to better safeguard children within the Church. In these years, all of us have had our eyes opened to the gravity and extent of sexual abuse in various social settings, he added. In Ireland, as elsewhere, the honesty and integrity with which the Church chooses to confront this painful chapter of her history can offer an example and a warning to society as a whole. Earlier Pope Francis prayed for victims of abuse left scarred by painful memories during a visit to the holy Knock Shrine. During his speech he said no-one could be failed to be moved by stories of young abuse victims who were robbed of their innocence. The pontiff added: This open wound challenges us to be firm and decisive in the pursuit of truth and justice. I beg the Lord\u0027s forgiveness for these sins and for the scandal and betrayal felt by so many others in God\u0027s family.  I ask our Blessed Mother to intercede for the healing of the survivors and to confirm every member of our Christian family in the resolve never again to permit these situations to occur. Thousands of supporters waved flags for the Pope as he arrived at the famous shrine in Co Mayo on the second day of his Ireland visit. Well wishers cheered for him in his Popemobile as he toured through crowds of pilgrims gathered in the torrential rain. Pope Francis then entered the chapel at the shrine site for a period of silent prayer before addressing the crowds. Pope Francis yesterday used the Spanish word caca, which translates as excrement, to describe those who covered up for clerics who abused people in their care.  His comments came during his private meeting with eight people representing a wide section of those who were mistreated by members of the Catholic Church in Ireland. By visiting the Knock Shrine today, Pope Francis is following in the footsteps of his predecessor John Paul II, who arrived at the hallowed spot in Co Mayo in 1979. In August 1879, 15 people said they saw an apparition in Knock of the Virgin Mary, St Joseph, St John the Evangelist and a lamb. Around 1.5 million people now visit the site every year.  The Pope landed at Knock airport at about 9.30am ahead of his visit to the holy shrine. Four local schools greeted the pontiff in the heavy rain and around 100 schoolchildren from Co Mayo were waiting for him. They waved Vatican and Mayo flags. Maria Casey, marketing and communications manager at Knock Shrine, said: People started to come here in the hope of receiving cures, and Knock became synonymous for that. And people came to the spot of the apparition to get some clay or holy water to send to abroad. It has developed over the years and it has a very unique story in the sense that it\u0027s the only shrine in the world where the Lamb of God has appeared.

The Princess Royal as well as Zara and Mike Tindall were also understood to be present for the gathering on Friday.  Reports said the Queen , 92, drove herself there in her Range Rover.   Prince George started at St Thomas\u0027 Battersea in south west London last September and he\u0027s now about to start Year 1.

John and Susan Cooper died suddenly within four hours of each other while on a Thomas Cook holiday at the Steigenberger Aqua Magic in the Red Sea resort of Hurghada.  Food, water and air conditioning are being probed as authorities try to establish the cause of their deaths amid accusations from the Burnley couple\u0027s daughter Kelly that something suspicious had happened. Now holidaymakers Paul and Bev Vanstone have claimed they also became ill while staying at the same hotel.  The pair were staying at the resort with their two children and Mr Vanstone\u0027s mother when four of them came down with stomach cramps, vomiting and diarrhoea. Mr Vanstone, 41, has revealed photos showing raw, pink chicken he claims he was served at the hotel.  He said: There was a party of six of us that went. My wife was treated for gastroenteritis, my 14-year-old daughter went down with a vomiting and diarrhoea bug and two days before leaving I had really bad stomach cramps and diarrhoea. While we were there we had to complain because we were served raw chicken. I ate that but if that had been my daughter... it was raw - very, very raw.  The dad-of-two said he arrived home in Oxford on August 6 and went to the doctor where he was diagnosed with high levels of salmonella poisoning.   He later lodged a complaint with Thomas Cook, but said the doctor was unable to confirm exactly what made them all ill. Mr Vanstone added: It could be chicken, it could have been the water, it could have been anything that you can get salmonella from.  Thomas Cook said that the circumstances of Mr and Mrs Cooper\u0027s deaths were still unclear and there could be a wait of 10 days for tests to show the cause .

Victoria Andrews, 26, was shocked to learn she was pregnant after doctors told her she was infertile due to Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. Yet she gave birth to baby Tobias – Toby for short – in May. And while Victoria has had to sell half of her collection to buy things for her real baby, Toby still has 40 doll brothers and sisters. He even has a ‘twin’ - an identical version of a sleeping newborn Toby. Victoria said: “I couldn’t believe it when I found out I was pregnant. “Obviously I love babies. I just thought I would only ever have the doll variety.  “I was smitten with Toby right away. He’s got my eyes and my ‘bum’ chin. I haven’t even picked up a doll since he was born.” Victoria only learned she was pregnant after going to the doctor after weeks of what she thought was a stomach ulcer or gastroenteritis. She said: “My blood tests came back. The doctor talked to me for a few minutes and then said ‘congratulations by the way, you’re at least seven weeks pregnant.’” The barmaid still didn’t believe it – so she paid for a private scan. “It was only when I saw his tiny body that I started to celebrate,” Victoria said. “I was so happy.” Last year Victoria started taking Infolic - a drug her mum found online that was meant to halt the facial hair growth polycystic ovary sufferers often have to deal with.  But it seems the medication also resulted in a spike in the barmaid’s fertility. Victoria said: “I’d tried so many different things in the past that hadn’t worked it didn’t really occur to me that this one might. I wasn’t even taking it for my fertility. “Me and my partner at the time didn’t use protection – there was no need. “We split up before I even knew I was pregnant because I found out he was cheating. “Now he doesn’t want anything to do with the baby. It’s massively his loss – Toby is absolutely amazing.” As a single mum Victoria had to offload some dolls to help make ends meet.  She made nearly \u0026pound10,000 selling about 40 dolls – called ‘reborns’ — and spent the money on a cot, pram and other necessities for Toby. At its peak her collection had over 100 dolls. Although she has always buys and the sells the dolls in order to upgrade to better versions, Victoria reckons she has spent around \u0026pound60,000 on the hobby. Now, with a real baby, she no longer has time to pay attention to the 40 she still has left. Victoria said: “Some of the ladies in the doll community take their collections quite seriously. They with feed and bathe their dolls and put them into pyjamas at night. “I mostly keep mine on a shelf. “Sometimes, before I had Toby, I would pick them up for a cuddle if I was feeling down. It’s really soothing. “But now I’ve got him I don’t need to do that. I don’t have time. I haven’t even picked one up since Toby came along. “I’ve kept my favourites though. Some of the best ones I paid \u0026pound1,500 for.” "},{"url":null,"title":"stormy daniels vows testify donald","story":"NewsStormy Daniels vows to TESTIFY about Donald Trump sex deal to Congress despite death threatsEXCLUSIVE: The porn star who pulled out of Celebrity Big Brother at the 11th hour reveals what happened on THAT night she met the future US PresidentShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByGeraldine McKelvie22:30, 25 AUG 2018Updated01:32, 26 AUG 2018NewsStormy claims to have only slept with about 25 men outside work (Image: Adam Gerrard/Sunday Mirror)Get daily Celebrity Big Brother updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPorn star Stormy Daniels today calls for President Trump to face justice, insisting: “He is not above the law.” In the darkest week of his presidency, Trump’s ex-lover tells the Sunday Mirror he should face impeachment if found to have broken US election rules. In an exclusive interview, Stormy said that she:  Will give evidence to Congress against Trump if he is impeached. Has received death threats from the President’s supporters. Was reduced to tears by women who turned to her for support after suffering sex harassment. Learned to stand up for herself after a tough childhood in which she was left home alone without food.  Stormy spoke in the same week that Trump’s former lawyer Mike Cohen, 52, pleaded guilty to violating campaign finance laws by paying her $130,000 “hush money”.  Another of the President’s alleged lovers, ex-Playboy model Karen McDougal, 47, is said to have had her silence bought in a $150,000 deal with the pro-Trump National Enquirer. And fresh claims emerged yesterday that Trump, 72, also had a secret love child with a housekeeper. The President faces yet more \u0026shypressure on three fronts: The ongoing probe into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 US election a poll boost for rival Democrats which could hasten an impeachment vote and reported immunity for key figures helping the authorities probe hush money payments. Stormy told the Mirror: “If Donald Trump has done things he shouldn’t have during his campaign he should be impeached. If he has broken the law he should be arrested and treated like anyone else. “I’ll happily testify under oath and prove my story is true. “I have always said that the truth is the most important thing and that is why I spoke out in the first place – so I can look my daughter in the eye and know I was honest. Now the truth is coming out and justice must be done.” Stormy, 39, claimed she was initially intimidated into keeping silent and is suing both Trump and Cohen amid claims a non-disclosure agreement she signed is invalid.  She told us: “I will not be silenced, but being called a liar is the hardest part. I am glad other people are now telling the truth. I am just fighting for the truth and I believe everyone should be treated equally. Trump probably wishes he’d never met me, but a lot of men feel like that.” Last weekend the articulate mum of one turned down a reported \u0026pound750,000 to appear on Celebrity Big Brother after, she claims, Channel Five “screwed” her at the last minute. Stormy talked to the Mirror earlier this week at a secret location in the English countryside. She spoke about meeting Trump at a Lake Tahoe golf event in 2006. Stormy claims they had sex once then – and met up on two further occasions. The President has been swamped by accusations of sexually harassing women. But Stormy said: “I have to be very clear he DIDN’T do that to me, it was consensual. But if the allegations from other women are true he should be in jail.” Of her alleged fling with Trump, she said: “I’m normally such a prude! I don’t do one-night stands. “People would be surprised to know that outside work I have only slept with about 25 men. If I see a cute guy in a bar, I chicken out. But on this occasion I was intrigued by Trump. I like very interesting people.” Stormy is prevented from revealing intimate details due to her ongoing lawsuit. But she says she barely recognised Trump when they met. July 2006  Donald Trump meets Stormy Daniels at a golf tournament in Lake Tahoe, just four months after wife Melania gives birth to their son Barron, now 12. Daniels claims she had sex with the tycoon. October 2016 Daniels is paid $130,000 by lawyer Michael Cohen to keep quiet about the alleged affair, just weeks before voters go to the polls. She now claims she was intimidated into silence. November 2016 Trump wins the presidency, defeating rival Hillary Clinton in a result which sends shockwaves around the world. January 2018 The Wall Street Journal carries a report about the payment and names Daniels. Trump denies both the affair and any knowledge of the payment. March 2018 Daniels takes legal action against Trump in a bid to prove the non-disclosure agreement is not valid because he didn’t sign it. April 2018 Cohen’s office is raided by the FBI, which seizes emails, tax documents and business records. August 2018 Cohen admits breaking election laws by paying hush money to two women, believed to be Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal, who also claims to have had sex with Trump. She went on: “There were lots of people around but I didn’t go after him. I didn’t chat him up and he didn’t chat me up – we were just talking. I knew very little. I wasn’t a fan of his and I’d never watched The Apprentice. “He didn’t yell ‘You’re fired’, although I bet now he wishes he had.” At the time, the tycoon’s wife Melania, 48, was at home nursing their four-month-old son Barron. Washington is awash with rumours that Melania, now First Lady, feels trapped and miserable in her marriage. But Stormy said: “People should stop speaking for her. Maybe she’s happy. Everything we say about her is a projection. Some people misplace sorrow and pity on another person. “The entire world would be interested to know what she feels. But if we never know, that is her right and I support it.” Stormy said she forgot all about Trump until he ran for President – to her “amusement and disbelief”. During campaigning a tape emerged in which he boasted he could do anything with women because he was a “star”, adding: “Grab them by the pu**y.” Stormy said: “I’m shocked there are women who are okay with it. It’s my job to grab women and if I said that I’d get in more trouble than him.” It was in January this year that the story broke of Stormy and Trump’s alleged fling. Overnight, she became an icon for women who claimed they had suffered harassment – even though Stormy insists that her relationship with Trump was consensual. She went on: “I’d no idea I would end up standing up for everyone but it has been a privilege I never expected. “It’s hard enough to face these powerful people but to have others place their hope and trust in you is a big deal. I’m not a feminist, I’m just human.” Stormy revealed that one woman confided in her that her sister had killed herself after being raped. Others have said her experience encouraged them to report abuse and sexual harassment.  Stormy – who appears in US clubs in a touring strip show – said: “I sometimes go back to my dressing room after listening to other people’s stories and it just makes me want to cry. “Sometimes we all cry together. But I am there to do a job so I pull myself together and then get back on stage. “I can be standing completely naked on stage and a woman will start crying. I’m like: ‘Oh my God, I really just want to hug you’.” Stormy said standing up to Trump came at a price. In March, she received so many death threats that she had to hire two bodyguards who never leave her side. Some of Trump’s fanatical supporters have bombarded her with terrifying messages. One man approached her in a car park, said she had a lovely daughter and “it would be a shame if something happened to her Mommy”. Stormy added: “I’ve been told: ‘Watch out, b*tch I’m coming for you, I’m going to cut your throat’ – and ‘Your kid should be euthanised’. It’s horrible stuff.” Stormy has now left the UK for a secret location following the row over her last-minute exit from Celebrity Big Brother.

At least 580 people were buried at the site near Lake Turkana, Kenya, making it the earliest and largest one in eastern Africa, archaeologists say.  And experts claim the discovery challenges long-held views about early societies as it was built by an egalitarian group without separate social classes. According to the international research team, the Lothagam North Pillar Site was a communal cemetery constructed and used over a period of several centuries, between about 5,000 and 4,300 years ago. Early herders built a platform around 30 metres in diameter and excavated a large cavity in the centre to bury their dead. After the cavity was filled and capped with stones, the builders placed large, megalith pillars, some sourced from as much as a kilometre away, on top. Stone circles and cairns were added nearby.  Researchers say 580 men, women and children of different ages were buried in the central cavity alongside personal ornaments, with no burials being singled out with special treatment. The existence of such a huge project contradicts long-standing beliefs that a stratified social hierarchy is necessary for the construction of large public buildings or monuments. Historically, archaeologists have theorised people built permanent monuments as reminders of shared history, ideals and culture, when they had established a settled, socially stratified agriculture society with abundant resources and strong leadership. It was believed that a political structure and the resources for specialisation were necessary to engaging in monument building. Ancient monuments have previously been regarded as reliable indicators of complex societies with separate social classes.  Doctor Elizabeth Sawchuk, of Stony Brook University in the US, said: This discovery challenges earlier ideas about monumentality.   Lothagam North provides an example of monumentality that is not demonstrably linked to the emergence of hierarchy, forcing us to consider other narratives of social change. She said the discovery is consistent with similar examples elsewhere in Africa and other continents where large, monumental structures have been built by groups thought to be egalitarian in their social organisation. The research team said the discover has the potential to reshape global perspectives on how and why large groups of people come together to form complex societies. They said it appears that Lothagam North was built during a period of profound change. Pastoralism, or livestock farming, had just been introduced to the Turkana Basin and newcomers arriving with sheep, goats, and cattle would have encountered diverse groups of fisher-hunter-gatherers already living around the lake. Newcomers and locals faced a difficult environmental situation, as annual rainfall decreased during that period and Lake Turkana shrunk by as much as 50 per cent.

Tannadice.United are one of only a handful of football clubs taking part in the campaign to tackle “period poverty”.Statistics have indicated that one in 10 girls have been unable to afford sanitary

starting at the match against Partick Thistle today.Since 2015, ULT83 has raised more than £5,000 for local community causes as well as the Dundee United Youth Development Board and the Dundee United Community Trust.Members of the group said they were delighted to join forces with ArabTrust, which has provided more than £300,000 to the Tannadice club since 2003.ArabTrust chairwoman Susan Batten said: “We thought it would be a great idea to provide free sanitary products for our female fans and for the women who visit Tannadice.“We are very proud to be part of the campaign to provide free

safranko admits understanding the dundonian accent has been his biggest hurdle","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United new boy Pavol Safranko has revealed the biggest hurdle he’s encountered since arriving has been learning to work out English – Scottish-style.The Slovakian international was an instant hit in Tangerine as he scored a cracking debut goal in the 2-0 win at Queen of the South a fortnight ago.And from what he’s seen of Scottish football so far, the 23-year-old is feeling good about fitting in to life in the Championship with United.Having already switched countries successfully once when he moved from Dunajska Streda in his homeland to Danish outfit Aalborg last year, he did not anticipate too many problems with getting used to the culture here.Particularly as his language of choice in Denmark was very often English.“I was one year in Denmark and everyone speaks English and I thought this is good for me coming here,” he said.“But when I came to the training ground from Dundee for the first time, the taxi driver spoke with me and I didn’t understand anything.“I had to ask him two or three times to say again before I understood what he said. It was not a big problem because he was a nice guy.“I will try to learn the accent here and it will happen but when I arrived it was more difficult to understand English here than I thought it would be.”While learning to speak, or at least understand, Dundonian, Safranko will also be reading up on the opposition he’s going to face in the Championship, starting with today\u0026#8217s visitors Partick Thistle.For him, though, the most important factor being at Tannadice will be getting to know his team-mates and focusing on playing to his and their strengths.“I do not know Partick Thistle. I do not know too much about any of the other clubs, so we have to see some videos, play games, and after I can say something about our opponents.“I think this can be a good thing. You always have to start from the ‘us’, from what we will do and not think too much about the other teams. This is a good way to build the winning mentality.“It’s more important to learn about team-mates than the other teams. I have had three weeks training now, that helps.“And it is important that we are winning games while we are learning about each other. There are many new players here and we will get better as a team but we must win while this happens.”With that impressive debut coming down in the Dumfries, for most United fans today will be their first glimpse of Safranko.Giving them a preview of what to expect he’s told them to look for him in the penalty box. He knows that’s where his worth to the team lies and that is where he wants to spend most of his time.“I am a striker who gets into the penalty box. This is my area to play. Hey, I am not good outside the box – I know where I am and that is where I play.“I hope this is good for United and that it is where we will play. Then I can help the team and that is what is most important.“We were good in my first game and we were the better team first half, so we were attacking.“Maybe not second half but we won. I hope the second game will be even better.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b7fd04af1b5a-836x564.jpg ","title":"elton ngwatala dundee players must trust each other to turn form around","story":"\t\t\t\t\tBelief is key for Dundee, says Elton Ngwatala, if they are to chalk up their first league points of the campaign.The Dark Blues will make the short journey to Perth to take on Tayside rivals St Johnstone in what has become a crucial fixture.The Dens men go into the clash stuck on zero points after two Premiership games keen not to repeat their slow start to last season.It took last year’s team until mid-September to register their first victory of the campaign – notably against today\u0026#8217s opponents, Saints, in a 3-2 victory at Dens Park.To repeat that, Ngwatala – one of the summer recruits – insists it’s about the players trusting each other to earn themselves a first win of the campaign.The Frenchman said: “Last week was, obviously, a very disappointing result for us but I think we have to look forward now.“We are back in the league matches and we have to start winning games, that’s the most important thing.“We can take a lot from the last game and learn from our mistakes. We will do everything we can to win but we have to score as well.“Obviously, we can do so much better than we have done.“Everybody in the team knows that but we have to improve and keep improving every week.“Now, everybody is on it. Everybody wants to do the best for the team, whatever the starting XI or subs, everybody wants to be part of it and we need that to be successful.”Before the 3-0 home loss to Championship side Ayr United, Dundee’s big problem was putting away the chances they were creating against St Mirren and Aberdeen.The defeat to the Honest Men has put a whole different spin on the club’s start to the season, however.Ngwatala, though, says there is plenty of talent in the current squad to create a positive twist in the story of Dundee’s season tomorrow at McDiarmid Park.“The first two games, I don’t think we deserved to lose,” he added.“That’s the way it is, though, and now I think we have to be prepared to fight every game.“As a team you have to give everything to get the win.“Even if we have to wait to score in the 95th-minute we’ll do that – you have to believe to the end.“We have to go there with confidence and express ourselves and do the best we can to get the three points.”And Ngwatala says the points will only be heading their way if they can work as a team and trust each other to get the better of their Tayside rivals – that’s the message from boss Neil McCann, anyway.“The manager has said we have to believe in ourselves, believe in what we can do and trust each other.“If we do that, we’ll get what we deserve.“It’s going to be a tough game – we have to treat this game like any other and prepare like we would against any team.“We must go there and do everything we can to get a result.”In those two league games, getting anything positive on the scoresheet was a big issue with Ngwatala the only Dundee player yet to find the net.He’s pleased to have got off the mark in goalscoring terms but would much rather have points on the board.“It was good for me to get the first goal so now I’m relaxed, the first is gone and I can carry on now.“However, I need my teammates to help me score and I will help them to do the same.“I want to score but when I do, I want my team to win, not just get a goal and we lose the game.“I want to help my team get points, that’s all I want.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b7fd016034e9-e1535108915987-720x564.jpg ","title":"feat of strength recognised at holyrood","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Dundee-born nurse who became the first woman in almost half a century to conquer a remarkable test of strength has been congratulated by the Scottish Parliament.Leigh Holland-Keen, 29, lifted the Dinnie Stones – two granite boulders that together weigh 733lb – in front of a crowd of 400 people.She was the first female in 40 years to do so and one of fewer than 100 people who have accomplished the feat.Ms Holland-Keen, who now lives in Australia, made history at Potarch, on Deeside, where the stones sit outside the Old Potarch Hotel.A North-East MSP has now marked the Sydney strongwoman’s feat with a motion at Holyrood.Scottish Conservative Alexander Burnett said: “Fewer than 100 people have managed to lift the stones since Donald Dinnie carried them the length of the Potarch Bridge in 1860.“Leigh was the first woman to do so in about 40 years. Quite rightly, her story has been celebrated by the media in her home country.“I hope more strong women and men are inspired to come and try their hands on the Dinnie Steens as a result.”The former Lawside Academy pupil said: “I was ecstatic and it was surreal that all these legends were clapping for me and hugging me.“That was the most special thing for me – all these 70 and 80-year-olds who did what I was doing back in their day.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b7ff73452762.jpg ","title":"huge prehistoric castle rock discovered on site of former dundee steak house","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCouncil staff renovating a retail unit got more than they bargained for when they stumbled on part of the city’s foundations.Crews in Castle Street who were working on the former Kennedy’s Steak House discovered the massive prehistoric “castle rock” in the basement of the building.The huge rock formation stretched back up the hill towards High Street and was the base for the city’s first castle, which lends the street its name.Lynne Short, convener of the city development committee, said: “In light of the interest in the city’s underground with the recent opening up of the vaults and our wider heritage in general, it’s amazing to find out that the very rocks the city of Dundee was first built on are still there.“The building created around it has an interesting enough history in itself as it was the only one left standing in the area during the early 20th Century when there was a massive clearance to make way for the Caird Hall complex.“Castle Street was cut through the vast formation on which the ancient Castle of Dundee stood but clearly large chunks of the rock remained under this building when it was put up.”The first historical record of a structure being erected on the then vacant plot at what is now 31-33 Castle Street is from 1799-1800.Dundee Town Council took ownership of the site in 1914 as part of the Central Improvement Scheme when many buildings were earmarked for demolition to make way for the Caird Hall. But contemporary photographs held in the city’s archives show that 31-33 Castle Street was not demolished.The sandstone building was annexed and included in the design and construction of the new Caird Hall complex and received a fresh, modern appearance.Unfortunately, history buffs can no longer see the castle rock as the final touches to the building included the provision of false walls and new flooring in the basement.The former Kennedy’s Steak House closed several years ago and has lain empty ever since.The council-owned building had slipped into a state of disrepair.In a bid to attract a new occupant to the site, an “extensive” refurbishment of the building is under way.In all, £183,000 has been set aside to strip out the unit and make it ready for a new tenant to move in.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ive loved every second and now i want more dan","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDan Jefferies “loved every second” of his first-team chance last season and has vowed to grab any chance he gets this campaign with both hands.The 19-year-old featured in the two final home matches of last season, as a substitute in a 1-0 win over Hamilton before starting the home defeat to Partick Thistle that concluded the campaign.The Welshman, who started his career in Swansea’s youth academy, joined the Dark Blues in January after leaving Colchester United and impressed in the U/20s team that narrowly missed out on the Development League title.He also grabbed a goal in last week’s Irn-Bru Cup win over Hibs Colts for the Dundee youth side and says he thinks he’s ready for another shot at first-team football.Though, he admits jokingly, he might have to calm himself next time he’s out on the pitch in the senior game.Describing his time in the first team last season, he said: “I loved every second of it – once you step on that pitch everything is mad, it’s crazy and you don’t know what to do!“You need to calm yourself down a bit but I’m buzzing to have played for the first team and, hopefully, I can get more chances this season.“I think I’m ready to make the step up.“With the players in front of me in my position, I’m always learning from them, they are always helping me and everyone around the training ground is helping me.“If I do get a chance this year, I’ll give my all and I think I am ready for it – I’ll definitely take it with both hands and I won’t look back.”As a centre-back, Jefferies certainly has plenty of competition to get through ahead of him.As far as central defenders go, the Dark Blues boast an array of experience – Steven Caulker being an England international and former Liverpool and Spurs defender, Darren O’Dea won numerous trophies at Celtic, Josh Meekings is a Scottish Cup winner and Genseric Kusunga has two Swiss league titles to his name.For Jefferies, that doesn’t pose an insurmountable hurdle but rather gives him an ideal opportunity to learn from players who have been there and done it.He added: “In training if you make a mistake, they don’t really get on to you, they encourage more than anything.“They want everyone to improve every day and because I’m young, I’m 19, I look up to the likes of Steven Caulker, Darren O’Dea, Josh Meekings and Gense – I mean, they’ve got some amount of experience.“I hope they can share it with me and I can move on with them.”After making the move north, Jefferies has settled into life quickly in Dundee and says the possibility of first-team football at a club with the stature of the Dark Blues was a big draw for him.“It was a quick six months at Colchester before the opportunity came about up here,” he added.“It’s a good club, I love it here, the people are friendly and I think I can learn more up here and maybe break into the first team.“The manager definitely gives young players a chance if he thinks they deserve it.“He believes in the youngsters and I am very grateful for the chance I had last season.“Hopefully, I can get more this year.“We play the same way as the first team and it’s all the same at Dundee so it’s not too much of a step up from reserve football but it’s older men with experience and you just have to put yourself about.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"life long dundee fan liverpool midfielder charlie adam linked with move away from stoke bolton wanderers","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee fan Charlie Adam looks set for

Whether or not either is fit to start on Saturday remains to be seen.A swollen knee means Murdoch hasn’t played since the Betfred Cup tie against Alloa a month ago.Whereas Booth’s absence stretches back a few days longer, to when he picked up a knock at Ross County in his only competitive appearance so far.Just the fact both are back working normally, however, is good news for their gaffer, though he remains frustrated by the continued absence of winger Billy King because of a thigh injury.“Callum Booth has trained with the team and also Stewart Murdoch has trained fully with the team, so they are now fit.“Billy King is still struggling with this stupid injury that he didn’t even get from training,” added Csaba.“He hasn’t done one training session so far this season.“Last season he was one of the most important players for the team but he is struggling with this injury and it continues to affect him.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/07/image.jpg@1.568496.jpg ","title":"today fun day hopes to boost dundee community spirit and revive high street","story":"\t\t\t\t\tHopes are high that a fun day in Lochee will revive some community spirit while offering activities for the whole family to enjoy.\u0026nbspOrganised by volunteers from multiple community groups including The Village of Lochee Community Partnership, Lochee Community Hub and Lochee Parish Church, today\u0026#8217s event is funded by the Community Regeneration Forum.Visitors to the High Street will be able to enjoy a performance by the Lochee Music Group, as well as appearances by Peppa Pig and Spider-Man.Meanwhile, along at the community hub there will be face painting, crafts, balloon modelling and a cake and candy stall.Lochee Library will also be involved, offering an opportunity to peruse stalls, get involved in some craft activities and enjoy an animal handling station.There will be some outdoor pursuits at the community garden, such as planting and a mini-garden festival, and refreshments will be available.

It’s the only reason I put myself through it.”Claire’s commitment to the charity began in 2012 after collecting donations at her grandmother’s funeral.“Alzheimer Scotland was our first choice.”But only then did Claire’s family discover the charity relied on fundraising.“We were shocked and it became the catalyst for me to want to get involved and help.”Claire’s first endeavour was a sponsored skydive.“It was totally exhilarating and amazing. An adrenaline buzz like no other,” she said.In 2013, Claire ran the Baker Hughes 10k and also the Great Scottish Run in Glasgow, completing them both in just over an hour and taking her sponsorship money close to £4,000.In between running her beauty business six days a week, Claire also made time to squeeze in training as a fitness instructor in 2015.The seeds of entering the London Marathon were then sown.“I applied in the ballot to run but I didn’t get a place,” said Claire.“I spoke to Alzheimer Scotland and through them I secured a charity place, which I was really grateful for as it afforded me the experience.”Claire followed the London Marathon 17-week running plan.She trained in the snow, wind and rain. The coldest day she ran was -5C.It took considerable commitment to follow the running schedule.Claire would rise at 6am and run between four to six miles in her short sessions.But come the weekend, her long runs, which were between two to five hours, would involve navigating her way along the Old Deeside railway line.The longest she ran ahead of the race was 21-and-a-half miles.So does Claire plan to run another marathon?“I will carry on raising money for Alzheimer Scotland, but I can honestly say I will never run the marathon again.“It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience but I simply can’t dedicate as much of my life to running ever again,” she said.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"boy finds pet cat strung up by neck","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA nine-year-old boy found his cat fighting for its life after yobs hung the animal from its neck with a dog lead.Ricky Henderson, from the Garthdee area of Aberdeen, today told how his wife Gail, 34, and son Cole, 9, found their pet Scruffy.A thick dog’s lead had been tied around the cat’s neck and attached to the top of a high fence near their home.The 33-year-old, who is assistant manager at Goals, said: “They realised they hadn’t seen him all day and then they heard him crying out the back.“My nine-year-old son found him on the fence struggling for his life.“He was round the back hanging on the end of a high fence.“He was soaked to the bone and his fur was on the fence because he must have been rolling around.

In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around $79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution? The short answer is ‘no’, but right now the race is on to find new, more durable building materials to replace the need for sand and in so-doing preserve marine ecosystems.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

However, they often endure short, painful lives without the most basic requirements.This is where SPANA makes such a huge difference, ensuring animals have access to the free veterinary treatment they urgently need when they are sick or injured.Actors Dame Judi Dench and Joanna Lumley are throwing their support behind this year’s event, and we hope your readers will be inspired to take part and help transform the lives of working animals around the world.The SPANA World Tea Party fundraising pack, full of free recipes, is available from www.spana.org/teaparty or by calling 020 7831 3999.SPANA World Tea Party Host, Tom HorsfieldSir,It only takes one person to put a stop to the accidental loss of life to drowning.With recent headlines being filled with tragic stories of people losing their lives to drowning, Lesley Laird, Shadow Scottish Secretary and the Royal Life Saving Society UK (RLSS UK) urge the public to be that \u0026#8216one person\u0026#8217: take some simple precautions and get \u0026#8216water smart\u0026#8217, before cooling off this summer.For more information on the issue, the statistics involved and interview opportunities, please contact Claire Huggins on 0300 323 0096 or email clairehuggins@rlss.org.ukSenior Communications Executive, Claire HugginsSir,There are more people using Instagram for interiors inspiration than ever before, but 70 percent of Scottish Instagram users feel dissatisfied with their homes after looking at images of other people’s houses on social media, a study has found.Researchers who polled 1,500 UK adults using social media for inspiration with their homes, found that a whopping 66 percent of those are displeased with their home. They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ (HDD).energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process. If we want to find a treatment or cure for disorders of memory like Alzheimer’s disease then we need to have a test of memory in animals that is analogous to human memory tests.\u0026#8217Steve Bargeton, St Andrews\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"do you want to see inveraray bank crumble","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 05/08/18, 6:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAnn Thomas\u0026#8217 latest cartoon depicts the growing worry over the potential closure of Inveraray\u0026#8217s branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland.The branch has been threatened with closure since the end of 2017, prompting protests and petitions.The status of the branch is still undecided and the bank remains open for now.The opportunity to have a say is quickly closing, with an online petition set to be hand-delivered by the person who initially set it up, Mid Argyll writer and journalist Marian Pallister.The petition will be handed over in Inveraray on Wednesday August 8.To sign online, visit the 38degrees website and search for ‘RBS Inveraray’.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"imagination and colour at lochgilphead lego show","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 11/08/18, 6:31 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA vast array of imaginative models were on display at the two-day Lochgilphead Lego Show.Lochgilphead Community Centre was the venue for the weekend of plastic brick magic on Saturday August 4 and Sunday August 5.Interactive workshops with Glasgow-based Bricks4Kids gave an insight into basic engineering using Lego, while the imagination room did exactly what the name suggests.

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex (number two) from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

Consistency, however, paid off for Inveraray as they were crowned Grade 1 Champion of Champions across all five major competitions during 2018 \u0026#8211 for the third year running.In Grade 4B, a young Mid Argyll Pipe Band kept up the momentum started in May when they won the British title. Led by Pipe Major Craig Lang, they performed tremendously well all season. A fourth place finish in the world championship ensured Mid Argyll Pipe Band won the Grade 4 Champion of Champions title for 2018.Early excitement for the Mid Argyll drum corps \u0026#8211 when they were awarded the drumming Champion of Champions crown \u0026#8211 turned to disappointment by the beginning of this week when the Royal Scottish Pipe Band Association amended the result. The Mid Argyll drummers were tied on points with Lower Clyde Pipes and Drums across the season but the fact Lower Clyde got a better result on the day put them just ahead, leading to confusion.Craig Lang said: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s been a historic season for the band, being crowned British champions in May, then going on to win Champion of Champions on Saturday, an unbelievable achievement for such a young group.\u0026#8216Myself and lead drummer Graeme McMillan are immensely proud of every member.

Whoever they invite and whatever they serve, people are highly encouraged to host a Macmillan Coffee Morning in a way that suits them.If people can’t bake, that doesn’t have to stop them.

The Labour list MSP hit out as it was announced rail users traveling to Glasgow from Kilmarnock will have to shell out an additional \u0026pound55 for season passes. Regulated rail fares are set to rise by 3.2 per cent, in line with the retail price index rate of inflation, from January. That will see a season pass increase from \u0026pound1692 to \u0026pound1746. Commuters in Ayr would see an increase of \u0026pound78 from \u0026pound2452 to \u0026pound2530 for a season pass. Mr Smyth said: “These rail fare rises are unwanted, unwelcome and unnecessary. “It is simply unfair that commuters in Ayrshire are being burdened with these rip-off rail fares for less than satisfactory services.  “The cost of rail fares being paid by passengers is simply unacceptable, with passengers from Kilmarnock having to fork out \u0026pound1746 a year to travel to and from work. “Scottish Labour is clear: it’s high time working people stopped having to pay such excessive fares to simply line the pockets of private companies. “Only Labour is fighting for a publicly owned railway which will serve the many, not just the few.” Elsewhere, an annual Lockerbie-Edinburgh fare will now cost \u0026pound5250 – up \u0026pound162 – after the Scotish Government decided peak fares were to increase. Transport secretary Michael Matheson said the rises were “unwelcome” and stressed action had been taken to minimise them.  Increases in off-peak fares in Scotland will be held at 2.2 per cent as the government have pledged to cap them at 1 per cent below inflation. All fares in England will rise by the RPI rate of inflation. Mr Matheson said: “This means in Scotland average fares increases are lower than England and Wales.” In recent months staff from rail union RMT have staged protests in cities around the UK. Mick Cash, general secretary of the RMT, said it was “nothing short of a scandal” that ticket prices were up to five times more than fares in Europe. Lib Dem MSP Mike Rumbles MSP said the rises are the last thing hard-up passengers need.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnLabour PartyScottish LabourGlasgowAyrKilmarnockEconomyTransportLockerbieKilmarnock NewsTransport ScotlandCheap travel"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"musical tribute concert honour loved","story":"NewsMusical tribute concert will honour loved onesFollowing on from the success of last year’s event, the Joan Price Memorial Concert will take to the stage once again next month.Share\u0026nbspByAbi Smillie16:27, 22 AUG 2018NewsColin Price and Pauline Moriarty join together for the tribute concert (Image: Ayrshire Post)Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA musical tribute concert will honour the lives of two well loved members of the community. Following on from the success of last year’s event, the Joan Price Memorial Concert will take to the stage once again next month. Joan Price, a beloved trombone player, was tragically killed in a road traffic accident in January 2017 by two boy racers who are now serving jail sentences. Joan’s fellow band members wanted to do something to honour her memory and decided to organise a concert featuring all three bands which she had played for. Kilmarnock Concert Brass, Irvine \u0026amp Dreghorn Brass Band and Dunaskin Doon Band will join together on September 1 to pay tribute to the Troon gran. The brass band show will now be an annual event, with each band taking it in turns to nominate a charity. This year Kilmarnock Concert Brass has chosen Beautiful Inside \u0026amp Out (SCIO) as the worthy recipients. Beautiful Inside \u0026amp Out (SCIO) supports bereaved families of suicide victims and any troubled person by providing and funding services such as counselling, music, play and drama therapy.  The charity was set up by mum, Pauline Moriarty, originally from Ayr, following the suicide of her 13-year-old daughter, Jenna. The concert will honour Joan and Jenna with traditional marches, big band hits, movie themes and film scores. Tasty treats and a raffle will be on offer during the interval. Colin, Joan’s husband said: “Our family is delighted and honoured that the three bands have decided to make this concert an annual event in Joan’s memory. A lot of hard work goes on behind the scenes to make a concert like this happen and I’m indebted to everyone who has helped or who is playing on the night. “Last year’s concert was a fantastic night of entertainment and I’m looking forward to meeting many old and new friends again this year.” Pauline Moriarty added: “We are so touched the bands have chosen to raise funds for the work of a Beautiful Inside \u0026amp Out (SCIO). It is such a lovely tribute to Joan Price and it will help us to potentially save lives.” Joan Price Memorial Concert will take place on Saturday, September 1 at 7pm at Kyle Academy on Overmills Road in Ayr. Tickets, \u0026pound7 (under 12s and over 65s \u0026pound5) are available by emailing secretary@ddband or messaging Dunaskin Doon Band on their Facebook page. A limited number of tickets will also be available on the night.

Fraser and Freya Russell have qualified for the National final of the American Golf Junior Golf Championships. The pair, who live in Troon and attend Marr College, progressed from the qualifying competition held at Leven Links Golf Club and now go forward to the final which will be televised on Sky Sports later this year. Competing in the gross score stroke play competition, 14-year-old Fraser, who incredibly plays off a five handicap at Royal Troon, put in a superb performance to take the qualifier with a score of nine over par. Not to be outdone by her older brother, Freya, 12, put in a fantastic performance to score 32 points in a stableford off a handicap of 13 in the girls’ net score competition. That was enough to take top spot and secure a spot in the final at Gainsborough Golf Club, where she will take on the UK and Ireland’s best girls. Speaking after the qualifier, Fraser said: “I am delighted with how I played, it will be a great chance for me to play golf on a good stage and I can test myself against some of the best.”  And younger sister Freya is looking forward to the continuing her golfing journey as she commented: “I love to play different golf courses, meeting new friends and getting to play golf with other girl golfers.” The pair play their junior medals on the Portland Course at Royal Troon, but due to their impressive handicaps they are allowed to enter in competitions that are played on the par 71 Old Course. They are both coached by Royal Troon pro Kieron Stevenson. Both Fraser and Freya represent Ayrshire for their age levels, and Freya has been playing with the West of Scotland U18 team since she was just nine. And they both played in the World Championships at the stunning Pinehurst course, which held both the men’s and women’s US Open just a year later - won respectively by Martin Kaymer and Michelle Wie.  Pinehurst has also been pencilled in for the 2019 US Amateur Championships and the 2024 US Open. The pair’s dad, Craig, has always played golf and he helped get them into the sport. Craig, who played golf for Cambridge University, said: “They have always been interested in golf. “I took Fraser to play at a young age, and Freya’s first steps were when she got up to pick up her brother’s golf club! “I’ve never forced it on them though, anytime they play golf it’s because they want to, which I think is the key. “They aren’t just into golf though, Fraser plays rugby for Marr and Freya wants to play hockey for her school, and both of them swim.” "},{"url":null,"title":"borders-dad-delivers-baby-in-familys-sitting-room","story":"A RAIL worker from the Borders delivered his baby daughter in the family\u0026rsquos sitting room.\nGarry Kennan from Coldstream was guided through the birth by a Scottish Ambulance Service call taker.\nMum Vanessa was 40 weeks pregnant and a home birth had been scheduled for the new arrival.\nAs signs showed the birth was imminent on Tuesday, July 30 the couple\u0026rsquos other kids, Callum, 10, Charlotte, nine, and Caitlyn, five were dropped off at a relative\u0026rsquos house.\nAnd they were waiting anxiously for a midwife to arrive when baby Faith decided to make an appearance.\nGarry, a conductor team manager for ScotRail, today praised the Scottish Ambulance Service.\nHe said: \u0026ldquoThings progressed very quickly and she went into labour before any healthcare professionals arrived.\n\u0026ldquoI was told by Borders General Hospital that a midwife was on the way.\nThe emergency call from Garry was made at 3.42pm, taken by Marianne McKeown.\nHe added: \u0026ldquoThe call taker I spoke to was fantastic.\n\"She kept me calm when I was darting about like a headless chicken and talked me through everything.

lived on High Askomil for 25 years and before that about eight years on Low Askomil, both overlooking the beach.Long before when I was a teenager I lived in one of the prefabs on Hillside Road.My friends and I would often head for Dalintober beach, commonly known as Banana Beach, where we would spend some pocket money on Jock Shields\u0026#8217 kayaks.There were about six or seven kayaks to hire for a shilling or two and go just about anywhere, in all weathers, for an hour, not a life jacket to be seen.Jock or John Shields ran a bicycle shop on Longrow but was into many things and also had a ship carousel at Banana Beach.The carousel wasn\u0026#8217t unlike one at the fair but consisted of seven or eight little cargo ships and cruise boats, all home made I think, for one child in each boat.They were attached to a centre spindle with one ship only having an outboard motor making the whole assembly rotate.I\u0026#8217m not sure if it was Jock or someone else who hired out rowing boats from the slipway in the harbour.We would hire two seater or four seater boats, the former being cheaper and we could always pick up another crew member when out of sight of the hirer.Rowing  to the large mooring buoy in the middle of the loch was no big deal, neither was accepting a dare to ride out the wake from the Duchess of Hamilton or Montrose sideways on.I\u0026#8217m sweating thinking about it as there were no lifejackets, we must have been crazy.Other memories of Banana Beach were the toilets and shelter at the top of the pier now long gone, and the push button drinking fountain at the wall near the beach slipway.Happy days indeed.  Good luck to those trying to restore it for today\u0026#8217s generation where I\u0026#8217m certain lifejackets will be in abundance for boating

It was nailed to the stretcher rather than the modern method of stapling. At some stage a further bar of yellowed wood had to added to keep the canvas taut.Further internet research revealed a painter known as H Shapiro, who was born in 1933. Helen was born in 1946.Unfortunately for those hoping for a massive price tag, the H stands variously for Hermon or Herman.A painting with a similar style, titled Loch Long, appeared recently on eBay and was described as: ‘Oil on canvas, possibly an early work by the artist Herman (Hermon) Shapiro.‘It is hand signed, lower right, with “H. Shapiro” and dated ‘52 (1952).’A large collection of Mr Shapiro’s other work, mainly of life studies of a distinctly different style is for sale with a gallery, named Hatfield Hines in Norwich.One of the partners at the gallery said they had bought the paintings. Despite having much biographical detail the partner claimed they had no way of contacting Mr Shapiro.That gallery states that Mr Shapiro was born in London and is settled in Scotland, which fits Clachan’s picture.He studied at Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts from 1949-54 where he was apparently influenced by Bloch, Minton and Vaughan and was associated with the acclaimed Camberwell Group.By the mid 1950s he had started teaching in South Wales schools and went on to lecture at Cardiff College of Art.His paintings and sculpture are mostly based on the female figure, more recently in a domestic environment.

Despite two days and a night of rain last week the water level remains well down.The dam is crossed to reach the track to Whitehill farm, which is derelict, and on to the Ballywilline lane and the route\u0026#8217s end at the A83 pavement.In an emergency the simplest descent from the summit would be south-east, leading to a dip and due west to the Knocknan loch track and the Balegreggan waterworks.No doubt hill runners will race up Knock Scalbert but stout boots, a waterproof, picnic and a drink would make for an enjoyable walk, plus a map and compass, and the ability to use them.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"Festival guests left feeling cheesed off call for a refund","story":"  The Big Cheese Festival, which was held at Hove Lawns yesterday, has been branded a \"shocking experience\" by\u0026nbspguests, with some saying they counted no more than two cheese stalls.

Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre. Gilson, who spoke before and after the showing, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great pleasure to be able to finally show this in Swindon.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a film to be appreciated, and to spread a message.

The move comes just 16 months after a public consultation on similar plans in which three quarters of those who took part objected to the change, leading the council to scrap the proposal.  The council said the move was part of a review of its service provision however, it has been criticised for not taking the plan back to the community before making the decision.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoIt is extremely disappointing that East Lothian Council are pressing ahead with service changes in Prestonpans that were rejected last year.  \u0026ldquoPrestonpans Community Council and other local community organisations should have been consulted on these changes rather than being presented with a fait accompli and we would ask that the council assure the local community that they will consult fully on the future proposals for Aldhammer House.

It comes as the number of lairs at Deer Park Cemetery, opposite where the proposed new burial ground would be sited, reaches a dangerously low figure.  Ward councillor Norman Hampshire stressed the importance of new burial spaces being created in the town.  Mr Hampshire, chairman of the council planning committee, was unable to comment on the merits of any specific application because of his role on the committee.  But he said: \u0026ldquoI have been told by officers, early next year there will be no spaces available in the cemetery.  \u0026ldquoIt would mean people in the community would need to be buried outwith the town, which would not be acceptable to people. There is a desperate need for [a new] cemetery within Dunbar.  The proposed new cemetery comes as part of a controversial planning application approved by the planning committee last year.  More than 100 houses are set to be built on land at Newtonlees Farm, despite the site being outwith the sites identified at that stage by the council\u0026rsquos Local Development Plan and recommended for refusal by planning officers.  Mr Hampshire ultimately had the casting vote on the Gladman Developments scheme after the vote at the council meeting was tied at 4-4.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe original proposal had been to extend the existing cemetery.  \u0026ldquoHowever, when the consent was given for a housing development along with the golf course at Dunbar Golf Club, the land was not secured at that time by the council.  \u0026ldquoThere have now been more burials in the cemetery and the way the layout is the bit of land that was available to purchase would not have created the substantial extension that would have been viable for the future in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoThat is why the council had to look at alternative sites to create a new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoThe two cemeteries are very close to each other.  \u0026ldquoThere will be parking still available in the old Deer Park site and some new parking created within the new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoI think the two will work well together and be a cemetery which is available for a long number of years and satisfy the needs of the Dunbar community.  Deer Park Cemetery opened in 1953 and is expected, according to East Lothian Council, to reach capacity by the summer of 2020.  There are a total of 1,300 lairs in Deer Park cemetery, which are expected to be full within 18-24 months.  A spokeswoman for the council said: \u0026ldquoThe size of the proposed cemetery is approximately 1.2 hectares offering 2,000 lairs, 700 ashes-only lairs and an area for woodland burial.

Fiona-Frances Adam, one of the town\u0026rsquos community councillors, raised the issue with councillors.  She asked: \u0026ldquoWhat are they going to be doing?  \u0026ldquoAre they going to extend the surgery with all the incoming people?  \u0026ldquoThey are stretched.

The new hospital is expected to be complete in 2020 but no planning application has been submitted for a GP surgery at any site in the town, including the hospital and within the new Letham Mains development, which is sandwiched between the B6471 and the A6093.  Jan Wilson, chairwoman of the community council, said: \u0026ldquoWhere the surgery is at the moment is central.  \u0026ldquoI think as far as I am led to believe there is supposed to be a doctors\u0026rsquo surgery in the Letham Main development.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership told the Courier that discussions had been taking place with Haddington GPs on how to support the growing population for \u0026ldquosome time.

Nicola Pryde, director of the nursery group, which is already open on Meadowpark and has another facility in Dunblane, Stirling, said that the new centre had been opened to meet demand as the town sees more families moving in.

The new order, which is an experimental order, will mirror what is already in place south of the East Coast Mainline in the Hallhill area of the town, where all the streets, with the exception of Kellie Road, are 20mph.

Figures show that the number of people in either part-time or full-time employment in East Lothian rose to 78.6 per cent between April 2017 and March 2018, an increase of 3.6 per cent from the previous year, when the rate was at 75 per cent.

It underlines the complacency of the UK Government, which is simply not doing enough to help people into work.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council, through its East Lothian Works employability service, is doing a good job supporting jobseekers, but both the UK and Scottish Governments must do more to enhance prosperity and create new jobs.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray added: \u0026ldquoI welcome the fact that East Lothian\u0026rsquos employment rate is higher than the Scottish average. However, too many local people are still not in work. We need a fundamental shift in how we grow our economy.  \u0026ldquoWe also need to ensure opportunities for creating these kind of jobs locally are maximised at the former Cockenzie Power Station site and the new innovation park at QMU.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoUnemployment figures in East Lothian are following a positive trend as there are over three per cent more people in employment now compared to last year.  \u0026ldquoThe council continues to strive to grow East Lothian\u0026rsquos economy and to make it the best place in Scotland to live, work and do business and we would very much hope our employment figures will continue to rise year-on-year as a result of this work.  \u0026ldquoIt is difficult to comment in detail on the figure of 4,000 households being classed as out of work as it\u0026rsquos unclear, as yet, exactly how this figure has been calculated.  \u0026ldquoIt is also important to note that the roll-out of full service Universal Credit in East Lothian has had an effect on the recording of our out-of-work levels so this too needs to be looked at more closely.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Works continues to support people of all ages and abilities to gain skills, re-train and undertake courses and work experience to get them back into rewarding employment, working closely with employers and education providers. There are also many initiatives to support the most vulnerable in our society, including those living in poverty, including projects initiated by our area partnerships designed to meet the needs of our very different communities across East Lothian.  Across Scotland, the most common reason people gave for not being in work was being sick or disabled \u0026ndash 37 per cent of out-of-work individuals cited illness or disability as the primary reason.  Students made up 13 per cent of the group, and 18 per cent were early retirees, with 10 per cent of jobless people in the area officially \u0026lsquounemployed\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash looking for work and able to start within two weeks.  A spokesperson from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said: \u0026ldquoSince 2010 the proportion of workless households is down in every region of Great Britain.  \u0026ldquoThe unemployment rate remains at its lowest since 1971, but we\u0026rsquore committed to ensuring that everyone who wants to work has the opportunity to do so \u0026ndash while making sure there is a safety net for those who can\u0026rsquot.  The DWP has also said that the majority of employment growth has been in both full-time and permanent roles.  David Leese, policy analysis manager at charity the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said that workless families in particular were at a much higher risk of poverty.  Figures from the DWP for 2016-17 show that in workless households nearly 75 per cent of children were growing up in poverty, compared to only five per cent of children with two working parents.  \u0026ldquoIf a child lives in poverty, it affects their health, their education, their family relationships and their plans for the future, Mr Leese said. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos not right that any child lives in such insecure circumstances."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-courier-pet-idol-see-the-top-50","story":"  Pictured here are all the 50 pets still in the running.

Among the East Lothian pubs to have permanently closed during this period are the Elphinstone Arms in Elphinstone The Hub in Tranent the Bay Horse in Haddington and The Hayweights, Burgh and Mrs Forman\u0026rsquos in Musselburgh.  The figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that in 2010 there were about 55 pubs and bars in East Lothian but by 2017 that had fallen to about 45.  Michael Peters, who is behind The New Pheasant in Haddington \u0026ndash which opened this week at the site of the former Pheasant, which shut in 2009 \u0026ndash was not surprised by the figures.  He said that there were a variety of reasons for the decline in the number of pubs, including the lowering of the drink-drive limit in Scotland in 2014, issues with breweries, and the state of the economy.  Mr Peters felt that there was a real need for pubs in towns and villages and said: \u0026ldquoI am not biased but every town needs a pub.  \u0026ldquoIt is not just for drinking but socialising and the community \u0026ndash nothing would be happening. Most things that happen \u0026ndash golf trips, football, anything like that \u0026ndash it is organised when you are in the pub.  \u0026ldquoWhere do most people socialise?  Across the UK, 5,745 pubs closed over the same period, and there are 54 local authorities across the country where 30 or more shut.  Pubs have been pointing the finger of blame at the taxman for their troubles, complaining about the duty on beer, VAT levels and the cost of business rates.  Britain\u0026rsquos Beer Alliance, a group of organisations in the pub and brewing sector, has started a campaign called Long Live the Local with a petition and calls for people to write to their MP to have beer duty reduced.  The latest data from the ONS shows that between 2016 and 2017, 655 pubs and bars across the UK called time for the last time.  In East Lothian there was a slight upturn in that period, with numbers up by about five.  A change in consumer habits, with people drinking at home more often, has been blamed for fewer people visiting pubs.  There are 21 areas of the country that have bucked the decline and have more pubs now than they had in 2010. Top of the list is Hackney in East London, which had 55 more bars in 2017 than it did in 2010."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-the-mermaids-magic-storm","story":"  AFTER our return from a final camping trip in the midges and mist, my youngest daughter started school. She needed an early-morning shower to remove the lingering smell of wood smoke in her hair this morning before getting ready.  She protested a bit, as she said she liked the smell of wood smoke because it reminded her of camping in the Highlands. But soon she was all excited to be dressed up, smart and clean for school. She is attending Prestonpans Infant School, as her big sister did before her, and as I did when it was the primary school.  She looked so smart and business-like as she walked into class with a beaming smile. We shared this moment with many other parents, who were taking the same photos and shedding similar tears. Only the day before, Skye had climbed the side of a mountain in Glencoe as if she had once been a mountain goat and proclaimed she wanted to live by a waterfall.  Now, all dressed to conform (although hair still looking slightly wild as she likes it), she has entered a formal system which in my day did its best to (literally) beat out any original creativity that didn\u0026rsquot fit in with teachers\u0026rsquo expectations.  But as our daughter walked through the same doors I had once gone through, I was uplifted by a hopeful expectation that when we come to pick her up she will be less smart, less clean and her hair even wilder. That\u0026rsquos what school should be like for a wee girl not yet reached five. And I know she is in good hands in that respect at Prestonpans Infants.  But as I kissed her goodbye this morning, she asked: \u0026ldquoCan we have tea by a campfire in the woods? The campfire had been the communal focus during our camping trip. As darkness fell, the spirit of the fire glowed brighter and danced with our imaginations as we told stories and riddles with each other. I of course agreed, but her comment helped me think of which tale to tell this week.  Much of our summer has been spent exploring the wonders of East Lothian. We explored beaches and caves. We climbed hills and moors. We swam and paddled in rivers, climbed trees and sat under them having picnics.  But wherever we went there was one thing that we always saw, even in quite remote places: litter. Sometimes there was more, sometimes there was less, but we couldn\u0026rsquot escape it. My children notice it I suppose because I mention it. Our children pick up other people\u0026rsquos litter as we walk, so we now need an extra rucksack to carry it.  \u0026ldquoWhy do people do this? asked my nine-year-old after she had watched a family sitting in a car in a car park by a beach. They had been eating sandwiches and drinking juice, and then threw all the packaging out of the windows. The plastic juice bottles rolled about in the breeze and the sandwich packaging blew away and got caught in some sea buckthorn bushes nearby. The family then drove away, no doubt having had a nice day at the beach, but leaving their rubbish for others to enjoy.  I make no apologies for sounding angry at this. And I do not blame the children, it\u0026rsquos the adults who frame this behaviour. I understand people want to keep their cars tidy but I couldn\u0026rsquot answer my daughter\u0026rsquos question as we sat watching someone else\u0026rsquos rubbish desecrate a beauty spot. I just can\u0026rsquot understand the mindset. So all I said was: \u0026ldquoWell they just don\u0026rsquot know any better I suppose, or maybe just don\u0026rsquot care.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos so sad, she replied, then went very quiet. Then she came up with an answer to the problem: a story:  \u0026lsquoThe king of the sea told all the mermaids not to go close to the shore because of the dangerous litter that humans pollute it with. One mermaid asked what litter was and the king replied it was many things, such as broken glass and plastic which kills sea creatures, as well as making the place humans live look ugly.  \u0026ldquoWhy do they do this? asked the mermaid. The king shrugged his shoulders, and said: \u0026ldquoThey must be less clever than the animals they kill.  But one day the mermaid disobeyed her king and swam to the shore close to the beach at North Berwick. But her tail was cut by broken glass and then she got caught in plastic bags floating on the surface. She was in trouble and a fisherman saw her.  He helped her remove the bags and gave her cream for her cut tail.  \u0026ldquoWhy do you people do this? she asked him. He felt ashamed because he also would throw litter. He promised her he would never do it again. But there was so much rubbish in the sea that they agreed they would try and collect it.  So the mermaid gathered her friends and collected the rubbish. The fisherman\u0026rsquos boat was soon so full that it nearly sank, and when he returned to the harbour people saw the mountain of rubbish he had caught. They laughed at him, thinking he was not a good fisherman because all he had caught was litter and rubbish.  \u0026ldquoLook, said the fisherman, \u0026ldquothis is what we are doing to the sea and the land. Why do we do this? But nobody cared.  \u0026ldquoThis is impossible, we can\u0026rsquot collect all of it, said the mermaid, \u0026ldquoand every day the wind blows more into the sea.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos hopeless, people will never change, said the fisherman. But the mermaid was angry: \u0026ldquoThey must change or else we will all die, including them too eventually.  Mermaids have powers to control the wind. They can whip up storms and so she decided she would make a very unusual, magic storm.  The wind blew not everywhere but where the litter lay. It blew all the rubbish thrown by the humans back into their houses and cars. People woke up with broken glass in their beds and plastic bags covering their children. Their homes were piled high with dangerous and ugly rubbish. When they tried to get rid of it, it just blew back in.  The countryside and sea became wonderfully litter free because of this magic storm, and when people littered the storm whipped up again and blew it straight into their house or car. They couldn\u0026rsquot escape from it. People were living knee-deep in the rubbish they had thrown out of windows or not recycled.  So soon they stopped littering because now they understood what it meant for the other creatures. Finally they cared, because they were the ones who suffered most. At last they got the wisdom of the animals.\u0026rsquo  This story, I think, would make the perfect start to any school day."},{"url":null,"title":"new-world-record-set-at-haddington-rugby-club","story":"  A total of 458 men, women and children took to the pitch at Neilson Park on Sunday as part of the Haddington 700 celebrations. Currently the world record for players involved in a continuous game of rugby is 442.  Now Haddington RFC president Keith Wallace is waiting for official confirmation that a new record has been set.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe day was a fantastic occasion despite the worst day of weather all summer, and we were delighted by the huge effort and support from the club and the rugby and local communities in getting past the record.  \u0026ldquoAs a celebration of the town\u0026rsquos 700 years of the Royal Charter it was a great success, with the match kicked off by Provost John McMillan, and great support from the town, with particular thanks to the boys\u0026rsquo football team who arrived late on, like the cavalry, to help get us over the line.  \u0026ldquoMore than that, though, it was brilliant to see players [aged] from five to 73 enjoying our great game, with several cases of three generations from the same family playing at the same time, including one connected family group of 18.  \u0026ldquoThis is the power of rugby. We look forward to seeing many of our record-breakers back at the club in the near future.  \u0026ldquoWe would also like to thank the Royal Bank of Scotland, sponsors of RugbyForce day of which we were one of two top prize winners, without whose support the event would not have been possible \u0026ndash in particular their many staff, including a good number from the local branch who helped massively on the day.  The match between Haddington President\u0026rsquos XV and Haddington Barbarians XV was kicked off by Provost John McMillan.  The councillor, who previously played for Murrayfield 3rds, said: \u0026ldquoIt was a real honour. I have not played rugby for well over 40 years and it was an amazing day, with a great turnout.  \u0026ldquoIt was very well-organised, despite the horrific weather. It was a great community thing and I was impressed how many people were there \u0026ndash men, women and children of all ages.  \u0026ldquoIt was a great tribute to the club but also the community.  Following their \u0026pound1,000 win for their successful application as part of the Royal Bank RugbyForce initiative, delivered in partnership with Scottish Rugby, Haddington\u0026rsquos event organisers will now submit evidence of the record for verification from Guinness World Records.  Haddington RFC will also use the prize money to contribute towards a recruitment drive to increase playing numbers at all levels and fund community engagement projects.  Haddington RFC\u0026rsquos charity partner Wooden Spoon were also in attendance on the day.  Mr Wallace, who took part in the early stages of the mammoth six-hour match, thanked current Scotland internationalists Stuart McInally, Willem Nel and Sarah Law while there was also an appearance from ex-Lions and Scotland forward Finlay Calder, who grew up in Haddington.

Pupils returned on Wednesday, with Ms Cook planning a series of assemblies to introduce herself to the students.  She said: \u0026ldquoI would like to make Knox Academy a flagship school in East Lothian \u0026ndash Scotland, potentially.  \u0026ldquoI want all young people to leave to a positive destination but be healthy and happy as they move through the school and really enjoy their school experience.  \u0026ldquoI want pupils to enjoy education in the widest sense, not just the curriculum but wider activities, and to develop as rounded individuals when they leave school to meet the demands of an ever-changing society.  Ms Cook, who lives in the county, previously worked in Edinburgh at a number of schools, including Drummond Community High School, Leith Academy and Tynecastle Academy.  The teacher, who has a background in physical education, started on Monday.  Two in-service days gave her the chance to meet the staff before pupils arrived.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe staff seem fantastic, a creative group of people. They really are keen for the school to engage with the challenge.  Ms Cook has also vowed not to remain in her office at the school but instead wants to get out and about and speak to the pupils and staff.

She said: \u0026ldquoI absolutely love the school.  \u0026ldquoLots of people say it about Dunbar, that it is a really special community.  \u0026ldquoThere is really something quite magical about the school and the community.  \u0026ldquoThe youngsters here are just tremendous and the friendliness you get from young people and staff \u0026ndash it is a really caring place.

And it takes the masterplan a stage further with more detailed ideas for each of the zones proposed in its vision, including calling for the Scottish Government to be invited to base its HQ for its proposed state company on the site, as well as suggesting offshore windfarm company Inch Cape \u0026ndash which wants to place a substation on the land to bring energy ashore from proposed turbines \u0026ndash should also be encouraged to put its Scottish base there.  The community council document comes in the wake of a brochure produced by neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council promoting its vision of a Port of Prestonpans cruise terminal at the former power station site.  That proposal sparked anger among supporters of the masterplan vision, who accused the Prestonpans group of ignoring the views of the local communities.  It led to the launch of \u0026lsquoGreenhills: delivering the Masterplan\u0026rsquo, a campaign by local groups and businesses backing the consultation document.  Now Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council has drawn up a draft brochure which sets out why it supports the plans and proposes a range of detailed ways it could be taken forward.  That includes putting head offices for Inch Cape and the Scottish Government energy interests in one part of the site, identified as its \u0026lsquoEnergy Quarter\u0026rsquo.  It also floats the idea of flooding the power station footprint to create a marina \u0026ndash as suggested by a local fisherman \u0026ndash with associated retail and leisure facilities, attracting businesses such as a film studio or 3D printing innovation to the site, or even creating a brewery.

North Berwick Community Council (NBCC) contacted Scottish Water over the issue and the company\u0026rsquos response was read out at a NBCC meeting last week.  A letter from Brian Lironi, director of corporate affairs, said: \u0026ldquoWe are not able to re-lay this section of pipe. However, following an inspection of it, we plan to carry out some work on the casing around the laterals and raised manhole columns.  \u0026ldquoThis work will take place outside of the bathing season when the laterals are more exposed and the beach is less busy. This should help to improve the aesthetic of the pipe.  The letter added: \u0026ldquoOn the point of erosion, we do not believe our pipe is to blame for this. With that said, I am asking for this to be looked at in more detail as it is important that we take an evidence-led approach. This will not happen during the bathing season.  Mr Lironi said the community council would be kept informed of any developments.  Spring 2018 was not the first time that severe weather saw the sewage pipe badly exposed. The pipe was clearly visible in the aftermath of storms in December 2010 and it took many, many months before the tides re-covered it with sand."},{"url":null,"title":"in-this-weeks-courier","story":"  HADDINGTON...

Plans lodged with East Lothian Council are split into two.  The design and access statement states: \u0026ldquoThe brief is twofold: to diversify the core business on the site with the introduction of small-scale gin and whisky distillation to enable the production of speciality spirits for sale within the business pub chain.  \u0026ldquoSecondly, in light of the increasing demand for both brewery tours and the use of the Monk\u0026rsquos Retreat as a function venue, it is felt that the facilities require being upgraded, both in terms of general amenity, improving the visitor experience and to provide for the disabled visitor with the addition of a platform lift and accessible toilet.  A spokeswoman for owners Greene King explained why they were looking to diversify at the site, on Belhaven\u0026rsquos Brewery Lane.  She said: \u0026ldquoLike any business we are always exploring options to develop our business and facilities. The recent planning application is just one of many opportunities we are considering but no decision has been made yet about whether it is an option we will pursue if planning permission is granted.  In terms of the production of gin and whisky, a still house would be created.  According to the design and access statement: \u0026ldquoThe distillery will be designed to produce 250 litres of spirit a day. It will be unique in the marketplace, making spirit from the same wurt as the beer.  \u0026ldquoThe spirit will be a mixture of Scotch whisky, gin and rum.  \u0026ldquoThis volume and complexity will mean that the brewery will need to employ an additional person to run the distillery.  \u0026ldquoIn time the site would like to re-instate a historical greenhouse within the gardens in order to grow their own botanicals to add to the gin however, this will be part of a separate application.  The new still house would mirror the mash house, which was given planning permission in January 2011, in terms of its look.  It is two storeys, with a more modern design than some of the historic buildings on-site.  If the plans were given the green light, work would also be carried out at the main building on the Belhaven site.  A museum is already in place on the ground floor of the main building, with a pub on the first floor.  Plans show a refurbishment of both floors as \u0026ldquothe existing interiors are now tired and dated and in need of a revamp.  The application, which could go before members of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee later this year, adds: \u0026ldquoConsidering the site\u0026rsquos historic importance both locally and within Scotland, it is clear that any development both internally and externally requires to be sensitive.  \u0026ldquoIt is also important to recognise the value of this development in terms of the improved visitor experience, which will impact visitor numbers to the area as a whole, and the business diversification."},{"url":null,"title":"avid-lynyrd-skynyrd-fan-pens-foreword-to-new-book-about-his-idols","story":"  Iain Monk has contributed to The Gospel According to Abraham by Paul Abraham, who was the American band\u0026rsquos road manager for a decade.  The new book is full of stories about the band, best known for hits such as Sweet Home Alabama and Free Bird.  Iain said: \u0026ldquoI became an instant fan of the band in the 1970s and was instantaneously hooked by the music, that kind of southern rock music.  \u0026ldquoMy obsession for the band just grew from there but the first time I saw them live was in 1988 in New York when I flew over to see them.  \u0026ldquoI had written to the band\u0026rsquos management to see if they could help me with tickets and I think they were impressed that I was coming from Scotland to see the band.  \u0026ldquoThat relationship grew with management, road crew and members of the band and I started following them across America.  Iain, who lives in Gullane, has spent countless hours travelling across the globe to see his idols perform at 31 shows, ranging from New York, Boston and Washington to Belgium, the Netherlands and all across the UK.  His friendship with band members and those associated with the band has even seen him spend a week at the family home of Randall Hall, who was the band\u0026rsquos guitarist, in Florida. A friendship also grew with Paul Abraham, with Iain interviewing the road manager for his Lynyrd Skynyrd blog about his intention to write a book.  Iain said the band, which was formed in 1969 and continued following the tragic death of lead singer Ronnie Van Zant in 1977, were \u0026ldquoamazing live but also \u0026ldquolovely people.  He added: \u0026ldquoThey are down to earth, very friendly people in my experience and the people that formed the band are very approachable.  \u0026ldquoI have been very, very fortunate that I have been given access to the band over the years.  \u0026ldquoThat is something most fans would simply not get and I think that is down to trust and trusting me not to take advantage of their generosity.  The 55-year-old was delighted to be asked to write the foreword for the book, which is now available online.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis memoir provides a ringside seat, it is an intriguing glimpse into Skynyrd\u0026rsquos world. Fans will feel more than satisfied. Paul had a lot to get of his chest. The book offers up more explosive revelations than a Donald Trump press conference.  \u0026ldquoOver the many years I followed Skynyrd on tour, I was treated like royalty by the band. That was all down to Paul so I was delighted to contribute to his fascinating book."},{"url":null,"title":"teenage-tranent-judokas-shock-visit-from-love-island-star","story":"  Hannah Wood was stunned when Jack Fowler, one of the stars of the hit ITV2 dating show Love Island, walked through her door on Sunday.  Hannah\u0026rsquos world had come crashing down when she tore her ACL last April while fighting in a competition in Berlin, leaving her facing a summer on crutches.  Having binge-watched Love Island while off her feet, the 16-year-old Ross High School pupil was starstruck when Jack \u0026ndash who was already in Tranent to visit family \u0026ndash appeared at her Church Street home to wish her well.  \u0026ldquoIt was mental, Hannah told the Courier.  \u0026ldquoHe was in Tranent and my little sister [Sophie, 12] had messaged him, and I didn\u0026rsquot know.  \u0026ldquoShe told him I\u0026rsquod had surgery and was being really moody! He said he\u0026rsquod be down soon and the next minute he was at the door!  The 22-year-old came sixth with partner Laura Crane on this year\u0026rsquos season of Love Island. Having only entered the show\u0026rsquos Majorcan villa in the fourth week, he proved an immediate hit with viewers.  \u0026ldquoHe was always my favourite, said Hannah.  \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos just dead nice. He has family up here so he was up visiting them.  \u0026ldquoHe stayed for about 20 minutes. He plays sport too, so he was asking about my injury and about judo.  \u0026ldquoI just asked him about Love Island, and what life was like after the villa.  \u0026ldquoHe said that he had a gut feeling he was going to leave, and that they all shared clothes and had a laugh. He said they\u0026rsquore all best friends after the villa.  But what did Hannah\u0026rsquos mum think when a 6ft 3ins-tall personal trainer from London walked in her door?  \u0026ldquoSophie told her before me but I still think she was a bit confused, Hannah laughed.  After posting news of her surprise house guest online, Hannah said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove gained 4,000 followers on Instagram and had loads of people messaging me wishing me well. My friends all said they should\u0026rsquove come round to see me!

ICOL wants to build a substation, which will bring energy from an offshore windfarm onshore and into the National Grid, on the former power station footprint.  The application has been opposed by local community councils and the council, who believe it is not the best use of the site, which was bought by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower in March and is subject to an ongoing masterplan process for its future.  However, within weeks of the council buying the site, Scottish Ministers called-in the only lodged application for the land, from ICOL.  They said the move was because it was of \u0026ldquonational importance and denied any link to the fact that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on a state visit to China \u0026ndash whose state-owned company Red Rock own ICOL \u0026ndash at the time of the announcement.  The reporter appointed to investigate the application carried out a site visit at the start of this month.  Following that visit, it was announced a hearing into the plans would be held and Allison Coard was named as the appointed reporter who would oversee the hearing and report back to ministers.  Ward councillor Lachlan Bruce welcomed the announcement.  He said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom glad that there is going to be a hearing on this application.  \u0026ldquoI, of course, would prefer if members of the public could also speak at the hearing to give their views and opinions but I do think that community councils being invited is a welcome step.  \u0026ldquoOf course, this is again lengthening the process of the application out. If it had been left by the Scottish Government for East Lothian to make a decision we probably would have had an outcome by now and members of the public would also have had their chance to have a say.  \u0026ldquoI am confident that the hearing will be a further step in helping to convince the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos independent reporter that the current Inch Cape application is wrong for the site and wrong for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton and Prestonpans.  Invitations have been sent out to Prestonpans and Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Councils inviting them to be represented at the hearing, along with East Lothian Council and representatives of ICOL.  All four have confirmed they will be attending the hearing.  In a statement following the visit, it was announced: \u0026ldquoThe reporter considers it would be helpful to have some wider community participation at the hearing and suggests that these views might be represented by one or both of the local community councils.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe appointed Reporter has decided that a hearing should be held on certain matters to help her consider the application, and the council has confirmed in writing that we will participate in this procedure. The council welcomes the Reporter\u0026rsquos decision to invite both Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council and Prestonpans Community Council to participate in the hearing.  A preliminary date for the start of the hearing has been announced as Tuesday, October 2, with a venue and more details of those attending to follow.  A spokesperson for ICOL said: \u0026ldquoWe welcome the announcement that a hearing will take place on the planning application for the proposed substation, in line with planning guidance for schemes of national importance. It is important that the local community has its say and we look forward to engaging with this process."},{"url":null,"title":"looking-back-when-haddington-was-underwater","story":"  John Hamilton of the Facebook page Lost Haddington got in touch with the Courier to highlight how the floods of 1948 would look in present-day Haddington.  He said: \u0026ldquoUsing the flood mark in the video-still as a reference, I got a friend who has access to a theodolite to use this and project this water level to other landmarks around the river and town centre.  \u0026ldquoRobert Byers from Haddington Camera Club then used his photo editing skills and a photoshop \u0026lsquoflood\u0026rsquo plug-in to reconstruct the photos.  In August 1948, persistent heavy rainfall saw the county face its most serious flooding in history.  Although much of East Lothian was affected, Haddington took a major hit. High Street as far west as the Town House was under several feet of water which stretched to the gates of Amisfield Park, a distance of more than half a mile.  Distillery Park, the Nungate, Peffers Place and Brewery Park were similarly devastated.  The Biel Burn also flooded, submerging all the low-lying land north and west of West Barns.  The flood occurred as the culmination of a period of truly exceptional rainfall \u0026ndash 122 mm of rain fell between August 1 and 8, followed by 153 mm in the next five days.  The saturated ground then received a huge 139 mm of rain in the next 24 hours, bringing severe flooding across the county.  The Haddingtonshire Courier reported on \u0026ldquodisastrous flooding without parallel in living memory \u0026ndash if not in history.  In the August 20, 1948 edition of the Courier, \u0026ldquoserious damage was inflicted on the banks of the River Tyne while other streams burst their banks and \u0026ldquoleft destruction in their wake.  It added: \u0026ldquoSo heavy was the flood of water that the streams made courses for themselves, with the result that many people were flooded out of house and home.  \u0026ldquoOne of the worst areas to suffer was Haddington, where a large number of people were rendered homeless, while shops and business premises were flooded to a depth of several feet.  Meanwhile at West Barns, the Biel Burn overflowed, causing serious damage to houses and shops in the village but fortunately \u0026ldquono loss of life is reported, although some people had narrow escapes, so suddenly did the water levels rise.  The floods also caused serious damage to crops on farms close to the Tyne and extensive damage was also caused to the now-demolished New County Cinema on Hardgate.  Nungate residents who had been enjoying the evening\u0026rsquos film were instructed by cinema management to return home to avoid being cut off as water levels rapidly rose.  And slightly further afield, the electricity supply in Gifford and Saltoun was interrupted, and at the Maltings in Haddington the sub-station was completely swept away. It was anticipated it would take many months for the affected areas to return to normal, and calls for assistance to help with the recovery were issued."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-the-commodore-of-haddington","story":"  TEENAGERS often get a bad press. To be sure, it\u0026rsquos a time when parents wonder what has happened to their children and feel they have lost them or gone wrong somewhere. This is because teenage years are a time of great change in terms of brain development. Quite literally the teenage brain is being remodelled and new priorities and emotions are created as a result.  It\u0026rsquos a time when peers and their approval become more important than parents or family, or almost anything else. Taking risks, or doing seemingly foolish things, are all part of this. We are familiar with the term \u0026lsquopeer pressure\u0026rsquo, but in our teenage years, approval by our peers and being included by them takes on a massive importance. It is an essential part of growing up and creating a new self-identity.  And a story from over 200 years ago shows that although the word teenager may not have been invented, and that there was no such thing as \u0026lsquoyouth culture\u0026rsquo as we now know it, behaviour was much the same.  It involves a group of young men who we would now call teenagers. They were a group of friends from Haddington. They included George Neill, John and William Haldane who were brothers, Peter Martine, Benjie Hunter and John Davie, whose nickname was \u0026lsquoLettie\u0026rsquo. They were all from Haddington, and their escapade became a story told well into their senior years. The nickname \u0026lsquoCommodore\u0026rsquo was coined for George on this day and stayed with him until he took it to his grave many years later.  Much of the tale is left to the imagination but the essentials were well told. One of the group came up with the idea of hiring a boat and heading out to Fife. These young men were not from poor backgrounds and so had the means to do this. So with the madcap plan devised, they set off as a group to the fishing village of Prestonpans.  The negotiations to hire a boat were concluded and they set off for the foreign shore of Fife, aiming for the town of Kirkcaldy. I cannot comment on their sailing abilities but they must have had some experience for they successfully navigated themselves to the shore of the \u0026lsquoLang Toun\u0026rsquo, possibly using the Lomond hills as a marker.  They came ashore like invading Vikings, intent on mischief. No social media in those days, but each town had a drummer who would disseminate news. And so they found Kirkcaldy\u0026rsquos drummer and paid him to announce to the town that at three in the afternoon there would be a spectacular diving and swimming show at the harbour entrance. The drummer set forth announcing the news, creating an air of expectation.  The group chose Lettie to be the performer. He was the best swimmer amongst them. As 3 o\u0026rsquoclock approached, a large excited crowd assembled on the harbour walls. The Haddington lads looked at each other with wry smiles and secret sniggers. Their ruse had worked, perhaps too successfully.  \u0026ldquoShow them what ye can dae, Lettie was told by his friends. And so Lettie stood on the edge of the boat and dived into the sea, from a height of about two feet. The crowd was silent, except for a wee five-year-old girl who clapped. She was the only one impressed by the spectacle.  There were murmurings as the Kirkcaldy folk began to realise they had been duped and were being made a fool of by these young Haddington lads. The mood began to get angry, and boos were followed by threats and words I cannot print here. It was clear it was time to go.  \u0026ldquoThank ye, the lads said, bowing to the crowd and laughing, mocking them for being so gullible. Stones began to fly towards them as they set off back towards Prestonpans, gesturing to the now-furious crowd. The lads in the boat were hysterical with laughter. They had raided and fooled the \u0026lsquoLang Toun\u0026rsquo.  But then their laughter stopped. Emerging from the harbour was a boat filled with angry Kirkcaldy lads who were shouting serious threats. The prank looked as if it might end unpleasantly so the Haddington lads had no choice but to row for their lives.  George took command. His friends had nicknamed him the Commodore at the beginning of their voyage, not so much because of his nautical skills but because of his leadership qualities. They were now desperately needed.  \u0026ldquoRow lads, row, he called on them. To be truthful the Haddington lads were at a disadvantage. They were not skilled seamen and in truth they were more bookish than brawn. But fear can do mighty things to a man\u0026rsquos capabilities, and as the adrenaline pumped through their veins they found levels of strength they didn\u0026rsquot know they had. They rowed like true Vikings, heave ho, heave ho. The sea splashed at their feet, their hearts nearly burst, but they kept the pace.  Slowly they began to pull ahead from the Kirkcaldy boat. \u0026ldquoKeep rowing, lads, dinnae look back, dinnae slow doon, called George, who was himself rowing as hard as he could. The tide was strong, the night was drawing in and the weather was beginning to change. The Kirkcaldy boat turned back, but the Haddington lads dare not attempt a Fife landing. They had no choice but to cross the Firth.  Darkness fell, then a thick haar covered them in freezing mist. They rowed through the night not sure in which direction they were headed. They wondered if their parents would ever know what had happened to them if, as now seemed likely, they were lost at sea.  The morning sun slowly burned off the mist. Thankfully they were still in the Firth, and there in front of them was the smoke coming from the lums and salt works of Prestonpans. They wept with relief and summoned up their last drops of energy to row ashore. Their final few hundred metres to the stony beach was watched by village children and women drying clothes.  Some fishermen helped pull the boat to land and the Haddington lads literally collapsed out of the vessel onto the beach, utterly exhausted but elated to be still alive.  George Neill was later to become a well-respected Baillie in Haddington, a bookseller and publisher of great local repute. He outlived his friends who had shared that day of adventure and danger.  He was often asked by those who knew him less well: \u0026ldquoWhy do people call you the Commodore? He never tired of telling the tale of his teenage adventure."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-secondary-schools-delighted-with-pupils-exam-results","story":"  This year saw the best pass rate in Higher exams across East Lothian for five years.  East Lothian Council said that pupils across its six secondary schools \u0026ndash Musselburgh Grammar School Knox Academy, Haddington North Berwick High School Preston Lodge High School in Prestonpans Ross High School, Tranent and Dunbar Grammar School \u0026ndash improved their performances, with the number of Highers passed going up to more than 79 per cent.  Lauren Rodger, headteacher at North Berwick High School, told the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe are absolutely delighted.  \u0026ldquoOur Higher results are brilliant and we\u0026rsquore really pleased with how all the current sixth year pupils have performed.  \u0026ldquoI know schools are judged on their exam results, but for us it\u0026rsquos also about seeing the pupils develop \u0026ndash that\u0026rsquos the most pleasing part.  Similarly pleased was Paul Reynolds, the Ross High School headteacher.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are delighted with the exam results.  \u0026ldquoOur Higher results have been record-breaking and the sixth-years who have just left us have got really positive results that will allow them to hopefully go to uni or further education.  Meanwhile, Musselburgh Grammar School is celebrating record attainment levels for S5 and S6 pupils at all levels in this year\u0026rsquos exam results.  Headteacher Colin Gerrie said that there were also many \u0026ldquoexcellent results achieved by pupils in S4.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe results achieved by our students this year are exceptionally good and continue the successes of recent years, with school records broken on an annual basis.  \u0026ldquoWe do not underestimate the hard work of our pupils and the commitment of our teachers to make this happen.  His counterpart at Preston Lodge High School, Gavin Clark, also gave his thoughts.  At PL, four S5 pupils achieved six As at Higher, although the number of pupils gaining one, two, three or four Highers dropped from the last set of results.  Mr Clark added: \u0026ldquoWe expected that to happen, as a result of our regular tracking process.  \u0026ldquoThis dip in no way diminishes the achievements of those who performed so impressively in examinations.  At Knox Academy, new headteacher Susan Cook gave an update on how the school was performing.  She said: \u0026ldquoSeventy-four per cent of S4 pupils attained five or more qualifications at National 3 69 per cent achieved five or more passes at National 4 and 47 per cent achieved five or more passes at National 5 at grades A-C and 55 per cent at grades A-D.  \u0026ldquoThere were some outstanding individual performances in S4, with eight of our candidates achieving seven A passes at N5.  \u0026ldquoThese results are a really strong foundation to build S5 performance upon and I would encourage all parents/carers to continue to support their child to study at home as the transition from S4 to S5 in terms of challenge and pace moves up a few gears and much more study is required, especially at Higher level.  Meanwhile, the performance of S5 pupils in their Higher exams was down on the previous three years.  Ms Cook added: \u0026ldquoFifty-five per cent attained one or more Highers 35 per cent three or more and 16 per cent attained five or more Highers.  \u0026ldquoTwenty-two of our pupils achieved five Highers and some with straights As across all subjects.  \u0026ldquoMany other pupils achieved a mixture of Higher and National 5 awards and will build upon these in their sixth year.  Finally, there was \u0026ldquoan improving trend for S6 pupils over the last four years at Higher level, Ms Cook added.  The headteacher said: \u0026ldquoThose attaining one or more Highers was 62 per cent and then added to their results from S4 and S5 (accumulate) this rose to 76.22 per cent having achieved one or more Highers over S5/S6 \u0026ndash one per cent lower than last year, which in terms of statistics is not significant. However, it\u0026rsquos more than 13 per cent more than pupils attained in 2015 and 2016.  \u0026ldquoThirty per cent of the year group attained three or more Highers and the accumulate total was 66 per cent (12 per cent more than last year and the highest value in four years).  Finally, Claire Slowther, headteacher at Dunbar Grammar School, told the Courier that the staff at the school were \u0026ldquovery pleased with the exam results and said: \u0026ldquoAt Dunbar Grammar we are very pleased with the SQA results our students have achieved.  \u0026ldquoIt is wonderful to see the hard work of our students be rewarded with great results.  \u0026ldquoOur excellent team of teachers always work hard to support and challenge students and we were all really delighted to see them do well.  \u0026ldquoWe are incredibly proud of the achievements of our students and are looking forward to celebrating these at our awards evening, which will be held on September 12."},{"url":null,"title":"plans-for-longniddry-south-to-go-on-display","story":"  Developers Cruden Homes (East) and ZeroC will be displaying their proposals for development at the Longniddry Inn on Wednesday from 3pm to 8pm.

The site is located around Longniddry Farm, to the south of the vilage\u0026rsquos railway line, and follows the approval by East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos planning committee of 450 new homes at the site last August, with formal planning permission in principle issued in June.  The initial plans were approved despite concerns that the new development could split the village in two.  The development includes about 25 per cent affordable homes plus associated commercial and retail space, community facilities, infrastructure and green space.

The letter also accuses Pope Francis of having initially rehabilitated McCarrick despite being informed of his attitudes to young seminarians in 2013, soon after he was elected pope.          https://t.co/UlmCN46aui          \u0026mdash N. Catholic Register (@NCRegister) August 26, 2018  The National Catholic Register and another conservative site, LifeSiteNews, published the letter attributed to Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano on Sunday as the pope was wrapping up a two-day visit to Ireland.  Mr Vigano, 77, a conservative whose hardline anti-gay views are well known, also urged the reformist pope to resign over the issue.  He and the pope have long been on opposite ideological sides, with the pope seen more as a pastor and Mr Vigano more a cultural warrior.  The Vatican did not immediately comment on the letter or confirm its authenticity.  In it, Mr Vigano accused the former Vatican secretaries of state under the previous two popes of having ignored detailed denunciations against McCarrick for years.  He said Pope Benedict XVI eventually sanctioned McCarrick in 2009 or 2010 to a lifetime of penance and prayer, but that Francis subsequently rehabilitated him.  Francis accepted McCarrick\u0026rsquos resignation as cardinal last month, after a US church investigation determined that an accusation he had sexually abused a minor was credible.  Since then, another man has come forward saying McCarrick began molesting him starting when he was 11, and several former seminarians have said McCarrick abused and harassed them when they were in seminary.  The accusations have led to a crisis in confidence in the US hierarchy, because it was apparently an open secret that McCarrick regularly invited seminarians to his New Jersey beach house, and into his bed.  Mr Vigano apparently sought to answer some of those questions. His letter identifies by name the Vatican cardinals and archbishops who were informed about the McCarrick affair, an unthinkable expose for a Vatican diplomat to make. He said documents backing up his version of events are in Vatican archives.  Mr Vigano, the Vatican\u0026rsquos ambassador to the US from 2011-2016, said his two immediate predecessors \u0026ldquodid not fail to inform the Holy See about accusations against McCarrick, starting in 2000.  He said Francis asked him about McCarrick when they met on June 23, 2013, at the Vatican\u0026rsquos Santa Marta hotel where the pope lives, three months after Francis was elected pope.  Mr Vigano wrote that he told Francis: \u0026ldquoHoly Father, I don\u0026rsquot know if you know Cardinal McCarrick, but if you ask the Congregation of Bishops, there is a dossier this thick about him. He corrupted generations of seminarians and priests and Pope Benedict ordered him to withdraw to a life of prayer and penance.  The pope declined to confirm or deny the claims.  Francis said the 11-page text by Mr Vigano, which reads as a homophobic manifesto and attack on Francis allies in parts, \u0026ldquospeaks for itself.  Francis was asked during an airborne press conference on Sunday if Mr Vigano\u0026rsquos claims that the two discussed McCarrick in 2013 were true.  The pope was also asked about Mr Vigano\u0026rsquos claims that McCarrick was already under sanction at the time, but that Francis rehabilitated him.  Francis said he had read Mr Vigano\u0026rsquos document and trusted journalists to judge for themselves and said: \u0026ldquoI won\u0026rsquot say a word about it."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7312928.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"what-the-papers-say-august-27","story":"  The Daily  leads with the flab-fighting medical breakthrough that could help tackle middle-age spread.

The investigation is into two complaints of incidents alleged to have taken place at Bute House, the First Minister\u0026rsquos official residence in 2013.  Ms Sturgeon said she agreed to the procedure covering ministers and former ministers in December 2017 but that while she was aware of the investigation she had no role in it.  Ms Sturgeon said that she was initially made aware of the investigation by Mr Salmond himself.  She said: \u0026ldquoAlthough I have been aware for some time of the fact of the investigation \u0026ndash initially from Alex Salmond \u0026ndash I have had no role in the process, and to have referred to it before now would have compromised the integrity of the internal investigation, which I was not prepared to do.  \u0026ldquoHowever, I was informed by the Permanent Secretary earlier this week that she had completed her investigation and that she intended to make the fact of the complaints public.  \u0026ldquoAlex Salmond is now challenging the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedure in court.

It must be applied without fear or favour, regardless of the identity, seniority or political allegiance of the person involved.  Mr Salmond denied the allegations and was taking action against the Scottish Government claiming he was denied the opportunity to refute them.

With lots of second and third cousins in the city it seemed ideal when a teaching post was advertised in a Catholic primary school in nearby Glasgow.  After a successful interview, the usual background checks and an endorsement of her teaching credentials by the General Teaching Council for Scotland she had already started packing when the Home Office advised Glasgow City Council her visa had been rejected.  With her future in turmoil, Ms Farrell will now have to stay in America while the vacant post at St Angela\u0026rsquos Primary School, in Darnley, is re-advertised and she goes through the same visa process again.  \u0026ldquoIt was a dream come true for me to be allowed to enter Scotland to teach. My family is from Scotland so for me this almost feels like coming home, she said.  \u0026ldquoMy paternal grandparents are originally from Paisley and that was the the main reason for my desire to go abroad and teach. I thought I would be coming full-circle if I could return to their home country and teach in Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThis is a goal that I have been working towards for over a year and I have invested a lot of time and money into this process. I also resigned from my teaching post in Virginia and moved my life back to my parents\u0026rsquo house before the move to Scotland.  \u0026ldquoDue to this setback it seems that I am in limbo, living back home with my parents without a job. It is still my goal to come to Scotland, and I am hopeful that it will happen because I know I can be an asset. I just need someone to give me that chance.  Despite widespread teacher vacancies across Scotland and a particular shortage of approved Catholics in the denominational sector, Ms Farrell was declined under the complex Home Office points based system.  Because the Westminster Government\u0026rsquos monthly immigration cap has already been reached it means all applicants are judged against each other on a set of criteria - including salary levels.  Those in occupations where there are shortages, such as the medical sector, are given priority with the rest of the places allocated according to factors such as level of salary or qualifications.  Teaching is currently not viewed as a shortage occupation and does not command the same sort of salaries as other professions.  Glasgow City Council has now re-advertised the post with the hope that the visa application will be successful at the second attempt.  Ms Farrell is also hopeful she will be soon be able to pursue her dream move.  She said: \u0026ldquoI was heartbroken when I received word that my sponsorship had been refused, but I am very fortunate that Glasgow has not given up on me and they still are going to reapply for the sponsorship.  A spokeswoman for Glasgow City Council said: \u0026ldquoFollowing a successful interview the teacher has been offered a job in Glasgow and we will do everything in our power to help her secure the correct documentation in order to teach.  A Home Office spokeswoman said the government recognised the contribution of international teachers, but the immigration system was designed to ensure employers \u0026ldquolooked first to the UK resident labour market before recruiting from overseas.  She added: \u0026ldquoWhen demand exceeds the monthly available allocation of places, priority is given to applicants filling a shortage or PhD-level occupation.  \u0026ldquoNo occupation on the shortage occupation list \u0026ndash which is based on advice by the independent Migration Advisory Committee \u0026ndash has been refused a place.  The Home Office is currently looking at creating more flexibility in the system by creating a specific category for doctors and nurses which will free up more places for other occupations.  Research by The Herald earlier this month revealed there were nearly 700 teacher vacancies at primaries and secondaries across Scotland.  Councils facing some of the most acute shortages include those in the North East such as Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire and Moray, but there were also shortages in Glasgow.  Teaching unions argue the main problem is pay and conditions with the increasing workload of staff putting off recruits at a time when salaries have declined in real terms.  Glasgow also has an issue with the number of teachers with Catholic approval in its denominational sector.  It is not uncommon for there to be at least 40 teachers working in the sector who don\u0026rsquot have approval every year because of the wider shortages.  In 2016 Archbishop Philip Tartaglia, president of the Catholic Education Commission, said there would be \u0026lsquosignificant consequences\u0026rsquo for Catholic education should the \u0026lsquoacute\u0026rsquo problem not be addressed."},{"url":null,"title":"vicky-allan-argento-allegations-say-its-time-for-mentoo","story":"  The then 37-year-old had also, it was revealed, paid the actor off to the sum of around \u0026pound300,000. Although she issued a denial that sex had taken place, photographs emerged which appeared to show them lying together.  A story like this was probably bound to hit #MeToo at some point. Indeed, the movement has already had its debate over what our reaction should be if a #MeToo victim looks to also be an abuser, when Junot Diaz, after writing of his childhood abuse, was accused of sexual misconduct himself.  But the impact of the Argento allegations is different \u0026ndash for she has been such a key icon of the movement. An early accuser of Harvey Weinstein, she once threatened other abusers: \u0026ldquoWe know who you are, and we are not going to allow you to get away with it any longer.  Personally, I don\u0026rsquot think this is a bad moment for #MeToo. This is where the movement has to come of age, to acknowledge complexity, take in male survivors, and shift its image away from being a movement for a female celebrity elite. Where it goes from here is dependent on how it frames the problem of Argento, and its ability to remind the world that it is a movement not of flawed and complex leaders, but about principles. That hasn\u0026rsquot happened yet.  What do we do with a problem like Argento? The accusations against her do need to be taken seriously. They\u0026rsquore also a reminder that we need to look at the way women too may abuse their power. She was, notably, his director and co-star when he was seven.  Does that mean I believe Jimmy Bennett and not Asia Argento? I certainly don\u0026rsquot disbelieve him. The #MeToo credo has always been to believe the accuser. That has never, it has seemed to me, been what\u0026rsquos most important. What, above all, we owe victims is not to discredit them.  Yet Argento \u0026ndash unsurprisingly given she is the accused, yet hypocritically given she is #MeToo \u0026ndash has discredited Bennett, impugning him as a grifter, out for the money. It is this that has been hardest to square.  Not only that but, on social media, we see Bennett discredited by the public mob, just as we have seen so many female accusers discredited, including Argento. The tone is not quite the same, but there are similarities. He is cast as a gold-digger, someone who really wanted the sex \u0026ndash for after all what 17-year-old boy, so the story goes, wouldn\u0026rsquot? Stereotypes about young male sexual appetites abound.  What the Asia Argento story is a reminder of is that the question of who is a victim, who is a perpetrator, who is a survivor, who is an abuser of power, isn\u0026rsquot a matter of identity, but of relations. A person can be at one point in their lives a victim, and another an abuser. That\u0026rsquos the case, regardless of whether you are male or female \u0026ndash we all start out as powerless children.  The problem is the #MeToo movement failed, up till now, to embrace male survivors sufficiently. It was always a little \u0026ldquonot you too. There was always, and I was probably guilty of it myself, a tendency to use the word \u0026ldquoher too much, to frame the cause as a female issue.  But it\u0026rsquos possible for a movement like #MeToo to be about both Asia Argento as victim, and also Jimmy Bennett too. It can contain both. Dealing with that, and many other difficult questions, is key to its evolution.  Leave no stone turned ...  ENOUGH. I\u0026rsquom done with my long, adventurous career as an international beach pebble thief. No longer will I collect small cairns for my bathroom shelves. Nor am I going to continue to lead my children into this life of squalid crime. This, by the way, is not merely triggered by last week\u0026rsquos news story of how a man, threatened with prosecution for stealing stones from a Cornish beach had driven back to return them. Nor is it because I\u0026rsquove only just realised that under the Coast Protection Act1949, this is a crime. I actually quit long ago.  I suspect we\u0026rsquove all stone-thieved at some point. I think of it as one of our early instincts \u0026ndash the finding of a really good stone that fits perfectly into the palm of the hand. But, in these acquisitive times, it\u0026rsquos not just one nice stone, it\u0026rsquos a whole pocketful, or a bag, and then it gets out of control and your yard is like a shingle beach.  Now, there\u0026rsquos nothing really wrong with your small home cairn, but we do have a knack for turning beautiful things into stuff. Plus there are hordes of us \u0026ndash tourists, they call us \u0026ndash at it.  The stone that was a thing of beauty on the beach too often becomes a bit of clutter around the house. I know the temptation. I have it every time I visit the beach. Stone gathering is irresistible.  But then I look at my treasured pile and think to myself \u0026ldquobetter just leave it, they look loveliest here."},{"url":null,"title":"stuc-in-firing-line-over-relying-on-snp-government-for-60-of-funding","story":"  Leaked documents show that the STUC, which speaks for nearly 500,000 workers, received around 60 per cent of its income from Nicola Sturgeon\u0026rsquos Government last year.  The \u0026pound2.6 million in public funding far exceeds the sum paid to the STUC in fees from its own members.  Meanwhile, the GMB union, one of the umbrella group\u0026rsquos biggest members, said in a statement that they had raised concerns about \u0026ldquotransparency and accountability in the running of the STUC.  Founded in 1897, the Glasgow-based STUC acts as the voice of the trade union movement and lobbies Government for policy changes. It represents the interests of members in 39 unions and 20 trades union councils, and is financed by affiliation fees.  Although the STUC is not aligned to a political party, the body had a high-profile role promoting devolution in the 1980s and 1990s.  However, senior trade union figures told this newspaper that the STUC, led by general secretary Grahame Smith, was too reliant on the Scottish Government and had lost its way.  The STUC is now facing questions about its relationship with the Government and the financial model on which the organisation is based.  Unlike the TUC \u0026ndash its UK sister organisation \u0026ndash the STUC is under no obligation to make its annual financial statements available outwith affiliated unions.  A spin-off firm, STUC Training Ltd, publishes accounts, but a detailed picture of the income of the body is not in the public domain.  According to documents presented to the annual congress in Aviemore this year, the STUC and its training arm had a combined income of around \u0026pound4.3m in 2017. Of this sum, less than 25 per cent came in the form of affiliation fees from trade unionists.  The biggest chunk of cash, \u0026pound2.3m, was given to STUC Training Ltd by the SNP Government for the \u0026ldquoScottish Union Learning initiative, which promotes skills and lifelong learning. Funds through the scheme are provided to the STUC, which distributes resources for different projects to help union members.  Another budget line also shows that the STUC received \u0026pound324,440 from the Government for the \u0026ldquoUnion Modernisation Fund.  This new pot was announced by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon as a way of mitigating what she described as Tory legislation that \u0026ldquothreatens the unions. For every pound received by the STUC in 2017, around 60p came from the SNP Government, whose policies the civic body attempts to influence.  One critic of Smith\u0026rsquos leadership said the STUC had offered occasional criticism of the SNP Government, such as questioning rates relief for small business.  However, Smith is a member of the First Minister\u0026rsquos Standing Council on Europe and he backed the SNP Government position in the row over a Brexit \u0026ldquopower grab of Holyrood powers. The STUC also provided a mild quote in response to the findings of the SNP Growth Commission, a report that was widely criticised by figures on the political Left.  Liberal Democrat MSP Alex Cole-Hamilton said: \u0026ldquoThe trade union movement is a vital part of public life and the defence of workers\u0026rsquo rights. They should always be utterly independent both of management and of Government. So to learn that the STUC gets the majority of funding from the Scottish Government puts that independence into question.  \u0026ldquoThey should be a champion for trade unions and of working people above all things, but many have been concerned that they have seemed to have pulled their punches recently over criticising the SNP Government on things like the austerity proposed by the Growth Commission.  Scottish Tory MSP Bill Bowman said: \u0026ldquoThe STUC is curiously quiet when it comes to criticising the Scottish Government.  \"Perhaps it\u0026rsquos a case of not biting the hand that feeds you.  \u0026ldquoIf the SNP Government is bankrolling the STUC, that explains why the organisation is so reluctant to question SNP decisions. No such problem seems to exist in relation to the UK Government.  \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos a blatant conflict of interest here, and one which raises serious questions about the STUC\u0026rsquos ability to function transparently and responsibly.  A senior trade union figure said: \u0026ldquoThis is a serious situation for the STUC. Relying on external funding from the Scottish Government not only undermines the future sustainability of the organisation, it places a significant question mark over their ability to scrutinise and challenge Scottish Government policy making.  Separately, the STUC also faced criticism after an employment tribunal ruled that a staff member had been victimised by selecting him for redundancy.  The STUC failed to have the ruling overturned in an appeal and is in line for a hefty legal bill.  The Sunday Herald asked some of the STUC\u0026rsquos biggest affiliates for a comment on the tribunal case, but most did not provide a comment.  However, a spokesperson for GMB Scotland, one of the country\u0026rsquos biggest unions, said: \u0026ldquoThe judgment is troubling \u0026ndash victimisation in the workplace isn\u0026rsquot acceptable.  The statement added: \u0026ldquoOn numerous occasions we have raised our concerns about transparency and accountability in the running of the STUC, to defend the jobs and conditions of the staff we represent within the STUC and for the organisation\u0026rsquos ability to campaign effectively on behalf of all its affiliate members in future.  \u0026ldquoGMB Scotland will continue to seek to address those concerns through the internal processes of the STUC.  An STUC spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe funds received by the STUC from the Scottish Government are to fund learning and development projects run by our affiliated unions that provide learning opportunities for over 9,000 trade union members every year.  \u0026ldquoThese projects make a significant contribution to upskilling and reskilling the workforce and to our shared objective with the Scottish Government of achieving a more inclusive economy.  \u0026ldquoThe STUC is not dependent on Scottish Government funding. If this funding was not provided, thousands of low-paid, low-skilled workers would be deprived of the opportunity for personal and professional development.  On the GMB criticism, the spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThere are multiple opportunities available to all of our affiliates to ensure we remain transparent and accountable, principally our Annual Congress which elects and holds to account our General Council on which members of the GMB serve.  \u0026ldquoConcerns raised by the GMB, which align with the specific issues mentioned above, have already been addressed directly with its Scottish secretary."},{"url":null,"title":"new-zealand-comic-rose-matafeo-named-funniest-at-the-edinburgh-fringe","story":"  Matafeo, 26, received the prize from Alan Partridge comedian Steve Coogan, who himself won the award in 1992.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called Mr McCain a \u0026ldquofascinating personality.  \u0026ldquoHe would occasionally be in a bad place with various members, including myself, and when this would blow over it was like nothing ever happened, Mr McConnell said Saturday after a Republican state dinner in Lexington, Kentucky.  \u0026ldquoHe also had a wicked sense of humour and it made every tense moment come out better.

It was the film\u0026rsquos soundtrack that breathed new life into the disco craze of the late Seventies and propelled the Bee Gees to global chart dominance.  Famously, Maurice, who died in 2003 aged 53, composed the track on the guitar after driving across a bridge in Florida and hearing the rhythm made by the car\u0026rsquos tyres on the road surface.  The guitar will be sold at Wiltshire-based auctioneers Gardiner Houlgate next month in what will be the UK\u0026rsquos largest ever auction of guitars.  Jive Talkin\u0026rsquo was the first single from the Bee Gees\u0026rsquo 1975 album Main Course, which marked the turning point in their career as they moved away from ballads, which were the hallmark of their early career, to disco.  The song was regarded as the Bee Gees\u0026rsquo comeback after a lull in popularity in the early Seventies.  In 1987, Maurice donated the guitar to BBC Radio 1 to give away as a prize on The Bruno Brookes show, for which it was autographed by all three Gibb brothers.  The prize winner subsequently sold the guitar on Channel 4\u0026rsquos Four Rooms show in 2014.  Also being sold is a second Maurice Gibb-owned guitar, an exceptionally rare custom-made 1968 Gibson EBS-1250 double-neck, which combines a bass and guitar into a single instrument.  The guitar was sold by Maurice in 1974 to another musician and collector, who has owned the guitar ever since. It is believed to be the only one of its kind made by Gibson in 1968.  Auctioneer Luke Hobbs said: \u0026ldquoBee Gees\u0026rsquo instruments are exceptionally rare and neither of these guitars has ever been offered for public auction before.  \u0026ldquoWe have great provenance on both. The J45 is well documented as the guitar on which Maurice Gibb composed Jive Talkin\u0026rsquo. We\u0026rsquove also got the letter from Radio 1 to the gentleman who won it.  \u0026ldquoMaurice was photographed performing with the doubleneck and he can be seen playing it on stage in a video on YouTube.  \u0026ldquoThese guitars represent the two great phases of the Bee Gees\u0026rsquo career.  \u0026ldquoThe double-neck comes from the Sixties and early Seventies when they sang popular ballads the J45 represents their comeback and the disco years.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos not often you get to encapsulate a band\u0026rsquos career so succinctly in a single auction.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove over 400 guitars in September\u0026rsquos sale, making this the largest ever auction of guitars held in the UK, possibly the world. We\u0026rsquore expecting massive international interest.  Both Bee Gees\u0026rsquo guitars are being sold by UK-based private collectors and each is expected to fetch over \u0026pound10,000 when they are auctioned on September 12.

Bear in mind that the Chequers deal already concedes enormous amounts to the EU.  Mr Hammond\u0026rsquos comments emerged hours after Mr Raab had attempted to play down the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit while outlining the impact of such a scenario via a series of technical papers.  Mr Hammond on Thursday was accused of launching a \u0026ldquododgy Project Fear with his letter.  The Chancellor said that his initial January analysis on GDP and borrowing was undergoing a \u0026ldquoprocess of refinement ahead of a parliamentary vote on any deal, noting scenarios which have higher barriers to trade with the EU are expected to have a \u0026ldquomore damaging effect on the economy and public finances.  He also defended the Government\u0026rsquos preferred approach, which was outlined in a white paper following a Cabinet summit at Chequers, by saying the economic and fiscal impacts of this would be \u0026ldquosubstantially better than no deal.  Mr Raab risked a Cabinet row with Mr Hammond after questioning the worth of economic forecasts about Brexit.  In an interview with the Sunday Times, the Brexit Secretary said that GDP estimates for 2019 \u0026ldquohave been revised up.

Peter Grant, the Nationalists\u0026rsquo Europe spokesman at Westminster, recently warned that there was \"not a rope in existence that is strong enough\" to hold Scotland to the rest of the UK if the Conservative Government pursued a \"cliff-edge\" Brexit.  Last week, following the publication of the first tranche of papers setting out Theresa May\u0026rsquos no-deal contingency plans, Nicola Sturgeon claimed that quitting the EU without an agreement would be an \u0026ldquounmitigated disaster while her Scottish Cabinet colleague Michael Russell branded such a scenario a \u0026ldquonightmare.  In contrast, David Lidington, the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos effective deputy, argued that a no-deal Brexit would in no way jeopardise the Union, saying the \u0026ldquostrength of the United Kingdom would continue regardless.  Earlier this month, the First Minister signalled that she was unlikely to be able to make a definitive decision on calling for a second independence referendum this autumn because of the uncertainties surrounding Brexit.  However, both Brussels and London have indicated that people will know by early November whether or not a deal is doable. Ms Sturgeon could make her key announcement within days of this development although Mrs May has made clear repeatedly that she would not facilitate a second independence poll before the next General Election due in 2022.  Commenting on Mr Van Rompuy\u0026rsquos remarks, a Downing Street spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoWe have always said the United Kingdom would continue to thrive in the event of a no-deal Brexit. But we are confident of getting a good deal one that delivers for every part of the United Kingdom and takes back control of our money, laws and our borders. That is what this Government will deliver.  Ex-SNP MP John Nicolson tweeted: \u0026ldquoNot many up sides to #Brexit but this may be one. People are beginning to focus and ask, again, why we were so misled during #indyref We have a bright future, independent and in the #EU.\"  The ex-EU Council President told The Observer: \u0026ldquoThe no-deal issue is not just a problem for the UK or Brussels, it is also an existential threat to the UK itself.  \u0026ldquoOne can imagine that a no-deal will have a big impact and cause concern in some of the regions.

This talk about a \u0026lsquono-deal\u0026rsquo is the kind of Nationalist rhetoric that belongs to another era.  Mr Van Rompuy, the first person to hold the European Council presidency, also suggested that a no-deal outcome would almost certainly lead to fresh elections in Britain.  \u0026ldquoIf there is no House of Commons support for no-deal, then you are very close to new elections. If you have new elections, then Article 50 [the legal process for Britain\u0026rsquos exit] will have to be postponed because it will not be clear that you will have a government or a government with a programme.  The former Brussels chief highlighted the Commission\u0026rsquos main objection to Mrs May\u0026rsquos proposal: the separating out of goods and services, which it believes would give the UK a major economic advantage.  He explained: \u0026ldquoIt is rather difficult to make a distinction between goods and services. We are living in a new economy where there is a mix of goods and services for the same kinds of products. Saying that we will have a customs union, or even going further with a single market for goods, and completely separate it from a single market in services, this is what [chief EU negotiator Michel] Barnier called unworkable.

There are no plans to step down any time soon.\"  It is expected that the Lib Dem leader will at conference unveil proposals to create a registered supporters scheme, similar to the one that allowed 180,000 people to vote in the Labour leadership elections.  Rules will also be rewritten so that supporters will need to be enrolled for at least 12 months before voting, to prevent any infiltration or undue influence by rival parties.  Sources suggested that Sir Vince hoped to emulate the success of Justin Trudeau\u0027s Liberal Party in Canada, which introduced the changes and went from third to first place in its 2015 election victory.  A consultation on the proposed changes is expected to last several months.  The party currently has 12 MPs four of whom are Scots: Ms Swinson Orkney and Shetland MP Alistair Carmichael, the former Scottish Secretary in the Lib-Con Coalition Christine Jardine, who represents Edinburgh West and Jamie Stone, who is MP for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross.  Some UK parties have had leaders who have not been at Westminster. The highest profile is Nicola Sturgeon, the current SNP leader and First Minister. Natalie Bennett, who was not an MP, led the Green Party between 2012 and 2016. She stood unsuccessfully at the 2015 General Election."},{"url":null,"title":"brexiteer-jacob-rees-mogg-criticised-after-suggesting-irish-border-inspections-post-brexit","story":"  Simon Coveney, Ireland\u0026rsquos Deputy Prime Minister, took to social media to say it was hard to believe such a senior British politician could be \u0026ldquoso ill-informed as to make such comments after the Somerset MP\u0026rsquos remarks, filmed during a town hall meeting, were disseminated.  The issue of how to keep frictionless trade across the Irish border has become arguably the biggest stumbling block to getting a deal with Brussels on Brexit.  But Mr Rees-Mogg, who leads the pro-hard Brexit European Research Group faction of Conservative MPs, told the town hall meeting that Ireland \"would not be a free-for-all\" and that \"historic arrangements\" could continue.  He explained: \"There would be our ability, as we had during the Troubles, to have people inspected. It\u0027s not a border that everyone has to go through every day. But, of course, for security reasons during the Troubles, we kept a very close eye on the border to try and stop gun-running and things like that.  The Tory backbencher added: \"It\u0026rsquos not inconsistent to have a border that people can pass through but you are keeping an eye on.\"  However, Mr Coveney tweeted: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos hard to believe that a senior politician is so ill-informed about Ireland + the politics of the #Brexit Irish border issue that he could make comments like these. We have left \u0026ldquothe troubles behind us, through the sincere efforts of many, + we intend on keeping it that way.  Sir Keir Starmer, the Shadow Brexit Secretary, also hit out at Mr Rees-Mogg, declaring: \"This man knows nothing of Northern Ireland.\"  His Labour colleague David Lammy insisted peace on the island of Ireland could not be allowed to be torn apart by \"hard right ideologues\"."},{"url":null,"title":"tory-arrogance-on-brexit-likely-to-push-more-scots-to-back-independence-claims-snp","story":"  Peter Grant, the Nationalists\u0026rsquo Europe spokesman at Westminster, warned there is \"not a rope in existence that is strong enough\" to hold Scotland to the rest of the UK if the Conservative Government pursued a \"cliff-edge\" Brexit.  SNP colleague Stephen Gethins added that \u0026ldquothe arrogant behaviour of the Tory Government\" is likely to make a growing number of people in Scotland \"see the benefits and attractions of independence\".  They spoke out after former European Council President Mr Van Rompuy argued that leaving the EU without an agreement would pose an \u0026ldquoexistential threat to the UK.  But the Scottish Conservatives have urged Mr Van Rompuy to \u0026ldquostop trying to interfere in UK domestic politics, while the Scottish Liberal Democrats warned against compounding \u0026ldquothe chaos of Brexit with the chaos of independence.  In his controversial intervention, the ex-chief Eurocrat said: \u0026ldquoThe no-deal issue is not just a problem for the UK or Brussels, it is also an existential threat to the UK itself.  \u0026ldquoOne can imagine that a no-deal will have a big impact and cause concern in some of the regions. Speaking of Scotland, it could have consequences for them and others.  Mr Van Rompuy also told The Observer: \u0026ldquoWe could end up with a situation in which the EU27 becomes more united and a United Kingdom less united. This talk about a \u0026lsquono-deal\u0026rsquo is the kind of Nationalist rhetoric that belongs to another era.  His remarks echo recent ones from some senior SNP figures, who have equated a hard or no-deal Brexit with a renewed push for Scottish independence.  Responding to the former Brussels chief\u0027s intervention, Fife MP Mr Gethins said: \u0026ldquoThe Tory Government thinks it can do whatever it wants to Scotland with its shambolic, disastrous hard Brexit plans and get away with it.  \u0026ldquoScotland voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU and, since the referendum over two years ago, Scotland\u0026rsquos voice and votes have been ignored. At the same time, the Tory Government in Westminster is using Brexit as a means of ploughing ahead with its power-grab from the devolved administrations.  But Paul Masterton, of the Scottish Conservatives, dismissed Mr Van Rompuy\u0026rsquos remarks as \u0026ldquoutter nonsense.  The East Renfrewshire MP said: \u0026ldquoNo matter what the outcome of the Brexit negotiations, nothing will be helped by Scotland leaving the UK.  \u0026ldquoScots know that you don\u0026rsquot solve leaving one Union by leaving another one that is far more important to us economically.  \u0026ldquoRather than weigh in unnecessarily, Herman Van Rompuy should stop trying to interfere and let us get on with delivering a Brexit deal that will work for the whole of the UK.  Willie Rennie, the Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, suggested nothing good could come of a no-deal Brexit.  Insisting a People\u0026rsquos Vote on the final deal was the \u0026ldquoonly logical way forward, he added: \u0026ldquoWe should not compound the chaos of Brexit with the chaos of independence. Surely the lesson of Brexit is that breaking up is a bad idea?  Last week, following the publication of the first tranche of papers setting out Theresa May\u0026rsquos no-deal contingency plans, Nicola Sturgeon claimed that quitting the EU without an agreement would be an \u0026ldquounmitigated disaster while her Scottish Cabinet colleague Michael Russell branded such a scenario a \u0026ldquonightmare.  In contrast, David Lidington, the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos effective deputy, argued that a no-deal Brexit would in no way jeopardise the Union, saying the \u0026ldquostrength of the United Kingdom would continue regardless.  Earlier this month, the First Minister signalled that she was unlikely to be able to make a definitive decision on calling for a second independence referendum this autumn because of the uncertainties surrounding Brexit.  However, both Brussels and London have indicated that people will know by early November whether or not a deal is doable. Ms Sturgeon could make her key announcement within days of this development although Mrs May has made clear repeatedly she would not facilitate a second independence poll.  Meanwhile, Downing Street, commenting on Mr Van Rompuy\u0026rsquos remarks, said: \u0026ldquoWe have always said the United Kingdom would continue to thrive in the event of a no-deal Brexit. But we are confident of getting a good deal one that delivers for every part of the United Kingdom and takes back control of our money, laws and our borders. That is what this Government will deliver."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-to-chair-special-cabinet-to-try-to-unify-colleagues-in-final-brexit-deal-push","story":"  The Prime Minister is preparing for a special Cabinet get-together in September when she hopes to eradicate the Brexit bickering and build a unified approach among colleagues ahead of the final push for a deal the last key brainstorming session at Chequers led to the resignations of Boris Johnson and David Davis.  This week, Dominic Raab, the Brexit Secretary, will return to Brussels for more talks with Michel Barnier, the EU\u0026rsquos chief negotiator, as discussions are put on a \u0026ldquocontinuous footing.  It will begin the most intensive period on Brexit as the final deadline on any deal begins to near with Westminster returning from its summer recess on September 4, the special Brexit Cabinet due on September 13, the party conference season starting the same week, an informal EU summit in Salzburg on September 20, where the PM hopes to raise Brexit over dinner, and the European Council\u0026rsquos crunch meeting on Brexit on October 18/19.  After the Chancellor warned of a significant fiscal impact on the back of a no-deal \u0026ndash higher borrowing of \u0026pound80 billion a year - his former Cabinet colleague, David Davis lashed out at \"bogus\" Treasury forecasts.  The former Brexit Secretary and a leading Brexiteer accused Mr Hammond of being \"either spectacularly incompetent, or deliberate\", adding: \"I know what I think.\"  He accused the Treasury of having \u0026ldquotrouble forecasting deficits even 12 months ahead\" and said Mr Hammond\u0026rsquos comments were an \u0026ldquoattempt to frighten the population into imagining the most terrible consequences of leaving the European Union without a deal.  Mr Davis went on: \"And even more disgraceful, by doing so it will undermine the Government\u0027s hand in striking a deal with the EU. If they do not think we dare walk away, then they will give us the worst deal they can think of. Bear in mind that the Chequers deal already concedes enormous amounts to the EU.\"  Meanwhile, Mr Raab, in an interview with the Sunday Times, noted how the latest GDP estimates for 2019 had been \u0026ldquorevised up\".  Without naming Mr Hammond, he echoed Mr Davis, saying: \"I\u0027m always chary of any forecast because most of them have been proved to be wrong.\" He suggested such fiscal projections had to be treated with a \u0026ldquomeasure of caution.  Elsewhere, Nigel Farage pledged to return to the stump to \u0026ldquorestart the Brexit campaign as Leave Means Leave announced a bid to create a \u0026pound5 million war-chest over the next three months.  The former Ukip leader, who is Vice-chairman of the campaign, declared: \u0026ldquoI am going back on the road with Leave Means Leave to restart the referendum campaign.  Noting how the first campaign event would be in Bolton on September 22, he said: \u0026ldquoThis issue is above party politics and has never been a debate about left or right. Our task is to mobilise the millions of alienated and angry voters and to get them to put real pressure on their MPs not to betray Brexit in the coming months. They need to know that if they do, they will lose their job."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-insists-no-legal-basis-to-suspend-alex-salmond-from-snp","story":"  The declaration by the First Minister came as political opponents called for \u0026ldquofull transparency about any meetings that occurred between the two senior Nationalists regarding the claims against the former party leader, who has forcefully denied them.  In a statement, Ms Sturgeon explained that the party had not received any complaints about her predecessor\u0027s conduct nor had it carried out the formal investigation. But, she stressed, the matter would be reconsidered if the situation were to change.  \"The party\u0027s rules apply to all members and no-one is above them,\" declared the FM.  She noted that, as with any other organisation, due process must be followed. Yet she pointed out: \u0026ldquoIn this case, unlike in some previous cases, the investigation into complaints about Alex Salmond has not been conducted by the SNP and no complaints have been received by the party.  \"Also, for legal reasons, the limited information I have about the Scottish Government investigation cannot at this stage be shared with the party. And, rightly, it is the party, not me as leader, that has the power to suspend membership.  \"In summary, the party has no legal basis at this time to suspend Alex Salmond\u0027s membership, added Ms Sturgeon.  The allegations about Mr Salmond\u0027s conduct towards two staff members in 2013 - while he was in office - have now been handed to Police Scotland.  Leslie Evans, Permanent Secretary at the Scottish Government, said the complaints were raised in January and the former SNP leader was notified in March about an investigation.  She had intended to make a statement but the move was halted after Mr Salmond initiated legal proceedings.  Meanwhile, Scottish Labour said it was \u0026ldquounderstood the FM and her predecessor had met on \u0026ldquomultiple occasions to discuss the case.  It called for publication of the times, dates and minutes of any such meetings as well as clarification about whether Mr Salmond had asked Ms Sturgeon to interfere in the investigation.  Rhoda Grant, Scottish Labour\u0026rsquos Women\u0026rsquos spokeswoman, declared: \u0026ldquoThe people of Scotland expect full transparency in this case. She stressed that it would be completely unacceptable if the details of any Sturgeon/Salmond meetings remained secret.  \u0026ldquoThe allegations against Alex Salmond are incredibly serious. His meetings with the head of a government that was investigating him must not be kept under wraps. Nicola Sturgeon must publish the details and minutes of these meetings as soon as possible.  \"The SNP must also do all it can to give complainants the support they need, whoever the alleged perpetrator is, and make clear that there is safe space for any other survivors to come forward.  Ms Grant added: \u0026ldquoNicola Sturgeon should finally suspend Alex Salmond from the SNP immediately.  Annie Wells, the Scottish Conservative Equalities spokeswoman, said, despite Ms Sturgeon\u0026rsquos latest statement, many questions remained unanswered.  \u0026ldquoWe are still none the wiser as to the way the assault was treated when it was alleged to have taken place, nor do we know when anyone in the SNP or the Scottish Government was informed about the incident.  She added: \u0026ldquoAs the First Minister herself states, these are very serious allegations as such, they deserve to be taken seriously and that means seeing full transparency from the SNP and the Scottish Government as to how they handled it.  Jo Swinson for the Liberal Democrats stressed how people on all sides of the political divide needed to \u0026ldquoresist the temptation to make party political capital from a situation involving allegations of sexual harassment.  She explained: \u0026ldquoSupporters of Scottish independence should abandon Unionist conspiracy theories and supporters of the UK should be wary of immediately branding the SNP leadership of complicity.  \u0026ldquoWhat\u0026rsquos important now is that the police investigation is able to proceed unimpinged by political pressure and it should proceed irrespective of the outcome of the Court of Session case.  \u0026ldquoAny flaws in the internal government process do not trump the imperative of a thorough investigation of the allegations by the police.  The Lib Dem deputy leader added: \u0026ldquoWe should be wary of inflammatory words and partisan statements which distract from the matter at hand and could discourage women and men, who have experienced similar situations, from coming forward."},{"url":null,"title":"brewdog told to pay sacked worker 12k","story":"        A former employee of Ellon-based brewers, BrewDog, has won his employment tribunal case after being sacked because he was losing his eyesight!

James Ross, 47,  who worked in the warehouse advised the company he was suffering from an eye condition which meant he was losing his sight.                                                    The company’s response was to suspend him from his post in order to explore options, but then later sacked him, despite them having been advised by medical experts on the condition, that with some suitable adjustments to his working conditions, he could continue to be a valuable employee.        The employment tribunal which heard the case has now issued its ruling that BrewDog unlawfully discriminated against Mr Ross and treated him unfavourably because of his condition.The company, which has been valued at £1.8bn were told to pay compensation to Mr Ross in the sum of £12,052.New legislation which passed into law in 2015 prevented the tribunal from ordering that BrewDog staff undergo further equality training.A spokesman for the company said: “This was a really difficult situation for every member of our team involved in it, and clearly for the Tribunal panel too as their decision on the outcome was split.                                                                                                         “We worked with James in order to find a suitable alternative role within the business where his safety would not be compromised, but James wanted to keep his packaging role. “We ended up in a position where we had to balance James’ wishes with the best interests of the team around him, and while we regret that an agreement couldn’t be reached, we have a moral responsibility to prioritise the safety of our team. “We wish James all the best in his new role and his upcoming studies.”RNIB Scotland, which supports blind and partially sighted people, said: “Many employers still assume this group would be difficult or even impossible to employ.                                                                                                        “We know of journalists, teachers, bankers and physicists working in Scotland with sight loss.“It’s about encouraging employers to consider what people can do, not what they can’t.”                                                                    "},{"url":null,"title":"housing development for inverurie site","story":"        A new  housing development may be about to get underway in Inverurie following a recommendation to grant planning approval for a new development by CALA Homes.

Accompanied by a support boat, Mr Cameron, 40, reached the shore on the other side, near Duncansby Head, sometime just before 8.20pm tonight.Mr Cameron decided to take on the seven-mile swim across the Firth in memory of his girlfriend Ena Brown, who died suddenly earlier this year. Money raised through the challenge will be going to the Kirkwall Maternity Ward, where Ena had worked.Speaking tonight, Monday, following the swim, he said: \u0026#8220It was a grind, I was swimming for over four hours and I never stopped for one second, I just ploughed on the whole way.\u0026#8220It was quite choppy to start with but it got better as I went on. Things eased off after about an hour or so. I knew I had it in me, I was just worried about the conditions changing and having to pull the plug, so I couldn\u0026#8217t relax during the swim. I went through all sorts of emotions \u0026#8211 I was confident and I had moments of doubt.\u0026#8220That last hour was a real grind, I must confess. I could see Duncansby Head in the foreground and I didn\u0026#8217t think I had long to go, but I was scared to ask. I had thought I had about 15 minutes to go, but I had an hour-and-a-half to go. It was real tough going.\u0026#8221\u0026#8220I\u0026#8217ve done marathons, I\u0026#8217ve won Scottish championship surfing titles, but that\u0026#8217s the toughest thing I\u0026#8217ve done.Asked how he felt following the swim, he replied: \u0026#8220I feel a big weight off my shoulders. If this hadn\u0026#8217t happened this week we would have been looking at next summer. I feel I\u0026#8217ve achieved something, I know this has been done before once or twice before, but this is something I will remember for the rest of my life. It\u0026#8217s very rewarding.

Money raised through the challenge will be going to the Kirkwall Maternity Ward, where Ena had worked.Accompanied by a support boat, Mr Cameron, 40, estimates the challenge should take him around three hours. He had been due to attempt the swim earlier this summer, with another swimmer, but they had to cancel due to poor weather conditions.Speaking this morning he said: \u0026#8220As a surfer, I never thought I would be so glad to see flat-calm sea conditions. I\u0026#8217m feeling nervous, excited and emotional — being here in Orkney and thinking of Ena is pulling at my heartstrings a bit.

Indeed, the evidence suggests that the capital grants previously available have made a real and positive impact.“Everyone agrees that encouraging new blood into farming is vitally important, including here in Orkney. At a time of real uncertainty for the sector, there is a need for the government to help provide what stability it can.“It is all the more surprising therefore that the minister has chosen to take this decision now.  I have written to Mr Ewing, who is due to visit Orkney next month, asking for a reassurance that the government does not intend to walk away from supporting new entrants and ensuring agriculture in Scotland has a bright future.”   \u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Local residents are digging in the last few metres of cable to more than 35 per cent of the properties.Community spokesman Steve Jones said: \"It\u0026rsquos a tremendously exciting time. Like many residents I\u0026rsquove only been getting very slow speeds capped at 0.5Mbps, making even the most basic of online activities difficult and frustrating, so looking forward to ultrafast speeds is fantastic.\"Fast, reliable broadband will bring huge potential to regenerate our scattered communities. It\u0026rsquos a prerequisite for attracting families and businesses to the area, where the population has fallen in recent years. People now expect good internet as a basic. In essence, it will help us to build a closer and more integrated community.\"Lesley Negri, who runs the historic Aultguish Inn near Garve with her husband Dario, added: \"It will make a huge difference to us, especially for our booking system and payments.\"At the moment everything slows down from 4pm and we can\u0026rsquot manage customer expectations. Many of our customers want to stream things or download photographs and it\u0026rsquos impossible to do that at the moment. We\u0026rsquove lived with slow broadband for so long that we can\u0026rsquot imagine what it\u0026rsquos going to be like when we can access ultrafast speeds!\"Monday 27 Aug 2018 2:43 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Although the provision of public toilets is a non-statutory function of local authorities, the Scottish Government ensured that the criteria for the fund did include capital support for toilet provision, where there was a demonstrable need.\"She added that she was aware of the council\u0026rsquos toilet closure plans and said she had \"personally pressed\" the local authority to reconsider.Council leader Margaret Davidson said the cuts were part of wider measures to \"balance the budget and safeguard essential services\" amid a climate of reduced funding for councils across Scotland and the wider UK.What do YOU think?

Her cooking was what initially drew clients to come to the centre and her baking, he said, was \"legendary\".This theme was echoed by speeches from Ina Mackenzie, Mina Stewart and Kerry Watson. Laela Maclean composed a poem which reminisced and poked good-natured fun at Cis\u0026rsquos life in Lochcarron and the Centre.Cis\u0026rsquos husband Sandy kept the feet tapping with musical interludes on his accordion \u0026mdash including one tune called Christine Ross of Lochcarron, initially written for Cis by the late Iain Crichton, from Stornoway.Christine Houser, Donar MacIver and his son, Stephen MacIver sang Gaelic songs \u0026mdash the eyes of some of the older guests lighting up as they joined in the choruses.Cis was aided by Morag MacCuish to cut her retirement cake which had been made by Harry Gow, her favourite baker. She made a speech thanking everyone for their presence and for the gifts she had received from the clients, staff and board members.The event provided a lovely send-off for Cis. The afternoon ended with everyone joining hands to sing Auld Lang Syne accompanied musically, as in life, by her husband Sandy.Monday 27 Aug 2018 2:43 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Smart Metering Systems (SMS), which connects, owns, operates and maintains energy metering assets and databases, has inked the tie-up with renewable energy supplier Good Energy.            Good Energy, based in Wiltshire, has more than 250,000 customers across the UK, adding to the 2 million-plus customers already served by SMS.             Under the terms of the agreement, SMS will supply domestic smart meters as part of the UK government’s rollout programme, which requires that domestic energy supply companies provide their customers with a smart meter to use in their homes and small businesses by 2020.SMS will provide new “SMETS 2” smart meters to monitor energy usage, which have a user-friendly advantage over the previous SMETS 1 model, as they allow customers to switch suppliers without changing meters. The majority of smart meters soon to be installed under the main phase of the government’s rollout scheme will be SMETS 2.  Alan Foy, chief executive officer at SMS, which is quoted on the alternative investment market (AIM), said: “We are delighted to be working with Good Energy as their exclusive supplier, one of the UK’s leading suppliers of energy from renewable sources, in the rollout of their smart meter programme. “Good Energy have over 250,000 customers across the UK, SMS is well positioned to support them with the smart meter rollout given our strong track record for customer services and asset ownership and management.”            John Maltby, Good Energy chairman, said the partnership would lead to a good user experience for the supplier’s customers. He said: “We are pleased to announce our partnership with SMS as the chosen supplier of our new SMETS 2 meters, as part of the UK government programme to roll out smart meters to UK energy customers.“Good Energy is focused on making sure smart meters work for the renewable energy sector. “Partnering with SMS gives us the ability to provide our customers with a market-leading smart meter, and associated products, which will enhance user experience.”            This is the latest deal for SMS, which signed a meter rental agreement in February with Utilita Energy to provide more than 100,000 meters throughout the year.The firm in March upped its dividend by more than a quarter despite a dip in pre-tax profits.

An army of the unemployed descended on Edinburgh from all corners of Scotland. With them were bands, field kitchens and banners. Each marcher had a knapsack and blanket. The goal of the marchers was to meet with Sir Godfrey Collins, Secretary of State for Scotland, to demand the abolition of the means test, increased relief for men, women and children and for work schemes to provide jobs. The city authorities made it clear the marchers were not welcome and they would provide no accommodation or food.            The march was organised by the Communist-led National Unemployed Workers Movement (NUWM), whose Scottish organiser was the veteran agitator, Harry McShane, but it won support from the Independent Labour Party, the trade unions and Labour Party. The Aberdeen and Dundee contingents marched south to join with the Fife contingent in Kirkcaldy. The Ayrshire contingent joined with Lanarkshire marching via Shotts and East Calder. The Renfrewshire and Dunbartonshire contingents, including a women’s section marched via Glasgow, Coatbridge, Airdrie, Bathgate, and Broxburn. The main Glasgow contingent marched to Kilsyth and Falkirk, where they joined with Stirlingshire, and onto Edinburgh via Bo’ness.READ MORE: Video: Rare footage of Edinburgh in the 1930sOn Sunday 12 June, they joined up in Costorphine for their entry into the capital. The next day 20,000 people greeted them at the Mound. The first sign of a thaw on the part of the authorities was when the Ministries of Labour, Health and Education agreed to meet delegations of marchers. But there was still no reply from Collins. A second victory was when the police lifted a ban on street collections. But Collins refused to meet with them.The NUWM members paraded through the royal palace of Holyrood with their band playing ‘The Internationale’ and other socialist tunes, and when the city council refused to provide accommodation their leader, Harry McShane, said they’d sleep on the pavement of Princes Street, the city’s most prestigious thoroughfare, as marcher William McVicar recalled: “I think someone offered us somewhere [to sleep] like Waverley Market or somethin’. And McShane and them wouldn’t accept that, they says, ‘No, no, we’re not going there.’ So they says, ‘Oh well, we cannae give you anything else.’ And of course he says, ‘Right we’ll sleep in Princes Street.’” The Edinburgh Evening News reported McShane telling the marchers as they gathered on the south side of Princes Street: “So far here we are and here we stay until another decision is reached. We can breakfast, dinner or tea here, and the men require a rest. They can have that rest in Princes Street. We have decided to give them a long lie in ‘bed’ this morning.” The Edinburgh Dispatch caught the mood among the ordinary folk of Edinburgh as they made thier way along Princes Street on that first morning: “Walking along on the carriageway one heard snatches of conversation: ‘Slept well?’ ‘How did ye enjoy yer feather bed?’ ‘Did ye feel a draught coming in during the night?’”            On the first morning, women marchers blocked the tramway while men shaved using their reflections in the windows of the big department stores. Tom Ferns remembers: “And they couldnae ha’ picked a better spot than Princes Street. Under the Conservative Party headquarters, the Liberal Party headquarters and the big luxury hotels, here was hundreds and hundreds o’ angry unemployed. Obviously a sight like that is not seen every day, particularly in the capital city of Edinburgh.”READ MORE: Astonishing press photographs capture interwar-era EdinburghAnother marcher, James Allison, said, “the police were going mad”. Yet Edinburgh police were not keen on inciting a pitched battle as Hugh Sloan recalled: “At dinner time, our field-kitchen came along and the police chief told Harry McShane, ‘This is Princes Street, you can’t feed here.’ Harry told them, ‘It was good enough for us to sleep here, it’s good enough for us to feed here.’” The marchers then demanded free transport home. Eventually the city’s chief constable and deputy town clerk told them they would provide transport if McShane guaranteed there would be no more marches to Edinburgh. He refused and the chief constable, worried about disturbances on the capital’s streets, backed down. Transport was then provided to take the marchers home.            On the last night, the marchers and their supporters gathered to burn an effigy of Sir Godfrey Collins before boarding buses and a final meal paid for by the city council. The march organisers refused to give a guarantee that no further hunger marchers would defile the city!Throughout the 1930s, the unemployed protested but the NUWM also organised children’s parties in the summer and at Christmas. A number of the marchers would go on to fight in the Spanish Civil War, including the leader of the Aberdeen contingent, Bob Cooney.The inter-war period, not just the “Hungry Thirties”, was grim in Scotland. Prior to the First World War, it had been at the cutting edge of British industry. Within a few years of the wars end the traditional industries, coal, steel and shipbuilding were in trouble. Scottish banks and companies were bought up by their bigger English rivals. Unemployment was a permanent feature, peaking in the 1930s and only ending with the demands of the Second World War.The shale mining industry collapsed, for example, as cheap imported oil cut demand for paraffin. In December 1925, “The Scotsman” reported from Tarbrax, a shale mining village then in South Lanarkshire under the headline “Situation at Tarbrax: Faced With Starvation,” which reported: “Workers from Tarbrax, to the number of nearly 400, marched in procession to Carnwath, nearly ten miles distant, on Thursday night last for the purpose of asking poor relief. Relief under the emergency clause of the Poor Law Act, which enables people in a state of absolute destitution to get relief, has been given to a number of people in Tarbrax on the recommendation of the doctor there. A meeting of Carnwath Parish Council has been called for today to consider the whole situation.”  Starvation – it’s a strong word. My father was little over a year old when the mine at Tarbrax shut. His father would have been on that cold December march before briefly finding work at another pit nearby, then giving up and coming to Edinburgh in search of work. He was without a permanent job until the end of the 1930s.

But fate is a fickle mistress and so late on Thursday it emerged her friend and mentor, Alex Salmond, was at the centre of two allegations of sexual harassment/assault examined by civil servants operating under the new rules on complaints against ex-ministers. These allegations had been passed on to the police.            The following morning, Sturgeon faced the unenviable prospect of publicly responding to a situation which has the potential to rip the SNP apart. The pressure must have been immense. Sturgeon’s friendship with Salmond is close and long-standing they stood side by side throughout the referendum campaign, although the relationship appears to have frayed over the past year.             With a survey suggesting one in five people in Holyrood have experienced sexual harassment or sexist behaviour, however, it was crucial the First Minister put the rights of the women to have their complaints rigorously investigated above personal loyalty. As someone who has trumpeted her support for gender equality in the workplace near the top of her agenda, anything short of an explicit endorsement of permanent secretary Leslie Evans’ actions would have been judged as hypocrisy.In the event, Sturgeon, though clearly perturbed, rose to the occasion. “I have been clear... that all organisations and workplaces must make it possible for people to come forward to report concerns and have confidence that they will be treated seriously,” she said. “For that principle to mean anything it cannot be applied selectively. It must be applied without fear or favour, regardless of the identity, seniority or political allegiance of the person involved.”Her determination not to waver in the face of Salmond’s anger and the spectre of a court case was significant for several reasons. Earlier in the week, the revelation that actor Asia Argento, one of the first women to accuse Harvey Weinstein of assault, was alleged to have slept with an underage boy, prompted a mini backlash against #MeToo. With some critics exploiting Argento’s behaviour to undermine the campaign, it was good to hear a political leader reassert the importance of creating a culture of accountability. The application of the updated procedure, with the claims investigated by the civil service and not the party, and Sturgeon keeping herself at a distance, also marked a step change from the chaos that characterised the investigation into former childcare and early years minister, Mark McDonald, less than a year ago. The circus that surrounded his return to Holyrood as an independent, during which women at the centre of the investigation were effectively erased, created a climate unconducive to future reporting the way these allegations have been handled may start to repair the damage.            Not that everyone was so keen on the new approach. Salmond, who vociferously denies the allegations, initially tried to gag Evans as she prepared to make them public. He dropped those proceedings, but is now seeking a judicial review over the handling of the complaints. He argues the procedures should not have been applied retrospectively (he had been out of office for three years by the time they were made) and that the investigation itself was carried out unfairly.Salmond is, of course, as entitled as everyone else to the presumption of innocence, but his attempts to put obstacles in the way of due process is not a good look for any politician who wants to be seen as an ally to women. Nor is the frankly bizarre suggestion that resolving the matter by conciliation, mediation or legal arbitration would have been in “everybody’s best interests, particularly those of the two complainants”. Does Salmond really believe these women are incapable of judging such matters for themselves?Outside Holyrood, there were fringe elements on both sides of the divide whose respect for due process was lacking. Some Unionists revisited the old Solero ice lolly photograph and hinted that he always seemed the type. Some Yessers insisted the allegations were part of a vast conspiracy cooked up to discredit the party and the independence movement.Particularly worrying was the denunciation of the complainers as false accusers, with some on Facebook going so far as to suggest, again without producing any evidence, that one of them had been involved in the setting up of the new procedures.            Such behaviour lends weight to the belief, prominent among feminists, that parts of the Yes movement are infected with a misogyny that is swept under the carpet in the pursuit of independence. We recently witnessed the invective unleashed on SNP councillor Rhiannon Spear after she asked why all three speakers at a “BBC bias” protest were men. Imagine what the women at the centre of this investigation would have to endure if their identities came into the public domain. This is especially pertinent when you consider some of the unedifying coverage yesterday. Phrases such as “sex pest” and “boozy bedroom encounter” trivialised the claims while the focus on what all this meant for Salmond was retrogressive.What Sturgeon has done is to distance herself and the SNP from the impulse to put party unity and independence above all else, and to stress the gravity of the situation. This is not to say she doesn’t have questions to answer. The most obvious is the one Scottish Labour has been asking: why hasn’t Salmond been suspended from the SNP just as McDonald was after his accusers came forward? In an interview with the BBC, Sturgeon implied it was because this investigation was not carried out by the party and so the party was not yet privy to its findings. But if there is enough substance to merit a report to the police, then it’s difficult to see why Salmond’s treatment should differ substantially from McDonald’s.More questions will follow if the judicial review finds the investigation was improperly conducted, although it is difficult to see how this would impact on the criminal inquiry which has already been set in motion and will surely now run its course.Life will get even tougher if it turns out the First Minister was aware of any other claims of inappropriate behaviour involving Salmond before he informed her of these ones. But, as playwright and director David Greig said, how we respond to this situation will define our political culture for the future whether or not there is independence.             “No more throwing women under the bus for Indy, for socialism, for art or any other supposed higher goal,” he tweeted.Sturgeon has set the right tone. For the moment, at least, she is leading by example."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4789811.1535224996!/image/image.jpg","title":"euan mccolm call out the nats for brexit double standard","story":"        Consumed by the certainty of the zealot, former first minister Alex Salmond spent much of the 2014 independence referendum campaign loudly denouncing anyone who dared suggest that breaking up the United Kingdom might come at a cost to Scotland as a scaremonger.                The very idea that a Yes vote would be anything but the key to unlock the gate preventing access to a land of milk and honey was all part of Project Fear in fact, went the Salmond spiel, a No vote would be catastrophic. Only independence could save the country.            In the end, a majority of Scots refused to be “charmed” by Salmond, who became increasingly ratty as polling day approached and has spent much of the past four years refighting old battles with those – Treasury officials, the BBC, anyone who ever looked at him funny – he blames for his failure to lead Yes to victory.            The truth is that Salmond lost, fair and square. His campaign was full of enticing promises but bereft of detail. The former first minister failed to persuade Scots that leaping into the dark with him was worth the risk because he couldn’t provide plausible answers to the most basic questions on currency and the economy.The Salmond mantra – proudly repeated by his successor, Nicola Sturgeon, and other senior SNP figures – was that the best people to make decisions affecting Scotland were people living in Scotland. Only by unlocking this power, could the country truly thrive.Two years after Salmond failed to persuade Scots to take back control, Ukip’s Nigel Farage used an almost identical approach to help win victory for the Leave campaign in the EU referendum. At times, a note-for-note cover version of Salmond’s indy song, Farage’s argument – that the best people to make decisions affecting the UK were people living in the UK – was a success.So why do we continue to put up with the myth that supporters of Scottish independence and supporters of leaving the EU are fundamentally different?Scottish Brexit Minister Mike Russell last week warned that Scotland faced a “nightmare” if the UK government failed to strike a deal with the EU the damage to business, services and the economy would be disastrous.            And it’s entirely likely – since 62 per cent of Scots wished the UK to remain in the EU – that he will have enjoyed the support of many of those listening.In the absence of anything vaguely resembling opposition from the Labour Party, the SNP has filled the void where an anti-Brexit party should be.But that doesn’t make the nationalists’ case any more coherent.If it is reckless to break up a partnership with the EU, with all of the implications that move has for trade and the economy, why is it not reckless to break up a partnership with England, with which Scotland does most of its business?            And how on earth can anyone take seriously the SNP’s claim that only independence can “save” Scotland from the pain of Brexit?The former SNP MP, Jim Sillars, is that rarest of beasts – a pro-independence Eurosceptic. His position involves the unfashionable application of logic: if Scotland should be a “sovereign nation” then breaking all unions – not just the one with the English (or the Westminsters as we are now obliged to call them) – is necessary.Sillars’ position makes sense. It may not be appealing to those who believe in partnerships but it is intellectually coherent.This is much more than can be said for the position advanced by Sturgeon, Russell and others on the SNP front bench.As Brexit looms, the Scottish nationalists will ratchet up the message that a second independence referendum is necessary. They will insist that Scotland can escape the Brexit “nightmare” if only the people choose to break up the UK.            We should treat these claims with the utmost scepticism.How, exactly, would entering into another break-up ameliorate the damage caused by this one? Surely, the risk of a Yes vote any time soon is that a bad situation is made worse.Even Russell, not a man in possession of one of the finer minds in contemporary politics, must surely know that arguing what Scotland needs now is to be even further isolated is nonsense.Identity politics – so terribly popular right now – allows for people to hold entirely contradictory views at the same time. A Scottish nationalist, certain that theirs is the politics of hope, of unlocking potential, can quite happily believe that it is essential to have a formal union with countries on mainland Europe while it’s equally essential that links with England are broken. Surely the time to stop indulging this sort of nonsense has long passed?By all means, be pro-independence, but don’t try to kid yourself letting power reside in Brussels is somehow different to letting it reside in Westminster.The Leave campaign got away with quite a lot in 2016. They lied and bluffed and cheated their way to victory. In 2014, the Yes campaign – just as full of nonsensical claims, hyperbolic warnings and promises to take back power from the establishment – wasn’t so lucky.It’s been two years since the EU referendum and the SNP has been allowed – thanks to Brexit chaos in both the Conservative and Labour Parties – to proclaim its contradictory positions on independence with few questions asked. But this particular emperor has no clothes. A politician arguing that the uncertainty created by leaving the EU is bad but that the uncertainty created by leaving the UK would represent an opportunity is guilty of placing ideology above reason.The UK’s departure from the EU is to be hugely regretted. It will, I fear, be proved an act of national self-harm.Responding to the instability created by Brexit by arguing for the break-up of the UK – with all of the uncertainties such a decision would create – simply doesn’t make sense and we should stop pretending that it does."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4789888.1535231211!/image/image.jpg","title":"fresh calls for sturgeon to suspend salmond over allegations","story":"        The SNP is under renewed pressure to suspend Alex Salmond from the party after details of the accusations against him were leaked to the media.                Salmond denies any wrongdoing. The former First Minister has been accused of inappropriate behaviour in December 2013 by two Scottish government employees.            READ MORE: Woman alleges Alex Salmond touched her breasts and bottomIn one of the allegations reported to the government, one woman is said to have repeatedly asked  Salmond to stop touching her in an encounter in the bedroom at the First Minister’s official Edinburgh residence, Bute House.            The woman has alleged multiple instances of unwanted sexual attention during Salmond’s time in office, according to the Daily Record, which claims to have seen wording from her complaint.She alleges that following an official engagement in December 2013 where the First Minister had been drinking alcohol, the pair found themselves alone.She claims Salmond instructed her to move from a public area to the bedroom, and repeatedly offered her alcohol, despite her refusals.He then told her to get on the bed before lying on top of her, kissing her and touching her breasts and bottom through her clothes, according to the report in the Daily Record.An investigation into the two allegations by the Scottish Government permanent secretary Leslie Evans has concluded, and details have been passed to Police Scotland.             Salmond is mounting a legal challenge against the government’s handling of the complaints, claiming its procedures are “unjust”.A fresh statement from Salmond issued yesterday said: “As Mr Salmond made very clear yesterday when he spoke to all media outlets, he intends to make no further comment on these matters until his petition for judicial review is heard in the Court of Session.“This is done on legal advice and in the context that he refutes these complaints of impropriety and absolutely denies any suggestion of criminality.”Labour MSP Rhoda Grant said Sturgeon should suspend Salmond from the SNP immediately.            “Not to do so will send the wrong message to members in her party and the people of Scotland,” she said.“People who experience harassment should be able to come forward in the knowledge there is a safe environment to do so and that the workplace they are in treats their complaint robustly.“The SNP must do all it can to give complainants the support they need whoever the alleged perpetrator is and make clear that there is safe space for any other survivors to come forward.“The First Minister has been too slow to act on these shocking allegations. “Nicola Sturgeon must take action and she must do it now.”            Scottish Conservative MSP Annie Wells said: “We must respect the women who complained and allow due and fair process to continue so that the facts can be brought out.“However, these revelations do raise questions about the way this matter was treated when it is alleged to have taken place, and these also need to be answered.She added: “We need to see full transparency from the SNP and the Scottish Government.”Leslie Evans, Permanent Secretary at the Scottish Government, said the two complaints were raised in January and Salmond was notified in March about an investigation. She intended to make a statement regarding the complaints this week but the move was halted after the former first minister initiated legal proceedings.Sturgeon said she first heard about the investigation from Salmond in April and had no role in the complaints process.A Scottish Government spokeswoman said: “For legal reasons, the Scottish Government cannot comment on the nature of the complaints.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

If you do have some proof to justify your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in different buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed. I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August. It is part of the Year of Young People activities.\nThe youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.\nYear of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to 26 years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call (01595) 744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate  (John Tulloch) and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! (I use the scientific meaning of parasite here).\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists ( or any other activity) when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"locum psychiatrist costs health board 625000 a year ","story":"\nMembers of the board agreed at Tuesday’s meeting to advertise for a full-time consultant post.\nThe health board has a substantive consultant psychiatrist who has been in the job for the six months, as well as speciality doctor, and paying a locum consultant psychiatrist for 12 months.\nDirector of community health and social care Simon Bokor-Ingram said in a report to members that out of hours cover was being provided solely by a locum and this was not sustainable.\nLocum costs for a full year were £625,000, the board heard, whereas a consultant psychiatrist would be £166,000 a year.\nMembers were told while a budget would need to be made for a permanent post it would provide “resilience and sustainability” across the service.\nMr Bokor-Ingram said the decision to appoint permanently would also mean the board could look to someone who had a specialism in dementia or learning difficulties.

Tourism makes a critical contribution to the local economy, and indeed the wider Scottish economy, and indirectly enables people to live, work and raise a family on the island.\n“As such, we write to categorically assert that Skye and Raasay is well and truly open for business.”\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Run-Rig-1977-ADJUST-e1534430676612.jpg","title":"highland exodus to stirling as runrig get set for final","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nAfter 45 years, Runrig will bring the curtain down on a remarkable musical career this weekend when they play their last ever shows.\nAn exodus of west Highland and islanders will be among the throng at Stirling’s City Park in the shadow of the town’s famous castle this Friday and Saturday.\nThey will be there to enjoy and celebrate one final time with a band which owes its roots to Skye and North Uist, and became an international flag bearer for Gaeldom’s language and tradition.\nSpeaking to the Free Press ahead of the ‘Last Dance’ shows, guitarist Malcolm Jones said he held conflicting feelings but there was excitement none the less at a final performance which will chart over four decades of music.\nHe added: “I would say we’re all approaching these final concerts with mixed emotions. There is certainly great excitement surrounding them and anticipation is high amongst both band and audience.\n“The Stirling concerts will be celebrations of our long musical journey, albeit tinged with the realisation that these are farewell appearances and so naturally emotions will be high – this is something we experienced recently at the farewell concerts in England and Europe – all spectacular events but nevertheless very moving.\n“We’ve been overwhelmed by the response to the announcement of the Stirling concerts – all the positive comments, the stories about what our music has meant to so many people, the sadness as the end approaches. But overall there will be a huge amount of love and positivity at Stirling and that’s what will carry everyone through these days ahead.\u0026#8221\nJones has been with Runrig all his adult life, having first joined the band on stage as a 17-year old at a dance in Portree’s Skye Gathering Hall in late 1977. He hopes the set list – which will be lengthy – will give a full reflection of the groups’s journey from a three -piece Scottish dance band playing island village halls to one which has sold out major venues across Scotland and Europe.\nHe said: “Compiling a set list is always a dilemma, with such a large back catalogue to choose from. Of course, there are certain songs that have to be included, otherwise we’d be lynched – but it’s also nice to pick some lesser-performed songs, possibly giving them a fresh twist.\n“Our set will be a good bit longer than usual – the problem was trying to keep the length down to sensible proportions – in essence, it will hopefully represent the band’s whole career, a celebration of our music and the unique bond with our audience.”\n century – the history of their native communities has shaped Runrig’s lyrics and songs. Jones believes that staying true to their roots – fusing them with the popular rock and pop influences they listened to in their teenage bedrooms \u0026#8211 has made sure the band’s popularity has endured through the generations.\n“We’ve been fortunate that throughout our long career we’ve continually gained new fans of all ages, at home and abroad, which has sustained us, even as fashions come and go around us,” he adds. “I guess there must be something in the lyrics, the melodies and the ethos of the band that has attracted such loyalty amongst fans, something universal that transcends our shared background in the heartland of the Highlands and connects with the wider world.”\nAuthenticity has been the hallmark of a band which can essentially still trace its origins to the three Portree streets of Fraser Crescent, Kitson Crescent, and Balmoral Road.\nThe original Run-rig dance band was founded by the Skye-raised sons of North Uist Calum and Rory MacDonald, along with Blair Douglas in 1973, and a year later the trio were joined by Donnie Munro, who became the band’s singer for more than two decades. Munro, who left in 1997 and was replaced by Canadian singer Bruce Guthro, will be on stage as a special guest this weekend.\n\nJones’ hopes for a legacy of music that people can continue to enjoy, and be inspired by, seem assured.\nHe adds: “Even though the band’s touring and performing life will have finished, I hope that people will continue to enjoy and discover our music for many years to come, perhaps giving inspiration to musicians that will follow on from us, in the knowledge that if you stick to your own path, be true to your musical roots and retain an open mind, great things may happen.”\nAs for the future – the band say it might be the end for Runrig, but it won’t mean retirement or the end of their music-making careers.\nSaid Jones: “The first thing to say is that there will be a long wind-down period – for instance we’ll film and record Stirling, so that will have to be worked on and brought to some sort of completion, plus there is the whole ongoing administration of the band archive and legacy which may lead to some interesting sideline projects.\n“Beyond that, we’ll all still be involved with our own individual performing, writing and music-making projects – that’s something you never retire from.\n“Personally, I’ll miss the band dreadfully but on the positive side I’ll spend more time on Skye plus I’ll have time to learn some new accordion tunes!”\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Runrig-5.jpg","title":"oidhche mhath runrig whfp editorial 24 8","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n night spoke for the Highlands.\nThe unassuming Malcolm has often been a coolly detached figure on stage, concentrating solely on his guitar.\nBut he has been playing with the Run Rig Dance and Ceilidh Band since he was 17 years old and he is now in his 60th year.

Arising out of the local experience of sectarian discrimination, the march helped to set in train a series of events that would change Irish politics forever.\nNationalists in the Six Counties had begun to explore new ways of highlighting the reality of discrimination. They had looked to Governments in Dublin for decades but found little help there. The IRA’s Resistance Campaign had ended in 1962, having failed heroically against the overwhelming military superiority of the British Army and RUC. However, the imposition of internment without trial, the banning of Sinn Féin and the use of the B Specials as a rural terror force, all exposed the violence that lay beneath the surface of the Orange state. \n which read: ‘Protestant girl required for housework. Apply to the Hon. Mrs. Terence O’Neill...’\n\nFive years after O’Neill’s accession nothing had changed. Unemployment and emigration among Catholics was far higher than among their Protestant neighbours. In County Tyrone, with a population of just over 73,000 Catholics to 60,500 Protestants, there were only 52 Catholics employed in local government as against 300 Protestants. Such discrimination was highlighted by the Campaign for Social Justice established by Patricia and Conn McCluskey in Dungannon in 1964. \nParallel with these developments, the IRA and Sinn Féin were rethinking their strategy with more emphasis to be placed on open campaigning against injustice in the North. The Wolfe Tone Society was established as a forum for debate and to circumvent the Stormont ban on the Republican Clubs, the name which, in turn, had been adopted to evade the ban on Sinn Féin. Members of the Wolfe Tone Society, the Campaign for Social Justice and others were involved in the formation of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA) in February 1967.\nIt was direct action on the ground that propelled the nascent Civil Rights Movement onto the streets. The Brantry Republican Club in County Tyrone had campaigned for council housing to be built but when 15 houses were built in Caledon only one of them was allocated to a Catholic. The house next door was allocated to a single Protestant woman, the secretary of a unionist politician. \nLocal people decided to protest. The main organiser was Annie Mary (better known as ‘Nana’) Gildernew, grandmother of Sinn Féin\u0027s Michelle Gildernew. Over a period of several months in 1967/68 a local family and supporters occupied a house in the Caledon estate. When they were evicted the case was raised in Stormont and began to make headlines beyond Tyrone. This was the spur for the march from Coalisland to Dungannon which received the endorsement of NICRA. \n\n\nIn a pattern that was to become all too familiar in the months ahead, Ian Paisley organised a counter-demonstration for Market Square in Dungannon. This was then used as a pretext by the RUC to ban the NICRA parade from the Square. \nAbout 2,500 took part in the NICRA march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon. The main speaker was Austin Currie MP, later a Fine Gael TD. Also speaking was Gerry Fitt, West Belfast MP. Fitt who, years later, was lifted into the House of Lords by Margaret Thatcher, declared that they would go on until they had “Civil Rights and a 32-County Republic”.\nBut the real leaders of the Civil Rights Movement which began that day were the rank and file, the ordinary people of Tyrone and beyond who marched for justice and freedom. \nThe first Civil Rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon was held on 24 August 1968, 50 years ago this week.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27459  ","story":"Sinn Féin spokesperson for Business, Innovation and Enterprise Maurice Quinlivan TD\n Callum Smyth\n\n“The government is currently missing its own targets when it comes to reforming the apprenticeship system.

It is only the second visit by a Pope to Ireland and has generated huge interest, particularly in recent weeks and days. \n\"Hundreds of thousands of people from right across the island are expected to travel to Dublin and Knock for the Papal events and countless more will be watching the events in the media. \n\n\"While for many this will be an occasion of celebration, for a significant group in our society it will also be a very difficult and challenging time. \n\"Many Irish people have suffered and have been deeply hurt by the abuses of the church over many decades, particularly the victims and survivors of child sex abuse and those who suffered in industrial schools, mother and baby homes and the Magdalene laundries. \n\"Many of them will have a very different view of this visit and I am very conscious of their views and acknowledge how difficult it will be for them,\" he said. \nConor Murphy said the Papal visit provides an opportunity for the Catholic church authorities to address the issue of abuse. \n\"For decades the Catholic church sought to cover up the horrendous abuse and this only compounded the hurt and suffering of victims and survivors. \n\"Hopefully this visit will provide an opportunity for that deep hurt to be acknowledged by the church hierarchy. But more than that, it is an opportunity to do something about it and that opportunity should be grasped. \n\"While the letter from Pope Francis acknowledged that hurt and suffering, it needs to be followed with more than words action is required,\" he said. \nThe former minister said the Catholic church needs to cooperate with investigations into abuse and address the legacy of abuse by providing redress to victims. \n\"This issue is not going away. While I acknowledge that the Pope will meet a number of victims and survivors of clerical abuse and it is important that he hears and listens to their stories, more is needed. The Vatican must release any and all files it holds that would help investigations and inquiries into abuse by priests and religious in Ireland and it must also commit itself to providing redress, including financial redress to victims of abuse north and south,\" he said. \n\ntest\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27464  ","story":" Caolán McGinley\n\nThe first civil rights march was a major cornerstone in Irish history, the people of the north stood up and said no more will we be treated as second class citizens, shaping politics on the island of Ireland for decades.\nToday, 24th August, marks the 50th anniversary of the first Civil Rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon in County Tyrone. \nThe Brantry Republican Club, led by Annie Mary Gildernew, had campaigned against the lack of council housing in the area. \n spoke exclusively to Colm Gildernew, Sinn Féin MLA for Fermanagh and South Tyrone and grandson of Annie Mary or better known as ‘Nana’ Gildernew, about the first civil rights march and events leading to it.\n“Fifty years ago, on the 12th of October 1967, Dungannon District Council convened its monthly meeting.  \n“One of the decisions they were about to take would reverberate across decades and bring the northern Unionist state to its knees and, some argue, ultimately led to its demise as a one party Orange state.\n“The Brantry Sinn Fein Republican Club, under the leadership of Annie Mary Gildernew (my Grandmother) had been trying to secure housing in the local area for nationalist families. \n“Dungannon Council refused point blank to build social housing in the Brantry area as this would also provide local nationalists with votes as well as housing.  \nInstead they agreed to build 15 houses in the then predominantly unionist village of Caledon and stated they would allocate these homes on the basis of half to unionists and half to nationalist families to ease the housing crisis.\n“At the council meeting this deal was reneged upon Unionist Councillor William Scott simply presented a list of 15 names which he had decided would be housed, no debate, no discussion, no democracy.\n“The Brantry Republican Club met immediately to assess their next move.  It was decided that they were left with no alternative but to take immediate and direct action.  \n“At 2am, on Friday the 13th of October members of the Gildernew, Goodfellow and McKenna families supported by the Brantry Republican club went to Caledon and took possession of two of the newly allocated homes, (numbers 9 and 11 Kinnard Park, Caledon) including a three bedroom house which had been allocated to a single 19-year-old woman who worked for a Unionist election candidate.  \n“In May 1968, following a 6 month series of court action and coercion, the State’s patience gave way a force of policemen, led by the brother of the young single girl who had been allocated the house, evicted Nana Gildernew, her daughter Mary Theresa Goodfellow with a three-month old baby and two other small children, and her daughter in law Geraldine Gildernew, expecting me at the time and with two young children.  They were forcibly dragged from the house under the gaze of the world’s press. \n“This led to the organisation of the first Civil Rights March from Coalisland to Dungannon was 24th of August to protest the eviction. The march was blocked by the RUC at Thomas Street from entering Dungannon’s Market Square, subsequently leading to the second Civil Rights march in Derry’s Duke Street on 5th October 1968.\n\"The first civil rights march was a major cornerstone in Irish history, the people of the north stood up and said no more will we be treated as second class citizens, shaping politics on the island of Ireland for decades,\" he said.\nOver 2,500 took part in the first civil rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon.\nThis would evidently change politics here forever - this was very much a campaign organised by people, from all backgrounds and none. \nProminent republicans were also central to the organisation of demonstrations, including the now Mid Ulster MP, Francie Molloy and the late Stan Corrigan.\nReflecting on the first civil rights march, 50 years on, Colm Gildernew said the first civil rights march should act as a rallying cry to those of us who seek to promote rights, equality and respect for all in society today.\n\"We are currently experiencing an unacceptable blockade on a swathe of rights-based issues by the DUP, including Irish language, marriage equality, women’s health, and legacy rights.  \n\"There are huge concerns arising from Brexit and the recent Boundary Commission proposals, seen by many as a new attempt to gerrymander the north. This could have a chilling impact on rights and representation in the six counties,\" he concluded.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_935986.jpg--.jpg?1534836507000\n","title":"the sky s the limit for stephens catering equipment abseiling team","story":"  \n \n  \nAN adventurous group of employees from Stephens Catering Equipment are going to great heights to raise money for Northern Ireland Chest, Heart and Stroke charity.\n  \nThe 12 strong team will be abseiling from the Europa Hotel on September 23 and what makes this even more of a challenge for the team is that most of them are afraid of heights!\n  \nClaire Adair explained: “This is the first abseil for most of us and a real challenge. \n  \n“I wanted to arrange a charity event that will really make us face our fears. \n  \n“Most of us taking part have a fear of heights so it will be a huge challenge.

It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying: \n\u0026#8220People use food banks for many and varied reasons and it would be misleading to link them to any single cause.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

The Skoda man felt the format incurred unnecessary expense in terms of fuel costs.\n\u0026#8220The fuel isn\u0027t cheap and the cars run on it whether you are driving a stage or the road sections, said Bogie. A remote service after Friday\u0027s first two stages would work for everyone.

And it’s an ideal venue to host birthday parties and school or group outings.”\n\nAir-tastic currently has two trampoline parks, located in Bangor and Cork, with a number of other Air-tastic trampoline parks planned to open in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in due course. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nFor further information on Air-tastic and the Craigavon trampoline park opening visit www.air-tastic or search Air-tastic Craigavon on Facebook.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8602227.1534344744!/image/image.jpg","title":"can you help a history project","story":"\nDid you ever work in the old Mayfair manufacturing company in Portadown? If so, then Mayfair Business Centre would like to hear from you.  \n\n                \nThe present day Mayfair Business Centre is inviting former workers who were employed at the sewing factory to discuss their memories and experiences of working there. This unique history project is being supported by Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council as part of the PEACE IV Shared Spaces and Services programme.\n\nUrsula Kearns from Mayfair Business Centre said: “We are really keen to speak to any women and men who worked in the factory during the 1960s and 1970s, including those who were made redundant when the factory closed. We want to hear and collect their experiences and memories and we want those stories to be recorded and shared. The intention would be for the former workers to meet together on a regular basis over coming months. It will be informal and will be a chance for old friends and acquaintances to meet up. We intend that the project will be led by those taking part, so we expect that it will touch upon other work-places as well as people’s social lives. It’s also intended that the project will result in a permanent exhibition within Mayfair.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nInterested?

authority offers assurance about future of school crossing patrols","story":"\nThe Education Authority (EA) has given an assurance that school crossing patrols will be in operation when children across Northern Ireland return to school in the coming days.\n\n                \nA spokesperson for the EA offered the assurance in response to media coverage revealing that the authority had considered removing “lollipop men and women” in a bid to save money.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nA letter obtained by BBC News NI revealed that the EA faces an estimated funding gap of £58 million in 2018/19.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIt highlights a number of “difficult choices” the authority is faced with in order to cut costs, including the possible removal of school crossing patrols, withdrawing uniform allowances and making compulsory redundancies in schools.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nAccording to the BBC, EA board members regarded the possibility of scrapping school crossing patrols – and other potentially controversial savings measures – as “unpalatable” and decided that any decision to make such cuts should be down to the Department of Education.\n\nThe letter also suggests that “traffic control measures” are not the EA’s responsibility, but that of the Department for Infrastructure and the

for school crossing patrols in the current financial year.”\n\nManned crossings are seen as a vital for the safety of children crossing busy roads, and the DUP’s education spokesman said any move to remove lollipop men and women would be “unacceptable.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“While undoubtedly the Education Authority and the department have to explore every option to live within budget, this idea cannot be regarded as a serious suggestion and it is clear that the members of the Education Authority would reject any attempt to propose it,” said Peter Weir MLA.\n\n“The safety of our children must be paramount, and there is no need to remove the current process for assessing individual placements of lollipop people provision.”\n\nThe Strangford MLA continued: “This bizarre suggestion does however highlight two key issues. Firstly, the extent to which education is effectively subsidising other elements of government particularly on road safety and transport and there needs to be a debate about where financial responsibility is borne. \n\n“Secondly, it further shines a light on the heavy pressures facing education in Northern Ireland, and the need for strategic changes and reform which need commitment on an Executive-wide basis, which again highlights the damage being done by a single party putting their narrow interests ahead of proper decision making and the restoration of government.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8602298.1534346604!/image/image.jpg","title":"fifty years on from first civil rights march","story":"\nOn August 24, 1968, Northern Ireland\u0026#8217s first civil rights march took place between Coalisland and Dungannon. \n\n                \nOn the march were teachers, students and politicians who all wanted the same thing, equality and civil rights.

This is the first time the event has been staged in Ireland.\nPope Francis will arrive in Dublin on Saturday, almost 40 years since Pope John Paul II came and addressed the faithful at capacity Masses in Drogheda, Knock and Phoenix Park. Pope Francis’ first engagement will be meeting President Michael D Higgins before visiting St Mary’s Pro-Cathedral and then the Capuchin Day Centre, which provides hot meals, clothing and showers for the city’s homeless. Pope Francis will then preside at the Festival of Families in Croke Park.\nHis visit will conclude on Sunday with a closing Mass at Phoenix Park. An estimated 500,000 people are expected to attend with thousands more watching the live footage from around the world.\nRector of Clonard Monastery Fr Noel Kehoe said that the parish is running a bus to the weekend events in Dublin “on Friday” and that he will be staying “to attend both the festival of Families and attend the Papal Mass”.\nParish Manager at St Oliver Plunkett Parish Glen Phillips told the Andersonstown News that Pope Francis’ visit had created “such a buzz within the parish”.\n“We have a coach leaving tomorrow (Thursday) so that parishioners can attend the WMOF Congress in the RDS.\n“A number of families from the parish will also be attending the Festival of Families in Croke Park on Saturday and we are also running a coach to the Papal Mass in Phoenix Park on Sunday.\n “There is such a buzz around the parish as the Papal visit approaches. Many older parishioners remember Pope John Paul II’s visit and many young parishioners were brought up on stories about it. Pope Francis is re-invigorating the Church and many parishioners want to be part of that and show support for him,” he said.\nSt John’s Church was proudly displaying its bunting and Papal flags as parishioners filed out from Mass on Wednesday morning. Parish Manager Conor Neeson explained how some of the decorations had stood the test of time and dated back to John Paul II’s visit.\n“We will have a number of buses on from Friday morning taking parishioners down to Dublin for the Pope’s visit. As part of the Falls Road Pastoral Community, parishioners from Corpus Christi, St John’s, St Mary’s, St Paul’s and St Peter’s Cathedral will all be travelling this weekend. There is a great sense of occasion and I’ll be staying behind to organise the parish hall for the Mass on Sunday as we will be screening it live,” he said.\nChair of the Pastoral Council Annette Hinchcliffe said she will be attending the Mass along with her teenage children and had also been part of history when she travelled down on the train to see John Paul II say Mass in 1979.\n“Many of our elderly population in the parish would have loved to have attended the Mass on Sunday but a lot of the instructions about once people get off their buses is the walk to Phoenix Park which is a possible three miles. We thought it would be nice to bring everyone together to give them a flavour of the day so that they wouldn’t just be watching it in the house. Our parishioners will have an opportunity to come to the parish centre to watch the Mass and be with the other people in their parish,” she said.\nParishioner Frances McEvoy told us: “I’m going down today (Wednesday) for the different discussions and events that are taking place over the next couple of days each day ending with a Mass and I’m looking forward to enjoying the weekend celebrations as well.\n“I was in Phoenix Park whenever John Paul II came and I think this Pope has the same charisma. I think he will be very welcomed despite all that is going on at the minute.\n“It’s very exciting. I was in Rome before Christmas staying with friends and I was at one of his meetings, when he meets the people on a Wednesday. The atmosphere when he walks in is just incredible. There is definitely  something about him. I think despite in terms of some of the negative publicly there has been around the visit he will speak to the people and he speaks from his heart,” she said.\nAt an extremely busy The Holy Shop in city centre’s Chapel Lane sales assistants Maura McShane and Teresa Nolan told us how there had been “great interest” in their Pope Francis memorabilia ahead of the highly anticipated visit.\n“We have rosary beads, candles, framed photos of Pope Francis and prayer cards all to mark his visit for the World Meeting of Families,” explained Teresa. “He is a very popular Pope and the amount of our customers going this weekend to see him is unreal,” she said.\nMaura said that many people were calling in since staff created their window display and there was a real “excitement” with people ahead of the weekend.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"civil rights movement a landmark in irelands history and i was proud to be part of it currie","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

They had everything they wanted.\" \n\nMr Currie was brought up in Coalisland, an overwhelmingly nationalist town. \n\nHe was elected as a Nationalist MP for East Tyrone from 1964 until 1972, and was one of the founders of the SDLP.\n\nHe moved to the Republic in 1989 and was Fine Gael TD for Dublin West.\n\nIn June 1968 Mr Currie and others occupied a house in Caledon, Co Tyrone, in protest at the discriminatory allocation of houses by the local council. \n\nWhen he saw a 19-year-old girl \"who happened to be a Protestant and a unionist\" and \"worked at a unionist politician\u0027s solicitor\u0027s office\" being allocated a home ahead of 269 others on the waiting list, he said he felt compelled to take action. \n\n\"I just felt it was unfair, unjust, intolerable and something had to be done, and I did it,\" he said. \n\nMr Currie said he made the decision to organise the march after taking part in the protests against the housing situation, hoping the event would be similar to those witnessed in the southern states of the United States. Two months after that march, another civil rights protest ended in violent scenes when police clashed with protesters in Londonderry. \n\nMr Currie said organisers had actually been disappointed with the numbers that turned out for the march, which had been banned, yet he said it has since become one of the catalysts for the entire civil rights movement here. \n\n\"The RUC acted absolutely stupidly and in front of the television cameras, particularly RTE, they ran awry, they ran mad and it was on the television and was seen around the world and that really effectively gave the boost which became the very successful civil rights movement,\" he said. \n\nThe former TD said he regretted the loss of lives during the Troubles that ensued afterwards. \n\n\"It wasn\u0027t inevitable that it would happen,\" he said, insisting non-violence was at the heart of the civil rights movement. It was very unfortunate and was not inevitable. But I wish it hadn\u0027t happened.\"\n\nMr Currie added: \"The civil rights campaign was an extremely successful organisation and it actually changed the whole political scene as far as Northern Ireland was concerned, and of course I don\u0027t regret that.\" \n\nHe criticised the current power-sharing impasse at Stormont. He said it was a \"totally hypocritical situation\" that elected representatives were being paid when the Assembly was not sitting. \n\nVeteran DUP man Nelson McCausland has a very different interpretation of the civil rights movement. \n\nThe former Stormont minister said: \"It may be the anniversary of the first civil rights march but he said it was certainly not their first appearance on the streets in that they had been out in Easter in 1968 against the banning of the republican Easter Rising parade. \n\n\"That in a sense was part of the problem, that right from the start the civil rights movement was so closely aligned with Irish nationalism and republicanism.\" \n\nHe said the movement was \"never going to be a place that was welcoming to unionists\".\n\nHe added: \"The tragedy is that it led on eventually to a situation which broke out into violence that led to more than 3,000 people dead.\" \n\nThe former MLA claimed that there are a lot of inaccuracies when it came to the housing statistics from the time.\n\n\"Much of what was put forward as fact to justify claims of discrimination was actually manipulated,\" he claimed. \n\nHe said there were some examples where there was an \"unbalance\" but he maintained that overall there was a \"fairly reasonable\" spread of council housing going to Catholic and Protestants at the time. \n\n\"It\u0027s not the picture that was portrayed at the time,\" he said.\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37245612.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/fatberg1.jpg","title":"massive fatberg pours out of sewer into west belfast street","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

We would remind all our customers that opening a manhole and putting anything down it is forbidden. By doing this, you are obstructing a working sewer which is designed to take waste away from homes. Incidents like this cause out of sewer flooding and require valuable time and resources to resolve,\" she said.\n\nShe urged people to dispose of their fat, oil and grease properly. \n\n“While most homes and businesses use grease traps and bin their waste correctly, those that don’t, contributed to a massive fatberg in the sewers around the area,\" Mrs McCullagh said\n\n“We would appeal to all our customers, especially food outlets, to dispose of their fat, oil and grease appropriately. For householders, let it cool and then put it into the bin. Alternatively, pour it into a disposable container and take it to your local oil bank.\n\n“Businesses also risk blocking their own drainage systems, which results in extra costs being incurred in clean-up efforts. These fat blockages can not only result in out of sewer flooding, but odour problems and the risk of rat infestations both near and beyond your premises. Ways to dispose of FOG include fitting a grease trap, using an enzyme dosing system or recycling it.\"\n\nMrs McCullagh said the fatberg was having a negative affect on the whole community.\n\n“We have all seen the disgusting effects of an overflowing manhole in the street and no one wants to see or smell it (not even us!) but the reality is, it happens regularly at a cost of millions to NI Water each year,\" he said.\n\n“We all have the power to stop it. In the last ten years, NI Water has spent over £1.5 billion investing in water and wastewater infrastructure but no amount of investment will completely stop blocked pipes if people continue to flush wipes (including flushable), sanitary items and cotton buds down the toilet.”\n\nShe urged people to properly dispose of sanitary products.\n\n“According to recent research carried out by Water UK, 93% of the material causing sewer blockages was made up of wipes - including a high proportion of baby wipes - which are not designed to be flushed. Less than 1% of the domestic waste in the blockages was identified as made up of products which are designed to be flushed, such as toilet paper.\n\n“Customer awareness and behaviour change is the only real way to address sewer misuse it’s simple really, don’t flush anything other than paper, poo and pee.\n\n“Visit \nwww.niwater\n for further information.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland man has whata boutye eyelid tatoo removed year on from benidorm stag","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Dr Donal McKeown, a laser specialist, read Steven\u0027s story online, and offered his expertise in tattoo removal.\n\nA year on, the results have been well worth the wait.\n\n\"In all my 25 years of removing tattoos, I\u0027ve seen them on every other part of the body but never on the upper eyelids,\" said Dr McKeown, who is based on Belfast\u0027s Antrim Road. \n\n\"I\u0027ve even removed them from the inside of the mouth, but Steven\u0027s case was unique, and quite difficult. I had to proceed very cautiously, with the laser down at low levels.\"\n\nSteven, from Tullycarnet, was in Spain as part of a 15-strong group celebrating his cousin James\u0027s upcoming marriage, when he drunkenly decided to get the €22 (£20) \u0027whata boutye\u0027 tattoo.\n\nA year and a half on, he is thrilled to be finally free of his daft eyelid doodles.\n\n\"The laser was worse pain than the tattoos but it was definitely worth it,\" he said. \n\n\"Dr McKeown is brilliant, spot-on. I thought I\u0027d have these things for life, but he knew exactly what to do. My mother and Tommy\u0027s mother weren\u0027t too impressed when they saw them and I took an awful lot of slagging, but thankfully, that\u0027s all died down now. You\u0027d really have to look closely to see any trace of them.\"\n\nSteven and his stag party pals had been in a Benidorm bar all afternoon when Steven decided to add the \u0027whata boutye\u0027 tattoo to his collection, which includes inking on his backside.\n\n\"When we came out of the bar, they all went for a walk down to the beach and I just ducked out and walked until I found the tattoo parlour,\" he recalled. \"I told them what I wanted and that was that.\n\n\"The fella wanted €60 (£54) for it but I only had €22, so that\u0027s what I gave him. It was probably a good job, because a more expensive tattoo would have been harder to remove.\"\n\nSteven had flown to Benidorm from Belfast for a three-night stay and admitted he \u0027lost count\u0027 of how much he had to drink before going under the needle.\n\nSteven is single, but can now use his brown eyes to woo the girls, instead of scaring them off.\n\n\"I think I\u0027ll have a better chance with them now,\" he said. \"And I\u0027ll not be getting inked again in a hurry, I\u0027ll tell you that.\"\n\nOver the last 18 months, he has undergone more than a dozen laser treatments on a bi-monthly basis, with dramatic results. The tattoo on his left eye is 95% gone the other is 97%, according to Dr McKeown.\n\n\"The laser breaks up the ink into very small particles and the body\u0027s own natural defence system removes it from the body,\" he explained. \"Steven has been a very good patient. \n\n\"I was concerned he\u0027d be prone to swelling and bruising at the start, as we were dealing with very delicate skin, but he tolerated the treatments well.\n\n\"Fortunately, Steven\u0027s tattoo was in a blue-black ink, which is easier to remove than other colours. I once had a patient with spider\u0027s web tattoo all over one side of his face - he was lucky it was done in the same sort of blue-black ink that can be broken down.\"\n\nA former west Belfast GP, Dr McKeown has removed hundreds of tattoos, including paramilitary slogans and insignia, over the last two decades.\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37247553.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/pope_ireland_010.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic alerts pope visit and local events set to cause disruption","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Francis was given a taste of a very different Ireland to the one his predecessor John Paul II got almost 40 years ago.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({})\n\n\nIt included Irish dancing, classical music, children’s choirs as well as testimonies given by families from across the globe.\n\nIn turn Ireland welcomed a different pontiff to 1979, with Pope Francis opening his address to the Festival of Families in Dublin by saying “Dia Daoibh” – Irish for good evening.\n\nIn a light-hearted moment during proceedings, Francis consented to a selfie with a teenager from the Travelling community.\n\nCroke Park stadium was packed with an estimated 82,500 people on Saturday night for the event at which Pope Francis was the star, but he was not the only draw as country stars Daniel O’Donnell and Nathan Carter thrilled the crowd with their performances.\n\nPope Francis received an enthusiastic welcome as he arrived in the stadium and then did a lap of the pitch floor in a golf buggy, closely flanked by his security team.\n\nMembers of the audience rose to their feet, and some even stood on their chairs, for a better look as he passed giving smiles and waves.\n\nWhen the Pope took his seat, Cardinal Kevin Farrell offered him the traditional Irish greeting of a thousand welcomes.\n\nThe pontiff smiled as a group of children performed an Irish dance in front of him, and he exchanged a few words with the youngsters before 500 other children from dance schools around Ireland treated him to a performance of Riverdance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stadium was packed with tens of thousands of people (WMOF18/PA)\n\n\n\n\nCo Donegal crooner O’Donnell was next on stage and brought many in the audience to their feet and dancing with a rendition of Let Your Love Flow.\n\nThere were also powerful testimonies from a number of families, including Azeez Al-Kanah who recollected fleeing their home in Iraq after Islamic State invaded the village.\n\nThere were also strong words from Missy Collins of the Pavee Point Traveller group, who told the pontiff of the struggle of the Travellers for recognition and the value her community places on the importance of family.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColourful performers entertained the crowds, and the Pope, during the event (WMOF18/PA)\n\n\n\n\nMore than 2,000 singers, dancers and performers took part in the festival, which organisers described as a “once-in-a-lifetime theatrical experience”, and it ran an hour over the scheduled finishing time of 8.30pm.\n\nDuring his address, Pope Francis paid tribute to all those who took part.\n\nAnd as he neared the conclusion of the first day of his two-day visit to Ireland, during which he also met President Michael D Higgins and survivors of clerical abuse amid a packed itinerary, he admitted he was tired.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed top 10 baby names in","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997. Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017 (both boys and girls) varied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":null,"title":"pope waves goodbye and heads back to rome","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

It included a starter of Toons Bridge mozzarella with a leek salad and Irish soda bread.\n\nFor his main course he had a choice of baked smoked salmon with braised Savoy cabbage, glazed carrots and baby boiled potatoes or basil pesto risotto with roasted summer vegetables.\n\nA passion fruit mousse and Cocoa Atelier chocolate bites were served for dessert.\n\nBefore landing in Rome, the pope was presented with two gifts by the airline, a model of Aer Lingus’ first aircraft, the De Havilland, and a replica of the Celtic Crucifix of Athlone which was on board the aircraft which carried Pope John Paul II in 1979.\n\nThe cross is one of the earliest Celtic Christian crosses found in Ireland and dates from around 800AD.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"young traveller overjoyed after securing selfie with pope","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

opportunity for a selfie with the leader of the Catholic Church, and took it.\n\nHer mum, Brigid, told the Press Association it is important that young traveller people have confidence in themselves, and Alison, who has met Pope Francis before, is a good example for others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPope Francis speaking at Croke Park (WMOF18/Maxwell)\n\n\n\n\nShe said: “It was a lovely experience for us all, we were given two tickets for myself and Alison to attend, but we weren’t expecting to get up that close to him.\n\n“One of the speakers brought Alison up along with her, as a representative of the young Traveller community.\n\n“She was a bit nervous when she was sitting on the bench waiting to meet with him, but she said the nervousness left when she got up.\n\n“She said she had been thinking of asking him for a selfie in her head, and didn’t tell anyone about it, just decided to go for it.\n\n“She’s absolutely over the moon, her Facebook and Instagram were hopping off all over the place.\n\n“We had to turn the phones off last night, they were ringing non-stop, and the picture was shared over and over.\n\n“She starts her first day of secondary school tomorrow, so she’ll be started school famous.”\n\nOne of the biggest cheers in Croke Park on Saturday was for activist Missy Collins talking about Traveller families, their faith and their exclusion in Irish society – with Alison by her side, Ms Collins asked the Pontiff to pray for young Traveller people in Ireland.\n\n\nMissy Collins pleads for Pope Francis to pray for the young of Ireland’s Traveller community

for young people,” Brigid added.\n\n“With Alison being so young, she’s set a trend for her peers to have confidence in herself and do it.”\n\nThe Croke Park event marked the second time Alison met with Pope Francis.\n\nDue to suffering from a number of medical issues in the past, she and her mother were gifted tickets for a Papal Mass, and travelled to Rome to meet with the Pontiff and present him with a gift, three years ago.\n\nBrigid said: “This is actually her second time meeting the Pope, we travelled to Rome three years ago, where she got a special audience with the Pope as the first

[]).push({})\n\n\nFormer Brexit secretary David Davis lashed out at “bogus” forecasts from the Treasury after the Chancellor suggested that GDP could fall and borrowing could be around £80 billion a year higher by 2033/34 if the UK resorted to World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms.\n\nIn an op-ed in the Sun on Sunday he said that Mr Hammond was being “either spectacularly incompetent, or deliberate”, adding: “I know what I think.”\n\n\n\nIt was an attempt to frighten the population into imagining the most terrible consequences of leaving the European Union without a deal\nDavid Davis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Davis’s intervention came as his successor as Brexit Secretary, Dominic Raab, suggested some fiscal projections needed to be treated with “a measure of caution”.\n\nWriting in the Sun, Mr Davis, who quit in protest at Theresa May’s Chequers deal, said the Chancellor’s estimates, outlined in a letter to Treasury Committee chairwomen Nicky Morgan, came from a “Treasury that has trouble forecasting deficits even 12 months ahead”.\n\nHe added: “It was an attempt to frighten the population into imagining the most terrible consequences of leaving the European Union without a deal.\n\n“And even more disgraceful, by doing so it will undermine the Government’s hand in striking a deal with the EU.\n\n“If they do not think we dare walk away, then they will give us the worst deal they can think of.\n\nBear in mind that the Chequers deal already concedes enormous amounts to the EU.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhilip Hammond warned of the economic impact of a no-deal Brexit in a letter to Nicky Morgan on Thursday (Brian Lawless/PA)\n\n\n\n\nMr Hammond’s comments emerged hours after Mr Raab had attempted to play down the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit while outlining the impact of such a scenario via a series of technical papers.\n\nMr Hammond on Thursday was accused of launching a “dodgy Project Fear” with his letter.\n\nThe Chancellor said that his initial January analysis on GDP and borrowing was undergoing a “process of refinement” ahead of a parliamentary vote on any deal, noting scenarios which have higher barriers to trade with the EU are expected to have a “more damaging effect” on the economy and public finances.\n\nHe also defended the Government’s preferred approach, which was outlined in a white paper following a Cabinet summit at Chequers, by saying the economic and fiscal impacts of this would be “substantially better” than no deal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrexit Secretary Dominic Raab said most Brexit economic forecasts ‘have been proved to be wrong’ (Peter Nicholls/PA)\n\n\n\n\nMr Raab risked a Cabinet row with Mr Hammond after questioning the worth of economic forecasts about Brexit.\n\nIn an interview with the Sunday Times, the Brexit Secretary said that GDP estimates for 2019 “have been revised up”.\n\nWithout naming Mr Hammond, Mr Raab told the Sunday Times: “I’m always chary of any forecast because most of them have been proved to be wrong.”\n\nThe newspaper also claimed that the Cabinet will meet to discuss no-deal Brexit preparations over fears that a row between Brexiteers and Remainers was undermining negotiations with Brussels.\n\nMeanwhile, former European Council president Herman Van Rompuy warned that a no-deal Brexit could cause the United Kingdom itself to collapse.\n\nThe ex-Belgian prime minister told the Observer that crashing out without a deal was an “an existential threat to the UK itself”.\n\nHe added: “We could end up with a situation in which the EU27 becomes more united and a United Kingdom less united.\n\n“This talk about a ‘no deal’ is the kind of nationalist rhetoric that belongs to another era.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"gary lineker

harassment.\n\nhttps://www.belfasttelegraph/news/uk/no-legal-basis-to-suspend-salmond-from-snp-sturgeon-37253724.html\n\nhttps://www.belfasttelegraph/news/uk/article37253722.ece/8ebb6/AUTOCROP/h342/bpanews_282619b9-604f-4ae0-8284-613b1cb07692_1\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said there is “no legal basis” to suspend Alex Salmond from the SNP, following accusations of sexual harassment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({})\n\n\nShe said her party had not received any complaints about her predecessor’s conduct – nor had it carried out the investigation – but the matter would be reconsidered if the situation changes.\n\nIt comes after opposition parties called for the SNP to suspend Mr Salmond over the allegations, which he denies.\n\nMs Sturgeon said: “As SNP leader, it is important that I set out the reasons for the party’s current position as clearly as I can.\n\n“The SNP, like all organisations, must act in accordance with due process.\n\n“In this case, unlike in some previous cases, the investigation into complaints about Alex Salmond has not been conducted by the SNP and no complaints have been received by the party.”\n\n\nPlease see further statement below.

investigation cannot at this stage be shared with the party – and rightly it is the party, not me as leader, that has the power to suspend membership.\n\n“In summary, the party has no legal basis at this time to suspend Alex Salmond’s membership.\n\n“Of course, should that situation change, the matter will be reconsidered, as it would be for any member.\n\n“The party’s rules apply to all members and no-one is above them.”\n\nThe claims about Mr Salmond’s conduct towards two staff members in 2013 – while he was in office – have been handed to Police Scotland.\n\nLeslie Evans, Permanent Secretary at the Scottish Government, said the complaints were raised in January and Mr Salmond was notified in March about an investigation.\n\nShe intended to make a statement regarding the complaints, but the move was halted after the former first minister initiated legal proceedings.\n\nMr Salmond responded to his successor’s comments on social media by saying he agreed with her that people in Scotland should be treated fairly.\n\nHe added that relied on confidentiality and a suitable process for complaints procedures.\n\n\nStatement in response to Nicola Sturgeon \npic.twitter/YZmfm0o2m5\n\n— Alex Salmond (@AlexSalmond) \nAugust 26, 2018\n\n\n\n\nScottish Conservative equalities spokeswoman Annie Wells MSP said: “Despite this latest statement from Nicola Sturgeon, many questions still remain about what has occurred.\n\n“We are still none the wiser as to the way the assault was treated when it was alleged to have taken place, nor do we know when anyone in the SNP or the Scottish Government was informed about the incident.”\n\nLiberal Democrat MP Jo Swinson said: “People on all sides of the political divide need to resist the temptation to make party political capital from a situation involving allegations of sexual harassment.\n\n“Supporters of Scottish independence should abandon unionist conspiracy theories and supporters of the UK should be wary of immediately branding the SNP leadership of complicity.\n\n“What’s important now is that the police investigation is able to proceed unimpinged by political pressure.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"what the papers say august","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

You’ve probably seen him in Sandinos, The Guildhall Taphouse, Rodden’s in Buncrana or the Grand Central.\n\nThe whole point of these articles is to highlight the importance of the local music scene and he and his brother Christy are widely regarded as innovators in the dance music fraternity, with tributes from Celtronic and other DJs piled up on Facebook since the terrible news seeped out last Saturday night.\n\nI’m a rocker myself and came quite late to the dance party, but God love him John did his best to educate me. \n\nHe had been for a number of years one of them Derry faces I was familiar with but had no name or conversation to put with it. \n\nOver the years of being his friend I was always amazed by the education he gave me, people I should at least give a chance to listen to and always revere Michael Jackson for he is the source of all that is good in music….at least it wasn’t The Beatles.\n\nWe eventually became friends over a shared love of music, films and a weird sense of humour. \n\nOur conversations always returned to music and would almost certainly contain the words Boards of Canada. \n\nAs a vinyl collector it was John who encouraged me to get into DJing myself so for all those who’ve endured my weird sets, it was his fault entirely.\n\nI spent many a night with him while he was on in Sandino’s and developed an appreciation for music.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push(function () {            var mapMpu = googletag.sizeMapping()                .addSize([100, 100], [[320, 50], [300, 250]])                .addSize([980, 200], [[300, 250]])                .build()            slot = googletag.defineSlot(\u0027/29764278/derrynow_article_mpu\u0027, [1, 1], \u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)                .defineSizeMapping(mapMpu)                                                            .setTargeting(\u0027section\u0027, \u0027news\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027page\u0027, \u0027article\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027id\u0027, \u0027244572\u0027)                                                    .addService(googletag.pubads())            googletag.display(\u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)            googletag.pubads().refresh([slot])        })    \n\n\n\nI would have otherwise never entertained, I attribute my love of Prince to his sets which goes to show a DJ has done their job right if they’ve turned at least one person on to something. \n\nJust as I’m writing this I wish I had referred to him as Jimmy Rabbitte from The Commitments at least once, he had been playing the Courteeners way before any of us had even heard of them and he was the first to realise they were s***.\n\nNot only did John entertain people with other people’s music but he made his own music, he never let me hear it though. \n\nI’m sure somebody out there has heard it and it won’t be lost. \n\nKnowing John the Greek as I did I’m sure it has his perfectionist stamp all over it.\n\nI could get carried away and paint him as a one-dimensional character and forget his many other loves, including the great outdoors and adventures. \n\nI have been privy to jumping in a car with John without actually asking for a plan and ending in Donegal for the day in absolute sobriety and perfect gratitude for the beautiful scenery and the many things we could do for free right on our own doorstep.\n\nI can’t miss the opportunity to point out two facts here, the first that John was actually a fairly decent barber, which leads to the second fact that once upon a time I used to have hair and he was my personal stylist – although he eventually admitted defeat and suggested accepting baldness and shaving it off!\n\nTributes have come in from all over, the bars and their staff he entertained in will miss him terribly, his ability to know what song to play isn’t that common, nor is the warmth and humour he exuded. His funeral was a testament to the love he showed the world with each of us leaving under no doubt that there is a time to moonwalk.\n\nI’ve waffled on enough and these memories are my own, but they are great memories and I will always look back with a smile. \n\nI’m glad I knew The Greek and I hope that your memories make you smile and hope our love is of comfort to Sophie, his parents and sisters Mia and Angela and their families.\n\n\n\nIf anyone reading this, musician or otherwise feels that they need help get in touch with Help Musicians here https://www.musicmindsmatter.org.uk/ or call 0207 239 9101 or contact Samaritans 028 7126 5511.\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"public urged visit arts exhibitions held unusual spaces across derry","story":"\nThree visual arts exhibitions have opened in unexpected places across Derry, including a bar and a park\n\nThey are taking place in the Walled City Brewery, The Gate Lodge and Gywns Café in Brooke Park and The Fashion and Textile Centre.\n\nA further exhibition will take place in the Sion Stables in Sion Mills.\n\nIn the Walled City Brewery, Yarli Allison has created a fake news television broadcast that can be seen on a television in the bar.

If not, then they will fail to absorb and highlight, the true spirit of \u002768.”\n\nMr McKinney questioned why an application for the parade was put forward as early as March and whether Sinn Féin felt major civil rights\u0027 concerns, ‘not least a non-functioning government resulting in adverse social consequences, were irrelevant and had no great immediacy?’\n\nHe pointed to the significance of that date in Derry and the north’s history which is recognised by lowly-paid, unemployed, homeless and the disenfranchised as a ‘a turning point for radical political, social and economic reforms in Northern Ireland.’\n\n“October 5th 1968,” he explained, “is a date linked to an era of hope when pro-democracy citizens banded together to achieve equality for all sections of our population, following the examples of Gandhi and Dr. Martin L. King. \n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push(function () {            var mapMpu = googletag.sizeMapping()                .addSize([100, 100], [[320, 50], [300, 250]])                .addSize([980, 200], [[300, 250]])                .build()            slot = googletag.defineSlot(\u0027/29764278/derrynow_article_mpu\u0027, [1, 1], \u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)                .defineSizeMapping(mapMpu)                                                            .setTargeting(\u0027section\u0027, \u0027news\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027page\u0027, \u0027article\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027id\u0027, \u0027244566\u0027)                                                    .addService(googletag.pubads())            googletag.display(\u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)            googletag.pubads().refresh([slot])        })    \n\n\n\n“If this historic analysis is distorted by sectarianism it will transpire that there are no limits on what this organisation would do to \u0027legitimize\u0027 themselves.\n\n“The NICRA was a non-party political cross-community organisation which gave the people of Northern Ireland an aspiration that radical change was possible. It created a vehicle whereby all were enabled to participate in a non-violent manner.\n\n“It seems blatantly partisan for one political group, rather than adopting a broad-front approach to contemporary issues, to proceed with a demonstration that suggests an opportunistic attempt to usurp the date and message of NICRA in 1968.\n\n“If that is the case, as many former campaigners and others from a wide range of backgrounds believe, then they should be ashamed of distorting a seminal moment in the history of this place to attract short-sighted populist gain via unpredictable media attention, alongside the inherent dangers, e.g. uncontrollable violent elements.”\n\nIn response Sinn Féin provided a statement from Tyrone MP Francie Molloy who said the party ‘were and remain’ at the forefront of civil rights and social justice campaigns. \n\nHe commented: “Fifty years ago, likeminded people from all communities, including republicans – outraged by the routine injustice and sectarianism of the six county state - came together to form the Civil Rights movement.\n\n“To mark the 50th anniversary of the civil rights march in Derry, Sinn Féin have organised a commemorative march from Duke Street to Guildhall Square, along the original planned route of the march. \n\n“Republicans were to the fore of and remain to the fore of civil rights and social justice campaigns. We would welcome anyone who feels the same to join us.”\n\nSurviving leaders and supporters of the original march were said to have met last November in Belfast City Hall where they decided on a programme of events.\n\nIt is noteworthy, Mr McKinney said, that \u002768 veterans at the initial meeting unanimously voted down a public commemorative demonstration ‘to avoid what may have been interpreted as a coat-trailing exercise’ thereby avoiding any possible violence on the streets. \n\n“It was agreed that such incidents would be highly injurious to the civil rights\u0027 cause, with resultant harmful images of our struggling city and general population, via regional and global media,” he said.\n\nA three-day programme of events will run at the Guildhall from October 4-7 to mark the international Civil Rights Festival, commemorating the 50th Anniversary of Duke Street Civil Rights March, which will see the Irish President Michael D Higgins make a keynote address.\n\nThe event was launched by 50th Anniversary Civil Rights Commemoration Committee last week, and will explore the civil rights\u0027 legacy through documentation, conferences, films and other educational activities.\n\n\nABOVE - Aidan McKinney, far right, pictured with some of the key figures of the Civil Rights Movement with then then President Mary McAleese during her visit to the Guildhall in Derry to mark the 40th anniversary in October 2008.
