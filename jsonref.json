Previously, frog amber had been unearthed in Mexico and Dominica, but those findings were from the more recent Cenozoic Era between 20 million and 30 million years ago, said Dr Xing, an associated professor from China University of Geosciences, Beijing.Dr Xing also explained to MailOnline that those rare fossils were from a new species that had been unknown to scientists before.The findings indicate that cold-blooded frogs lived in an area much wider than what researchers previously believed in temperate climates during the Cretaceous Period, according to the research team.The stones are also said to be the first collection of amber containing frogs from Myanmar\u0027s Hukawng Valley, a region known for its rich amber deposits. Dr Xing and his colleagues studied a total of four pieces of amber.The largest amber was given to the research team by Chinese amber collector, Li Mo. Ms Li bought the stone from a Myanmar vendor in 2013.The other three pieces were discovered by Dr Xing and his colleagues at markets in Myanmar between 2015 and 2016.The largest piece contains frog remains measuring 2.2 centimetres (0.87 inches) long. The frog\u0027s skull, spine and most of its limbs have been preserved.The frog is believed to be a young frog less than two years old, judging by the fact that some of the bones in its ears and around its wrists had not been fully developed, said another member of the research team Edward Stanley.Dr Stanley, from the Florida Museum of Natural History, called the fossil highly valuable because the frog is likely to have lived on the tree, therefore it would be difficult for its body to survive for such a long time.The second specimen is seven millimetres (0.28 inches) long and comprises the majority of the frog\u0027s body, except for its head. The rest two pieces preserve the limbs of two frogs.  Researchers from China and the United States obtained a total of four pieces of amber (right). Remains of the frogs are well preserved by the stones (left is one of them) and closely studied          The four pieces of amber were first discovered in Hukawng Valley in northern MyanmarResearchers have managed to understand the anatomy the species after putting the amber through 3-D CT scans.The examination gave researchers unprecedented, detailed insights into the bone structure of the animals. With the information in hand, scientists managed to illustrate the frog\u0027s likely appearance using computer-generated imagery.Dr. David Blackburn, another researcher from the team, told MailOnline that it was \u0027exhilarating\u0027 to hold these small fossils up to the light and see the small skeletons within.Dr. Blackburn is an evolutionary biologist specialised in frogs at the Florida Museum of Natural History. He said his role in the project was to scan and describe the fossils.He explained these ancient frogs would have been similar to modern-day frogs such as fire-bellied toads and midwife toads, adding that all toads are in fact types of frog. However, Dr. Blackburn also said that the fossils are missing important parts, such as the frogs\u0027 hips and pelvis, and this has posed challenge for the researchers to make more detailed comparisons between the ancient frogs and other known species.           The ancient frog species has been compared to the modern day fire-bellied toads (pictured)          They are also said to be similar to midwife toads (pictured) which are found in most of EuropeThe newly discovered species has been named Electrorana Limoae. \u0027Electrorana\u0027 is a combined word of \u0027amber\u0027 and \u0027frog\u0027 in Latin while \u0027Limoae\u0027 pays tribute to Li Mo, the amber collector who gave the largest gemstone to the scientists. The species could have lived in ponds near the Hukawng Valley and fed on mosquitoes, beetles, spiders and other creatures that didn\u0027t have a backbone.Dr. Blackburn said it is exciting to find direct evidence of ancient frogs living in wet tropical forests. \u0027While frogs today live throughout the wet tropics, we have little evidence of this association from the fossil record.\u0027Humid and hot northern Myanmar is renowned for its deposits of amber. Many animals and plants from the Cretaceous Period became trapped in tree sap and have been kept until today.Dr Xing Lida has previously led a separate research team to discover an incredibly well-preserved ancient bird trapped in amber from 98.97 million years ago.The animal was dubbed the \u0027pancake bird\u0027 by Dr Xing because it is thin, and is so far the most complete specimen of an ancient bird found stuck inside amber. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/13/11/4D1F002300000578-5838857-image-a-3_1528886220929.jpg","title":"What Karl Stefanovic net worth","story":"     Karl Stefanovic attends the Witchery x OCRF White Shirt Campaign Launch 2018 in SydneyWho is Karl Stefanovic?Born on August 12, 1974 in Darlinghurst, New South Wales, Karl Stefanovic studied journalism at university before taking up a position with TVNZ as a reporter for One Network News in New Zealand. In 1998, Kark returned to Australia and worked for Ten News in Brisbane.Two years later he moved to the Nine Network and started out as a reporter and back-up presenter for National Nine News. After covering the Warragamba bushfires, he was given a role to Nine’s Sydney newsroom.Stefanovic went on to replace Today host Steve Liebmann in 2005 and still presents the show to this day. Karl has also filled in on A Current Affair and participated on Torvill and Dean’s Dancing on Ice. He also worked on Carols by Candlelight and is a reporter on 60 Minutes.He met Cassandra Thorburn in 1995 and they later married, having three children together before separating after 21 years. Their orce was finalised in October 2017.          Stefanovic went on to replace Steve Liebmann in 2005 and still presents Today to this dayKarl Stefanovic and Jasmine YarbroughAfter meeting on a Sydney Harbour boat cruise in December 2016, Karl Stefanovic and Jasmine Yarbrough were seen kissing the following February and their romance was confirmed. A year later, the pair were engaged despite claiming to take things slowly.\u0027We are taking things really, really slowly. I certainly did not expect to meet someone five months after I broke up with my wife. That was not planned. I met her on a boat in Sydney. We have a really lovely relationship, but it\u0027s got to be slow for a variety of reasons,\u0027 Karl said.They made their first appearance at the Mercedes Benz Fashion Week and spent time together in Bora Bora and Mexico, where Karl met Jasmine’s parents for the first time. However, many slammed Karl’s quick move from Cassandra to Jasmine, including former KIIS FM radio host Meshel Laurie.The radio host blasted their displays of affection as ‘insensitive’ and ‘shameless’. \u0027It feels a little insensitive, obviously I don\u0027t know these people. Is it criminal? No. Is it illegal? No, is it a bit bloody shameless and rotten? Maybe.’           Cassandra Thorburn and Karl Stefanovic attend the Global Illumination Gala Dinner 2008In the marriage that lasted over 21 years, Cassandra seemed to act as the traditional mother and wife and would ‘struggle to re-establish her career, following two decades of standing loyally by her husband’s side as a somewhat “traditional wife and mother”.’After their separation, it was rumoured that Stefanovic had agreed to a ‘orce financialproperty settlement’ and from the deal, Karl received $500,000 (£284,000) out of the couple’s combined net worth of $6.5 million (£3.7m) as well as his Mercedes Benz car. Cassandra got the remaining $6 million (£3.4m), 92 per cent of the asset pool.Creek, a managing director and special counsel in orce law, believed that Cassandra is able to enter the workforce and earn the same as her ex-husband. ‘Perhaps Mr Stefanovic is shortly to inherit a large fortune. Maybe he is heading off to the United States, where sports commentators earn more money than President Trump and all his children combined,’ he said.Who is Cooke Maroney?

Barrett in these pictures, snapped by artist and photographer Skyler Brown          Above: the boat in its heyday. The Mamie S. Barrett is a steel-hulled sternwheel river towboat constructed with scow bow and steam engine rig. It was built in 1921 by the Howard Brothers of Jeffersonville, IndianaThose luxurious touches are long gone, however, as this one-time-gem, a steam-powered towboat built in 1921, lies rotting after being abandoned at Deer Park, Louisiana, 10 miles from the Mississippi.Haunting pictures show the flaking walls of the interior with the remnants of a kitchen area still visible, doors hanging off their hinges and ceilings falling down.Other striking shots show the rusting exterior of the once-proud boat as it lies beached upon a green bank.          Debris covers the floor of the Mamie S. Barrett, a steamboat which was bought by the US Army Corps of Engineers in late 1923. The Barrett was designed to accommodate a crew of 11 officers and 27 men          Above: peeling walls and decaying walls are evident inside the once-proud boat, which was ravaged by fire last year. It enjoyed a long and varied career on the inland river system, and underwent numerous modifications since its launching in 1921          It\u0027s not clear whether some of the equipment which can still be seen inside the decaying boat was originally part of the vessel, or has been dumped inside it, since it was left to deteriorate 10 miles from the Mississippi RiverIt would take a mammoth amount of money to restore this historic steamboat, which has notched up close to 100 years, to its former luxurious condition.Originally named the Mamie S. Barrett, the US Army Corps of Engineers bought the steamboat in late 1923, two years after the 124-foot-long boat had been constructed at a cost of $145,000 (£108,000) at the Howard Shipyard in Jeffersonville, Indiana.The vessel was used by the Army Corps for 24 years, to cruise inland waters. President Franklin D. Roosevelt would have known it as the Penniman, as it was renamed in 1935.          Under foliage, the former towboat and floating restaurant lies abandoned on the shore. In the 1950s the second deck was partially enclosed with wood panels and jalousie windows          Peeling paint can be seen on the walls of the boat, which is also being overtaken by weeds at Deer Park, Louisiana. In 1981 the entire hull was filled with special foam to prevent further deterioration of the vessel. Estimates around that time indicated that over $725,000 would be needed to rehabilitate the Barrett into a first class restaurant and boutiqueIn 1942, the commander in chief inspected certain strategic industrial and military sites related to the war effort via the Mississippi River. But information on these trips, which included a visit to Camp Shelby, was not publicized at the time, for security reasons. It also was employed as a towboat for hauling rock and lumber to sites for revetment work. In 1945 the Barrett carried a group of important officials and dignitaries on an inspection tour of the Mississippi River between Minneapolis and Cairo.          The floor is pocked with holes as the elements continue to take a toll on the derelict boat. The Mamie S. Barrett, built in 1921 as the flagship vessel for the Barrett Towboat and Barge Line Company, is significant as a rare surviving form of riverboat transportation and for its historical association with the Howard Brothers Ship Yards of Jeffersonville, Indiana          During the vessel\u0027s relatively long period of service on the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers (1921-1949), riverboat transportation and technology underwent a period of great transition, passing from the age of steam powered sternwheelers into the modern era of propeller driven, diesel powered vesselsAnd before it was dumped on the shore and left to decay over 30 years ago, the vessel underwent various conversions.The Barrett has been a floating clubhouse, restaurant and, during the 1980s, a showboat with a 120-seat theater on the main deck. The boat, which was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983, was bought to be used as a casino boat three decades ago. But that never eventuated, reports steamboats.org.In the 1990s, having survived two floods, the boat was donated to the town of Rosedale, but it had no use for the vessel.          Although a substantial number of sternwheelers had been built during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, very few still survive          The Mamie S. Barrett was launched at the Howard Yards on August 11, 1921, making her maiden voyage to Cincinnati two weeks later in tow of the J. D. LanePlans to restore it have failed to materialize and last year, when the Mississippi River rose to the area it had been left to rot, the Mamie S. Barrett caught fire and was mostly destroyed.Documenting changes since that fire in a haunting series of photos, artist and photographer Skyler Brown, of Sacramento, California, said he was drawn to the vessel after \u0027hearing rumors of a large abandoned steamboat somewhere along the Mississippi River.\u0027\u0027I\u0027ve been documenting abandoned locations around the world for several years now,\u0027 he added.Paul McCartney spotted doing Carpool Karaoke with James CordenFisherman dies after being chased into icy river by brown bearMexican politician shot dead while taking selfie with fanDad puts woman in chokehold after she punches his daughter\u0027Paranormal activity\u0027 caught on camera in Manchester flatThree pro wrestlers lose game of tug of war with young lionWoman tries to force open door of moving bus to chase boyfriendMerkel receives pressure to toughen Germany\u0027s border policyTeen arrested after clashing with officers outside of schoolA look into the relationship between Emmanuel and BrigitteAmsterdam roundabout gives right of way to cyclistsAdele sings along to \u0027Lean on Me\u0027 at Grenfell Tower memorial    The Barrett and other sternwheel towboats such as the Loretta Howard, long considered the standard of the period, were two of only 17 sternwheel towboats built at the Howard Yards after 1920          As a result of the Depression, the Barrett Line sold the towboat in 1937 to the Army Corps of Engineers Office in Florence, Alabama. The Barrett was transferred to the St. Louis District and renamed the motor vessel Penniman, in honor of William H.

In 2016, she announced her reelection bid and said that her priorities were affordable housing as well as environmental health and public transport.After the death of Mayor Ed Lee, London Breed became the acting mayor by virtue of her role as President of the Board of Supervisors. In 2018, Mark Farrell was selected to serve in the interim until the election.          London Breed campaigns with Senator Scott Weiner in downtown San Francisco, CaliforniaLondon Breed mayorDuring a time in which African-Americans are becoming increasingly scarce in the US city, London Breed was declared the winner of the race to become mayor of San Francisco.After eight days of counting, Breed built up a lead in the 250,000 ballots that were tallied and won by 2,177 votes, with only 6,700 left to count.After her win, London revealed that her election sends a message to San Francisco’s youth, especially to those, like herself, are growing up poor.‘No matter where you come from, no matter what you decide to do in life, you can do anything you want to do. Never let your circumstances determine your outcome in life,’ Breed said.She will take office next month and will also be the second woman to be elected mayor in the history of San Francisco, after US Senator Dianne Feinstein. Breed has vowed to represent all of the city and lead the parts that are economically thriving but mired in homelessness and unaffordable homes.London also said that she would get rid of the homeless tent camps within a year of taking office, before she will need to run in November 2019 after completing Ed Lee’s term, which ends in early 2020.The city has an unusual ranked choice voting system that allows voter to pick their top three candidates for mayor. This means that as votes are being counted, second-place and third-place choices are also tallied.Ahead of the election, Mark Leno and Jane Kim asked supporters to pick the other as their second choice in order to block London Breed from winning entirely, saying that she represented what had made San Francisco so inequitable, despite all being Democrats.          Former state Senator Mark Leno speaks to reporters in San Francisco ahead of the electionThis portrayal as a lackey for big business affected Breed and she said: ‘I ask people to not attribute what I\u0027ve done — my success and how hard I\u0027ve worked — to not reduce that or attribute that to someone else,’ Breed told the AP in a pre-election interview.At City Hall, she paid homage to her late grandmother and said she probably had a hand in her win. ‘She took care of the community, she took care of me even on days when I didn\u0027t deserve it, and so being here in her honor means so much,’ she said.Who is Cooke Maroney?

She had to have them removed and went on to have more surgery after a blood clot developed after the removalShe said: \u0027I’m fuming, it’s not just one mistake that place has made.\u0027They’ve made the mistake with me, not just once but twice.\u0027Ms Finegan-White underwent the double-mastectomy to reduce the risk of her developing breast cancer. She had the surgery in October 2014 after both her late mother, Carol Manola and her aunt were diagnosed with the disease.  Donna had asked for \u0027temporary expanders\u0027 - which stretch the skin and pectoral muscle - to be implanted immediately following the mastectomy, a spokesman for Irwin Mitchell claimed.He said instead she received permanent sub-pectoral breast implants, without her consent.  She said: \u0027I expected to come out of the surgery risk free of breast cancer and without permanent implants as this is what had been agreed upon.           The Great Western Hospital in Swindon where a woman was given  breast implant surgery without her consent \u0027Yet, I woke up with implants, which I had never signed for in the consultations with the surgeon. At this point, I felt shocked and very upset and frustrated as it was completely unexpected.\u0027Following the surgery Donna, who has a son and a daughter, sought medical help several times for severe pain and swelling in her breasts and suffered a significant psychological reaction.She finally underwent corrective surgery to remove the implants on 23 February, 2016.However, Ms Finegan-White had to undergo further emergency surgery to remove a blood clot that had developed following the removal of the implants that could have killed her.Man \u0027paid for his girlfriend\u0027s boob job, holidays and online...\u0027Creepy\u0027 IT teacher \u0027shone laser pen at pupil\u0027s genitals,...Share this articleShe added: \u0027We put a great deal of trust in medical staff, relying on them for expert care. I just feel totally let down and angry by the care I received.\u0027I suffered a great deal of pain and trauma for months because of the implants that I never signed up for.\u0027By speaking out I hope my story reminds hospitals of the importance of upholding patient consent.\u0027Ms Finegan-White has called on hospital trusts to ensure they honour the wishes of patients.She instructed specialist medical negligence lawyers at Irwin Mitchell to investigate the level of care she received from Great Western Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.          Donna Finegan-White was shocked when she had breast implants inserted without her permission after she had a double mastectomy The trust denied it had acted negligently but admitted the issue of whether Donna consented to the implants fell below \u0027reasonable standards\u0027. It settled the matter out of court.James Pink, expert medical negligence lawyer at Irwin Mitchell representing Donna, said: \u0027Donna had undergone counselling at the request of the Hospital Trust to prepare psychologically for double mastectomy so was incredibly shocked and upset to come out of surgery with implants she had not consented to.\u0027This was already a distressing time and this just compounded her problems.\u0027The NHS had shown care and compassion in helping Donna prepare for her surgery. However, what was meant to be an operation designed to reduce the risk of Donna being diagnosed with breast cancer ended up causing her much unnecessary distress and suffering.\u0027We now call on the NHS Trust to ensure it learns lessons from Donna\u0027s case and realises the importance of ensuring policies and checks surrounding patient consent are upheld at all times.\u0027A spokeswoman for Great Western Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said: \u0027We were given consent by the patient for implants in 2014, we did not act negligently and the case was settled in 2016.\u0027We have clear and effective consent processes that are followed across the Trust, which outline the risks that patients may face during and after any surgery, including the common risk of blood clots. Based on this case we are further strengthening our consent processes.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/14/07/4D278A1800000578-0-image-m-6_1528956508870.jpg","title":"Hungarys PM Viktor Orb n claims population Europe replaced","story":"    Hungary\u0027s far-right Prime Minister Viktor Orbán (pictured) claimed the population of Europe is being replaced with mass migrationIn response to press reports that Soros\u0027 organisations are in every Balkam country, Orbán declared: \u0027It\u0027s worth fighting against a force that is stronger than us – against a force like George Soros and his army.\u0027We\u0027ve played a role in this network being exposed, as we brought it out into the open, and now they have to openly state their goals. They want immigration.\u0027The replacement of populations and peoples is under way in Europe, partly because speculators like George Soros can make large financial profits.\u0027They are set on the ruination of Europe, because they\u0027re hoping for large profits.\u0027Doctors and nurses from outside EU will be given visas to...Ship carrying 900 migrants docks in Sicily as Italy fights...Share this articleAs well as profits, Orbán also insisted that an ideological motivation for the creation of a multicultural Europe.He said: \u0027On the other hand, there is also an ideological motivation: they believe in a multicultural Europe they don\u0027t like Christian Europe they don\u0027t like the traditions of a Christian Europe and they definitely don\u0027t like Christians.\u0027They believe that if they mix us with some other kind of people we\u0027ll be more beautiful, we\u0027ll look better, and Europe will be a better place in which to live.\u0027We, however, do not want to mix with others.\u0027          Orbán claims financial speculators like US billionaire George Soros (pictured) are hoping to profit from the \u0027ruination of Europe\u0027 with mass migrationHe added that the current rising tide of mass migration poses a challenge for Hungary\u0027s neighbours.\u0027We are indeed seeing signs of a new migration wave, of a rising tide following a low tide it\u0027s rising now, and this poses a challenge,\u0027 he said.\u0027We\u0027ve managed to ensure that now every migrant knows that they shouldn\u0027t follow the path marked by the signpost pointing to Hungary.\u0027This is good, but it won\u0027t protect our neighbours, and as we also need stable neighbours we must provide them with help.\u0027It comes after Orbán\u0027s government proposed legislation, to be voted on later this month, which would criminalise the act of helping asylum-seekers.Leading Hungarian non-governmental organisations denounced the so-called \u0027Stop Soros\u0027 package of bills that could see activists and lawyers jailed.The measures would allow courts to pass criminal sentences including jail terms of up to one year on iniduals for aiding asylum-seekers.Representatives from prominent local NGOs called the proposals \u0027an attack against human rights defenders\u0027.Parliament should \u0027drop the idea of criminalising our work which is in solidarity with asylum-seekers and refugees\u0027, Julia Ivan, head of Amnesty International in Hungary, told a press conference outside parliament.          Orbán\u0027s government has proposed legislation which would criminalise the act of helping asylum-seekers\u0027We do what we have to do, we are not criminals,\u0027 she said.The government says the laws are aimed at persons helping undeserving migrants to acquire refugee status, for example if those persons were not in immediate danger before entering Hungary, or who entered the country illegally.Named after the liberal Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros, the measures are the government\u0027s latest broadside against the 87-year-old, who has long been accused by the fiercely anti-immigration Orbán of facilitating migration into Europe.The run-up to a parliamentary election in April, which Orbán\u0027s ruling Fidesz party won by a landslide, was dominated by anti-migrant and anti-Soros messaging on pro-government media.After the vote, Orbán vowed to clampdown on NGOs, whose staff he called \u0027Soros mercenaries\u0027.According to Marta Pardavi, co-chair of the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, a group providing free legal aid to asylum-seekers, Stop Soros is meant \u0027to stigmatise, intimidate, and sanction human rights defenders\u0027 work\u0027.The measures are \u0027unacceptable,..and should have no place in a democratic country that is run by the rule-of-law\u0027, Pardavi told the press conference.The UNHCR refugee agency has also called on the government to withdraw the plans.They \u0027would significantly restrict the ability of NGOs and iniduals to support asylum-seekers and refugees\u0027, it said in a statement.The EU\u0027s rights watchdog, the Venice Commission, has also begun a probe into the laws\u0027 compliance with EU values, and is due to give its opinion later in June.The NGOs have pledged to use all legal means to challenge the legislation, depending on the final version approved by parliament, including bringing cases before the Hungarian constitutional court and the EU courts. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/14/15/05F8B1B1000003E8-5844203-image-a-47_1528986748265.jpg","title":"Who Jack Brooksbank Princess Eugenies fiance revealed ahead Royal Wedding","story":"    Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank pose in the Picture Gallery at Buckingham PalaceWho is Jack Brooksbank?Born May 3, 1986 and once nicknamed ‘barman Jack’, Princess Eugenie’s husband-to-be has worked his way up through some of London’s bars and nightspots, after spurning university and embarking on a career in the hospitality business.Despite being known as a party animal, Jack Brooksbank has put his best foot forward when it comes to entrepreneurship and set up a wine merchants business. He is also an ambassador for Casamigos tequila, part-owned by actor George Clooney.Jack went to school at Stowe, the renowned £10,000 a term Buckinghamshire school, whose former pupils include the likes of Richard Branson and John Sainsbury. He is also known to be a close friend of Prince Harry’s ex-girlfriend Cressida Bonas.          Princess Eugenie of York and her fiance Jack Brooksbank with her mother Sarah FergusonJack Brooksbank parentsThe son of chartered accountant George Brooksbank and his wife Nicola, Jack is also the great-grandson of Viscount Thomas Coke, a former Earl of Leicester and peer in the 19th century.However this Viscount, who died in 1909, is also the great, great-grandfather of Eugenie’s mother, Sarah Ferguson. This means that Eugenie and Jack are actually distant cousins.Princess Eugenie and Jack BrooksbankPrincess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank met during a skiing holiday in Verbier, Switzerland back in 2012 and a friend recalled that there was ‘an immediate attraction’. However, their relationship has not been easy with Eugenie studying in Newcastle and Jack working in London when they met.\u0027She is very uncomplicated. She\u0027s a doer, a worker, as is Jack. They are very suited. Jack\u0027s always worked hard. He chose not to go to university so that he could get on the career ladder and Eugenie loved that. She didn\u0027t care at all that he was a waiter. She might be a princess, but Eugenie comes with few airs and graces,’ a friend said.In 2013, when Eugenie moved to New York City to work at the Paddle8 auction house, their relationship was tested but they remained together. Two months after their relationship became long-distance, Brooksbank told the Daily Mail: \u0027We spend a lot of time on Skype. It\u0027s great. We are still very much together.\u0027Eugenie moved to the UK in 2015 and started working at the Saville Row art gallery Hauser \u0026amp Wirth. After months of rumours, Jack proposed in Nicaragua and she accepted.

As previously announced, the wedding will take place at St. George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle,’ the tweet read.How did Jack Brooksbank make his money?Although Jack Brooksbank’s net worth has not been made public, it is known that his work in the hospitality business has been fruitful after taking a chance and not following his peers into finance degrees and City jobs.After gaining the permission of his parents, he worked as a waiter at Chelsea’s Admiral Codrington and it was here that he met businessman Piers Adam, who encouraged him to work at The Markham Inn, in the same area.Jack began to mingle in Royal circles and got to know Prince Harry and his friend Guy Pelly. He went on to help run Mayfair nightclub Mahiki, one of London’s most exclusive.          Jack Brooksbank and Princess Eugenie of York attend Tracey Emin\u0027s birthday partyBrooksbank was also said to be a stabilising influence on Eugenie, once considered a ‘party princess’ and they have both cut down on clubbing as they have grown older. After getting to know the business, Jack became a brand ambassador for Clooney’s Casamigos tequila.This move was considered to be tactical and to make him seem more respectable ahead of his potential welcome into the Royal Family. Jack also said that he intended to open a chain of pubs and hostelries.In 2013, he said: \u0027I want to create a chain of pubs. It has been my dream since I was 18.

This is really desperate - the fact they are asking for office supplies and toilet paper.\u0027As a parent, if the school is begging for toilet paper then it makes you wonder what\u0027s next.\u0027Ms del Campo says the new National Funding Formula, which was designed to iron out discrepancies in the way funding was applied to schools, is seriously underfunded if schools are begging for essential items.She said: \u0027It doesn\u0027t sit right with me that the Government can find £50million for grammar schools when others are begging for toilet paper.\u0027The £50million fund, announced in May, is for selective schools that can prove their commitment to admitting disadvantaged pupils.Kate Foreman, business manager at St Edmund Campion, said this is the first year the school has received less funding from the Education Funding Agency than the previous year.  Mrs May has represented the constituency of Maidenhead for 21 years. In March, she told the House of Commons that the Government was spending more on schools \u0027than ever before\u0027She added that a further £70,000 had been lost due to the Government\u0027s decision to cut the Education Services Grant.Academies and councils stopped receiving the grant last September.Mrs Foreman said she is uncertain what the future holds for the school which has around 420 pupils aged four to 11.She said: \u0027We\u0027re still committed to providing our children with an outstanding education but there\u0027s only so much you can do. Financially we\u0027re OK this year, and the next two years will probably be fine but any longer than that is harder to evaluate.\u0027It\u0027s certainly got more difficult over the last few years.\u0027The Government has defended the funding it provides for schools.Detailing the new National Funding Formula in July last year, then Education Secretary Justine Greening said it will be a \u0027fairer\u0027 distribution and delivers \u0027higher per pupil funding in respect of every school, and in every local area\u0027.But Angela Rayner, Labour\u0027s Shadow Education Secretary, insists the Government has done nothing to reverse cuts.Speaking earlier this year, she said: \u0027£2.7billion has been cut from the budgets of England\u0027s schools since 2015, and teacher recruitment targets have been missed for the fifth year in a row.\u0027Until this Government gets the basics right, they will never be able to deliver the education that every child deserves.\u0027Other items on St Edmund Campion\u0027s Wish List include plasters, Pritt Sticks, colouring pencils, marker pens, envelopes and lever arch files."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/14/17/4D3C490F00000578-5844567-image-a-16_1528993327395.jpg","title":"Roseanne reveals watched Malcolm X documentary planted trees sleeping soundly without Ambien","story":"Tweet, tweet, tweet: Roseanne Barr (above in March) said antisemitism and the plight of Jewish people were central themes in the Planet of the Apes films          Comment: \u0027That is what my tweet referred to-the anti semitism of the Iran deal.

I have always lived and taught my children to be inclusive. I believe our show strived to embrace different backgrounds and opinions, through open dialogue.\u0027Barr was none too happy with that statement and fired back on Twitter: \u0027I created the platform for that inclusivity and you know it. ME. You throw me under the bus. nice!\u0027Fishman responded, stating: \u0027You fought, built, and designed Roseanne for inclusiveness.

The victim said he was ‘petrified’ by this, the jury heard.Miss Cottage told how King tried to reassure him ‘saying that he could telephone a girlfriend to arrange for her to come over and relieve him of his virginity.’The boy said he wanted to leave, King gave him the tickets and let him go.Share this articleLater he dedicated the song ‘Illegal Alien’ by Genesis to both schoolboys on his Christmas Day radio show.Asked in police interview if he had touched the boy, King quipped: ‘I don’t think I would have done unless he’d asked me very politely.’King, who had a series of top ten hits and hosted TV shows like ‘Entertainment USA’ is accused of sexual offences against 11 victims at Southwark Crown Court.On another occasion King took one of his victims to visit a ‘friend’ at school - a sixth form border.When police raided his home they found a picture pinned up of a blonde boy, signed on the back: ‘To Jonathan, Love X, Nov ‘78.’Police also found a diary detailing sexual exploits with young boys on a trip to Mexico.He speaks of ‘trolling’ and ‘cruising’ to pick up 15 and 16-year-old boys in his car for sex.      King name-dropped stars from the time like comedian Kenny Everett (left) and model Samantha Fox (right), the court was toldHe took the boy to a Chinese restaurant and got him drunk while name dropping Kenny Everett before and then took him back to his home.The prosecutor described how the victim was shown King\u0027s music room and \u0027his next memory was of waking, naked, in the defendant\u0027s bed which had black shiny sheets.After carrying out a sex attack on him, King gave him £5 for a taxi home and he never saw him again.The prosecutor showed jurors a video of King\u0027s home, pointing out a topless picture of 1980s page three model and singer Samantha Fox.\u0027Samantha Fox is someone who the defendant occasionally described as his girlfriend to one or two of these young men,\u0027 she added.One said he was \u0027star struck\u0027 when King pulled up in his car and started speaking to him.                                                     "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/14/16/21F57D6900000578-5844815-image-a-66_1528991076076.jpg","title":"When Eid al Fitr 2018 celebrate UK","story":"    Egyptians try to catch balloons distributed for free marking Eid outside a mosque in CairoWhat is Eid al-Fitr?Eid al-Fitr, known as the feast that breaks the fast of Ramadan, is the first and only day of the new month called Shawwal when Muslims are not permitted to fast.Ramadan, one of the Five Pillars of Islam which lasts between 29 and 30 days, is based on when a new moon is sighted by local religious authorities. When the crescent moon is seen, Eid can begin.Considered one of the most important holidays of the Islamic calendar, Eid has its own particular set of prayers that can only be recited in congregation and often called out in parks, community centres or mosques called the Salat al-Eid.          Iranian men perform the Eid prayers at Tehran University to mark on the religious festivalWhen is Eid al Fitr 2018?Due to the dates of Ramadan varying from one year to another on the Gregorian calendar, Eid is also on a different day each year because it is determined by the lunar calendar.In 2018, Eid al-Fitr will take place on Friday, June 15 after the crescent moon is seen on the evening of June 14 in Saudi Arabia.The time in Saudi Arabia is three hours later than Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) and at present, there is a two hour difference between the UK and Riyadh because of British Summer Time (BST).This means that as sunset is predicted for 6.43pm this evening, this would be 4:43pm in Britain. But as astronomers have predicted that the moon will not be visible until the next day, Eid al-Fitr will officially begin on Friday.Saudi Arabia’s Supreme Court has requested for Muslims to keep an eye out for the crescent moon and report it to authorities as many Islamic scholars insist on it being visible with the naked eye.          Pakistani worshippers hold prayers for Eid in the Lahore King\u0027s Mosque for the religious festivalHow to celebrate Eid in the UKEvery year, Eid al-Fitr is a big celebration with the Salat al-Eid being recited. Muslims will gather at mosques or open-air areas to pray on the first morning before eating breakfast with their family and friends, their first meal in daylight in over a month.Events will also be held in London’s Trafalgar Square and Birmingham’s Small Heath Park to mark the start of the new month.Muslims also honour Eid by giving to charity and this is referred to as Zakat al-Fitr. Donations will be given to those who are not able to join in the feast and celebrate the breaking of the fast.Who is Cooke Maroney?

The film follows the prophet Muhammad and the beginning of the Islamic religion in Mecca.The Message depicts when the first Muslims were persecuted and shows their exodus to Medina, after Muhammad was warned of an assassination plot against him before ending with their triumphant return to Mecca.It was made in English with Anthony Quinn and Irene Papas as the main characters and in Arabic, with leading Arab stars Abdullah Gheith and Mouna Wasef from Egypt and Syria respectively.          The Message will be the first Arabic film to get a commercial screening in Riyadh (pictured)Why was The Message banned?The Message was banned in many Muslim-majority countries and in the US, its release in cinemas was suspended after members of an extremist group called the Hanafi movement staged a siege in Washington DC.The group took a number of hostages and killed two people because they thought  Anthony Quinn had played the character of Muhammad in the film. In addition to this, because images of Muhammad are strictly forbidden in Islam, The Message was criticised by conservative Muslims.However, the director Moustapha Akkad was aware of this and produced an epic where Muhammad was never seen or heard. In 2018, more than 40 years after the ban, the Saudi censorship board have cleared it to be screened in 4K in time for Eid celebrations.With both versions being cleared, The Message will be screened by producer Trancas Entertainment and distributor Front Row in the VOX Riyadh Park multiplex in the Saudi capital.

However, the blue tick seems to have disappeared overnight.The controversial tweet may have caused the social network to follow their guidelines, which say that the social media platform will remove verification of anyone that is ‘promoting hate andor violence against, or directly attacking or threatening other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or disease among other reasons’.A Twitter spokesperson told the Daily Caller that the company does not comment on inidual accounts for ‘privacy and security reasons’.The ‘Satanic Jew’ tweets are not the first time Farrakhan sparked accusations of anti-semitism.In 1984, he described Judaism as a ‘gutter religion’ and branded supporters of Israel as criminals.He once said that \u0027the Jews don\u0027t like Farrakhan, so they call me Hitler. Well, that\u0027s a good name. Hitler was a very great man\u0027.When speaking about Hezbollah, he said: \u0027They call them terrorists, I call them freedom fighters.\u0027Here is all you need to know about Louis Farrakhan including his wife, children, net worth and Nation of Islam.Who is Louis Farrakhan?Louis Farrakhan is the leader of the Nation of Islam, the American religious group.Born in New York on May 11, 1933 as Louis Eugene Walcott, Farrakhan initially trained as a teacher and a nightclub singer.He won a track scholarship to college in North Carolina and was a talented classical violinist, having first started playing the instrument at the age of 5.In 1955, the religious and political figure Malcolm X persuaded Farrakhan to join the Nation of Islam. Upon joining, Farrakhan dropped his last name and became Louis X. He later became Abdul Haleem Farrakhan, and ultimately Louis Farrakhan.At the beginning of the sixties, a rift formed between Malcolm X and the Nation of Islam leader, Elijah Muhammad.In 1964, Farrakhan criticised Malcolm X in the NOI newspaper saying: ‘The die is set and Malcolm shall not escape... such a man is worthy of death.’The following February, Malcolm X was assassinated and Farrakhan became the NOI spokesman.By the late 1970s, Farrakhan was the head of the Nation of Islam, becoming a highly influential figure on the political landscape during the 1980s.In 1984, Farrakhan supported Jesse Jackson’s presidential bid, and subsequently threatened the Washington Post reporter that reported the story about Jesse Jackson using anti-Semitic language in private.          Farrakhan tweeted a link to his May sermon about Harvey Weinstein that was called \u0027Thoroughly and completely unmasking the Satanic Jew and the Synagogue of Satan\u0027The following year he accepted a $5 million interest-free loan from Muammar Gaddafi.In 1986, Farrakhan sued Ronald Reagan over the Libya sanctions and was banned from entering the UK.In 1991, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, which returned again in 1999. He had surgery in 2001 and again in 2007.In 1995, Farrakhan was in the news for organising the ‘Million Man March’ to Washington DC. Hundreds of thousands of black men marched and pledged to remain committed to their families and communities.Louis Farrakhan’s wife and childrenFarrakhan married Betsy Walcott, nee Ross, in 1953 and the couple had nine children. Betsy subsequently changed her name to Khadijah Farrakhan.          Farrakhan organised the 1995 Million Man March as well as the Million Family March in 2000The couple’s oldest son, Louis Farrakhan Jr, was reported dead by the Nation of Islam on June 4, 2018. The statement from the organisation said the 60-year-old had a heart condition and died peacefully in his sleep.What is Louis Farrakhan’s net worth?Louis Farrakhan’s net worth is estimated to be $3 million (£2.2m), according to Celebrity Net Worth.What is the Nation of Islam?The Nation of Islam is a religious and political movement that started in the early 1930s by W.D. Fard Muhammad. Muhammad’s goal was, according to the Nation of Islam website, ‘to teach the downtrodden and defenseless Black people a thorough Knowledge of God and of themselves, and to put them on the road to Self-Independence with a superior culture and higher civilization than they had previously experienced.’Muhammad reportedly disappeared in 1934, and his disciple Elijah Muhammad took over. The organisation rose to prominence when Malcolm Little, later to be Malcolm X, joined, with its numbers swelling to tens of thousands by the 1970s. Muhammad Ali was one of its most famous members.Who is Cooke Maroney?

Although this was housed in a stone building, the houses were often quickly constructed from pre-made designs. They were located in neighborhood clusters centered on their own commercial center, and were surrounded by large amounts of green space          While Oak Ridge served as the headquarters of the operation, Los Alamos dealt with the mechanisms of the bomb, and Hanford was in charge of the production of plutonium. Pictured is a car pulled up at the main gate of the Los Alamos Project, next to a sign asking for all visitors to show their security passes          Built in the early years of the modern movement, these cities reflected cutting-edge ideas about town planning, mass housing, civil and mechanical engineering, and modular construction. Pictured is an aerial view of the K-25 plan at Oak Ridge, c. 1945          Keeping neighborhoods apart in their own inidual housing clusters was useful for the government, because officials did not want the scientists all gathering together and exchanging their secrets in one downtown area. The basic design of the cities would be repeated in numerous American suburbs that were constructed during the post-war era. Pictured: A house in Oak Ridge, 1944While the ethics and strategic necessity of the decision to use such a weapon first on Hiroshima and then Nagasaki are still fiercely debated, there is no question that this initiative was one of the most significant milestones in the history of scientific research and development.The Manhattan Project would not have been possible without the achievements in architecture, engineering, and planning that yielded three entirely new cities in a remarkably short time.Built in the early years of the modern movement, these cities reflected cutting-edge ideas about town planning, mass housing, civil and mechanical engineering, and modular construction.The houses – which were often built from pre-made parts to save time – were located in neighborhood clusters centered on their own commercial center, and were all surrounded by large amounts of green space.Keeping neighborhoods apart was useful for the government, a town planner told fastcodedesign.com, because officials did not want the scientists all gathering together and exchanging their secrets in one downtown area.

The film marked the first time the family have spoken out about the romance that blossomed after Macron began seeing his drama teacher (pictured in the 1990s)\u0027They were quite smitten and it was quite obvious between them and very difficult,\u0027 said Ms Auzière.Mr Macron was just 16 when he declared his love for the then Mrs Auzière, his drama teacher.Her first husband, André-Louis Auzière, moved out of the family home in Amiens, and went to live in Lille.Mr Macron\u0027s doctor parents asked Mrs Auzière to stop seeing him until he was 18 but she said \u0027I can\u0027t promise you anything,\u0027 according to the documentary.Instead, Mr Macron was sent to Paris to continue his education, and they continued seeing each until the Auzières finally orced.          Tiphaine Auzière (left) has revealed how, at the age of nine, she watched her mother Brigitte Macron (right) fall for a 15-year-old Emmanuel MacronDespite such trauma, Tiphaine Auzière said: \u0027If I had to present a vision of love, it\u0027s Emmanuel and Mummy. When they are together, it\u0027s almost as if the world does not exist.\u0027In other recent media interviews, Ms Auzière has called her mother a \u0027remarkable warrior\u0027, who gave Mr Macron a great deal of confidence.As his teacher she used to stand off stage and tell him \u0027to raise his voice\u0027, for example, said Ms Auzière.She added: \u0027I had parents who did things intelligently* things were done gradually.\u0027My dad and my mummy always took care to protect us, to not expose us and to manage things properly so that we suffered as little as possible.\u0027My dad worked in Lille during the week and, I was with my mom when she went to see Emmanuel.\u0027Mr Macron has since admitted that the young children of Tiphanie and her sister and brother are \u0027enough\u0027 for him, and he does not regret not having any of his own.Mrs Macron would not be interviewed for the documentary, but is said to have sanctioned close friends and family talking about her.She is quoted in the film as saying: \u0027I know that I hurt my children and it\u0027s the thing for which I most reproach myself but if I hadn\u0027t made that choice I would have missed out on my life.\u0027Mrs Macron suffered a great deal of criticism in Amiens, where her family owned a chain of bakeries.In a macabre twist, the documentary compared the Macron affair to the case of Gabrielle Russier, a teacher in Marseilles who committed suicide in 1969 after being convicted of seducing a 16-year-old in her class. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/14/19/0048C60A00000258-0-image-a-3_1529002761550.jpg","title":"Postmen allowed fly flag England World Cup says Theresa May","story":"    The Prime Minister said she hopes a way is found so all England football fans are able to show their support for their team           The Royal Mail said a policy in place for a number of years allowed workers to display flags in offices, but not on vehiclesMrs May\u0027s official spokesman told reporters: \u0027The Royal Mail\u0027s policies are a matter for them. \u0027But the Prime Minister believes everybody should be able to show their support for the England football team and hopes a way can be found for people to do that.\u0027The Prime Minister wishes the England football team the very best and hopes the country enjoys cheering them on.\u0027Putin\u0027s storm in a D cup: Russian leader is mocked after...Putin tells Russian women they CAN have sex with World Cup...Share this articleA Royal Mail spokesman said: \u0027Flags should not be flown on vehicles as Royal Mail has a duty of care both to all employees and to members of the public.\u0027This is a company-wide policy across the business, which covers flags and stickers across trollies, bikes, vans and lorries. \u0027No other flag or insignia should be carried next to the Royal Mail brand and insignias.

The Queen and Meghan dropped in to see schoolchildren at the Storyhouse building in Chester, but at first the youngsters didn\u0027t seem to notice the visitors had arrived          Getting on famously! The Queen and the Duchess of Sussex shared a joke as they watched a ceremony to open the new Mersey Gateway Bridge during their first official engagement togetherWhat is all the more remarkable is that it should have happened so quickly. Since her wedding on May 19, Meghan has seen the Queen only once – at last Saturday\u0027s Trooping the Colour.While she and Harry have been on honeymoon – said to have been to Canada – the Queen has also been away, to Craigowan Lodge at Balmoral.Royal aides had been thinking about a joint visit involving the monarch and Meghan but it was the Queen herself who suggested it should be sooner rather than later.Meghan\u0027s bond with Her Majesty! Harry\u0027s bride shows her...The Queen\u0027s tribute to Grenfell: Her Majesty observes...Share this articleThe Duchess of Cambridge had been married almost a year before being invited to accompany the Queen, at the start of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations in 2012 for a day in Leicester.Some will doubtless wonder if this early invitation for Meghan reflects some sort of favouritism. I understand the decision was taken because it was felt the Duchess of Sussex might need more help to adjust to life inside the Royal Family than the already poised Kate Middleton did.   Growing confidence! Meghan seemed completely at ease as she chatted with the monarch          The Duchess of Sussex looked animated as she chatted during her first official engagement with the Queen          It was felt the Duchess of Sussex might need more help to adjust to life inside the Royal Family than the already poised Kate Middleton (left) did\u0027Remember, unlike Kate she doesn\u0027t have a family to fall back on here,\u0027 said an insider.Indeed, it was noticeable how nervous Meghan appeared as she joined the carriage drive last Saturday.\u0027The Queen\u0027s thinking is simple, she wants to put her at her ease,\u0027 says one of her staff.When the invitation arrived, officials assumed Harry would be included too. Instead, it was made clear this was to be a visit for just the two women.Intriguingly, the programme was not especially designed for Meghan – as it was when the Queen took Kate to Leicester where the two sat through a fashion show. In fact it was deliberately planned as a day of typical royal events that would give Meghan a better grounding in the royal routine.\u0027Nothing too starry, lots of handshaking and meeting of local worthies,\u0027 as one insider puts it.    A sudden gust of wind made Meghan’s decision not to wear a hat on her first official engagement with the Queen rather noticeableSo a message was sent to the Queen’s private office asking what the sovereign intended to wear. The answer included mention of the hat by Rachel Trevor Morgan, which some would have taken as a suggestion for Meghan to do the same.But after some discussion, it was agreed between Buckingham and Kensington Palaces that the duchess would let her brunette locks flow free.                        So much has happened to Meghan since her wedding day: Nottingham Cottage where she and Harry live at Kensington Palace has been redecorated and the couple have spent time at their new country bolthole in Oxfordshire.Nevertheless, it is not difficult to imagine how the duchess must have been feeling as she arrived at Buckingham Palace on Wednesday evening.Whenever the Queen takes the Royal Train there is a protocol to be observed. She dines first at home and then she travels to the station, on this occasion Euston.Meghan, too, had already had supper and the two women were driven together at 10.45pm along with a handful of senior staff. Domestic staff, including footmen, stewards and a dresser, had gone ahead.Once on board the train it is understood the Queen was keen to turn in. She doesn\u0027t like eating late but she did want to ensure that Meghan was comfortable.It must have been an eye-opening experience for the American-born duchess. There are no showers on the train, but full-size baths.   The pair shared a joke during the opening ceremony, showing how a bond is clearly developing between the two women  The Queen looked in great spirits as she began her day out with Harry\u0027s new wife and the pair showed their lighthearted bond as they laughed together during an opening ceremony for the new Mersey Gateway Bridge  The Queen and Meghan were all smiles as they left Chester Town Hall, with both women carrying pretty bouquets of flowers It is thought that Meghan was provided with Prince Philip\u0027s saloon which includes a bedroom, bathroom and sitting room.By the time the train and its royal passengers arrived at Runcorn, Cheshire, yesterday morning after breakfast, Meghan and the Queen had spoken about the day ahead.That much was clear as they exchanged several observations during the ceremony to mark the opening of the Mersey Gateway Bridge.By the time she had watched the Queen unveil two plaques, completed a walkabout, attended a civic lunch and accepted numerous posies, her early stiffness had gone and she began to relax.Next week\u0027s carriage drive at Royal Ascot should be breeze. And next month sees an event where it\u0027s just possible that the Queen will be turning to the newest member of the family for help – the arrival in London of Meghan\u0027s fellow American, US President Donald Trump.

The Barrett was designed to accommodate a crew of 11 officers and 27 men          Above: peeling walls and decaying walls are evident inside the once-proud boat, which was ravaged by fire last year. It enjoyed a long and varied career on the inland river system, and underwent numerous modifications since its launching in 1921          It\u0027s not clear whether some of the equipment which can still be seen inside the decaying boat was originally part of the vessel, or has been dumped inside it, since it was left to deteriorate 10 miles from the Mississippi RiverIt would take a mammoth amount of money to restore this historic steamboat, which has notched up close to 100 years, to its former luxurious condition.Originally named the Mamie S. Barrett, the US Army Corps of Engineers bought the steamboat in late 1923, two years after the 124-foot-long boat had been constructed at a cost of $145,000 (£108,000) at the Howard Shipyard in Jeffersonville, Indiana.The vessel was used by the Army Corps for 24 years, to cruise inland waters. President Franklin D. Roosevelt would have known it as the Penniman, as it was renamed in 1935.          Under foliage, the former towboat and floating restaurant lies abandoned on the shore. In the 1950s the second deck was partially enclosed with wood panels and jalousie windows          Peeling paint can be seen on the walls of the boat, which is also being overtaken by weeds at Deer Park, Louisiana. In 1981 the entire hull was filled with special foam to prevent further deterioration of the vessel. Estimates around that time indicated that over $725,000 would be needed to rehabilitate the Barrett into a first class restaurant and boutiqueIn 1942, the commander in chief inspected certain strategic industrial and military sites related to the war effort via the Mississippi River. But information on these trips, which included a visit to Camp Shelby, was not publicized at the time, for security reasons. It also was employed as a towboat for hauling rock and lumber to sites for revetment work. In 1945 the Barrett carried a group of important officials and dignitaries on an inspection tour of the Mississippi River between Minneapolis and Cairo.          The floor is pocked with holes as the elements continue to take a toll on the derelict boat. The Mamie S. Barrett, built in 1921 as the flagship vessel for the Barrett Towboat and Barge Line Company, is significant as a rare surviving form of riverboat transportation and for its historical association with the Howard Brothers Ship Yards of Jeffersonville, Indiana          During the vessel\u0027s relatively long period of service on the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers (1921-1949), riverboat transportation and technology underwent a period of great transition, passing from the age of steam powered sternwheelers into the modern era of propeller driven, diesel powered vesselsAnd before it was dumped on the shore and left to decay over 30 years ago, the vessel underwent various conversions.The Barrett has been a floating clubhouse, restaurant and, during the 1980s, a showboat with a 120-seat theater on the main deck. The boat, which was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983, was bought to be used as a casino boat three decades ago. But that never eventuated, reports steamboats.org.In the 1990s, having survived two floods, the boat was donated to the town of Rosedale, but it had no use for the vessel.          Although a substantial number of sternwheelers had been built during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, very few still survive          The Mamie S. Barrett was launched at the Howard Yards on August 11, 1921, making her maiden voyage to Cincinnati two weeks later in tow of the J. D. LanePlans to restore it have failed to materialize and last year, when the Mississippi River rose to the area it had been left to rot, the Mamie S. Barrett caught fire and was mostly destroyed.Documenting changes since that fire in a haunting series of photos, artist and photographer Skyler Brown, of Sacramento, California, said he was drawn to the vessel after \u0027hearing rumors of a large abandoned steamboat somewhere along the Mississippi River.\u0027\u0027I\u0027ve been documenting abandoned locations around the world for several years now,\u0027 he added.Paul McCartney spotted doing Carpool Karaoke with James CordenFisherman dies after being chased into icy river by brown bearMexican politician shot dead while taking selfie with fanDad puts woman in chokehold after she punches his daughter\u0027Paranormal activity\u0027 caught on camera in Manchester flatThree pro wrestlers lose game of tug of war with young lionWoman tries to force open door of moving bus to chase boyfriendMerkel receives pressure to toughen Germany\u0027s border policyTeen arrested after clashing with officers outside of schoolA look into the relationship between Emmanuel and BrigitteAmsterdam roundabout gives right of way to cyclistsAdele sings along to \u0027Lean on Me\u0027 at Grenfell Tower memorial    The Barrett and other sternwheel towboats such as the Loretta Howard, long considered the standard of the period, were two of only 17 sternwheel towboats built at the Howard Yards after 1920          As a result of the Depression, the Barrett Line sold the towboat in 1937 to the Army Corps of Engineers Office in Florence, Alabama. The Barrett was transferred to the St. Louis District and renamed the motor vessel Penniman, in honor of William H. Penniman, an employee of the St. Louis Office from 1891 to 1934          In 1945 the Barrett carried a group of important officials and dignitaries on an inspection tour of the Mississippi River between Minneapolis and Cairo\u0027Any time I travel somewhere I research the region beforehand to find forgotten locations that are off the beaten path. \u0027There wasn\u0027t much information online about the boat or its location, but after scouring satellite imagery I found what I suspected was the boat.

However, what was meant to be an operation designed to reduce the risk of Donna being diagnosed with breast cancer ended up causing her much unnecessary distress and suffering.\u0027We now call on the NHS Trust to ensure it learns lessons from Donna\u0027s case and realises the importance of ensuring policies and checks surrounding patient consent are upheld at all times.\u0027A spokeswoman for Great Western Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said: \u0027We were given consent by the patient for implants in 2014, we did not act negligently and the case was settled in 2016.\u0027We have clear and effective consent processes that are followed across the Trust, which outline the risks that patients may face during and after any surgery, including the common risk of blood clots.

Orbán\u0027s government has proposed legislation which would criminalise the act of helping asylum-seekers\u0027We do what we have to do, we are not criminals,\u0027 she said.The government says the laws are aimed at persons helping undeserving migrants to acquire refugee status, for example if those persons were not in immediate danger before entering Hungary, or who entered the country illegally.Named after the liberal Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros, the measures are the government\u0027s latest broadside against the 87-year-old, who has long been accused by the fiercely anti-immigration Orbán of facilitating migration into Europe.The run-up to a parliamentary election in April, which Orbán\u0027s ruling Fidesz party won by a landslide, was dominated by anti-migrant and anti-Soros messaging on pro-government media.After the vote, Orbán vowed to clampdown on NGOs, whose staff he called \u0027Soros mercenaries\u0027.According to Marta Pardavi, co-chair of the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, a group providing free legal aid to asylum-seekers, Stop Soros is meant \u0027to stigmatise, intimidate, and sanction human rights defenders\u0027 work\u0027.The measures are \u0027unacceptable,..and should have no place in a democratic country that is run by the rule-of-law\u0027, Pardavi told the press conference.The UNHCR refugee agency has also called on the government to withdraw the plans.They \u0027would significantly restrict the ability of NGOs and iniduals to support asylum-seekers and refugees\u0027, it said in a statement.The EU\u0027s rights watchdog, the Venice Commission, has also begun a probe into the laws\u0027 compliance with EU values, and is due to give its opinion later in June.The NGOs have pledged to use all legal means to challenge the legislation, depending on the final version approved by parliament, including bringing cases before the Hungarian constitutional court and the EU courts. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/14/13/4D38953C00000578-5843961-image-a-62_1528980142955.jpg","title":"Cambridge UKs Dutch style roundabout gives right way cyclists","story":"      Cambridge is set to build a £1million roundabout that gives right of way to cyclists and pedestrians, meaning drivers will be the lowest priority at the busy junction           New funding will transform the Fendon Road and Queen Edith\u0027s Way roundabout to improve safety and construction work is due to begin in 2019Elderly man on mobility scooter causes havoc on dual...Shocking moment driver speeds around a roundabout with his...Share this articleCambridge ided over UK\u0027s first ever Dutch-style roundabout to built in the city - Cambridge News"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/14/15/4D39354F00000578-5844291-image-m-177_1528985119017.jpg","title":"Primary school Theresa Mays constituency begs parents donate toilet rolls","story":"    St Edmund Campion Catholic Primary School sent a desperate email to parents with a link (above) to its Amazon \u0027Wish List\u0027 page, asking for them to buy essential items it cannot afford.

As it happened, the dropping of nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki brought about Japan\u0027s surrender around a week later          Calutron operators at their panels, in the Y-12 plant at Oak Ridge during World War II in 1944. The calutrons were used to refine uranium ore into fissile material. During the Manhattan Project effort to construct an atomic explosive, workers toiled in secrecy, with no idea to what end their labors were directed          Scientists and other workers at Los Alamos National Laboratory were originally housed in trailer parts before permanent dwellings could be constructed.

The management of the facility took care to provide good facilities for staff to ensure their vital work could continue          View of a school in Oak Ridge on July 12, 1944. Great care was taken to document the cities as they existed during the war despite the utmost secrecy that surrounded them          Road building in Oak Ridge, 1944. Constructing the infrastructure needed to house so many people in such a short period of time required huge investment The basic design of the cities would be repeated in numerous American suburbs that were constructed during the post-war era.However, the revolutionary planning did not guarantee equality for all the residents, as African-American residents were often housed in plywood shacks.Secret Cities examines the innovative design and construction of Oak Ridge, Hanford, and Los Alamos, tracing their precedents in the Bauhaus and other early modern schools of architectural thought.It also looks at daily life within the cities and how it was shaped by their physical form, illuminating the social stratification and segregation that were still evident in these cities despite the high-minded principles underlying their design.Oak Ridge remains the home of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which is focused on solving problems related to energy and security.Architecture and Planning of the Manhattan Project is at the National Building Museum and runs from May 3rd to March 2rd, 2019.           The junior high school at Hanford, which was attended by the children of plant employees. The cost of the school snowballed from a $1,786,000 estimate to an actual final cost of $3,980,000          The entrance to the Technical Area at Los Alamos, which housed laboratories where scientists carried out their urgent mission. Tight security at this gate, including guards and a barbed wire fence, was necessary to prevent spies from entering.

The film marked the first time the family have spoken out about the romance that blossomed after Macron began seeing his drama teacher (pictured in the 1990s)\u0027They were quite smitten and it was quite obvious between them and very difficult,\u0027 said Ms Auzière.Mr Macron was just 16 when he declared his love for the then Mrs Auzière, his drama teacher.Her first husband, André-Louis Auzière, moved out of the family home in Amiens, and went to live in Lille.Mr Macron\u0027s doctor parents asked Mrs Auzière to stop seeing him until he was 18 but she said \u0027I can\u0027t promise you anything,\u0027 according to the documentary.Instead, Mr Macron was sent to Paris to continue his education, and they continued seeing each until the Auzières finally orced.          Tiphaine Auzière (left) has revealed how, at the age of nine, she watched her mother Brigitte Macron (right) fall for a 15-year-old Emmanuel MacronDespite such trauma, Tiphaine Auzière said: \u0027If I had to present a vision of love, it\u0027s Emmanuel and Mummy. When they are together, it\u0027s almost as if the world does not exist.\u0027In other recent media interviews, Ms Auzière has called her mother a \u0027remarkable warrior\u0027, who gave Mr Macron a great deal of confidence.As his teacher she used to stand off stage and tell him \u0027to raise his voice\u0027, for example, said Ms Auzière.She added: \u0027I had parents who did things intelligently* things were done gradually.\u0027My dad and my mummy always took care to protect us, to not expose us and to manage things properly so that we suffered as little as possible.\u0027My dad worked in Lille during the week and, I was with my mom when she went to see Emmanuel.\u0027Mr Macron has since admitted that the young children of Tiphanie and her sister and brother are \u0027enough\u0027 for him, and he does not regret not having any of his own.Mrs Macron would not be interviewed for the documentary, but is said to have sanctioned close friends and family talking about her.She is quoted in the film as saying: \u0027I know that I hurt my children and it\u0027s the thing for which I most reproach myself but if I hadn\u0027t made that choice I would have missed out on my life.\u0027Mrs Macron suffered a great deal of criticism in Amiens, where her family owned a chain of bakeries.In a macabre twist, the documentary compared the Macron affair to the case of Gabrielle Russier, a teacher in Marseilles who committed suicide in 1969 after being convicted of seducing a 16-year-old in her class. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/14/19/0048C60A00000258-0-image-a-3_1529002761550.jpg","title":"Postmen allowed fly flag England World Cup says Theresa May","story":"    The Prime Minister said she hopes a way is found so all England football fans are able to show their support for their team           The Royal Mail said a policy in place for a number of years allowed workers to display flags in offices, but not on vehiclesMrs May\u0027s official spokesman told reporters: \u0027The Royal Mail\u0027s policies are a matter for them. \u0027But the Prime Minister believes everybody should be able to show their support for the England football team and hopes a way can be found for people to do that.\u0027The Prime Minister wishes the England football team the very best and hopes the country enjoys cheering them on.\u0027Putin\u0027s storm in a D cup: Russian leader is mocked after...Putin tells Russian women they CAN have sex with World Cup...Share this articleA Royal Mail spokesman said: \u0027Flags should not be flown on vehicles as Royal Mail has a duty of care both to all employees and to members of the public.\u0027This is a company-wide policy across the business, which covers flags and stickers across trollies, bikes, vans and lorries. \u0027No other flag or insignia should be carried next to the Royal Mail brand and insignias.

The Queen and Meghan dropped in to see schoolchildren at the Storyhouse building in Chester, but at first the youngsters didn\u0027t seem to notice the visitors had arrived          Getting on famously! The Queen and the Duchess of Sussex shared a joke as they watched a ceremony to open the new Mersey Gateway Bridge during their first official engagement togetherWhat is all the more remarkable is that it should have happened so quickly. Since her wedding on May 19, Meghan has seen the Queen only once – at last Saturday\u0027s Trooping the Colour.While she and Harry have been on honeymoon – said to have been to Canada – the Queen has also been away, to Craigowan Lodge at Balmoral.Royal aides had been thinking about a joint visit involving the monarch and Meghan but it was the Queen herself who suggested it should be sooner rather than later.Meghan\u0027s bond with Her Majesty!

Meghan seemed completely at ease as she chatted with the monarch          The Duchess of Sussex looked animated as she chatted during her first official engagement with the Queen          It was felt the Duchess of Sussex might need more help to adjust to life inside the Royal Family than the already poised Kate Middleton (left) did\u0027Remember, unlike Kate she doesn\u0027t have a family to fall back on here,\u0027 said an insider.Indeed, it was noticeable how nervous Meghan appeared as she joined the carriage drive last Saturday.\u0027The Queen\u0027s thinking is simple, she wants to put her at her ease,\u0027 says one of her staff.When the invitation arrived, officials assumed Harry would be included too. Instead, it was made clear this was to be a visit for just the two women.Intriguingly, the programme was not especially designed for Meghan – as it was when the Queen took Kate to Leicester where the two sat through a fashion show. In fact it was deliberately planned as a day of typical royal events that would give Meghan a better grounding in the royal routine.\u0027Nothing too starry, lots of handshaking and meeting of local worthies,\u0027 as one insider puts it.    A sudden gust of wind made Meghan’s decision not to wear a hat on her first official engagement with the Queen rather noticeableSo a message was sent to the Queen’s private office asking what the sovereign intended to wear. The answer included mention of the hat by Rachel Trevor Morgan, which some would have taken as a suggestion for Meghan to do the same.But after some discussion, it was agreed between Buckingham and Kensington Palaces that the duchess would let her brunette locks flow free.                        So much has happened to Meghan since her wedding day: Nottingham Cottage where she and Harry live at Kensington Palace has been redecorated and the couple have spent time at their new country bolthole in Oxfordshire.Nevertheless, it is not difficult to imagine how the duchess must have been feeling as she arrived at Buckingham Palace on Wednesday evening.Whenever the Queen takes the Royal Train there is a protocol to be observed. She dines first at home and then she travels to the station, on this occasion Euston.Meghan, too, had already had supper and the two women were driven together at 10.45pm along with a handful of senior staff. Domestic staff, including footmen, stewards and a dresser, had gone ahead.Once on board the train it is understood the Queen was keen to turn in. She doesn\u0027t like eating late but she did want to ensure that Meghan was comfortable.It must have been an eye-opening experience for the American-born duchess.

They are grazed by cattle and dotted with oaks, and would be pastoral and peaceful were it not for the A-road traffic churning by and the occasional aircraft coming into Heathrow. Somewhere here, in June 1215, Magna Carta was sealed.Despite its many archaic clauses, and its revisions over the years, the 3,500-word document that King John’s rebellious barons forced him to accept stands as a statement of legal principles that continues to resonate in Britain and beyond. Its most important provisions include that justice should be done not arbitrarily, but according to the law of the land that justice cannot be sold and that no one, even the monarch, is above the law. The National Trust is now opening a permanent commemoration of the charter, in the form of a new work by Mark Wallinger. Writ in Water, as it is called, is an entire building. The artist – who won the 2007 Turner prize and whose statue of Christ, Ecce Homo, was the first contemporary sculpture on Trafalgar Square’s fourth plinth – teamed up with architect James Lowe to produce what is his largest-scale single work to date.As you approach it across the meadows, the first thing you see is a simple buff-coloured structure that seems almost flat, like a chunk of wall, but gradually reveals itself as a low, circular edifice. We are used to seeing odd structures on National Trust land – things that “seem to hold some promise”, as Wallinger says. It might call to mind the follies or temples at grand 18th-century estates such as Stourhead in Dorset. At the same time, it has an unusual solemnity and groundedness, almost appearing to be part of the little plateau on which it stands.That is partly an effect of the material, which is rammed earth – sand and gravel quarried locally, compacted with a little cement and gradually built up. “It was important that it seemed to grow out of the land,” says Wallinger, “as if it was laying down its own sediments.” The process of building was “almost medieval”, adds Lowe. It was a complex project: the difficulty of building on a site that includes a flood plain, and dealing with what the artist calls “all the various bureaucracies”, means the project is opening three years late, on the 803rd rather than the 800th anniversary of Magna Carta.The surface of the walls is rough, pebbly, even friable. “It invites you touch it, to explore it,” says Lowe. “We didn’t want anything polished.” When you step inside, through a simple rectangular opening, you are confronted with another circular wall, several feet ahead – or rather several cubits ahead, since everything is measured using this ancient system based on the distance between the tip of the middle finger and the crook of the elbow. You can now turn left or right, widdershins or clockwise, the choice generally offered at the entrance of a maze. These structures have preoccupied Wallinger since, as a young man, he cycled from Paris to Chartres and saw the medieval labyrinth set into the floor of its cathedral. Travellers on the London Underground can spot his works depicting labyrinths in all 270 of its stations each is different and each, in its rounded shape, subtly recalls the distinctive tube logo designed by Frank Pick in the early 20th century. At Chartres, the labyrinth contains the idea of a meditative journey, or an acolyte’s progress, to Jerusalem. “I want this place to have a bit of a sense of pilgrimage, too,” says Wallinger, as we walk into a gloomy corridor, the darkness relieved by small apertures positioned regularly, like numbers on a clock face. Then, all of a sudden, an opening appears and we enter an inner chamber containing a round pool that’s echoed by a large opening in the roof – an oculus, as in the roof of the Pantheon in Rome.Around the edge of the pool, laser-cut into its stainless-steel rim, are the crucial clauses of Magna Carta: “No free man shall be seized or imprisoned, or stripped of his rights or possessions, or outlawed or exiled, or deprived of his standing in any way, nor will we proceed with force against him, or send others to do so, except by the lawful judgment of his equals or by the law of the land.” But they are in mirror-writing, so they can be read only as they are reflected in the pool. They are writ in water, as the title goes.The title was suggested to Wallinger by the words on John Keats’s tomb in Rome: “Here lies one whose name was writ in water” – an epitaph that reeks with anxiety about the potential ephemerality of an artist’s work. Mirrors and reflections are another abiding interest of Wallinger’s, often because of the way they draw attention to the workings of the eye and the act of perception. “There’s that moment when you are having your eye test,” he says, “when the optician says, ‘Which is better, the left eye or the right?’– and you can’t phone a friend. You are thrown back on to your own senses.” The image might also recall what actually happened at Runnymede: the king did not sign Magna Carta, but put his seal to it, an image that is reversed when pressed into wax.Puns and wordplay are also important to Wallinger, not least the nominative determinism of his forename – in his role as someone who “makes marks”. The words that seem to dance across the surface of the water are a secular kind of “writ” but, despite their longevity, they are also intangible, unlike what might be carved into stone – a reminder that Britain lacks a written constitution.“When I was proposing the work,” says Wallinger, “Magna Carta was invoked when MPs tried to block the government proposal to hold suspected terrorists for up to 42 days without charge. Magna Carta is the beginning of common law and the progress to what are now called human rights. These rights had to be fought for tooth and nail. They were never bestowed by benevolent rulers. These can seem like a guaranteed birthright, but they need to be learned anew and maintained through every generation. And we can see how threatened they can be by the appeals of populism or fundamentalism.”Being inside this structure is like being inside a sanctuary. It is hushed – the rumble of the A road is dulled by the walls. It invites contemplation. The sky was grey and flat the day we were there, but I could imagine shafts of sunlight falling into the chamber, clouds rushing across the aperture, or even the moon hovering in the water’s surface. As it was, I could see oak branches from a nearby tree and the occasional crow flapping lazily over. To Wallinger’s immense delight, since the building was put up in the brutal cold of last winter, two pairs of swallows have nested, huddling up next to the rafters. (There are 52 rafters, reflecting the weeks of the year, just as the low apertures in the outer walls recall the months, as well as the minutes and hours on a clock face.)As we talk, the birds dart up past us into the oculus and back to their nests in the outer passageway. I sit on the bench that lines the wall of the chamber and am reminded not only of the Pantheon, but also of the simplicity and ancientness of stone circles of Scottish brochs and of medieval castle towers that would have been familiar to John and his barons. Wallinger’s literary touchstone is James Joyce, so it is hard not to think, too, of the Martello tower at the start of Ulysses. But he also quotes the first line of Finnegans Wake: “riverrun, past Eve and Adam’s, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation”. Starting mid-sentence, this is, in fact, a continuation of the last line of the book: “A way a lone a last a loved a long the”. So that Joyce’s book, like this artwork, is circular.Wallinger has been to look at some of the early versions of Magna Carta. He laughs uproariously as he recalls being shown, with absolutely zero ceremony, the one at Oxford. “I was surprised when they opened what seemed a fairly ordinary filing cabinet to get it out. You would have thought there would have been some kind of preamble.” It was modest in size, plain and sparsely decorated. “A humbling little thing,” he says. Now Magna Carta has its own humbling little sanctuary, too.• Writ in Water opens to the public on 16 June."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cec0393446ec15191abcec77b238b49d95a00550/0_325_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f47c7679b58bf5a109932baad53c5a16","title":"australian artist buries himself under busy road for three days","story":"Mike Parr will spend three days sealed in a steel box as part of Hobart’s Dark Mofo festival An Australian performance artist has been buried alive in a box under a busy section of road in the capital of Tasmania.Mike Parr, 73, was entombed on Thursday night under Hobart’s Macquarie Street for his work entitled Underneath the Bitumen – the Artist.Parr will apparently spend 72 hours meditating, drawing, fasting and reading Robert Hughes’s The Fatal Shore. He will be excavated on Sunday at 9pm local time.In preparation for his performance a section of Macquarie Street was blocked off, a hole cut into it and a steel container placed in the void.The container is a steel box measuring 4.5m x 1.7m x 2.2m. It was constructed by a team at Dark Mofo – the ongoing arts festival in Hobart. The original box manufacturers pulled out on discovering that a man would be buried under a road in it.A tube has been fitted under the road to allow air to reach the artist.By 10.30pm on the Thursday the road had been resealed and opened to traffic. Passersby posted photos of buses rolling over Parr’s section of road.According to organisers of Dark Mofo, the artist’s stay underground is a “response to 20th-century totalitarian violence in all its forms”.But some local Indigenous groups have responded to the work negatively – saying the idea was insulting to members of the Aboriginal community.Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre (TAC) CEO Heather Sculthorpe told the ABC, “If they have any interest in telling the Aboriginal story then they should have put it out there for Aboriginal people to do it.“We have a lot of great storytellers and some old fella under a road is not the way to do it.”Dark Mofo clarified the art work’s intent saying “this work is NOT a representation of Tasmania’s history of colonial violence in particular, but the global experience.“This work is about the NULL of the image – there is no artist, there is no performance, there is no artwork. Life resumes as normal, and we are left with the anxiety of knowing what has transpired, for the duration of the 72 hours.”The work was originally conceived a decade ago for an arts festival in Germany, but health and safety issues meant that the work was too problematic to perform.Hobart City Council approved the work last month and the bill for the roadworks is being footed by Dark Mofo.On Thursday night, crowds filed past the cavity where Parr was to be buried, and stared in – as if paying their respects at an open-casket funeral.A small bar heater was solemnly lowered into the void (winter in Hobart is brutal, even underground) as was a large thermos."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/338869f7b2f37288f789450e3eeefeed0b2753b6/0_51_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=958e45fdb45d20dbc49768c59251eb5e","title":"summer in the city new yorks parks august 1978 in pictures","story":"In August 1978, the press corps at The New York Times, Daily News and New York Post went on strike in a labour dispute.

Not any more. British children seem under perpetual assault from the three horsemen of the apocalypse: obesity, social media and the manic gods of examination. Of these the most needless, and clearly dangerous, is the exam. The signs of stress are blatant. One in 10 schoolchildren now has a “clinically diagnosable mental illness”. Rates of teenage self-harm have risen dramatically in the last decade. Student suicide rates are soaring.I have never seen the point of exams. If children cannot recall what they were taught two months ago, they will not remember it for life, probably because it was never worth remembering. An exam is like a Dickensian birching. It asserts power, and hurts.A primary-school child of my acquaintance can handle counting and proportion, but he cannot access the world of complex numbers and algebra. In every way a lively, intelligent, creative boy, he is innumerate. For this harmless failing, he is accused of lowering his class score and his school league place. He dreads going to school.This boy is a victim of the overpowering cult of maths, which modern education is as obsessed with as the ancients were with Latin. All the maths a normal grown-up needs can be read in John Allen Paulos’s admirable 135-page booklet, Innumeracy. Instead maths has been turned into a state religion, a national ritual, and for one reason alone: because proficiency in maths is easy to measure.Whitehall officials would suffer agonies trying to measure creativity, imagination, life skills or self-esteem. But even a zombie can tell how many pupils can do an equation. Maths is now the most cited measure of performance. It is how we rank teachers, how we place schools in league tables, and how the UK fares in the world. It is as if schools were a vast ongoing Olympics medals feast.At this time of year children, students and their parents endure weeks of stress, not for their own good but to amuse the government. Primary schools at risk of supposedly “failing” must torture children at their most vulnerable age. London secondary schools now report that half their pupils are buying private tuition to help with exams. School sports, art and music are being slashed to make way for maths and science “revision”.When I was briefly a teacher, we used to argue over the uselessness of maths, the idiocy of revision and the stress of exams. Other teachers replied that they needed to know “how well we are doing,” as if there were no other way of telling. They fell back on the classic defence of pointless learning, that “it trains the mind”. They justified exams as “teaching stress”. They used to say that of flogging.When school league tables were introduced in the 1990s it instantly led to a plague of testing and quantification. Whitehall set up its own schools to prove it could do “better” than local government, leading to a mess of centrally funded city colleges, trust schools, academies and “free” schools. They were meant to prove that local must be worse.An old cliche holds that no one knows the point of education, since we cannot see inside a child’s mind. But ask young people what they recall of their schooling and it is usually a remarkable teacher or a life-changing experience. It is not a league table performance. The current surge in holiday truancy is threatening parents with fines and worse. But who says going abroad does not enrich a child and a family, even if it inconveniences a school?We now entrust the upbringing of the nation to a regime fixated with self-validation. Universities have spent years trying to calculate the worth of a degree or of academic research. The latest absurdity is to rank teachers by asking students to vote them “gold, silver or bronze”, and rank research by the number of citations from colleagues. Anything will do to cobble together a league table.Britain is on its way to the purgatory of South Korea, where secondary-school children are made to cram for 14 hours a day to get into university, with suicidal consequences. It is like Athenian youths being trained for life by fighting each other to death. Current student mental health rates are appalling, so why make them worse when degree class is immaterial? The accountants Grant Thornton dropped their 2:1 entry requirement, and found graduates with poor degrees outperforming those with better ones. No one dared ask why. It might have called education’s bluff.Teacher friends today talk of feeling like rats on a treadmill. They are slaves to targets and measurements, so they just teach the test. It is easier. The normal components of a rounded education go by the board. Schools become data factories, because data is the only food the modern state can eat."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79ab17383c233f76cac84504fcbfefe427441ac3/0_467_7322_4393/master/7322.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f41960adc6c5ad61f17c93869264d8e","title":"let universities alert parents about students struggles says father","story":"James Murray, whose son killed himself, calls for opt-out system on sharing mental health concernsThe father of a student who killed himself is calling for the relaxation of data protection rules that currently deter universities from alerting parents that their child has serious mental health problems.Last month Ben Murray, 19, who was studying English, became the third Bristol University student to die in the space of three weeks. Ten Bristol students have died since October 2016.Ben’s father, James Murray, is urging universities to introduce changes this summer, before the next intake of freshers in September, in order to better support vulnerable students and prevent further suicides.Central to his demands is that universities should be given the authority to share information with parents if there are serious concerns about a student’s wellbeing. If students do not want that information to be shared, they should be required to sign an opt-out, he argues.“I understand that sharing data needs to be curtailed in certain situations, but in this situation we’ve got to stop the intellectual debate on data privacy and focus on protecting the vulnerable,” Murray said.He said he hoped his son’s death on 5 May would mark a turning point in the way universities handle cases of students with poor mental health. There are already changes afoot at Bristol, which is implementing an opt-in contract with students that would allow for contact with nominated next of kin if major concerns arise about their wellbeing. Murray also wants universities to examine their processes for removing students, looking from the perspective of a young person with mental health problems. And he wants more resources to be invested in training tutors who find themselves on the frontline of student welfare.He described his son as bright, kind, sensitive and intelligent beyond his years. Ben attended Sherborne independent boys’ school in Dorset and then Latymer in Hammersmith, west London. He loved nature, he was passionate about sport and he cared deeply about his friends and family. He was deeply affected by the death of his grandparents in the months before he took his A-levels. He wanted to go to Edinburgh University, where he would have joined his brother and his girlfriend, but narrowly fell short of the three As required to secure his place.Instead, in a last-minute scramble through the Ucas clearing process, he got a place at Bristol, where he arrived last September. Murray believes that sudden change of plan and narrowly missing out on Edinburgh made his son vulnerable. “He loved Edinburgh. We had been there many times,” he said. “A sense of not succeeding becomes a sense of failure. I think that’s what Ben was carrying with him going to university. To take your own life you have to be in extraordinary mental pain.”Ben told his family he was enjoying university, but they discovered after his death that he had struggled to engage with the course and had missed lectures and exams. Murray said his son had informed the university he was suffering from anxiety and he was sent a link to support services.He killed himself a few days before he was due to leave Bristol at the end of a formal withdrawal process. “One of the aspects of Ben’s removal from university which we later discovered was the absence of face-to-face meetings,” said Murray. “Part of the intervention has got to be face to face. Anyone working in a business or company that removed a member of staff by email or by letter without meeting them would have to look to their own job. These are human beings. They’ve spent £10,000 to be there and worked damned hard.“The thing that shocked me the most of all was the reticence to share information about a student’s health with parents because of data privacy. To me it’s a nonsense when lives are at risk.“When they were at school we considered them kids. Then at university we consider them adults. What’s the difference? Ten weeks of summer holidays, that’s all. It’s nothing.”On Thursday, Murray raised these issues at the Festival of Higher Education, at the University of Buckingham, where the universities minister Sam Gyimah later told the audience he believed higher education institutions were in loco parentis. Sir Anthony Seldon, the vice-chancellor of Buckingham, agreed that there should be more contact with parents. “Nothing matters more than preserving life. We need porous walls to save lives.”A statement from Bristol said its vice-chancellor, Hugh Brady, had met Murray Sr and the university was actively working with parents to create preventive services and policies to help students avoid reaching crisis point.“This includes implementing an opt-in contract with our students which would enable contact with nominated emergency contact if we had a major concern about their wellbeing,” the statement said.“The new opt-in policy now means students will be asked each year (via registration) to give consent for the university to also be able to use the emergency contact details in situations which are not ‘life or death’ but where there are serious concerns about the student’s wellbeing.”Murray said: “We will never know the whole story – that went with Ben. But we must do something in his honour to learn from what has happened.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc4703398e6af2f48622d6123696402b14a6b5cd/0_278_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab0e08a23124858a48e49aba4f204415","title":"human activity making mammals more nocturnal study finds","story":"Research involving 62 species found mammals spent relatively less time being active during the day when humans were nearbyHuman disturbance is turning mammals into night owls, with species becoming more nocturnal when people are around, research has revealed.The study, encompassing 62 species from around the globe, found that when humans were nearby, mammals spent relatively less time being active during the day and were more active at night - even among those already classed as nocturnal.Experts say such a shift might not only affect particular animals themselves – for example impacting their ability to navigate or find food – but also have numerous knock-on effects across other species.Kaitlyn Gaynor, first author of the research and a doctoral student at the University of Berkeley, said the findings echoed the past, noting it was only after the extinction of the dinosaurs that mammals started exploring the daylight.“Humans are now this ubiquitous terrifying force on the planet and we are driving all the other mammals back into the night-time,” she said.Gaynor said the shift might affect numerous interactions between species, noting that coyotes in California are moving from eating diurnal creatures like squirrels and birds to nocturnal animals like mice, rats and rabbits, while sable antelope in Zimbabwe are less able to access water during the day as they shift towards increased nocturnal behaviour.Dr Chris Carbone from the Institute of Zoology at the Zoological Society of London, who was not involved in the research, said it was startling to see that the trend is so widespread.“One of the key, interesting findings here is we are used to seeing human impacts on the environment in terms of loss of habitat or conversion of habitat or loss of space for those big, wide-ranging species – but this is talking about loss of time,” he said. Carbone added where possible it might be necessary to consider limiting hours of human activity – drawing parallels to his recent work that has found hedgehogs are active longer nocturnally in London park areas which are closed at night.Gaynor agreed, with the study noting that human access to certain areas is already restricted during breeding seasons.Writing in the journal Science, the team describe how they analysed data for each species in 76 previously conducted studies, including elephants, moose and lemurs, and looked at data relating to their activity during the day and night based on information captured by motion-activated cameras, human observation, radio tracking devices or other means. They then compared this activity for low and high human disturbance, with the latter including periods or areas of activities such as hunting, hiking, road construction and even urban settings. Human activity, Gaynor notes, mostly occurred during the daytime.A marked increase was seen regardless of the type of human activity considered – a finding, the authors note, that suggests animals do not differentiate between whether humans are a direct threat or not.The team also found the shift was not linked to the body size of the mammal, the type of habitat, or whether animals ate meat or plants. While the authors say fear of humans is likely the key driver of the effect, they add other factors might also be at play, including availability of food, or light pollution.Kirsty Parks, professor of conservation at the University of Stirling, who was not involved in the study, said it wasn’t clear quite how much human activity was deemed a “high level”, but it was striking that, even so, a consistent shift towards nocturnal behaviour in wildlife was seen – and that it was similar regardless of what humans were up to.But she said it is now important to look in more detail at the consequences, and to explore how great an increase in human activities us needed to affect patterns of activity."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dcdd873f4a96f561f7403a4502678d6fc0ddb207/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25060f2ad8e0842f02994d4f9ddbb7ae","title":"the best yellow pieces for all ages in pictures","story":"Move over millennial pink, Gen Z yellow is the new bold colour in town.

But this season, they are using some smarter scheduling tacticsWhere will you spend this World Cup? Primarily down the pub, surrounded by pals and beers? Or in the cinema, lapping up chick flicks and chardonnay? If the movie industry is to be believed, it’s a simple choice between the two – hence the phenomenon of counterprogramming.Every so often, canny cinema managers flood the schedules with titles designed to attract anyone desperate to escape summer football tournaments, or whatever apparently alienatingly macho sporting event (see also the Super Bowl) is keeping traditional action fans from the cinema doors.Counterprogramming choices have included glossy comedies such as Sex and the City, which scored enormously during Euro 2008, teen-skewed weepies including The Fault in Our Stars, and the family-friendly fodder of How to Train Your Dragon 2. The latter two were box–office winners during the 2014 World Cup, when the period drama Belle (mixed-race daughter of an admiral helps abolish slavery) also highlighted the opportunities for arthouse crowd-pleasers.Yet the formula isn’t foolproof. That was also the year distributors dangled Grace of Monaco (glamour! tragedy! Nicole Kidman!) in the direction of anyone unexcited by sport. But appalling reviews and word of mouth proved too formidable a defensive backline. Simply chucking A-list ladies and nice jewellery at the screen doesn’t necessarily woo women.Such assumptions are on the way out, hopes Claire Binns, director of programming at cinema chain Picturehouse. “I’m slightly tired of the idea of putting a ‘women’s film’ as counterprogramming,” she says. “Women do watch football.” For Binns, it’s now more about a certain type of quality title. “I’m happy to have Ocean’s 8 and Mamma Mia! 2, but I hope it’s not a case of a bunch of men in the studio offices thinking: ‘Let’s give the girls something to watch.’”Yet Tom Grater, a reporter for the trade magazine Screen, thinks gender-based assumptions persist. “Exhibitors typically brace for a drop-off during an international football tournament. Clearly this year they are making a huge effort to plug any potential gaps with counterprogramming.”The female-fronted heist spin-off Ocean’s 8 is this year’s most obvious attempt to woo supposed World Cup widows. The signs are good: despite moderate reviews, it topped the US box office last weekend. It ticks every box and more: big names, racially erse, with a Bechdel Test-passing plot – and top frocks, too. Trooping off to Ocean’s 8 doesn’t even seem an aggressively anti-sport move.Other forthcoming releases look particularly machine-tooled. Adrift, which helpfully stars the lead actor from The Fault in Our Stars, Shailene Woodley, is a true-story drama co-starring Sam Claflin, who had hearts aflutter as a dapper quadriplegic in Me Before You. For the more mature woman, The Book Shop pairs Emily Mortimer with Bill Nighy for a story involving the establishment of a Suffolk arts centre in 1959. And for those in the market for a Bridget JonesMarley \u0026amp Me cross-breed, here comes Patrick, a romcom featuring a puppy cupid.Meanwhile, fashion documentary McQueen is mining an assumption that interest in couture precludes ownership of a Panini sticker book. While Studio 54, revisiting the history of the hedonistic Manhattan club, suggests someone has a hunch that people only really like one sort of gathering of hot sweaty bodies.Yet two significant titles this year are, encouragingly, a little less on-the-button. First out is Hereditary, released tomorrow, a family-themed movie with Toni Collette in the lead, yes, but also one guaranteed to scare you senseless. Grater suspects changing audience habits mean the gamble will pay off: “Hereditary has had a pretty significant marketing campaign behind it and launching on the second day of the World Cup will serve as a good bit of counterprogramming. It could do very well with a younger female audience – recent statistics say they are biggest audience for horror movies.”The other is Sicario 2, a sequel to the gritty Mexican drug-trade drama, which this time round, while starring Benicio del Toro and Josh Brolin, doesn’t also feature Emily Blunt. Stuart Crane, head of programming at Cineworld, puts it front and centre of his counterprogramming hopes, alongside Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom and Ocean’s 8.“This is an interesting one,” says Grater, “as you’d expect a male-heavy crowd. Clearly, the distributor, Lionsgate, thinks there’s opportunity here.” In fact, they may be erring on the side of pessimism. Sicario 2 is scheduled for release on 29 June – the day before the knockout stage of the World Cup gets under way. “They might be banking on England being out of the tournament by then,” says Grater.

For over 25 years, his gang has hidden behind cars, set up stings and cloaked themselves in disguised just for the thrill of saying: “You’re it.” One guy even got tagged at his dad’s funeral. It’s a true story – the Wall Street Journal profiled the dudes in 2013 – and you can write the scene that comes next. A Hollywood executive spots the headline, grabs the phone and barks: “Get me Ed Helms.”The relentlessly funny comedy Tag pairs the ever-twerpy star of The Hangover with a posse that includes Jon Hamm as an egotistical CEO, Jake Johnson as a sad-sack stoner orcee and Hannibal Buress in his usual part of the underwritten sidekick who steals scenes by mumbling the best jokes. Ever since they graduated and spread east from Spokane, Washington in the 1990s – director Jeff Tomsic clues us into the era with the Toad the Wet Sprocket poster in Helms’ childhood playroom— Hoagie (Helms), Callahan (Hamm), Chilli (Johnson) and Sable (Buress) have spent every May sneaking around and smacking each other on the back. Only each other. Hoagie’s aggressive wife Anna (Isla Fisher) has never gotten to officially play, thanks to a no-girls-allowed rule forged in boyhood. As for fifth player Jerry (Jeremy Renner), the alpha jock has never been tapped. He’s that fast.Tag keeps them young, or at least acting like it until their knees give out vaulting a fire escape. Ironically, it also keeps these competitive best friends at a distance. When Jerry plans his wedding – 31 on May, according to his hard-headed fiancee’s (Leslie Bibb) dream date – he doesn’t even invite his pals. If they attend, they’ll just tackle him at the pulpit. Besides, they’re guaranteed to show anyway. As Hoagie vows: “We get Jerry now or we die. Eventually.”How does the game mesh with their adult lives? Poorly. In an opening scene, Hoagie sabotages Callahan’s big interview with – oh hi! – the Wall Street Journal, who’s managed to be written into the film by recasting original journalist Russell Adams as beautiful blonde Rebecca Crosby (Annabelle Wallis), who impulsively decides to city-hop across America to Jerry’s wedding with these strangers without packing a toothbrush or a personality. Screenwriters Rob McKittrick and Mark Steilen don’t even hammer her into the script as a love interest, making Crosby’s presence so extraneous I kept checking the backseats of cars, expecting the film would forget she’s supposed to be there. Orson Welles might nod that he used the same reporter plot device in Citizen Kane. But for all the great, dumb pleasures of Tag, even the film itself would agree that deciphering why these guys play is even less weighty than Rosebud.Tomsic is aware of the cruelties of the game: the injuries, the trampled bystanders, the lonely geeks who long to join and the PTSD-like paranoia that’s forced Sable into therapy (which he also seems to be directing at his wife who gets mentioned once and forgotten). He’s built out this world to be about more than nostalgia, though there’s plenty of that, too, from cassette tapes to a needle-drop of the 1995 Pharcyde hit Runnin’ that’s so pitch-perfect he plays it twice. (U Can’t Touch This must have been too expensive.) The script cheapens itself squeezing in empty gags about a homophobic – and possibly closeted – receptionist (Thomas Middleditch) and Hoagie’s mom’s (Nora Dunn) inappropriate crush on one of his childhood playmates. (It’s shockingly not Hamm, who here maximizes his elastic eyebrows and cartoonish good looks.) Tag is better when it fumbles for the boundaries of the game. Beyond “amendment B: no ass-punching”, what’s the line between sporting and sociopathic? Is it Chilli’s insistence that Jerry’s wedding is a ruse? Or is it our suspicion that Jerry seems capable of doing exactly that?Tag doesn’t give Tomsic many chances for directorial flair, but when Jerry is in danger of being touched, the cinematography shifts into a thriller. The shadows sharpen, harsh white light rakes against Renner’s pores, and suddenly the Bourne Legacy hero has leaped from comedy back to the battlefield where he belongs. Renner looks like a comic, but this is his first chance to prove he can hang – even if, like Jason Statham in Spy, his misfit seriousness is the joke. He fights both mentally and physically, inviting an ex-girlfriend (Rashida Jones) to the wedding reception as a honeypot trap, and mastering defensive moves that fend off attackers without making skin contact. By the time Tomsic steals a camera move from Sam Raimi’s horror flick The Evil Dead, we’re primed to agree with Sable when he groans: “Our friend is a psychopath and this is scary.”Surprisingly, there’s emotional resonance in this slapstick flick about friends who are terrified to hug. Add that to the solid chemistry between the leads, and Tag is a fine callback to the sprawling ensemble comedies of the 1980s, back when the real-life tag team graduated high school. It’s a solid summer film that will melt away from memory by fall. Though, if it does well, you can guarantee that the studio that churned out three Hangovers is hoping for a sequel. After all, this game never ends."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b326852d99dd15acd22a635df2245e638e48dc98/0_595_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2af6f47a62e413414e440c082300ffe","title":"mohamed salah brought happiness and pride to egypt world cup liverpool","story":"Salah’s stunning form for Liverpool, key role in Egypt’s qualification for the World Cup and charitable, humble nature have turned the boy from Nagrig into an icon for a nationby Salma Islam in Cairo and NagrigMamdouh Abbas wants to set the record straight. A wealthy businessman who has built a vast real estate and petroleum empire is these days better known in Egypt as the man who refused to sign Mohamed Salah in 2011, when chairman of Zamalek – one of the country’s leading teams. “Salah needs much more work,” he said in a televised interview that year. But contrary to what his successor at the club (and apparent arch nemesis) says, a separate committee took the decision at the time. “I am not responsible,” insists Abbas.Speaking the day after Salah became the first Egyptian to be named Professional Footballers’ Association player of the year, it is not surprising that Abbas feels sensitive over the claim that he missed Salah’s potential. It must feel as if he is defending himself not only to ardent football fans but also to an entire nation that dotes on their “Egyptian King”.Egypt’s reaction to the shoulder injury Salah sustained in last month’s Champions League final following a challenge from Real Madrid’s Sergio Ramos, and which in the immediate aftermath made him a doubt for the World Cup, showed how he is revered in the country. It was summed up by a headline in the al-Masry al-Youm newspaper the next day: “The night Egyptians cried: Ramos the butcher dislocated Abu Salah’s shoulder.”Egyptians cursed Ramos on social media and the Arabic hashtags “Ramos the Dog” and “Son of a Whore” were soon trending on Egyptian Twitter after Salah left the pitch in tears at Kiev’s Olympic Stadium. An Egyptian lawyer has filed a lawsuit against Ramos, equivalent to £874m, for causing Egyptians “physical and psychological harm”.For his fellow countrymen, Salah’s magic has transcended the pitch. He represents a rare figure behind whom all Egyptians, regardless of class or politics, can unite, an astonishing feat given the years of political and economic turmoil that have followed the uprising of 2011 that toppled the longtime president Hosni Mubarak.“Mohamed Salah is really important because he is a symbol … like Tutankhamun, like the pyramids,” said Mohamed Farag Amer, head of Egypt’s parliamentary youth and sports committee. On the 25-year-old being compared to Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, the Cairo-based sports journalist Hatem Maher says: “This is unprecedented for any Egyptian football player at any point in history.”Egypt kick off their first World Cup for 28 years against Uruguay on Friday and Salah seems certain to start even though doubts remain over whether he has fully recovered. It will be a huge shame if he has not, and not only because of the forward’s talents. It was Salah who sent Egypt to Russia by scoring twice in their dramatic 2-1 victory over Congo in October. Egyptians poured on to Tahrir Square in central Cairo – the centre of the popular protests against Mubarak – after the match to celebrate, waving flags and blowing horns. Some observers noted that the rapturous scenes on the square were reminiscent of the heady days of the revolution.The fall of Mubarak in 2011, at the height of the Arab Spring, gave momentary hope to a nation that had been in the grip of his dictatorship for almost 30 years. But the transition to democracy proved turbulent and collapsed when the country’s polarising first democratically elected president, the Muslim Brotherhood’s Mohamed Morsi, was overthrown by the military with popular support in 2013. Egypt has since been under the iron fist of President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, the former head of the armed forces, who has ushered in the most severe clampdown on dissent in the country’s contemporary history.Egyptian football has too often been caught up in the isive politics of these past years and Salah’s popularity is partially down to the fact that he has steered clear of it. “He’s very clever. He’s a footballer first and foremost,” said Khaled Dawoud, the former leader of the liberal Dostour party and a prominent government critic. In January, for instance, the Egyptian Football Association announced its support for Sisi before the presidential elections in March, which critics called a sham after genuine opponents were prevented from running against him. Salah never commented on the issue.He also stands in contrast to another towering sporting figure for Arabs, Mohamed Aboutrika. The former Egypt forward, with whom Salah is close, led Egypt’s national team for a decade until his retirement in December 2013. But his career was overshadowed by accusations of sympathy with the Muslim Brotherhood. Aboutrika was placed on a terror list last year for alleged ties to the group, which was outlawed after its fall from power in 2013. The 39-year-old denies the charges.Like Aboutrika, however, Salah has captured hearts across the spectrum of Egyptian society with his modesty and kindness. “He’s important because of his personality and how humble he is,” said Hany Mohamed, a 34-year-old waiter at a downtown Cairo street cafe where a large mural of Salah attracts visitors seeking selfies. “He’s a very nice person and this makes everyone like him.”Tarnim Mannaa, a 42-year-old engineer, said: “He never forgot his roots. I’m proud that he’s an Egyptian.”The way Salah prostrates as if he is praying whenever he celebrates scoring a goal, the way he talks about his love for Egypt’s carb-heavy national dish of koshary, the way he gives back to his local village, Nagrig, and does not brag about it, have helped make him a role model for the country’s youth. To many, he is projecting a positive and powerful image of Egyptians abroad. And Salah’s stunning rise from a small farming village in the Nile Delta is providing hope and inspiration to young people. The message is clear – through hard work and focus anything is possible, a point the player stresses himself.At a time when many Egyptians are exhausted by a prolonged economic downturn following the revolution and soaring prices and subsidy cuts after the government implemented painful economic reforms in return for a $12bn IMF loan, Salah is the rags to riches story the country needs. And nowhere is he more loved than in Nagrig.A small community of about 15,000 people located 80 miles north of Cairo, the village is surrounded by fields of jasmine, and chickens and cows roam the dusty, unpaved streets. Many front doors are left open, a sign of the closeness between neighbours.Salah usually returns to Nagrig at some point after the end of the season but, according to Maher Shetia, the mayor of Nagrig, he is highly unlikely to do so this year because of the World Cup. Chatting in the sitting room of his home on the elaborate gold Louis XIV-style seating that is so popular in Egypt, the jovial Shetia recounts how Salah sat on the sofa opposite last June, during Ramadan. Shetia had been in an accident and Liverpool’s No 11, a Roma player at the time, dropped in to check up on him.“Mohamed is a very quiet person, he doesn’t talk much,” Shetia says. “He’s very simple … at that time he said there might be something with Liverpool.” No one in the village could have predicted the shy local boy would reach such heights, scoring 44 times in 51 games in his debut season at Anfield. Now that he has, this tight-knit community is proud. “He worked hard to get there,” says Shetia.The tale of how a teenage Salah would travel for nine hours every day, five days a week, from his home to train with the Arab Contractors team in Cairo has become the stuff of legend in his homeland. Nagrig’s wonderboy has not forgotten where he is from in the face of stardom, using his wealth to give back to the community. Salah has paid for the construction of a religious school, a charity food market and an ambulance station in the village. “He didn’t change, he didn’t become conceited,” says Mohamed El Bahnasy, the director of the Mohamed Salah Charity, which provides financial support to people in need every month.Bahnasy, whose office walls are festooned with photos of Salah, will not say how many people the charity helps, but the number is in the hundreds and they share the equivalent of more than £2,000 a month that the player gives to the charity. Reports about Salah’s charitable deeds often go viral in Egypt but many are fake.He did not, for instance, pay for couples to get married in Nagrig, nor did he purchase land there for a water-cleaning factory. But what the stories reflect is how keen Egyptians are for saintly stories regarding their national hero.During an after-school kickabout at Nagrig’s local youth club, which has been renamed after the village’s most famous native, nine-year old Zaid Jummah sums up the mood of a nation. When asked which football team he supports, he replies: “Mohamed Salah.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd87f74d2a10c3213a17b69e1efe813f7775000a/1_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5760fb961878f446c3e453baf09244cc","title":"africa world cup history egypt morocco nigeria tunisia senegal","story":"Egypt, Morocco, Nigeria, Tunisia and Senegal have reason to be confident but all five going beyond the groups looks optimisticEstablished powers used not to see African teams coming. That was the case literally in 1982, when West Germany’s manager, Jupp Derwall, decided against asking his squad to watch a video of Algeria before facing them because he feared his players would mock him for making the suggestion. Some of those players had, after all, boasted publicly that they would score a hatful of goals and play the match with cigars in their mouths.Algeria’s 2-1 victory over the European champions was a delicious lesson about the perils of hubris but also, to anyone willing to pay attention, about advances made by African teams. Tunisia thought they had made that point four years earlier when holding West Germany to a 0-0 draw (and beating Mexico) but apparently some folks needed telling more than once.Africa’s other participants in 1982, Cameroon, also performed well but also failed to reach the next round even though they did not lose a match. But from the next tournament onwards, starting with Morocco in 1986, an African representative has always reached the knockout stages. Four years ago Algeria and Nigeria made the last 16, seemingly indicating increased strength in depth across the continent. This year the bar could be raised higher, with all five African countries capable of getting out of their groups.On the flip side, there are grounds for believing this will be the first World Cup for 36 years in which every African team falls at the first hurdle.Let’s explore the Afro-optimist view. For a start, it is worth noting that all African squads in Russia seem relatively happy. This week’s dissolution of the Ghanaian Football Association following the exposure of systemic corruption served a reminder that the efforts of many African players continue to be sabotaged by oafs and miscreants. However the signs are the quintet at the World Cup are in decent hands, which is to say, at least, that the risks of schisms over bonuses or extraneous botheration appear to be low. That already gives African teams an edge over, say, Spain.Spain will meet Morocco, who are probably the most complete African team at this tournament and have been cast into the toughest pool. The Atlas Lions are a model of powerful unity under Hervé Renard, who has transformed them since taking charge two years ago.Their tight defence is screened by Karim El Ahmadi and built around Juventus’s Mehdi Benatia, whose wiliness at centre-back has helped the Wolves midfielder Romain Saïss to adapt well to being his sidekick. Morocco did not concede a goal during the final six-game round of qualifiers.Going forward they have players who can pick a way through any defence on a good day, particularly M’barek Boussoufa, Younès Belhanda and, above all, Hakim Ziyech, who is looking to bring to global attention the skills that earned him the player of the year award at Ajax last season.Beating Iran on Friday seems essential if Morocco are to advance from a group that includes Portugal and Spain, neither of whom will find them easy to penetrate and both of whom could be vulnerable to counterattacks.Senegal have plenty going for them, too, even if, like Nigeria, Tunisia and even the Egypt of the 45-year-old Essam El-Hadary, there are doubts about the reliability of their goalkeepers.Few teams in Russia will have a better central defensive pairing than Kalidou Koulibaly and Kara Mbodji, assuming Mbodji has recovered fully from the injury that hampered him last season. Senegal’s spine is reinforced by a central midfield in which Badou Ndiaye’s influence is growing and Alfred Ndiaye has shown in recent friendlies that he could be an upgrade on Idrissa Gana Gueye, whose recent performances for his country have been glum.On a solid platform Senegal could thrill although their manager, Aliou Cissé, has yet to prove he has found a way to harness fully the potential of gifted attackers such as Sadio Mané, Keita Baldé, Mbaye Niang and Ismaila Sarr. If they click, Senegal could swagger out of their group and trouble their opponents in the last 16. That could be England.To get that far England will need a positive result against Tunisia, who will be no stooges. While not expecting to dominate possession their manager, Nabil Maâloul, has said his team will be daring and do more than simply try to absorb pressure. Last week’s friendly against Spain, in which Tunisia held their own until shrinking into their shells in the second half, underlined that audacity would be their best policy because Maâloul does not have good enough defenders to interpret catenaccio. Even though injury has deprived them of their most exciting creator, Youssef Msakni, Tunisia’s strongest players are slick attackers. They will aim to play against England and Panama on the front foot and could hurt both.Egypt, by contrast, are likely to be cautious even though their group looks less dangerous. That will be especially true in their opening match, against Uruguay, for which Mohamed Salah has been declared fit. Without Salah Egypt are marvel-less. Russia and Saudi Arabia are no great shakes either and Salah can be expected to torment them.Nigeria have real qualities: dynamism, power and sharpness up front if Simy Nwankwo makes an impact in place of Odion Ighalo. But they also have flaws, notably in goal and defence, and they lack the ingenuity of previous Super Eagles sides so while they should crush Iceland, they look unlikely to finish ahead of Croatia and Argentina even if they beat the latter in a friendly in November, when Lionel Messi was absent. For them, too, reaching the knockout stages looks improbable. But not impossible.All five of the African countries, then, can find reasons to be confident of venturing beyond the group stage, where there could be an unprecedented contingent from the continent. But that is unlikely. Even less likely is that any of them will become the first African country to reach a semi-final."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e26ff726a9b40fa160087c0f523de467f9280c1a/0_63_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0364c26fad65489a2a046f926cee4a1","title":"paul pogba not the star france world cup mbappe dembele griezmann","story":"The Manchester United midfielder will be important for Didier Deschamps but the attacking trio of Mbappé, Dembélé and Griezmann are the real keyFrance v Australia, the opening match for my country at the World Cup. Time to stop the talking, time for action. I’ve been there and have had to cope with the pressure – pressure from the fans, the expectations of a nation and the pressure you put on yourself. Wanting to deliver.Everybody knows the first game is really tricky and really important, psychologically. You will all look at this fixture and think it shouldn’t be too complicated for Les Bleus. But this is a key moment for the French team. And we will find out a lot from the way things go and the way the team performs.You should have seen us in 1998, seen how we were shaking. With all respect, it was only South Africa we had to face for the first game but we were trembling. I remember we could hear them singing in their dressing room just before we went out for the kick-off. They seemed so cool.We were playing at home and there were big expectations. And we were really not very good for the opening hour of that game. We have to win the first game. For confidence, it’s vital. If you can win the first one then you know that a second victory will often mean you have already qualified for the next round and that’s important because it gives the manager a chance to make sweeping changes for the final group match. This is how it went for us in 1998 and in 2000 – and it allowed the other guys to play, to play their part, to bring their contribution and to feel concerned – that’s how you ensure a rock-solid team spirit.Didier Deschamps knows all about that, of course – he was our captain. His choices for this squad reflect his experience. He knows that France will need positive guys on the bench, bringing a good vibe but ready to step up if needed. When I look at this French side, when you look at the players inidually – wow. There is just so much amazing talent. I really think it’s a challenge for Didier having so many talented young players coming through.I remember during Euro 2016 much of the offensive animation came from Antoine Griezmann and Dimitri Payet, who is no longer in the squad. Griezmann is the man for the situation, he’s shown what he can do. Scoring twice in the semi-final against Germany two years ago showed us he can cope with the big games, that he relishes the big stage. There are players like that, who can step up the level when necessary.But now Griezmann needs to show us he’s smart again by finding the right balance with Kylian Mbappé, the new kid on the block. I’m not sure he will play all the games but Mbappé can be one of the big stars of this World Cup. Didier has to protect him. He has to allow him to digest the pressure he will have around him.He is so young, it’s his first World Cup and the expectations are high – from back home, of course, but from around the football world. Here is a raw talent, a player who can change games and Didier will have to keep a close eye on him. Kylian has burst on to the scene in a way that is not so dissimilar to that of Thierry Henry back in 1998. Henry and David Trezeguet were the youngsters who brought their talent and insouciance to our team back then and Thierry finished the World Cup as our top scorer, with three goals.The other youngster who can make his mark for France is Ousmane Dembélé, who had an up and down season with Barcelona but who has a very special talent. Right foot, left foot, you can’t even tell which is his strongest, and in the recent warm-up game with Italy I was impressed with the way he went about the game.Mbappé and Dembélé have shown they are ready to perform for their nation. The challenge for my friend Didier is to find the correct system, to adapt his philosophy of the game to the players he has. A good example of this test for a manager is the burning Paul Pogba question. Everyone wants to know how to get the best out of Pogba, what’s the best way to allow himself to express himself? I think Didier has a decision to make. While he will be an important player for France, I think Pogba has to accept that he is part of a midfield that will have to provide balance – that he won’t be the star of the team because I think potentially we have a three-man attack that can frighten any team in Russia.A quick word about the host nation. I want to congratulate the Russians. I have been able to visit many of the stadiums and on an infrastructure level everything is very impressive, very well organised. I have felt the passion that is there around football and the fact they sold the tickets very quickly shows they have the football culture some may have doubted.This is such an important rendezvous for the Russian people. They know the eyes of the world are upon them. Russia is opening up to the rest of the world but it takes time. I have had the chance to spend time in the country as part of my role as a Fifa ambassador and I have to say I have not experienced any racism. I have seen people laughing, having fun among themselves but perhaps eyeing the outsider with curiosity.And, of course, we don’t know the Russians very well – there are all sorts of stereotypes knocking about and maybe we fear them a little bit. That’s why the World Cup is so important. It will help open their minds and that’s why I’m enjoying interacting with the people and trying to understand their culture and seeing how football can help move things on.I’m a great believer in sport as a vector for change. Let’s see how it turns out, but as far as I can see there should be no fear for the African teams in Russia. As for Australia, getting ready to play my national team, I hope they are afraid! And I hope France get off to a winning start."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc6baa7007b583b6139c488e5686b2a298894a94/0_188_2753_1651/master/2753.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e29fe7465ddcb1229fa0d6bd52bacd4c","title":"penthouses for sale around the uk in pictures","story":"Hit heady heights with these top-floor properties, from Devon to Edinburgh"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4077fff7543e999fe9e9521561ca052f1aea675e/0_128_1099_659/master/1099.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26a4ca65766f35acf7676a46f167cf99","title":"alice glass on leaving crystal castles the cruelty never ceases to amaze me","story":"The singer found fame with the electro band before leaving and accusing her ex-bandmate of nonconsensual sex and controlling behaviour. Here, she talks about her decision to go publicAlice Glass’s Los Angeles home is a\u0026nbsppicture of gothic splendour. Her kitchen resembles a graveyard of dead flowers she is annoyed that her living black lilies never droop when she is looking. There is a fake Goya on the way down to her basement studio, where skulls surround the drums. A spider crawls out of the toilet roll when I use her bathroom. It is probably not part of the decor.Glass is less macabre: there is\u0026nbspa tattoo of Bambi on her thigh. She loved the royal wedding. Her voice only rises above its perpetual whisper when she calls to her cats, Mr Peanut and Fuzzy, the alpha who dominates her pit bulls, Jacob and Shadow. She apologises for the boxes that entomb the sofa, merch from her recent debut solo tour. She had polled fans on Twitter to ask which song she should play from the back catalogue of her former band, the anarchic electro-punk duo Crystal Castles, which she quit in October 2014. Ultimately, she decided to play the material to which she still felt connected – “where I’m feeling worthless and hopeless”, she says. It\u0026nbsptook time in rehearsals to shake off\u0026nbsptheir negative associations.It was not until allegations surfaced against Harvey Weinstein that Glass (born Margaret Osborn) was emboldened to go public with detailed allegations of abuse against her ex-bandmate, Ethan Kath (real name Claudio Palmieri). She felt it was her responsibility, “especially after I had been told he had done similar things to at least one other woman”. Glass had previously alluded to her experience when she released her debut solo single, Stillbirth, in July 2015: “You don’t own me any more,” she shrieked over music that she likened to “being\u0026nbspeaten by fire ants”.The song allowed her to speak covertly at a time when she was scared of going outside in case she was served with a lawsuit, she says, claiming that Kath started making legal threats in response to her tweeting stats about domestic abuse fatalities shortly after she announced her departure from the band. Glass says she received cease-and-desist letters from the same firm that represented Bill Cosby, which quoted her tweets and intimated that Glass was making these statements to benefit her career. But seeing other women speaking out about abuse last October was like watching “someone jumping off a cliff”, she says. “If someone goes first, it\u0026nbsplets you know that you’re safe. It\u0026nbspreally put things into perspective. If it wasn’t for them, I’m not sure how long it would have taken me to\u0026nbspspeak out.”She published a lengthy statement accusing Kath of nonconsensual sex, stalking, manipulation, intimidation and isolation, violence (including being dangled over a stairwell), control and derision. Kath has repeatedly denied Glass’s allegations, describing them as “pure fiction”. He sued her for defamation and issued his own statement: “Alice and\u0026nbspI had a long ongoing relationship both personal and professional. When she suddenly left Crystal Castles to handle her mental health issues and substance abuse issues I\u0026nbspfully supported her. I will continue to support her quest to wellness but I can’t support extortion, false claims, and accusations put forth after the band attained new success without her.” (She says his comments about mental health and substance abuse are “bullshit”.)Kath’s defamation lawsuit was dismissed in February, as was an appeal in May, in which he was ordered to pay Glass almost $21,000 (£15,800) in legal fees. The lawsuit was rejected under a California statute designed to protect freedom of speech the court did not make any finding on whether Glass’s allegations were true. He remains under investigation by the Toronto police sex crimes unit after complaints from several women, the police service confirmed to the . Glass does not know if he can bring the suit again. “Probably, he’ll try, but it’s not getting in my head,” she says. “I want him to know that he can keep trying to sue me and it’s not affecting me in the way that you think it is, you’re just spending more of your money and wasting more of your life.”In the early 00s, Glass was a teenage outcast in Toronto. She had difficulties with her parents, who agreed that she should move out aged 15 – she will not discuss why. She turned her flat into a squat for fellow punk runaways – “It was always an aspirational dream to live in a community of people that you can trust” – and formed bands. Fetus Fatale played only a couple of chaotic shows, but Kath has claimed he saw one of them and felt he had “discovered a great poet” in Glass. She doubts that she recalls them meeting when she bought his CD after a show. Her statement details what came next: she alleges that he intoxicated and had sex with her while he was sober. “I feel like, for a lot of it, he could have been anybody when I was lost and desperately searching for someone validating to\u0026nbspmy experiences,” she says.They recorded together, but she says he told her that the results were so poor that they would not be released. They lost touch Kath was in two other bands, “hedging his bets to see which would be the most successful”, says Glass. But then a song called Alice Practice started taking off on Myspace, so named because, according to Kath, Glass’s parts were merely a microphone test. Glass denies this, too, saying that she had written lyrics and melodies. She had no idea the music was online.A small record deal materialised and Glass says Kath encouraged her to quit high school to tour. She had never left Canada and was 18 when they arrived in Britain, where Crystal Castles experienced viral success, miming on the TV series Skins and leading a bratty noise scene. “Moshing with your friends is the best kind of medicine when you’re an aggravated young person,” Glass theorises of their popularity. She had no such community, was unable to connect to fans’ idolisation and felt like a misfit in the scene: “I\u0026nbspdon’t think that my expression was necessarily taken seriously, because\u0026nbspI was a woman screaming in\u0026nbsppeople’s faces.”The media portrayed her as a\u0026nbspferal creature: Kath would extol her violent and accidental genius NME dedicated a spread to her knuckles after she punched a man at a festival. It is expected that violence and outlandish behaviour is concomitant with male musical genius. But when volatility is part of\u0026nbspa woman’s artistic persona, her work is presented as an accident, rather than a purposeful statement. “It seems like a by-product of trauma or some expression that she’s not completely in control of,” Glass says. She wanted to explain herself\u0026nbsp– that she was violent at live shows because men groped her. But Kath told her it would be better to remain mysterious, disaffected. “That idea of nihilism leaves you completely open to let people come and take advantage of you.”She felt men came to shows to target her. “Like: ‘She doesn’t care what you do to her, pull her hair, try strangling her with your shirt, grab her around the groin, why don’t you rip her skirt off?’ They were all things that happened to me regularly. When a woman doesn’t really have agency – not doing interviews, having music that seemed unintentional, seeming like a vessel who’s there to fulfil someone else’s idea – then you can treat her not as a person and do whatever you want to her.”Glass began to see herself as abject. She had neither friends – she\u0026nbspsays Kath restricted her personal relationships – nor family ties. She felt “robotic”, escaping on stage then returning to the bus alone, scared to go out. She claims Kath told her that men liked to gang-rape feminists, dissuading her from sharing her ideals. She was so\u0026nbspdisconnected from reality that she\u0026nbspbelieved him.Glass says the band’s manager, James Sandom, would lament Kath’s behaviour, but she feels he never offered her genuine support. “He pretended to care and pretended to help me at times – or sometimes would just say whatever it took to keep me working.” She says it took until 2012 for Sandom to acquiesce to her demands for a phone and a credit card. Kath allegedly held her passport and controlled the band’s finances, giving Glass “some money throughout the years, but not a proportionate account ... The ‘joint’ bank account,” she sneers.Last year, Sandom – who still manages Crystal Castles – told the Daily  that he could offer “no further insight” into Glass’s accusations: “During our time managing Crystal Castles whilst their professional relationship was occasionally volatile, their personal relationship was never fully clear.” Glass disputed this, posting screenshots of emails in which she told Sandom that Kath had thrown her phone out of a moving car and ripped hair from her head. Sandom’s replies characterised Kath’s behaviour as “domestic abuse” and said he would\u0026nbspcall the police next time. I tried to speak to him prior to meeting Glass, but he declined, saying he had “nothing but admiration for Margaret” and wished her “the best on the path ahead professionally and\u0026nbsppersonally”.“Fuck you,” she says at Sandom when I repeat this. The sun has dipped we have been talking in the dark. She bolts to look for a cigarette. Minutes later, her boyfriend, the musician Jupiter Keyes, comes upstairs with Glass, who has been crying. “Let me give you some light, OK,” he says, switching a lamp on before going out to buy wine.Glass sits back down and says: “It’s cliched to be somewhat triggered by that, but it’s a little weird that he would still be supporting him. I just don’t even know what to say to that. The amount of … cruelty? It never ceases\u0026nbspto amaze me. But it’s not just me – there are people that will continue to suffer because they believe the person who’s telling them they wish them all the best really does. I would rather people like that said: ‘Y’know, she can go fuck herself, I don’t care that this happened to her.’”Glass does not know if Sandom talked to Kath about that incident and she does not think he called the police. She alleges a wider picture of neglect. Glass played on crutches for a year with a fractured ankle and performed through broken ribs and food poisoning. Her behaviour ties in with a pattern of self-abasement, but she says it was encouraged. When she proposed cancelling shows, she says Kath told her they would be sued, that fans would stop coming. It played to her sensibilities: “My entire life was performing, so I\u0026nbspcouldn’t imagine not being able to\u0026nbspdo that – it was my identity.”She says she repeatedly tried to quit, but she was told that doing so would be “such a shame, that kind of language”, she says. “It is hard to walk away from a project that you put everything into, especially if you almost believe that you’re being received as an artist by a fluke chance.” Glass says she had to get a lawyer to access her half of songwriting and publishing, and her new management had to lobby Twitter for the account that Kath had registered in her name. She was dating Keyes by the time Crystal Castles were supporting Depeche Mode in September 2013 as they drove away from the last date, she knew it was over.Glass goes to the balcony to smoke, gesturing at her “anxiety table of disgusting old cigarettes”. She is not surprised that Kath continued the band with another young, female singer who looks just like her. She says he would often threaten her with the prospect of a nameless girl waiting in the wings “who’s a better singer and who would put up with a lot worse than I would”. Part of Glass leaving entailed coming to terms with the fact that she probably would not be a musician any more. But after she freed herself she decided to write anyway, even if she did not think anyone would care. They did: she signed to Loma Vista (St Vincent, Iggy Pop), released Stillbirth and, last year, the Alice Glass EP.Her new single, Mine, was written with the songwriter Justin Tranter, who she chose for his work on Justin Bieber’s Sorry. None of Glass’s solo material has been an easy listen – eerie melodies snake around blasts of digital static – but Mine is a profoundly heavy listen, describing self-harm: “Abuse myself till I’m finally mine,” she sings. “That’s how desperate I felt,” she says now.She is more comfortable with people idolising her since she spoke out proud, even. But she still grapples with guilt: after her statement, more women alleged that Kath had abused them as teenagers. It was “surreal and fucked up” to know she was not alone, but equally so to contemplate that “a lot of these women – girls – met him because they were fans of mine. If I didn’t exist, then a lot of those experiences wouldn’t have\u0026nbsphappened.”Her eyes are glassy again. Easier said than done, but she can’t blame herself for that. “Some people have told me that, too, but in the brief times I got to express myself – this one-dimensional side that’s not a completely true representation – that is destructive. And the people that would feel connected to that are most likely damaged themselves and it’s a breeding ground for creeps. There’s no way not to feel guilty. I’m just gonna have to live with it for the rest of my life.”These days she attempts to think about Kath as little as possible, preferring to try to discern the logical explanations behind how she feels about herself. “Justice is just being able to live my life,” she says. Her left hand bears a fresh tattoo of white roses, to symbolise new beginnings. She repeatedly says that she is lucky to be here, to have a career. “That really is an ideal scenario for somebody like me – a\u0026nbspdamaged high-school dropout.” But\u0026nbspshe also knows that she put the\u0026nbspwork in to get here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8bcaf660a0de345ac509662b5deda09526c86200/0_288_4406_2644/master/4406.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=834f71a083ac07780c73e5e927c3d54d","title":"can marriages between rock superstars ever work beyonce jay z","story":"Beyoncé and Jay-Z’s UK tour dates this week have been a public display of their love. But from Sonny and Cher to Fleetwood Mac, rock pairings are notoriously turbulentWhen Beyoncé and Jay-Z flew into Salford this week, ahead of their On the Run II show in Manchester, the gossip columns noted several details: that Beyoncé wore a black hooded jacket, their children were not with them and, most provocatively, that the pair landed in separate helicopters.The insinuation was clear: all might not be rosy. For while both musicians have enjoyed stunningly successful solo careers, it is their 15-year union that has long captured the public’s imagination: a relationship that began with a duet – 2003’s Bonnie and Clyde – and has continued through courtship, marriage, children, infidelity, two painfully confessional albums about marital difficulty and a second instalment of a joint world tour. The success of their relationship, despite the pressures and media attention, is quite remarkable.In their shows this week, the pair have willingly referenced their relationship – videos screened home movies and apparent images of their children alongside the message “Love never changes”, but there was also footage of houses burning down and vows being renewed. And while the pair held hands and Beyoncé announced: “It makes me so happy to be on stage with the man I love”, both played songs from Lemonade and 4:44, their respective portraits of a marriage in turmoil.Any marriage is a delicate creation, but from Ike and Tina Turner to Sonny and Cher, Notorious BIG and Faith Evans to Gwen Stefani and Gavin Rossdale, the union between two musicians has long seemed more vulnerable than most.For some, this has fuelled their work – Fleetwood Mac’s 1977 album Rumours documents the marriage breakdown of John and Christine McVie as well as the collapse of the onoff relationship between their bandmates Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham. Abba began as two couples – Agnetha Fältskog and Björn Ulvaeus, and Anni-Frid Lyngstad and Benny Andersson, but as their relationships faltered their music grew in introspection and maturity. By the time of their 1981 masterpiece The Visitors, both had separated. Michelle and John Phillips’ marriage lasted only as long as the Mamas and the Papas. Jack and Meg White of the White Stripes managed to navigate the musical fame that arrived after their orce. What makes a superstar marriage falter, what helps it endure, and why are they so complicated?Musicians are prey to the same pressures as other famous or successful couples – demanding jobs, long stretches apart, a want of privacy. And music itself can play a\u0026nbsprole in the marriage. In 2016, after Jay-Z was accused of infidelity, Beyoncé’s riposte came in the form of Lemonade and, most particularly, the track Sorry, a sublime hurl of rage, accusation and defiance. “Today I regret the night I put that ring on,” she sneered. “He always got them fucking excuses.” Although it was the line: “He better call Becky with the good hair” – apparently in reference to her husband’s mistress – that proved most potent: for weeks, speculation abounded about Becky’s true identity.“I think the thing about musicians is that when they’re writing songs about the relationship, they’re private thoughts but they’re singing them publicly,” says behavioural psychologist Jo Hemmings. “You’re singing to your partner via music – so music becomes almost a third party. That’s a good thing if you can mediate through it, if you find it easier than talking about problems. It’s probably quite restorative and recuperative in a way – it’s part of the therapeutic process.”But at times, she suggests, it can prove an unsettling and indirect way of communicating. “It raises questions,” she says. “Was that song about me? Was it real, or just your imagination? And if so, why were you thinking that way? So you have got to be able to back it up and be accountable. Otherwise, you could leave the other party at a loss, or perhaps even writing a song in response and hanging out your dirty washing in public.”Being part of a successful musical couple does, of course, bring specific difficulties. When Cherilyn “Cher” Sarkisian met Sonny Bono at a cafe in Los Angeles in 1962, she was 16 and he was 27. They were married for six years before splitting in 1974 – Sonny citing “irreconcilable differences”, Cher countering with charges of “involuntary servitude” and the accusation that he withheld earnings from her. Twelve years after Bono’s death, Cher told Vanity Fair that he had treated her “more like a golden goose than like his wife”. Although time, perhaps, and his passing had mellowed her feelings. “I forgive him, I think,” she added. “He hurt me in so many ways, but there was something. He was so much more than a husband — a terrible husband, but a great mentor, a great teacher.”Often what breaks apart a musical marriage are the obvious things – perhaps no different from those in any other marital breakdown, but amplified by the gleam of showbusiness – infidelity, boredom, distance, the slow sad inevitability of two lives drifting apart.The difference is that in the eyes of the public they have come to represent something more than just two people in a marriage. When Kim Gordon wrote in her autobiography, Girl in a Band, of the end of her 27-year marriage to her fellow Sonic Youth member Thurston Moore, its details were strikingly ordinary, but carried the extra weight, shame and sadness of the publicness of their split: “The couple everyone believed was golden and normal and eternally intact, who gave younger musicians hope they could outlast a crazy rock’n’roll world, was now just another cliche of relationship failure,” she wrote. “A male midlife crisis, another woman, a double life.”Infidelity is common in any walk of life, but in a musical marriage, temptation is arguably greater. Partners are often apart on tour, having quite different unshared experiences and, in such circumstances, a sense of closeness can be hard to maintain. More problematic can be the gulf between the stage and domesticity – thousands of fans screaming their name, the surge of adoration, the assistants on call, the manager to shield them, the hours of interviews spent talking only about themselves, and then back home to something more prosaic: a partner whose love is less fawning, who sees them as a flawed human being.But sometimes, magically, it can work. Tom Waits and Kathleen Brennan have been together since 1980, and while Waits is the frontman in their pairing, they have a strong songwriting partnership and he frequently speaks of her talents. Brennan, Waits once said, is “a remarkable collaborator, and she’s a shiksa goddess and a trapeze artist, all of that. She can fix the truck. Expert on the African violet and all that. She’s outta this world. I don’t know what to say. I’m a lucky man. She has a remarkable imagination. And that’s the nation where I live. She’s bold, inventive and fearless. That’s who you wanna go in the woods with, right? Somebody who finishes your sentences for you.”Johnny Cash’s first marriage to Vivian Liberto was in many ways a portrait of how the celebrity marriage can go awry — a young, hurried union when they barely knew one another, and both struggled with their new way of life when Cash found fame. Liberto filed for orce, weary of her husband’s constant touring, his problems with drugs and alcohol and womanising.When he married June Carter it was quite a different relationship. The pair had known each other for many years before becoming a couple, and Carter was already part of a well-known musical family with an understanding of the industry. They married in 1968 and died within four months of one another in 2003. Key to their marriage was their understanding of intimacy in the midst of a public relationship –although Cash’s proposal was rather ostentatious: “He asked me to marry him in front of 7,000 people,” she once recalled, “but I would’ve liked it if he had gotten down on his knees and proposed to me, you know. But that was the way it was. It was a great big production …”Still, Cash would speak often and pleasingly of the simplicity of their bond. Once, asked for a definition of paradise, he replied: “This morning, with her, having coffee.”What kept them together was the acknowledgement that what truly mattered was far away from the swagger of the stage. “There’s unconditional love there,” he once said. “You hear that phrase a lot, but it’s real with me and her. She loves me in spite of everything, in spite of myself. She has saved my life more than once. She’s always been there with her love, and it has certainly made me forget the pain for a long time, many times. When it gets dark and everybody’s gone home and the lights are turned off, it’s just me and her.”When Lou Reed died in 2013 his wife Laurie Anderson paid tribute to their long relationship in an essay for Rolling Stone, citing their shared understanding of peculiar careers as part of what held them together. Reed had asked her out after they first met taking part at a concert in Munich and her response, tempered by her commitment to her own work, apparently delighted him: “I think he liked it when I said Yes! Absolutely! I’m on tour – but when I get back, let’s see, about four months from now, let’s definitely get together.” She added: “Musicians being married is sort of like lawyers being married. When you say: ‘Gee, I have to work in the studio til three tonight’ – or cancel all your plans to finish the case – you pretty much know what that means and you don’t necessarily hit the ceiling.”To read Anderson’s essay is to be reminded of all the normal, complex, beautiful things that make up a relationship – how they loved butterfly-hunting, kayaking, their dog, how sometimes they felt angry or abandoned, and how together they “constructed ways to be”. And how, throughout their 21 years together as partners and professional musicians, they were bound by this remarkable combination of the humdrum and the spectacular, the silence and the song. “How strange and exciting and miraculous,” she wrote, “that we can change each other so much through our words and music and our real lives.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03d79b3fc3b729b0a81936e0e91ba209b98ed542/0_63_5250_3150/master/5250.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7060085e27f89600afeb985f6ee6286f","title":"johnny marr webchat post your questions now","story":"The former Smiths guitarist answered questions on his golden days, life as a clean-eating rock star and why he ‘draws the line’ at Kanye WestI\u0027m off now.

David Bowie, Siouxsie, Arctic Monkeys, Duran Duran, Kate Bush, Karen O, Chrissie Hynde. I\u0027ve always been inspired by the girls as much as boys. Chopping it, colouring it, growing it, whatever it takes. It\u0027s one of the best bits of being in a band. Watch this space...The outro on Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others is fantastic and those little harmonics still make me tingle every time I hear it. What do you consider the best guitar work you’ve ever done – Smiths and post-Smiths?Nice. That is a good outro. Best guitar work I\u0027ve ever done - How Soon Is Now. Dogs of Lust, The The. Fly Trapped in the Jam and Dashboard, Modest Mouse. Cheat on Me, the Cribs. Half a Person, the Smiths. The Messenger. Luckily there\u0027s a lot I like.You played with The Last Shadow Puppets in 2016 in London and Manchester, can you tell us what’s the story behind that? and on the subject of Alex Turner – what do you think of the new Arctic Monkeys record?Okay - this is what happened. When I was writing my autobiography and I got to the part where the Smiths were about to break up, I was writing about Last Night I Dreamt Somebody Loved Me as not only does it remind me of that time but it\u0027s my favourite Smiths song. I got a call from Alex inviting me to play with the Shadow Puppets and asked if I minded playing a Smiths song. For some reason I assumed they wanted to play Last Night... or something like that. I was in a very weird headspace as I was writing about the breakup - a bit frazzled, slightly burnt out and strangely emotional. Then I got a message that they wanted to play Last Night... We played it in Manchester first and I\u0027d forgotten that the Smiths had never played it live. It was a nice moment and went off okay but when we played it again at Alexandra Palace, and opened the show with it, confetti was raining down on everybody from the ceiling and it was a really poignant moment for me. There\u0027s a good recording of it on YouTube, it was just another one of those weird things that happens in life sometimes. I love the new Arctic Monkeys record - it\u0027s very self-aware and feels like another chapter in an ongoing long story.Which records in your collection are you most embarrassed by? Any particularly guilty pleasures?I don\u0027t believe in guilty pleasures. Where do you draw the line? Disco? I\u0027ll always like disco. But watch out... I love John Coltrane. McCoy Tyner. And yes, it is jazz. I draw the line at Kanye West though.How do you feel about the way Manchester Inc is putting Happy Mondays, New Order and the Smiths on coasters and mouse mats? Do you get royalties from each tea towel sold?It\u0027s so naff. Most people think it\u0027s a joke. They\u0027ve got it very wrong - and no, we don\u0027t see any royalties.How did Manchester manage to maintain such a distinctive and internationally celebrated music scene over 15 years (to the early 90s) and what has (not) happened since?There\u0027s a big cultural explanation for the creativity in Manchester that goes back to the Industrial Revolution and the arrival of the Irish community, the Jewish community and the West Indian community, amongst others. All of these people set out their own entertainment culture. Manchester had more clubs per capita than any other city in Europe during the 1960s, which made it a very vibrant live scene during the beat boom and early pop years. All the important artists played there all the time and in turn inspired a generation of up and coming musicians and thinkers and radicals - not only in the city centre but which spread out to the suburbs too. So when the punk scene exploded, there was a strong culture of musicians and radicals ready to go. When I was growing up, Buzzcocks were a very big band and having them around and so successful was a big sign to me that it could be done. So the Fall, the Smiths, Joy Division and New Order - the whole Factory scene - was a result of all of this. The Mondays, Stone Roses followed on from us and Oasis and Doves followed on from that. It has its own scene now and is still vibrant and a big music town - but the next big thing, and the next big scene, isn\u0027t really happening in any major city in the UK, or the USA for that matter.You’ve talked about recording the new album in an industrial space with a view of the Pennines. I wondered about the extent to which you think landscape and cityscape seeps into the music you write? Is it possible to hear Manchester and the north in your guitar sound?I do think that environment affects your work and mindset and emotions. In my case, I became aware of this quite early on, for instance when we did Hand in Glove, I thought it sounded like our immediate world outside - and still does. The Messenger was recorded partly in Berlin for that reason and for Playland, I decamped to London for the same reason. Call the Comet\u0027s been made in the top floor of an old factory on the outskirts of Manchester, which has directly informed the sound of some of the songs. You\u0027ll be able to hear for yourself tomorrow - songs like Actor Attractor, New Dominions, My Eternal all feel and sound to me like my view from the factory and I wanna do more of it.Who do you think was the best British guitarist of the 1990s?Squire? Butler? Coxon? Greenwood?It\u0027s not really a contest, is it? I like Graham Coxon for one thing and Bernard Butler for something else entirely.What is your favourite guitar chord?Any tips for aspiring musicians?Don\u0027t listen to anyone who says you can\u0027t do it. Trying to be great is the best reason to want to do it. Do not bunk off to the pub. Learning everything you can about the history of other musicians is a help. From what I know, anyone who was innovative in any of the arts was an expert.What is your favourite film soundtrack?Once Upon a Time in America, Morricone. It\u0027s powerful and evocative, has all the classic Morricone motifs and eccentricity, and I can listen to it without needing to see the film. Still stands up.Is Morrissey in danger of destroying all that was good about the Smiths?You can\u0027t really destroy history, can you?Have you seen Mark Gill’s film England is Mine? And did Laurie Kynaston’s portrayal of you bring back memories of those magical early days?I haven\u0027t seen it. I thought I might but I kept forgetting to see it. I felt bad that I hadn\u0027t seen Laurie Kynaston\u0027s version of me because I\u0027ve been told he\u0027s a good guy and did a good job. I heard the film wasn\u0027t that good though.As a 16-year-old, it is clear that the Smiths are just as popular among teenagers nowadays as they were 30 years ago. When writing your songs, were you aware that they were timeless?No, I wasn\u0027t aware that they were timeless but in all truth I was hoping they would be. I wouldn\u0027t have expected it to turn out that way and it\u0027s weird that it has. I think when you\u0027re writing a song you just want it to either feel right or be impressive and that\u0027s plenty to be going for. All the other big stuff is too much to think about and certainly something you can\u0027t engineer. Otherwise you\u0027d be doing it all the time and if you could, there\u0027s something that doesn\u0027t seem right about that anyway. Writing songs is about hopeful inspiration, craft, work, joy and plenty of mystery. I love all of that.Who was your guitar hero growing up? Are there any young guitarists in bands now who impress you?My favourite guitarist is Nick Zinner from the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. I know they\u0027ve been around a while but I like everything Nick does. There\u0027s plenty of bands around with good guitar players including my son and his band, Man Made, and if people wanna make something of that, fuck \u0027em."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3843cd35f1adfd0d7e1c73de60b56c58e3031d7/0_62_4477_2686/master/4477.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b4d977ec260e307052a55426f10cc03","title":"best photos of the day world cup fans and grenfell tower anniversary","story":"’s picture editors bring you a selection of photo highlights from around the world, including memorials on the anniversary of the Grenfell fire"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61af2dc80abf34178e8348d2a32fa88f8ade1b52/0_112_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3079407d99dbce7756d1a6ebb5bdf074","title":"soundscape ecology with bernie krause science weekly podcast","story":"Do you know what noise a hungry sea anemone makes?

Rory McIlroy’s buildup had included a series of Long Island golf outings in the company of friends, in a re-acquaintance with an element of the sport that is lost when it becomes a professional pursuit. A return to the competitive scene delivered a reminder of its harsh realities on a brutal opening day at the US Open, where stellar names did little to mask their frustrations, McIlroy stood over an 11-foot putt on the 18th needing to make it to break 80.The Northern Irishman’s attempt was to slide by, ensuring the matching of his highest single round score in a major championship. US Open Thursdays have been curiously cruel to McIlroy recently this 80 follows a 78 in 2017 and 77 two years ago. Shinnecock’s par of 70 adds further bruising context.The damage this time was done in the early stages. Starting at the 10th, McIlroy found himself six over after only five holes having produced back-to-back double bogeys. There was another at the 1st, his 10th, to compound a first half of 42. McIlroy sought to repair some of the damage with birdies at the 5th and 6th but those shots were handed back to the course before his scorecard was signed.It would be unwise to ignore the extenuating circumstances. Blue skies and piercing sunshine barely disguised a menacing venue, with the United States Golf Association exacting payback 12 months after the playing of its marquee championship. Brooks Koepka triumphed at Erin Hills at an aggregate of 16 under par. Here, a whipping wind added to the difficulty levels. “At least some of the pin positions were on the greens” was the cutting assessment of Jason Day after his 79.Tiger Woods took seven at the 1st, with subsequent steadying of his round undone by a four-putt at the 13th. Woods – a muttering, frustrated Woods by close of play – was to join those beaten by Shinnecock, as proved by a 78. He found only seven greens in regulation. “I hit a lot of good iron shots but they were conservative and I just didn’t putt well,” he said. “It is tough out there but I shouldn’t be making two double bogeys and a triple.”Dustin Johnson, who partnered the 14-times major winner, tied the 18-hole lead at one under. He has Ian Poulter, Scott Piercey and Russell Henley for company. Justin Rose’s 71 left him only two from the summit. Henrik Stenson equalled his Ryder Cup partner’s score late on.McIlroy is too fine a player to be posting numbers such as 80 in golf’s most illustrious events. The 29-year-old looked out of sorts in demeanour, with the key question whether that was a consequence of his on-course troubles or the cause of them. What changes between the free-flowing, ebullient McIlroy at his best and episodes such as this, the first round of the 118th US Open, remains one of golf’s great mysteries.His playing partners suffered problems of their own. Phil Mickelson’s agonising wait for a US Open win may well stretch to at least 2019 after he slipped to a 77. The left-hander could muster only a single birdie. Jordan Spieth, the third member of this much-heralded grouping, signed for a 78. Spieth had opened bogey-triple bogey after air mailing the green from an adjacent bunker at the 11th.“It was just blah,” admitted Spieth. “It wasn’t fun it was not fun. I’m not happy with my score at all. If I’m upset with anything, it is with the decision I made on that bunker shot. I was trying too hard to get the stroke back I lost on the previous hole. All in all I ended up making six there. So I was four over through two and trying to figure out how to shoot four over on the day.”Poulter’s brilliant renaissance continues apace, though he retained a cautious outlook. “I feel confident, I feel happy,” said the Houston Open champion. “I feel happy off the golf course and it makes that a lot easier on the golf course.“I don’t want to get carried away. This is day one of four extremely tough days and three bad holes on this golf course can take you home pretty quick. So a great start is what it is but there’s a very long way to go in this tournament.”Spare a thought for Scott Gregory, however, the 23-year-old Englishman who found 92 beside his name at the end of day one. To his immense credit the 2016 Amateur champion took up his media duties. “I’ll forget about this quickly,” he said. He may take solace in being far from the only one needing quick deletion of a gruesome memory."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6fa2b03c74628d71187d6fbe3be2a16a609df90/180_225_3516_2110/master/3516.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c43f2b856e9c948918776c5725713a6b","title":"uk sport change funding olympic paralympic games","story":"The governing bodies of 12 British sports have demanded an end to a funding policy that puts Olympic medals above all else.Describing the current model as “isive”, the bodies – which include Badminton England and GB Wheelchair Rugby – have called on UK Sport to apply “at least a baseline level of funding” to all Olympic and Paralympic sports.In a letter to the  the 12 also challenge UK Sport’s current consultation on future strategy. “It seems designed to create fear that there will be a total collapse of the UK medal tally should the current funding model be meddled with,” it read.“We believe that giving many millions of pounds to some sports but none to others is isive and will prove self-defeating. We think the British public believes in fairness and equality of opportunity, and the best way to achieve this is to provide at least a baseline level of funding to all Olympic and Paralympic sports. We are confident that this can be achieved without sacrificing current medal success.”Great Britain has enjoyed unprecedented success at the Olympic Games since the no-compromise approach to funding was introduced in 2004.

In so doing they also became the first country to improve their medal tally at five consecutive Games.None of the 12 bodies that signed the letter to the  will be funded during that cycle. While the group argue that a new approach need not be at the expense of medals, they also make the case for changing the criteria upon which funding is based. “UK Sport has a responsibility to ensure that all our Olympic and Paralympic athletes are encouraged to achieve their potential and that a system of development opportunities should be there for all of them”, the group argue. “The popularity and levels of participation of a given sport are key to inspiring a nation and must be considered when funding decisions are made,” the bodies argued.UK Sport launched a public consultation on post-Tokyo funding this month, asking respondents to consider how funding can contribute to the government’s current sports strategy of “using high-performance sport to promote inspiration, participation, economic growth and social impacts such as on physical and mental health in society”. Its board will announce its decision in ‘early 2019’ and any changes will be implemented by April 2021.The 12 signatories were: Archery GB, Badminton England, Baseball, Softball UK, British Fencing, British Handball, GB Luge, GB Wheelchair Rugby, Table Tennis England, British Volleyball, British Weightlifting and British Wrestling."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9d3480c66e17bf7a16acc7eb2da1d56bb020d50/0_88_6811_4088/master/6811.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2bf4402abd9adaf3786359ad715cb3bc","title":"arty party gallery and event highlights from the great exhibition of the north","story":"Music, heritage, art and design are celebrated at these north-east venues as part of this major cultural happening.

Recommended by Daniel CarrollMark and MeMy interest in interviews with people from the movie and music industry drew me to the Mark And Me Podcast, but what I discovered was so much more. Mark’s genuine interest and sincerity results in something much closer to intimate conversations, that are always fascinating, and often inspiring. The Neill Blomkamp episode, one of my personal favourites, is a surprisingly honest and eye-opening conversation about film-making and the studio process that gave me a newfound respect for his films and creative integrity. In another episode, Mark even manages to click with the ever-elusive Tommy Wiseau. No mean feat! Such is the personal feel of these episodes, my recollection of them is not of listening on my phone, but as being present during them. I listen to many podcasts and line them up ready for when I get some free time, but when a new Mark And Me episode lands, I drop everything to listen.

Long-running opposition against the proposals reached a head on Thursday evening, with about 200 people demonstrating outside the Legislative Council against the bill. “The Basic Law can no more provide protection to Hong Kong people.

Even the children are spiritless and look obtuse.” The theoretical physicist, who once said racism was “a disease of white people”, added: “It would be a pity if these Chinese supplant all other races. For the likes of us the mere thought is unspeakably dreary.”While some internet users called for a “boycott of Einstein” and said his observations proved “all humans, even Einstein, have a stupid, shallow side,” most said the China Einstein witnessed is nothing like it is today. “Einstein went to China at the wrong time,” said one Weibo user, describing the early years of the Chinese republic, established in 1912, which came after centuries of imperial rule. “Hunger, war, and poverty all pressed on the Chinese. How could Chinese people at the time gain Einstein’s respect?” Many were in strong support of the scientist: “This is called insulting China? That’s ridiculous. Did the Chinese in that era look dirty? When I see the photos from then, they look dirty, Einstein depicted the true state of that era.”Others compared the scientists’s observations to that of Lu Xun, considered the father of modern Chinese literature, who was best known for his scathing satire of Chinese society in the early 20th century. “We praise Lu Xun because he pointed out our disadvantages. Why should we blame Einstein for this?”Historical narratives promoted by the Chinese government often paint the days before China’s communist party took power in 1949 as chaotic. The state-run Global Times published an editorial on Friday praising the level-headed response of Chinese internet users. The author, who goes by the pen name Gengzhige, wrote: “I’m curious what Einstein would write now if he saw the open attitudes most Chinese show today toward his private diary.” The editorial elicited over 2,000 comments. One of the most liked responses said: “Dignity is earned by oneself, not given by others.”But there were some dissenting voices amongst the comments: “This is just racism. We can see that Einstein is strong in physics but he doesn’t understand humans at all.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ca9126720da5550aa40781abda1dd65031aed56/0_59_4939_2964/master/4939.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73ccbd95730abd0c2016303072ecefbd","title":"the daddy quota how quebec got men to take parental leave","story":"In 2006, the province adopted a groundbreaking social policy to create a more equal societyWhen Daniel Goldsmith’s first son was born in Quebec in 2013, he took the newborn on a trip to Colorado Springs, the US town in which he grew up.“I’d smile at a mother in a coffee shop, because her baby was the same age as mine, just weeks old,” he recalls. “And then she’d tell me she was going back to work the following week.”Goldmith, a humanities teacher in Montreal, spoke to old friends about their experiences with babies and work. “It just sounded like the definition of insanity: mothers going back to work two weeks after a baby was born fathers taking two days off.”News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theIn the family of Canada’s provinces and territories, Quebec has long been the noisy, rebellious child. In 2006, it orced itself from the country’s complex and lacklustre parental leave programme. The province created its own system, the Quebec Parental Insurance Plan (QPIP), a model influenced by Scandinavian countries and with the aim of improving gender equality.Along with Quebec’s highly subsidised daycare system – the envy of parents across the rest of Canada, with rates as low as C$7.55 (£4.35) per day per child – QPIP was seeded in the 1990s by the controversial separatist leader Pauline Marois, then Quebec’s minister of families. “Marois is a feminist and fiercely determined,” says Sophie Mathieu, a post-doctoral fellow at Brock University who researches the Quebec parental leave system. “As a province, Quebec went from being the laggard in gender equality – Quebec was the last Canadian province to give women the vote – to being the leader.”“There is so much working against fathers when it comes to leave,” says Andrea Doucet, the Canada Research Chair in Gender, Work \u0026amp Care. “Fathers go into work and say they want to take leave, and their bosses say: ‘Well isn’t your wife taking leave?’ Fathers were being penalised for taking leave, all the stuff that women have been going through for so long.“What they found in places like Sweden is that if you give fathers their own leave, something families will lose if they don’t take, taking the leave becomes expected.”Globally the picture is even starker. Almost two-thirds of the world’s children under a year old – nearly 90 million infants – live in countries where fathers are not legally entitled to a single day of paid paternity leave, according to new research by Unicef. Ankita Patnaik, an economist at Mathematica Policy Research in Washington DC, authored one of the first papers studying QPIP. She says the programme quickly showed results with regards to time use between couples. “I found that the mothers having babies in Quebec under QPIP were spending more time in paid work one to three years after having their children,” she says. What’s more, Patnaik found that fathers who made use of QPIP were engaging in more childcare and domestic work one to three years later than fathers who did not – 37 minutes more per day, on average.While five weeks of leave is a good step in this direction, “it’s just one step”, she adds.Goldsmith, who also used shared parental benefits to take months-long leaves for both his young sons, believes that men caring for their babies in the early weeks of their life has a significant and continuing benefit for family life. “It’s different for dads. Mums have an automatic bond but dads have to earn it. And then when you start getting reactions from your babies, it makes you want to be more involved,” he says. “I want to care for my kids, not because of some abstract theoretical notion of sharing 5050. My son smiles when I smile, he smiles when he sees me. So I do things for love. Love becomes the reason.”In Canada, that love is spreading. “In the 2018 budget, we have introduced an additional parental sharing benefit of five weeks,” says the families minister, Jean-Yves Duclos. “This is directly related to this very successful experiment in the province of Quebec. “We know it’s policies like this that will help us achieve a more equal and inclusive society. These are the kind of policies we want. Not the kind that build walls. Here in Canada, we prefer bridges.”This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

They and other visitors have brought valuable tourist dollars to the city and other locations across Japan.But now the country’s former capital is on the frontline of a battle against “tourism pollution” that has already turned locals against visitors in cities across the world such as Venice, Barcelona and Amsterdam.The increasingly fraught relationship between tourists and their Japanese hosts has spread to the short-stay rental market. On Friday a new law comes into effect that requires property owners to register with the government before they can legally make their homes available through Airbnb and other websites. The restriction has caused the number of available properties to plummet and has cost the US-based company millions of dollars.Thanks to government campaigns, the number of foreign tourists visiting Japan has soared since the end of a flat period caused by a strong yen and radiation fears in the aftermath of the 2011 Fukushima disaster.But for many people living near sightseeing hotspots, the tourism boom is proving a double-edged sword. “Japan’s rise as a bucket-list destination is a mixed blessing,” said Peter MacIntosh, who organises walking tours and geisha evenings for small groups. “When there were very few tourists, people complained, and now that there are lots of them, they’re not ready for it. If it’s like this now, what do you think it’s going to be like closer to the Olympics?”The Gion-Shimbashi area of Kyoto is quiet on this weekday morning, but by the weekend the road in front of Tatsumi Daimyojin shrine, the bridge over the Shirakawa and alleyways dotted with restaurants, homes and ryokans (traditional Japanese inns) will be teeming with an international cast of visitors.Tomoko Okuda, who runs Shiraume, a ryokan that welcomes overseas guests, believes more could be done to educate tourists about local customs before they arrive.“Making a booking at a restaurant and then cancelling on the same day may be acceptable in other countries, but in Japan it causes real problems because of the preparation involved,” Okuda said. “I’ve also heard complaints about people going into old tea houses and coffee shops, taking photos and leaving without ordering anything.”Kanji Tomita, an architect and member of a group campaigning to preserve the Gion-Shimbashi’s traditional atmosphere, said tourists were welcome, but added that some local businesses were running out of patience.Most complaints target groups loitering in the doorways of private homes, sitting on delicate bamboo fences and trespassing to take the perfect selfie. Others say the sheer number of visitors has led to overcrowded buses, fully booked restaurants and a general din that spoils the city’s miyabi – the refined atmosphere that draws people to Kyoto in the first place.“This used to be a place where you’d only see locals out for a stroll or eating at a restaurant,” Tomita said. “But more and more people read online reviews and make a beeline for the area. It’s a beautiful place and we want visitors to enjoy it, but they should also consider the feelings of the people who live here. It’s not some sort of cultural Disneyland.”Under the new private lodging law, which was supposed to address a legal grey area surrounding short-term rentals – known as minpaku – properties can be rented out for a maximum of 180 days a year, and local authorities are permitted to impose additional restrictions.The result has been a dramatic drop in the number of Japanese properties available via Airbnb, from more than 60,000 this spring to just 1,000 on the eve of the law’s introduction. The legislation has forced the firm to cancel reservations for guests planning to stay in unregistered homes after Friday and to compensate clients to the tune of about $10m.Complaints about late-night noise and rubbish incorrectly sorted before disposal, along with security concerns, have pitted residents against local authorities keen to cash in on the tourism boom. Tellingly, Kyoto will allow private lodging in residential areas only between mid-January and mid-March, the one time of the year that tourists traditionally avoid.A short walk south of Tatsumi Daimyojin, hordes of tourists have congregated on a street in front of Ichiriki, the 300-year-old teahouse made famous by the book and film Memoirs of a Geisha. Most are here for one reason: to catch a glimpse of the Gion district’s geiko and maiko – or qualified and trainee geisha.“The problem is that everyone thinks of Kyoto as their own private photo studio,” said MacIntosh, who has lived in the city for 25 years. “I’ve seen maiko bursting into tears and fending off people who want to have their photo taken with them. They are not on display. This is a live, working environment.”Other incidents have hardened attitudes towards mass tourism, with TV networks running features on tourists climbing up cherry trees during the blossom season or staggering drunk around Tokyo’s Golden Gai bar district. In May there was widespread anger when more than 100 trees in a popular bamboo forest were found to have been defaced by people carving their names into them. Alex Kerr, a Kyoto resident and author of several books about Japan, said the country had been caught off-guard. “It’s not just Kyoto – most of Japan is unprepared for the foreign influx because the boom has happened so quickly. Nobody ever expected tourists to come in such large numbers, and it is only just beginning.”Kerr believes better management would ease the pressure, including the introduction of higher admission fees to popular attractions.“Tourism is the last salvation for many rural towns, and even having a big impact on metropolises such as Osaka,” he said. “So clamping down on tourism is not the answer. At the same time, there’s no question that unmanaged crowds can damage the experience, especially in a city like Kyoto where so much of the essence of the culture was about the quiet and meditative atmosphere.”In Tatsumi Daimyojin, the photoshoots have ended and the groups in kimonos move on to the next attraction.“Japan is going through a period of adjustment,” said Okuda. “Kyoto isn’t as big or cosmopolitan as Tokyo, and it is taking time to get used to the influx of visitors. But the last thing I want is for Kyoto to become the sort of place that sends out the signal that tourists should stay away.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63f14eaa2457332806a8a2a096fd3709c6bea2ec/0_17_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6bee03a4cbfa0b4bfd10b86c8a8aad48","title":"we have a new chance zimbabwe gears up for elections after mugabe","story":"Opposition says country still lives under dictatorship but relatively peaceful election campaign gives some hope of changeThe president and his wife drive slowly across the dusty sports ground, preceded by a pickup full of local reporters, flanked by a crowd of excited teenagers, and followed by a large cloud of dust. Banners are held aloft, flags waved.Zimbabwe’s election campaign has reached Chegutu, a small agricultural town on the high, flat uplands 70 miles west of Harare.The rally is one of the first since the official declaration of the campaign last month. The coming election – on 30 July – is the latest turning point in the most tumultuous few months in almost four decades of Zimbabwe’s political history.In November, Robert Mugabe was forced out of power after 37 years, following a peaceful military takeover supported by the vast majority of the 17 million population. The coming election could decide the former British colony’s course for decades to come.“For so long we were suffering. Now we have a new chance in Zimbabwe,” says Chiedza Marutsa, a 57-year-old farmer attending the rally in Chegutu.The election pits Zanu-PF, the ruling party, against the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), the longstanding opposition. Zanu-PF is led by Emmerson Mnangagwa, a 75-year-old former vice president known as “the Crocodile” who took power when Mugabe was ousted. Polls indicate a potentially close race, but one Zanu-PF should win.Mnangagwa’s message at Chegutu is simple: a vote for Zanu-PF is a vote for economic growth. The average income in Zimbabwe will increase four, five, 10 times in coming years, he promises the crowd, but that requires foreign investors.“What builds clinics, roads, schools, clean water? What makes jobs? It is business … Zimbabwe is open for business,” he says.The rhetoric is a stark departure from the leftist ideology of the Mugabe years. But Zimbabwe is in desperate need of capital: its once envied infrastructure is crumbling government debts are massive civil servant salaries go unpaid millions need food aid to avoid severe malnutrition. Marutsa says her six children, all educated or with professional qualifications, are without jobs.Senior officials deny any shift in party principles, describing a “course correction” instead.“We are fulfilling what we went for in the 1970s: to build a new and modern country. We are going to break out economically at last,” says Chris Mutsvangwa, a presidential adviser and leader of the powerful veterans of the liberation war.Mugabe has “stolen the future of the young people”, he continues. “We were sliding into the middle ages. Reforms are in the works that will make us the optimal destination for investment in the while of Africa. Discipline, organisation, education and stability will be the building blocks of our future.”The ruling party’s messaging encourages Zimbabweans to look forward to prosperity and stability under an experienced, moderate and reasonable ruler. Anyone looking back may see Mnangagwa in a very different light.A former spy chief, Mnangagwa was Mugabe’s right-hand man for decades. He and other senior officials – many of whom are former senior soldiers – are accused of involvement in massacres in the early 1980s of tens of thousands of civilians in Matabeleland and of masterminding the brutal repression of the MDC in more recent years. Some are accused of corruption and racketeering.Voters know that Mugabe was not ousted to restore democracy but because Mnangagwa and others feared that the 94-year-old ruler’s much younger wife, Grace, was about to take power.Senior opposition figures are unequivocal about their view on the state of affairs.“We removed a dictator in November 2017 but we did not remove a dictatorship. These are not change agents,” says Tendai Biti, a top MDC official.So far there has been little material improvement for the ordinary Zimbabwean citizen since the end of Mugabe’s rule. Hard currency still remains desperately short and the price of key essentials is still rising.Representatives of major international investment funds have flown into Harare but are wary of committing large sums. When Mnangagwa flew to Beijing this year, he was told that China was happy to help but only when financial and legal systems improved. Until massive loan arrears are cleared, the big multilateral lenders cannot supply the money needed to refloat the economy.This is one reason why senior officials are so keen for Zimbabwe to return to the Commonwealth, from which it was suspended in 2002 after brutal repression and fraud during a presidential election.“Our policy is very clear: we want to be friends with everyone,” says the foreign minister, Sibusiso Moyo, a former general who shot to global prominence when he announced the military takeover of the state broadcasting network.“For many years our people have been suffering and we want to get them out of the quagmire. We need friends to do that. We want to be a member of the community of nations again.”Opinion of Mnangagwa is ided among western diplomats and analysts in Harare Some are convinced the president wants to be seen as the statesman who has restored democracy in Zimbabwe and who would step down if defeated. Others say the Crocodile “does not have a democratic bone in his body”, but has pragmatically recognised the need to win international legitimacy if his country is to access the financial assistance it so desperately needs.The international community has interests too. Post-Brexit Britain needs a foreign policy success and has made its support for Mnangagwa clear – if conditional on free, fair and credible elections. China continues to take advantage of the Trump administration’s lack of interest in Africa to expand its influence.“These are the same people who were the enforcers of Mugabe’s regime,” says Welshman Ncube, a senior MDC figure based in Bulawayo, the country’s second largest city.The MDC says there are serious problems with the electoral roll, concerns over the ballot papers, a biased election commission and systematic intimidation of voters in rural areas. They also complain about the obvious and massive bias in the dominant state-run media.“A ruse has been sold to the international community … They are putting stability ahead of democracy, and favouring commerce over good governance,” says Chamisa, who has been leader of the MDC since the death of Morgan Tsvangirai in February. Other MDC officials go further, accusing London and Washington of complicity in repression.But few deny that the atmosphere is dramatically improved compared with previous elections. Although there have been 71 verified incidents of political violence in the first six months of this year, about half of which were committed by Zanu-PF supporters, respected human rights activists in Zimbabwe say that, so far at least, levels remain relatively low.One international election expert in Harare says logistic and technical preparations for the elections has been “correctly conducted” – a statement that opposition leaders called “outrageous” – and points out that many more respondents are now prepared to answer pollsters questions on voting intentions, suggesting “less fear” than before Mugabe’s fall.The MDC is holding rallies in Zanu-PF strongholds where previously it feared to set foot and has been allowed to march through central Harare.“A lot remains to be done but in the context we were coming from, to let us canvas, mobilise and organise is a lot of progress,” Ncube says.Mukudzei Majoni, 25, a project officer at Magamba TV, an online network in Harare that faced repeated harassment by the authorities under Mugabe, describes the atmosphere as “weird”.He says: “We’ve never had an election like this. We’ve never had this much peace ... It’s very disorientating.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3529320.1528974374!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"my leaving i haven t opened a book and i m not sorry","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tJade Simpson is a student at Carndonagh Community SchoolI haven’t opened a book and I’m not sorry. People jolt when they hear that, but there is a good reason: most of the work for the Leaving Cert Applied (LCA) is done in class and we are so well-prepared that there isn’t a huge need for extensive exam preparation.Back in second year I found the larger classes were hard to work in. I moved into the Junior Cert Schools Programme (JCSP), where the curriculum is more suited to our needs, and I found it so much easier to learn. I skipped Transition Year because, at the time, I thought I wanted out of school as soon as possible, but part of me wishes I hadn’t. As for leaving school, I have mixed feelings: it’s both daunting and exciting. One of the main reasons I chose the LCA is because of the smaller class sizes and the ersity of subjects, including hair and beauty, English and communication and IT. There was work experience too, and I got jobs out of both placements, including childcare in a playschool and in SuperValu, where I’m still working. I think that the mainstream Leaving Cert, if it is being reformed, needs to look at what we do for the LCA.There’s also a lot of project work and we were taken out on more than a few occasions, including to a car rally. One of the best LCA modules was a driving programme, which is particularly important given the high accident rate among young drivers in Donegal. What’s behind it? Some young people on the road can be careless and they don’t fully grasp what can go wrong until it’s too late. The class we did taught us to know ourselves better and to be more familiar with the road. I can’t wait to get behind the wheel. I have my provisional licence and will start lessons soon. When you’re in a relatively isolated area such as Carndonagh, a car becomes a necessity. I’m taking a year out to work and then looking at a course in childcare, probably in Derry or Letterkenny. Let’s hope I’m not stopped at the Border crossings.Will Brexit bring a hard border? The truth is that I haven’t been following events and it’s not really on my radar. And long may it stay that way.

Photograph: PA WireThe European Union could ignore its own rules if it wants to avoid a hard border in Ireland after Brexit and simply agree not to create one in any circumstances, the leading backbench Conservative Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg has said.Mr Rees-Mogg, who chairs the European Research Group of pro-Brexit Tory MPs, said Theresa May should call Ireland’s bluff rather than allow the Border issue to hold Brexit to ransom.“Will the Irish put up a border? Will a government that has always believed there should be a single government across the whole island of Ireland suddenly put up a wall? Is it going to be a Trump-like wall built by Mr Varadkar?The British government has repeatedly said it will not impose a border, so it is entirely up to Mr Varadkar, ” he told The .“I think we can easily negotiate a deal on trade across the Border, but I don’t think this issue should hold us to ransom on doing everything else, which is what it’s currently being used for.I think we should simply make it clear that we will not put up a border and that is our position. And what would the Irish do if the EU insisted? I think that is a really interesting question. I think we should call that particular bluff.”Britain and the EU have agreed that there should be no return to a hard Border, and Ms May, the prime minister, has acknowledged that a unilateral British commitment not to create new barriers was not enough to resolve the issue.Mr Rees-Mogg said he disagreed with the prime minister and dismissed the EU’s argument that its rules demanded that it should police its external borders and protect the integrity of the single market and the customs union.“It wasn’t possible for Italy to join the euro. But lo and behold the rules were waived. It was not possible for Greece to join the euro, but lo and behold Goldman Sachs fiddled the figures and Greece joined. The four freedoms are inisible, except when it comes to the association agreement with Ukraine, when lo and behold the freedom of movement of people – oh dear, we are not going to have that,” he said.\u0026nbsp“This is one of those things we must not fall for. The EU says this is EU law. It is holy writ. Moses has brought it down from the Alps, when he was not busy in the Sinai, and therefore it must be obeyed. Whenever it is convenient to the European Union, European law is adjusted. It is political rather than legal.’’Mr Rees-Mogg said that, considering its long history with Ireland, Britain should not do anything that risks security or damages the Irish economy. He noted Britain’s importance as a trading partner for Ireland, particularly in agriculture, and warned of the consequences if the EU made Britain subject to the common external tariff.“There would be up to 70 per cent tariffs on Irish beef ... I cannot believe there is any wish that the Irish Government has any wish for any of this to happen. Therefore I think we have to be very clear and say: we are not going to have a border, we’re going to carry on trading freely with you, what are you going to do?’’Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3531052.1529001700!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"jacob rees mogg leads caucus that could hold theresa may s fate in its hands","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Jacob Rees-Mogg: The European Parliament is not, he claims, “a serious parliament” or a proper democratic forum because it doesn’t represent a single people. Photograph: Stefan RousseauPATheresa May has spent much of this week struggling to reconcile the two ends of her party over Brexit, shuttling between former attorney general Dominic Grieve, who leads the pro-European rebels, and Brexiteer shop steward Jacob Rees-Mogg. But for Rees-Mogg, the 49-year-old Somerset MP who chairs the European Research Group (ERG) of up to 60 hard Brexiteers, negotiating with the EU couldn’t be simpler.“I think there’s a very straightforward deal actually. I think what we should say to the EU is: here’s £39 billion, and here’s a trade deal,” he says, forming each of his hands into a fist to demonstrate.\u0026nbsp“If you give us one, we’ll give you the other. If you don’t give us the other, we won’t give you one. And then, for 21 months of the multiannual financial framework negotiation, you’re going to have to get more money from other member states.”Once caricatured as a backbench Bertie Wooster on account of his fogeyish style, elongated vowels and reactionary outlook, Rees-Mogg is today one of the most influential MPs at Westminster. A consistent poll-topper in Conservative Home’s surveys of party members on who should be their next leader, he leads a caucus that could hold the prime minister’s fate in its hands.Rees-Mogg, whose father William edited the London Times and went on to become a Conservative peer, made a fortune estimated in the tens of millions of pounds before becoming an MP. This week, it emerged that his investment company\u0026nbspSomerset Capital Management had launched a new investment vehicle in Dublin, which advised investors that a hard Brexit\u0026nbspcould affect it adversely. In any case, he doesn’t believe in the downside economic risks to Brexit, despite a warning from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) that a hard exit from the EU could wipe out entire sectors of the British economy.“The CBI represents incumbents. It doesn’t represent challengers, it doesn’t represent competition and if you represent incumbents, of course you want to maintain the cosy cartel that keeps prices high. But I’m on the side of my voters who are consumers and consumers want lower prices, lower tariffs, less obstructions to trade therefore non-tariff barriers too,” he says.For Rees-Mogg, leaving the EU is about much more than economics or day-to-day politics, it is about democracy itself. He says one of the most important questions every member of parliament faces is whether he can seek redress of grievance for his constituents.“And you can’t once it’s a European competence. Whereas when it’s a British competence you can raise it in the House of Commons, you can introduce a bill if you want to change the law. You have an active way of seeking redress of grievance for your constituents,” he says.The European Parliament is not, he claims, “a serious parliament” or a proper democratic forum because it doesn’t represent a single people.\u0026nbsp“There are the peoples of Europe, there’s not a single European people. If there were a European people, the Germans wouldn’t mind subsidising the Greeks. But they hate it,” he says.So is there a single British people? And is everyone in Northern Ireland part of it?“Yes there is. By a long-established history. Northern Ireland is part of the UK,” he says.\u0026nbsp“Some of them wish to leave. And they have, under the Belfast Agreement, the right to a referendum under certain circumstances”.But the agreement also gives them the right to identify as British or Irish or both, which would suggest that some of them have the right not to be part of the British people?“Well they have a vote in the British election but they don’t have to use it. We don’t have compulsory voting, and I don’t think we should,” he says.“I believe in the concept of nation-state. I think that’s where power validly belongs. And the people who belong to that nation-state have rights and duties within that nation-state, and the democracy applies to them. But I don’t believe that there is a European people that is willing to accept the burdens required for a single state.”“We would be in an association with it, which would not make us subject to the ECJ, the ECJ would have no writ in the UK, it would have a writ in the chemicals agency. And that is different from the current position where if the ECJ ruled on the chemicals agency that would automatically be UK law. Under those circumstances, it would not be UK law and could not affect what happened in the UK unless we decided that it would,” he says.“Voluntary alignment is fine because you can decide not to align if you think the regulation is going wrong,” he says.What Rees-Mogg is describing is similar to Switzerland’s relationship with the EU, which is governed by numerous bilateral treaties that offer the Swiss a measure of sovereignty in theory but leaves them in reality as rule-takers from Brussels.Despite the current chaos in Westminster and the slow progress of negotiations in Brussels, he believes that May will secure a deal from the EU.“My guess is that there will be a deal. I’m in favour of a deal but I’m not frightened of leaving without it,” he says.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspNegotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"magnum freedom project pictures","story":"1968 was a seismic year of deep societal and political shifts.

practices could contribute to increased longevityReligious people live on average four years longer than their agnostic and atheist peers, new research has found.\u0026nbspThe difference between practising worshippers and those who were not part of a religious group could be down to a mix of social support, stress-relieving practices\u0026nbspand abstaining from unhealthy habits, the authors suggest.For the study, a team of Ohio University academics, including associate professor of psychology Christian End, analysed more than 1,500 obituaries from across the US to piece together how the defining features of our lives affect our longevity.The surprising effects of loneliness on healthAtheists gather together to help homeless people in South CarolinaRecord number of British people say they have no religionThese records include religious affiliations and marriage details as well as information on activities, hobbies and habits, which can help or hinder our health, not otherwise captured in census data.The study, published in Social Psychological and Personality Science today, found that on average people whose obituary mentioned they were religious lived an extra 5.64 years.Life expectancy was still 3.82 years longer in religious people when they statistically controlled for marriage rates, a factor which has been shown to increase life expectancy and help stave off disease.“The study provides persuasive evidence that there is a relationship between religious participation and how long a person lives,” said Baldwin Way, co-author of the study and associate professor of psychology at Ohio State University.The major part of the study used more than 1,000 obituaries from newspapers in 42 states. But a further analysis of 500 obituaries from the Des Moines Register, a paper in Iowa, found the effect was more pronounced and religion was associated with an extra 6.48 years of life, suggesting living in a more religious area might have an extra effect.Religious participation often goes hand-in-hand with increased participation in activities and social groups, which might help tackle loneliness and sedentary lifestyles\u0026nbspthat could also shorten life expectancy.But analysis of activities mentioned in the report found this accounted for a fraction of the effect.Health news in pictures150 Gay, lesbian and bisexual adults at higher risk of heart disease, study claimsResearchers at the Baptist Health South Florida Clinic in Miami  focused on seven areas of controllable heart health and found these minority groups were particularly likely to be smokers and to have poorly controlled blood sugarNew guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the body which determines what treatment the NHS should fund, said lax road repairs and car-dominated streets were contributing to the obesity epidemic by preventing members of the public from keeping active350 New menopause drugs offer women relief from \u0027debilitating\u0027 hot flushesA new class of treatments for women going through the menopause is able to reduce numbers of debilitating hot flushes by as much as three quarters in a matter of days, a trial has found.450 Doctors should prescribe more antidepressants for people with mental health problems, study findsResearch from Oxford University found that more than one million extra people suffering from mental health problems would benefit from being prescribed drugs and criticised “ideological” reasons doctors use to avoid doing so.550 Student dies of flu after NHS advice to stay at home and avoid A\u0026ampEThe family of a teenager who died from flu has urged people not to delay going to A\u0026ampE if they are worried about their symptoms.

The treatment, that works similarly to a vaccine, is a combination of two existing drugs, of which tiny amounts are injected into the solid bulk of a tumour. 950 NHS reviewing thousands of cervical cancer smear tests after women wrongly given all-clearThousands of cervical cancer screening results are under review after failings at a laboratory meant some women were incorrectly given the all-clear. A number of women have already been told to contact their doctors following the identification of “procedural issues” in the service provided by Pathology First Laboratory.1050 Potential key to halting breast cancer\u0027s spread discovered by scientistsMost breast cancer patients do not die from their initial tumour, but from secondary malignant growths (metastases), where cancer cells are able to enter the blood and survive to invade new sites. Asparagine, a molecule named after asparagus where it was first identified in high quantities, has now been shown to be an essential ingredient for tumour cells to gain these migratory properties.1150 NHS nursing vacancies at record high with more than 34,000 roles advertisedA record number of nursing and midwifery positions are currently being advertised by the NHS, with more than 34,000 positions currently vacant, according to the latest data. Demand for nurses was 19 per cent higher between July and September 2017 than the same period two years ago.1250 Malnutrition deaths in hospitals in England and Wales at highest level for a decadeThe number of people dying in hospital as a result of malnutrition has hit its highest level for a decade, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show.

Longer commutes also appear to have a significant impact on mental wellbeing, with those commuting longer 33 per cent more likely to suffer from depression2050 You cannot be fit and fatIt is not possible to be overweight and healthy, a major new study has concluded. The study of 3.5 million Britons found that even “metabolically healthy” obese people are still at a higher risk of heart disease or a stroke than those with a normal weight rangeWhen you feel particularly exhausted, it can definitely feel like you are also lacking in brain capacity. Now, a new study has suggested this could be because chronic sleep deprivation can actually cause the brain to eat itselfDavid Lloyd Gyms have launched a new health and fitness class which is essentially a bunch of people taking a nap for 45 minutes. The fitness group was spurred to launch the ‘napercise’ class after research revealed 86 per cent of parents said they were fatigued. The class is therefore predominantly aimed at parents but you actually do not have to have children to take part2350 \u0027Fundamental right to health\u0027 to be axed after Brexit, lawyers warnTobacco and alcohol companies could win more easily in court cases such as the recent battle over plain cigarette packaging if the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is abandoned, a barrister and public health professor have said.2450 \u0027Thousands dying\u0027 due to fear over non-existent statin side-effectsA major new study into the side effects of the cholesterol-lowering medicine suggests common symptoms such as muscle pain and weakness are not caused by the drugs themselves2550 Babies born to fathers aged under 25 have higher risk of autismNew research has found that babies born to fathers under the age of 25 or over 51 are at higher risk of developing autism and other social disorders. The study, conducted by the Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment at Mount Sinai, found that these children are actually more advanced than their peers as infants, but then fall behind by the time they hit their teenage years.2650 Cycling to work ‘could halve risk of cancer and heart disease’Commuters who swap their car or bus pass for a bike could cut their risk of developing heart disease and cancer by almost half, new research suggests – but campaigners have warned there is still an “urgent need” to improve road conditions for cyclists.2750 Ketamine helps patients with severe depression ‘when nothing else works’ doctors sayKetamine helps patients with severe depression ‘when nothing else works’ doctors say2850 Playing Tetris in hospital after a traumatic incident could prevent PTSDScientists conducted the research on 71 car crash victims as they were waiting for treatment at one hospital’s accident and emergency department. They asked half of the patients to briefly recall the incident and then play the classic computer game, the others were given a written activity to complete. The researchers, from Karolinska Institute in Sweden and the University of Oxford, found that the patients who had played Tetris reported fewer intrusive memories, commonly known as flashbacks, in the week that followed2950 Measles outbreak spreads across Europe as parents shun vaccinations, WHO warnsMajor measles outbreaks are spreading across Europe despite the availability of a safe, effective vaccine, the World Health Organisation has warned.3050 Vaping backed as healthier nicotine alternative to cigarettes after latest studyVaping has been given an emphatic thumbs up by health experts after the first long-term study of its effects in ex-smokers.3150 Common method of cooking rice can leave traces of arsenic in food, scientists warnMillions of people are putting themselves at risk by cooking their rice incorrectly, scientists have warned.3250 Contraceptive gel that creates ‘reversible vasectomy’ shown to be effective in monkeysAn injectable contraceptive gel that acts as a ‘reversible vasectomy’ is a step closer to being offered to men following successful trials on monkeys.3350 Shift work and heavy lifting may reduce women’s fertility, study findsWomen who work at night or do irregular shifts may experience a decline in fertility, a new study has found.3450 Breakfast cereals targeted at children contain \u0027steadily high\u0027 sugar levels since 1992 despite producer claimsA major pressure group has issued a fresh warning about perilously high amounts of sugar in breakfast cereals, specifically those designed for children, and has said that levels have barely been cut at all in the last two and a half decadesScientists have made a “monumental leap forward” in the treatment of pancreatic cancer after discovering using two drugs together dramatically improved patients’ chances of living more than five years after diagnosis.3650 Japanese government tells people to stop overworkingThe Japanese government has announced measures to limit the amount of overtime employees can do – in an attempt to stop people literally working themselves to death.3750 Over-cooked potatoes and burnt toast ‘could cause cancer’The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has issued a public warning over the risks of acrylamide - a chemical compound that forms in some foods when they are cooked at high temperatures (above 120C).3850 Cervical cancer screening attendance hits 19 year lowCervical screening tests are a vital method of preventing cancer through the detection and treatment of abnormalities in the cervix, but new research shows that the number of women using this service has dropped to a 19 year low.3950 High blood pressure may protect over 80s from dementiaThe ConversationIt is well known that high blood pressure is a risk factor for dementia, so the results of a new study from the University of California, Irvine, are quite surprising. The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.4050 Most child antidepressants are ineffective and can lead to suicidal thoughtsThe majority of antidepressants are ineffective and may be unsafe, for children and teenager with major depression, experts have warned. In what is the most comprehensive comparison of 14 commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs to date, researchers found that only one brand was more effective at relieving symptoms of depression than a placebo. Another popular drug, venlafaxine, was shown increase the risk users engaging in suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicide4150 \u0027Universal cancer vaccine’ breakthrough claimed by expertsScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany4250 Green tea could be used to treat brain issues caused by Down’s SyndromeA compound found in green tea could improve the cognitive abilities of those with Down’s syndrome, a team of scientists has discovered. Researchers found epigallocatechin gallate – which is especially present in green tea but can also be found in white and black teas – combined with cognitive stimulation, improved visual memory and led to more adaptive behaviour. Dr Rafael de la Torre, who led the year-long clinical trial along with Dr Mara Dierrssen, said: “The results suggest that iniduals who received treatment with the green tea compound, together with the cognitive stimulation protocol, had better scores in their cognitive capacities”4350 Taking antidepressants in pregnancy ‘could double the risk of autism in toddlers’Taking antidepressants during pregnancy could almost double the risk of a child being diagnosed with autism in the first years of life, a major study of nearly 150,000 pregnancies has suggested. Researchers have found a link between women in the later stages of pregnancy who were prescribed one of the most common types of antidepressant drugs, and autism diagnosed in children under seven years of ageParents have been warned that giving children paracetamol-based medicines such as Calpol and Disprol too often could lead to serious health issues later in life. Leading paediatrician and professor of general paediatrics at University College London, Alastair Sutcliffe, said parents were overusing paracetamol to treat mild fevers. As a result, the risk of developing asthma, as well as kidney, heart and liver damage is heightened4550 Connections between brain cells destroyed in early stages of Alzheimer’s diseaseScientists have pinpointed how connections in the brain are destroyed in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, in a study which it is hoped will help in the development of treatments for the debilitating condition. At the early stages of the development of Alzheimer’s disease the synapses – which connect the neurons in the brain – are destroyed, according to researchers at the University of New South Wales, Australia.

The tool was used to let a 28-year-old man who has been paralysed for more than a decade. While prosthetics have previously been able to be controlled directly from the brain, it is the first time that signals have been successfully sent the other way4750 Research shows that diabetes drug can be used to stop first signs of Parkinson’sScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped.

Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. 4950 NHS agree, after loosing legal battle, to fund HIV prevention drugHaving lost the legal battle over who was to pay for the drug the NHS have finally agreed to fund the HIV prevention treatment. National Aids Trust, whom Princess Diana supported, said that it was a ‘pivotal moment’.Scientists have discovered that the switch is controlled in the hypothalamus area of the brain. The switch acts on insulin receptors and involves the protein TCPTP. Scientists have discovered the switch in mice and are hopeful but yet to find out if the switch would be the same in humans.“We found that volunteerism and involvement in social organisations only accounted for a little less than one year of the longevity boost that religious affiliation provided,” said Laura Wallace, the study’s lead author.“There’s still a lot of the benefit of religious affiliation that this can’t explain.”The authors suggested that the remaining life expectancy might be a result of religious people being more likely to abstain from alcohol and drug use and other behaviours that could affect life expectancy – though these were not regularly recorded in obituaries.There also may be a benefit of “stress reducing practices” such as meditation, yoga or prayer, Dr Way added.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

New research suggests a vital link between our ability to sense our physical bodies and knowing how we feelClick to followThe Independent OnlineSuch profound problems with emotion are sometimes associated with autismStephen has been married twice. Two wedding days. Two “I do”s. Yet Stephen has no happy memories from either – or, in fact, from the marriages or any of his relationships.\u0026nbspHe met his first wife on a pre-nursing course when he was just 16. Six years later, they were married. Three years after that, they got orced she was never really the right one for him, he says.Almost two decades on, in 2009, he met his second wife through a dating site. He threw himself into the relationship and, the following year, with his father and her two adult siblings present, they married at the registrar’s office in Sheffield, where they both live.\u0026nbspHe put on smiles for the wedding photos because he recognised that they were expected but, as he explains: “From an inner feeling point of view, anything I do that requires an emotional response feels like a fake.“Most of my responses are learned responses. In an environment where everyone is being jolly and happy, it feels like I’m lying. Acting. Which I am. So it is a lie.”\u0026nbspHappiness isn’t the only emotion that Stephen struggles with. Excitement, shame, disgust, anticipation, even love… he doesn’t feel these, either. “I feel something but I’m unable to distinguish in any real way what that feeling is.” The only emotions he is familiar with are fear and anger.\u0026nbspSuch profound problems with emotion are sometimes associated with autism, which Stephen does not have, or with psychopathy, which he doesn’t have, either.Last year, at the age of 51, he finally learned what he does have: a little-known condition called alexithymia, a word made from Greek parts meaning, roughly, “no words for emotion”.Despite the name, the real problem for people with alexithymia isn’t so much that they have no words for their emotions, but that they lack the emotions themselves. Still, not everyone with the condition has the same experiences. Some have gaps and distortions in the typical emotional repertoire.Some realise they’re feeling an emotion, but don’t know which, while others confuse signs of certain emotions for something else – perhaps interpreting butterflies in the stomach as hunger pangs.\u0026nbspSurprisingly, given how generally unrecognised it is, studies show that about one in 10 people fall on the alexithymia spectrum. New research is now revealing what’s going wrong – and this work holds the promise not only of novel treatments for disorders of emotion, but of revealing just how the rest of us feel anything at all.\u0026nbspAfter working as a nurse for 10 years, Stephen decided he wanted to do something different. A two-year Access to University course led to a degree in astronomy and physics, and then to a job testing computer games.He built a successful career for himself, working for various companies in their computer testing departments, managing teams, and travelling around the world to speak at conferences. He had no problem conveying facts to colleagues.It was in the context of more personal relationships – or any other scenario that would typically involve expressions of emotion – that he felt things were “wrong”.\u0026nbsp“At the beginning of a relationship, I’m totally into who that person is,” he explains. “I’ve been told I’m very good at maintaining a honeymoon period for ‘longer than expected’. But after a year it takes a massive turn. It all falls apart. I’ve put myself on a pedestal to be this person which I’m really not. I react mostly cognitively, rather than it being emotions making me react. Obviously, that is not valid. It’s not real. It seems fake. Because it is fake. And you can only pretend for so long.”\u0026nbspHe and his current wife stopped living together in 2012. He saw a GP and was prescribed antidepressants. Though he was still in contact with his wife, it was clear that the relationship was no longer working. In June 2015, he attempted suicide.“I had actually been posting on Facebook and Twitter regarding killing myself and someone – I’ve never found out who – contacted the police. I was taken to hospital and treated.”\u0026nbspA psychiatrist referred Stephen for a series of counselling sessions and then a course of psychodynamic psychotherapy, a type of Freudian-based therapy that, in trying to uncover unconscious drivers of thoughts and behaviour, is similar to psychoanalysis.\u0026nbspIt was in a book called Why Love Matters by Sue Gerhardt, which his therapist recommended, that he first came across the concept of alexithymia.“I brought it up in therapy, and that’s when we started talking about how I was very alexithymic. Obviously, I’ve got a vocabulary. I’ve got words for emotions. But whether they’re the right words for the right emotion is a different point altogether… I just thought that I wasn’t good at talking about how I feel and emotions and stuff like that. But after a year of therapy, it became apparent that when I talk about emotions I don’t actually know what I’m talking about.”The term “alexithymic” dates from a book published in 1972 and has its origins in Freudian psychodynamic literature.Freudian ideas are now out of favour with most academic psychologists, as Geoff Bird, a professor of psychology at the University of Oxford explains. “Not to disrespect those traditions, but in the cognitive, neuro, experimental field, not so many people are really very interested in anything associated with Freud any more.”But when Bird read about alexithymia, he found the descriptions intriguing. “Actually, it’s really quite amazing.” For most people, “at a low level of emotion, you might be a bit unsure about exactly what you’re feeling, but if you have a strong emotion, you know what it is”. And yet somehow, here were people who simply did not know.\u0026nbspBird started his academic career studying autism spectrum disorder, empathy and emotional awareness, which led to his interest in alexithymia.In one of his first studies in this field, he linked alexithymia, as measured with a 20-item checklist developed at the University of Toronto, with a lack of empathy. If you can’t feel your own emotions in the typical way, it makes sense that you can’t identify with those of others, either.\u0026nbspBut what really drew Bird into alexithymia research were his interactions with people with autism. “There has been this perception that people with autism don’t have empathy. And that’s rubbish. And you can see that immediately as soon as you meet some autistic people.”In a series of studies, Bird has found that about half of people with autism have alexithymia – it’s these people who struggle with emotion and empathy, while the rest do not. In other words, emotion-related difficulties are intrinsic to the alexithymia, not to the autism.Bird is passionate about spreading this message. He talks with feeling about one particular autistic study volunteer who did not have alexithymia: “A lovely guy with an IQ we couldn’t measure, it’s that good. He couldn’t hold down a job. But he volunteered to work at a care home because he wanted to do something productive with his time.“They said, ‘Oh because you’ve got a diagnosis of autism you can’t do empathy, therefore you can’t look after our elderly people.’ Which is just ridiculous.”\u0026nbspBird has since run a series of studies exploring alexithymia outside the context of autism. He has found, for example, that people with the condition have no trouble recognising faces, or distinguishing pictures of people smiling and frowning.“But for a few of our really alexithymic people, while they can tell a smile and a frown apart, they have no idea what they are. That is really quite strange.”\u0026nbspMany of the people with the condition who Bird has met talk about being told by other people that they’re different, though some do recognise it in themselves early on.“I guess it’s a bit like not being able to see colour, and everybody’s always banging on about how red this is or how blue, and you come to realise there’s an aspect of human experience that you’re just not participating in.”As well as better characterising alexithymia, Bird and his colleagues have also dug into what explains it, taking what could seem to be a circular argument – Stephen has problems with emotion because he has alexithymia, which is characterised by problems with emotion – and blowing it right apart.In situations that Stephen recognises as being in theory highly emotional – like telling someone “I love you” – he experiences changes inside his body. “I feel my heart race and this rush of adrenaline, but to me that feeling is always scary. I don’t know how to react. It makes me want to either run away or react verbally aggressively.”\u0026nbspFear and anger – and confusion – he understands. “Everything else just feels all the same… it’s this feeling of, ‘Errrr, I’m not quite comfortable with this – it’s not quite right’.”\u0026nbsp“Similarly with anxiety, it might be that someone experiences an emotional response associated with a fast heartbeat – which might be excitement – but they don’t know how to interpret that, and they could panic about what’s happening in their body.”\u0026nbspThe ability to detect changes inside the body – everything from a racing heart to a ersion of blood flow, from a full bladder to a distension of the lungs – is known as interoception. It’s your perception of your own internal state.\u0026nbspDifferent emotions are associated with different physical changes. In anger, for example, the heart rate rises, blood rushes to the face, and fists clench. In fear, the heart rate also rises but blood drains from the face.It’s generally thought that these changes are not entirely specific to inidual emotions, and so context is also important: if you feel your heart racing and you’re looking at a spider, you know it’s fear that you’re feeling, not sexual arousal.\u0026nbspWhat Bird, Brewer and others have found in people with alexithymia is a reduced ability, sometimes a complete inability, to produce, detect or interpret these internal bodily changes. People with the condition have normal-range IQs.They can understand as well as anyone else that they’re seeing a spider, rather than an attractive potential partner. But either their brains aren’t triggering the physical changes that it seems are needed for the experience of an emotion, or other regions of their brains aren’t reading these signals properly.\u0026nbspIn 2016, Bird and Brewer, along with Richard Cook at City University in London, published a research paper that characterised alexithymia as a “generalised deficit of interoception”.Here, then, was an explanation for these people’s problems with emotion – but also, in effect, a manifesto stating that the perception of a range of bodily signals is important for the experience of emotion in the rest of us.\u0026nbspIt’s an idea that we already express in everyday language: in English, for an apology to mean anything, it has to be “heartfelt”. If you truly love someone, it’s with “all your heart”.When you’re really angry, your “blood boils”. Instead of saying that you’re anxious, you might talk about having “butterflies in your stomach” (thought to be caused by a ersion of blood flow away from the digestive system).While most people may not be familiar with alexithymia, there is a different disorder involving flat emotions and poor empathy that seems to fascinate us, even more than it repels us: psychopathy. Can we learn more about how we feel by understanding psychopaths?Lieke Nentjes is in her early thirties. She’s slender and softly spoken it’s hard to picture her spending countless hours in small rooms with incarcerated, unshackled psychopaths, including serially violent men who have committed murder.\u0026nbsp“Then he explained that he was at the end of his therapy and was ‘resocialising’ and no one would hire him because they were intimidated by him. He wasn’t really angry. He was frustrated.”While the nature of psychopathy is still debated, psychologists generally agree that it entails, among other things, a lack of empathy or guilt, shallow emotions, and antisocial behaviour – treating other people badly and, in some cases, engaging in criminal acts.\u0026nbspIt has certainly been suggested that the reason some psychopaths are able to torture or murder people is that they don’t process emotions properly – they don’t feel fear, for example, and they don’t recognise it in others.\u0026nbspNentjes is based at the University of Amsterdam. Here in the Netherlands, if a criminal is found to have a psychological condition that relates to the crime, he or she is deemed to be only partially responsible.Such criminals might spend a few years in a regular jail before being sent to a secure treatment centre, or they may be sent straight for treatment.\u0026nbspNentjes decided to assess a range of criminals from these centres and from jails to find out just how psychopathic they were (with particular attention to different aspects of psychopathy), to learn about their lives – their upbringing, and their criminal behaviour – and also to measure their interoceptive ability.\u0026nbsp“Emotion is very central when you look at psychopathy – or rather, lack of emotion,” she says. So could it be that psychopathic offenders just aren’t very in touch with their bodies?\u0026nbspIn the course of the interviews, Nentjes asked questions to probe their levels of empathy, and how much remorse they felt about what they had done to their victims. “Some were just completely honest, and would say, ‘I don’t care,’” she says.“Others who were psychopathic would say, ‘Oh, but I’m very empathic.’ They had learned the lingo to describe feelings very accurately and they could talk about compassionate, empathic feelings towards others – but then when you look at the crimes they have committed…” Her sentence trails off.\u0026nbsp“There is research finding that psychopathic offenders can describe emotions in terms of words, but they lack the inner experience of the emotion,” she adds.\u0026nbspSince assessing a person’s ability to detect a range of bodily signals is tricky, the most commonly used measures of interoceptive sensitivity are based on judgements of heart rate. One test involves asking participants to count their heartbeats over varying periods – 25 or 50 seconds, perhaps – multiple times.About 10 per cent of us are good at counting heartbeats, 5 to 10 per cent are very bad, and the rest fall somewhere in between.In another test, volunteers are played a series of beeps that are either in sync or out of sync with their heartbeat, and asked which it is. On this type of task, about 10 per cent of the general population can do it really well, and 80 per cent can’t do it at all.\u0026nbspNentjes brought the necessary equipment for the heartbeat synch task with her into the interview rooms, and took measures for 75 offenders. She found a clear link: the higher an offender’s score on the antisocial aspect of psychopathy, the poorer their performance on the heart-rate task.This does at least suggest that psychopaths who are poorer at detecting bodily signals feel less emotion and therefore less empathy for others.Psychopathic criminals are sometimes ided into the “white-collar” type, who tend to commit non-violent crimes such as fraud, and the violent type. In her interviews with this violent group, Nentjes was struck by one similarity, in particular, compared with the white-collar group.“That was their upbringing. Or rather lack of it. Emotional abuse. Sexual abuse. Neglect. A lot of physical abuse. I’ve heard people literally say that emotion is not of use to them. All they felt during their upbringing was fear.”\u0026nbspAs a child, Stephen suffered extreme emotional neglect. When he was six, his mother intentionally set fire to their home in Nottingham while she, Stephen, his younger brother and even younger sister were all inside. Fortunately, the children’s father, who had left for work, realised that he’d forgotten his packed lunch and came home.\u0026nbspLooking back, Stephen says it’s clear that his mother was suffering from post-natal depression. But she received no treatment, “and all I knew was anxiety and being worried”. After the fire, his mother went to prison. His father was a steelworker, who worked all kinds of shifts.“A neighbour contacted social services and Dad was told to sort it out or they’d take us away. None of my dad’s brothers or sisters wanted me or my brother because we were little shits. We were always in trouble. Robbing shops. All kinds of stuff. So we went into care.”\u0026nbspFor the rest of his childhood, Stephen was in and out of care homes. The only emotions he remembers feeling, even then, are fear, anger and confusion. “Christmas, birthdays, people out of the blue at care homes being nice to me… I never really got used to it. I always felt uncomfortable. There’s just a mess of feelings inside me that I don’t interpret properly, or respond to properly.”\u0026nbspAlexithymia is often associated with trauma and neglect from a young age, explains Geoff Bird. Twin studies have suggested a genetic component, too. And it’s also linked to certain types of brain damage, particularly to the insula, the region that receives interoceptive signals.\u0026nbspAs Rebecca Brewer notes, the kind of anxiety that Stephen experiences is common in people with poor interoception. At the University of Sussex, Hugo Critchley and Sarah Garfinkel, who have expertise in psychiatry and neuroscience, are looking at ways to alter interoception, to bring anxiety down.\u0026nbspGarfinkel has put forward a three-dimensional model of interoception that has been well received by others in the field. First, objective accuracy at perceiving interoceptive signals – how good you are at counting heartbeats, for example.Second, subjective report – how good you think you are. And third, metacognitive accuracy – how good you are at knowing how good you actually are.\u0026nbspThe third dimension is important because various studies have found that the gap between how good someone thinks they are at counting heartbeats, for example, and how good they actually are predicts their levels of anxiety.Lisa Quadt, a research fellow with the Sussex group, is now running a clinical trial with the aim of testing whether reducing this gap for people with autism can reduce their anxiety.In a pilot study, Critchley, Garfinkel and MSc student Abigail McLanachan recruited a group of students who came into the lab for six training sessions. In each session, they first did the heartbeat-counting task.The volunteer sat at rest, with a loose rubber pulse oximeter on their forefingers, and reported how many beats they’d counted. Then McLanachan told them how they’d done so that they got a better sense of how accurate they were.McLanachan then got them to do a few minutes of jumping jacks or walking fast up the steep hill outside the building – whatever was necessary to raise their heart rate, to make it easier to detect. (“Because some people really can’t feel their heartbeat at all. I can’t,” Quadt explains.)Then they went back into the lab, did the tasks again and, as before, were given feedback each time.\u0026nbspThis was just a pilot study on a general student population. But after three weeks, not only had the students’ accuracy improved on all three dimensions of interoception, but they also reported reductions in anxiety of around 10 per cent.\u0026nbspFor the main trial, volunteers diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder will complete the same tasks as in the pilot, but once at the start and once at the end they’ll do them inside an MRI scanner.This will allow the team to monitor activity in the insula, which receives heart-rate data, and look at how changes in that activity may correspond to connections between the amygdala, which detects threats, and the prefrontal cortex, which can work out whether a potential threat really is or is not dangerous and so whether anxiety is warranted.The hope, Critchley explains, is to see improved connectivity between these two regions, which previous studies have linked to reduced anxiety.\u0026nbspIn Oxford, meanwhile, Geoff Bird wants to look at the idea that there are two different types of alexithymia. People with one type don’t produce enough of the bodily signals necessary for the experience of an emotion, so would be unlikely to benefit from the Sussex group’s kind of training.People with the other type produce all kinds of bodily sensations but their brains don’t process these signals in the typical way. This second group, which includes Stephen, might benefit more.\u0026nbspBird stresses that, although people with alexithymia struggle to understand emotion, that doesn’t mean they don’t care about other people. “For the most part, iniduals with alexithymia can recognise that others are in a negative state, and this makes them distressed.“The problem is that they can’t work out what the other person is feeling, and what they are feeling, and therefore how to make the other person feel better or how to reduce their own distress. I think that’s important because alexithymia is different from psychopathy in that respect.”Stephen says that for him, this is certainly true. And in theory, an emotional training technique is something he would welcome. “I’ve got several books about emotions and feelings and they don’t make a jot of difference because they’re not talking specifically enough about what you actually feel within your body is which emotion.”\u0026nbspFor now, given the absence of available treatments for alexithymia, Stephen plans to use his newfound understanding of himself, gained through therapy, to try to move forwards. At first, he says, he hoped that therapy would fix everything.“I thought every day would be perfect, brilliant… and I’ve come to realise that’s not going to happen. I’m always going to have problems, always going to have issues.”\u0026nbspHe’s learned valuable lessons, he says. Though he and his wife are still separated, they talk regularly and now he tries not to reject her views on his anxiety. “Rather than go, ‘No,’ I will listen. I think, ‘Well, you know what emotions are about and I don’t, so I’m going to listen to you and I’ll either take it on board or I’ll find a way to deal with it’.”He’s also thinking about moving to work with people who are struggling with substance abuse, because he’d like to be back in a career where he can help people.\u0026nbspMost of all, he’s determined to use his diagnosis of alexithymia. “For me, it empowers me – now I know about it, I can read about it. I can find out more about it. And I can develop certain tools that enable me to combat it.”Nutritionist reveals truth about health benefits of soya foodsWhen kids run for 15 minutes in school every day, here’s what happens How the military is helping tackle mental health problems Graphic cigarette-style health warnings also effective on sugary drinkPeople without alexithymia could probably use such tools as well. Bird has led work showing that people who are more aware of their own heartbeat are better able to recognise others’ emotions, a crucial first step in being empathetic.He’s planning studies to investigate whether heartbeat training might therefore increase empathy.\u0026nbspThose who want to reduce feelings of stress and anxiety in daily life, but who either can’t or don’t want to change the sources of stress, could focus on changing the signals coming from their bodies instead.Regular physical exercise should dampen down the kinds of bodily signals (from the heart and circulation, for example) that the brain could interpret as being anxious – so it should dampen down feelings of anxiety, too.\u0026nbspKnowing that signals from our bodies underpin our emotions could be empowering for all of us.

Flat desert on either side, a few lights.\u0026nbspThe Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta passed this way on camel back in 1326, and wrote of its emphatic wilderness: “He who enters it is lost and he who leaves it is born.”Before mass tourism ruined them for a second time, I’d travelled to the so-called “lost” cities of Petra, Machu Picchu and Angkor Wat.\u0026nbspMy destination tonight was the isolated sandstone valley eulogised by Charles Doughty, the first European to enter it\u0026nbspin 1876, as “the fabulous Mada’in Saleh\u0026nbspwhich I was come from far countries to seek in Arabia”.The prospect of following in Doughty’s flapping shadow gave me a jolt of anticipation that I hadn’t experienced since my twenties.\u0026nbspDoughty’s classic book Arabia Deserta was championed by his friend TE\u0026nbspLawrence, who later used it as a military textbook, as the greatest record of adventure and travel in our language.It begins with Doughty trying to smuggle himself into Mada’in Saleh in the guise of a poor Syrian pilgrim.\u0026nbspEven up until recently few Europeans have visited this cradle of forgotten civilisations, which, though designated a World Heritage Site in 2008, remains a blank page on the archaeological record, closed off by geography, politics, religion.“Visitors last year from abroad? I can say zero,” my guide Ahmed tells me.Mada\u0027in\u0026nbspSaleh\u0026nbspnear Al-Ula\u0026nbsphave survived for 2,000 yearsThis is set to change. Last July, under the impetus of Saudi Arabia’s progressive new Crown Prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, or “MBS” as he is popularly known, a Royal Commission took charge of Mada’in Saleh and its surrounds – “the only crown jewel of a site the country possesses,” says one of the archaeologists recruited to excavate it.In December, public access was halted first in order to survey what actually is there, next to develop a strategy for protecting it, and then to open up Mada’in Saleh to the outside world. My advance visit is aimed at providing an amuse-bouche, as it were.In the bright morning sunlight, Ahmed escorts me through locked gates, past the German-built railway-line linking Damascus with Medina, which Lawrence bombed (“there are still local tribes which call their sons Al-Orans”), to the celebrated Nabatean rock tombs.Doughty first heard about these in Petra, 300 miles north. Fifty years earlier, an awe-struck British naval commander had gazed in disbelief at Petra’s imperishable Treasury, murmuring, as many continue to do: “There is nothing in the world that resembles it.” He was wrong.If a little less rosier than her sister city, Mada’in Saleh shares her capacity to stagger.\u0026nbspOut of the flat desert, one after another, the ornate facades rise into sight, 111 of them, carved into perpendicular cliffs up to four storeys high, their low doorways decorated by Alexandrian masons in the first century AD, with Greek triangles, Roman pilasters, Persian flowers, Egyptian sphinxes, birds.“This is a twin to Petra,” Ahmed says. Except that in Petra we would be bobbing among crowds.Ahmed\u0026nbspis descended from a long line of imamsStanding in reverent silence, with the valley to ourselves, I recall how the Victorian artist who supplied the first images of Petra to the world, David Roberts, responded to that other city. “I turned from it at length with an impression which will be effaced only by death.”These tombs were carved for the Nabatean tribes who ruled this region for 300 years until the Romans annexed them in 106AD. Nomads who had settled and grown wealthy, the Nabateans controlled the lucrative spice route from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea.Then, like the civilisations they’d replaced, the Dedanites, the Lihyanites, the Thamuds, they galloped off into obscurity. Their tombs were looted: the acacia doors plundered for firewood, the marble statues melted to make lime for plaster, the porphyry urns smashed.All that survives of their caravan city, Hegra, is a flat expanse behind a wire fence: “her clay-built streets are again the blown dust in the wilderness,” Doughty wrote.The same desolation holds true for the still more ancient Biblical city of Dedan, situated on the lip of an oasis a few minutes drive way. To visit both sites is to gain the sense of a narrative even now being worked out.\u0026nbspUntil the 20th\u0026nbspcentury the story of these civilisations was scrawled on the rocks in Nabatean or Thamudic script. Ahmed leads me between two steep cliffs to the oldest inscription, written 6,000 years ago.Tombs in Mada\u0027in Saleh were decorated by Alexandrian masons in the first century with Greek, Roman and Persian symbolsThe ancient Biblical city of Dedan is situated on the lip of an oasisCliffs formed out of red and black sandstone have eroded into crazy, hallucinatory shapes such as elephants, mushrooms, and sealsAncient Dedan inscriptions.

Ahmed could be speaking of the cavity in the historical record when he says, “They were making sacrifices to one god, Dhu-Ghaibat, which means ‘the one who is absent’.”Out in the desert, the wind has chiselled its own mysterious deities and hieroglyphs. The scene is stunning. In Petra, which forms part of the same massif, David Roberts threw away his pencil in despair at being able to convey it, believing that the ruins “sink into insignificance when compared with these stupendous rocks”.It’s hard to disagree. Cliffs formed out of red and black sandstone have eroded into crazy, hallucinatory shapes: elephants, mushrooms, braying seals. If they were transcribed into music, it would be Wagnerian.They make you believe in mountain gods, I tell Ahmed, who smiles. “I never try smoking weed, but when I hear someone react, I feel like that. It makes you high, naturally.”For sheer high spirits, no one yields to the British archaeologist I meet that night. Jamie Quartermain is part of an international team employed since March to survey these sites.A surveyor who pioneered the use of drones, Quartermain says: “We’ve been wanting to get involved here, but Saudi has been a closed shop, a completely untapped reserve.The perception is that it’s big, open desert. When I tried to find out anything about it, there was essentially one book. The discovery that there are so many archaeological sites is a big shock for most people. It was a big shock for me.”Advised by the Royal Commission to expect 450 unexcavated sites, Quartermain estimates the truer number between 6,000-10,000.\u0026nbsp“The survival of the archaeology is remarkable, some of the best condition remains I’ve ever seen. We’re not finding it close to the surface, it’s above surface, well and truly visible.”Dedan\u0026nbspinscriptions. Holes in the rock floor denote a sacrificial spot from the time of the DedanitesDeploying a drone, he has begun creating a three-dimensional textural surface of the area. Already, what he has found is ground-breaking. “You can see all the archaeology jumping out and biting you on the bottom.”When, aged 20, I visited Petra, sleeping in one of the caves, I talked to the head of the Bdoul tribe, allegedly descendants of the Nabateans, who told me: “We have a saying that the more wealth you have, the more brain cells you need to be able to cope with it.What impresses about MBS’s plan for Mada’in Saleh is his determination to use his nation’s resources to avoid the pitfalls of Petra.“Wadi Rum is pretty disastrous,” says Chris Tuttle, an American archaeologist seconded to the project. Tuttle spent many years excavating in Petra. He saw at first hand the ruinous impact of tourism, both on the ruins and the local community.By contrast, in Al-Ula, the local town for Mada’in Saleh, there has been a concerted drive to educate the locals, giving scholarships to 150 children, but also to attract experts armed with the latest methodolOne reason for the blankness on Saudi Arabia’s archaeological map, says Tuttle, has been the resistance of conservative religious leaders to question their history. “You don’t need to study the past when you’ve been given a manual from God.”Suddenly, a multi-thousand-year-old story has become an open book, not a closed one, and the revelation it contains could be a complex of sites more significant even than Petra.\u0026nbspMy guide Ahmed Alimam is a perfect representative of Al-Ula’s past and future. He comes from a long line of imams descended from a grand tribal judge who arrived c1400 in Al Ula’s “old town”Abandoned in 1983, the year of Ahmed’s birth, this haunting labyrinth of mud houses and twisting streets replaced Dedan and Hegra. It was built using stones from those cities. They can be seen fortifying the occasional doorway.Ahmed leads the way down an empty street to the house where his parents used to live – collapsed beams, upturned crates. He shows me the mosque, erected over the spot where the Prophet Mohammed stopped in 630AD, and with a goat bone drew in the sand the direction of Medina Ahmed’s uncle was the last imam.Iranians are angry with Israel and Saudi Arabia, not just TrumpSaudi Arabia to build giant $9bn oil complex with French company TotalSaudis \u0027to cut off Qatar\u0027 with canal, nuclear dump and military baseSaudi Arabian Prince toured Hollywood and Harvard on trip to USAnd a modern inscription: the name “Charles”, scratched on the oat-coloured mud wall not, as momentarily I’d hoped, by Charles Doughty, but by Prince Charles (in 2015, with his key), and below it the Islamic translation.During the Islamic period, Al-Ula, or El-Ally as Doughty knew it, became an important station on the haj road south, and marked the last place where Christians were permitted to travel.\u0026nbspIbn Battuta described how pilgrim caravans paused here for four days to resupply and wash, and to leave any excess baggage with the townspeople “who are known for their trustworthiness”.“I hope we are still doing our best to be like that,” Ahmed says. “You can try, if you want, to leave something.”The only thing I left behind after my four days here was an urge to come back.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

For the likes of us the mere thought is unspeakably dreary.”In another passage, he describes “bandit-like filthy Levantines” who board his ship during a stop at Port Said, Egypt.“In the harbour, a swarm of rowing boats with screaming and gesticulating Levantines of every shade, who lunge at our ship. As if spewed from hell,” he wrote.Ze’ev Rosenkranz, the book’s editor and assistant director of the Einstein Papers Project at the California Institute of Technology, told : “I think a lot of comments strike us as pretty unpleasant – what he says about the Chinese in particular.“They’re kind of in contrast to the public image of the great humanitarian icon. I think it’s quite a shock to read those and contrast them with his more public statements. They’re more off guard, he didn’t intend them for publication.”In his preface to The Travel Diaries of Albert Einstein, Mr Rosenkranz says the diaries exhibit a “quirky style” and “acerbic quips” but also contain some “troublesome entries”.“I began to ask myself: how could this humanist icon be the author of such passages?” Mr Rosenkranz writes.He adds it “seems clear that Einstein has bought - to some extent - into the perceived threat of ‘the yellow peril’,” referring to the racist colonial trope that the people of East Asia were a threat to the western world.Chanda Prescod-Weinstein, the\u0026nbspcosmologist, science writer and equality campaigner, said Einstein’s racism was “shocking and disappointing”.Even Einstein couldn\u0027t think of a peace planLegendary physicist Albert Einstein left letters that reveal his thoughts on the relationship between Arabs and JewsThe correspondence also includes a letter from Einstein’s former lover, Betty NeumannDuring the British mandate, Einstein engaged“I am both surprised and not surprised,” she tweeted. “Scientific ‘advance’\u0026nbspreally does not go in tandem with social advances. Sometimes scientific success drags racism along with its interlocutors.”Einstein toured Asia after being invited to speak in Japan shortly after being awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in 1921.By contrast to his prejudice against the Chinese, Einstein speaks positively of the Japanese, who he praises as “unostentatious, decent, altogether very appealing”.His diaries from the period have previously only been published in German as part of the 15-volume Collected Papers of Albert Einstein.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The sighting means\u0026nbspEid can begin.The holiday, considered one of the most important in the Islamic faith, has its own particular set of prayers, which Muslims will recite in congregation often in parks, community centres or at mosques.The exact dates of Ramadan and, in turn, Eid, vary\u0026nbspfrom one year to another on the Gregorian calendar.\u0026nbspThis year, Eid-al-Fitr could take place on 15 June, if the sighting of the crescent moon is made on the evening of 14 June.The festival is a day when Muslims thank Allah for strength and blessings, hoping Ramadan has brought them closer to god. It was first celebrated by Muhammad in 624CE\u0026nbspfollowing a victory in battle.A wide variety of practices take place during Eid, the first of which is a special set of prayers saved only for the occasion, known as Salat al-Eid.Muslims will generally gather at mosque or in open-air locations to carry out prayers on the first morning of the festival before sitting down with family and friends for breakfast, their first daylight meal in a month.Gatherings will take place in public areas across the UK to celebrate Eid, including in Trafalgar Square in central London, while up to 150,000 are expected to celebrate in\u0026nbspBirmingham’s Small Heath Park.In pictures: The first day of RamadanTurkish anti goverment protesters gather as they break their first day of fasting for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan on Istiklal street in IstanbulA man sells prayer caps at his shop in Chaman, PakistanStudents sit in circles during a Quran recital class on the first day of the holy fasting month of RamadanAfghan children read and memorise the Koran at a mosque in Jalalabad Mosque workers prepare food for distribution to the poor and Muslims who come to break their fast at Noor Mosque in Nairobi, KenyaA Lebanese man prays at a mosque in Beirut, LebanonAnother important Eid tradition is the Zakat al-Fitr – charity given to the poor at the end of Ramadan.The donation is aimed at providing the needy with enough so they too can join in the feast and celebrate the breaking of the fast, but can be donated to help the poor or the needy in general.\u0026nbspDuring Ramadan 2016, British Muslims were estimated by the Charity Commission to have given £371 each to charity on average.Eid al-Fitr should not be confused with Eid al-Adha, the 10th day of the final month of the Islamic calendar and the holiest of all Muslim holidays, when Muslims from around the world will travel to Mecca for pilgrimage.\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

From January to October 2017, 40 per cent of those affected by late payments waited in total around 11 weeks or more, and 20 per cent waited almost five months.\u0026nbspDespite improvements,\u0026nbspin March\u0026nbsp21 per cent of new claimants still did not receive their full entitlement on time, with 13 per cent receiving no payment on time.The\u0026nbspNAO\u0026nbspalso accuses\u0026nbspthe government of not showing sufficient sensitivity towards some claimants and failing to monitor how many claimants are having problems with the programme, or have suffered hardship.The report reveals\u0026nbspincreases in rent arrears had been\u0026nbspreported by local authorities, housing associations and landlords\u0026nbspin areas where universal\u0026nbspcredit had been introduced, with some private landlords telling\u0026nbspthe NAO they have become reluctant to rent to claimants.In three of the four areas the NAO visited, and for which data was available, the use of food banks increased more rapidly after the full service was rolled out to the area.A\u0026nbsppoll for\u0026nbspThe Independent revealed last week\u0026nbspthat\u0026nbspnearly 4 million adults had been forced to use food banks,\u0026nbspwith similar numbers also forced to skip meals and borrow money as austerity measures leave them “penniless with nowhere to turn”.The report states that, despite the problems, returning to the old system would now be “so complex and costly” that there was no real alternative but to continue with universal credit.Amyas Morse, head of the NAO, said: “The Department for Work and Pensions has kept pushing the universal credit rollout forward through a series of problems. We recognise both its determination and commitment, and that there is really no practical choice but to keep on keeping on with the rollout.“We don’t think the\u0026nbspDWP has shown the same commitment to listening and responding to the hardship faced by claimants.\u0026nbspWe think the larger claims for universal credit, such as boosted employment, are unlikely to be demonstrable at any point in future. Nor for that matter will value for money.”Meg Hillier MP, chair of the public accounts committee, said: “The government’s introduction of universal credit has been one long catalogue of delay, with huge impact on people’s lives.“After eight years’ work and £1.3bn spent on the project, not even 10 per cent of claimants have transferred. Many who have moved are suffering hardship but the\u0026nbspDWP does not accept it is at fault.“The DWP needs to wake up and understand what is going so wrong before future claimants share a similar fate.”Children’s charities warned many families on low incomes had been left struggling to keep their heads above water, while offering “little or no value for money” to the taxpayer.Alison Garnham, chief executive of Child Poverty Action Group,\u0026nbspsaid yesterday: “The picture the NAO presents is justifiably bleak. On the ground, new claimants can’t even be sure they will be paid in full and on time.\u0026nbspAnd how many people will be helped into work by the benefit is far from clear.\u0026nbsp”Today’s report must give ministers pause for thought.\u0026nbspWill the government press on with a programme that is demonstrably failing – causing financial misery for families – or will it restore the money that’s been taken out of universal credit in an effort to rehabilitate it for struggling families?“Anthony Painter, director of action and research at the Royal Society of Arts, said universal credit had failed on its own terms and a “radical rethink” was required to mitigate the “very real harmful impacts” of the social security benefit.“It promised to be easier to deliver but is proving an administrative nightmare, and most importantly\u0026nbspit promised to be much more humane but has led to delays, debt\u0026nbspand destitution,” he said.A DWP spokesman said: “Previous administrations poured billions into an outdated system with a complex myriad of benefits, which locked some people into cycles of welfare dependency.\u0026nbspWhereas we are building a benefit system fit for the 21st century, providing flexible, person-centred support, with evidence showing universal credit claimants getting into work faster and staying in work longer.“Universal credit is good value for money and is forecast to realise a return on investment of £34bn over 10 years against a cost of £2bn, with 200,000 more people in work.\u0026nbspFurthermore, 83 per cent of claimants are satisfied with the service and the majority agree that it ‘financially motivates’ them to work.“As the NAO acknowledges, we have made significant improvements to universal credit as part of our ‘listen and learn’ approach to its rollout, and it’s on track to be in all job centres nationally by the end of 2018.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

She has previously told The Independent she\u0026nbspwants to keep Britain in the customs union and single market, a stance which could put her at odds with Jeremy Corbyn.Labour retained a majority of 5,629, far below the 21,213 won by Heidi Alexander in the 2017 general election.

I will consider people\u0027s jobs, the economy and people\u0027s rights and that will dictate to me the precedent in how I will conduct myself both within Parliament and out of Parliament.Grenfell represents everything wrong with country, says CorbynCorbyn suffers biggest Brexit rebellion as six frontbenchers resignLabour MP Heidi Alexander resigns to become London deputy mayorLeaving Europe \u0027could slash billions from NHS budget\u0027Janet Daby wins Labour candidacy for Lewisham East byelectionMs Daby faced stiff competition to be on the Labour ticket from Lewisham’s powerful branch of the pro-Corbyn movement Momentum. Asked if she would clash with the party leader over Brexit, she pointed out that she had voted for Mr Corbyn at two Labour leadership elections.“Obviously within politics not everybody will agree on everything,” she said. “For me it\u0027s about ensuring that we have as close a relationship to the EU as possible and that\u0027s what I\u0027ll be arguing for and that\u0027s what I\u0027ll be putting forward my views on.”Despite the victory, there will be concerning signs for the party in Ms Daby’s vote share of 50.2 per cent - down from the 67.9 per cent won by Ms Alexander in 2017, when turnout was 69.3 per cent.The Lib Dems heralded the nearly 19 per cent swing to them from Labour, as well as the collapse in Conservative support, as showing who “the real opposition here” was.Brexit: 10 of the most ridiculous headlinesThis wholly false headline merited the first ruling by IPSO (the press regulator) under clause 1 of the revised Editor\u0027s Code of Practice. Clause 1  makes specific reference to newspapers printing headlines not supported by the textIn perhaps the most notorious front page of the past few years, the Mail derides the High Court judges who ruled that parliament must have a vote on whether to trigger article 50 and start the Brexit processIn the Express\u0027 take on the same story, they manage to incorporate the Union Jack, allude to First World War propaganda, invoke memories of Churchill and, of course, state Brexit means BrexitThe Sun marked the day on which Mrs May triggered article 50 by projecting a huge and terrible pun on to the Cliffs of DoverReferencing their notorious eurosceptic headline from 1990 (See: Up Yours Delors), the Sun stokes the flames of the brief Gibraltar dispute, a dispute in which Spain, the supposed aggressors, only joined to note that there was no need for itThis headline followed Mrs May\u0027s snap election announcement, which gave the Mail hope that dissenting opinions on Brexit would disappearIn recent months, the Mail has often forgone catchy headlines in favour of rambling rants, this is an early example aimed at Tory Brexit rebelsThis headline (?) takes aim at the Lords over their repeated amendments to the EU Withdrawal BillOn the day that the EU Withdrawal Bill is to be debated in the Commons, the Sun offers two choices to MPs, desperately including all conceivable imagery that might make Brits feel patriotic, which apparently includes the Loch Ness MonsterOn the same day, the Express lets MPs know what the consequences of the vote may beTheir candidate, Lucy Salek, said the by-election was “about recognising that the people have a final say on Brexit”. She said: “We have turned around a massive increase in our vote share. We\u0027re back and people are starting to notice.”Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, said the result “sends a message to the Labour leadership that it cannot take pro-European voters for granted”.He said: “This is the largest swing from Labour to the Liberal Democrats in over a decade and the failure of Labour\u0027s leadership to oppose the Conservatives\u0027 hard Brexit cannot be hidden or forgotten.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The most dangerous would be a mortal blow to the Government’s negotiating hand and could trigger a new election.Another one on Wednesday would be a giant step towards shackling ourselves forever inside an EU customs union, without any power over its decisions. That’s the worst possible Brexit, a catastrophe.Monday nights fudge between the two wings of the Tory party is still a risk — and merely postpones an inevitable showdown next month.In the end MPs must have faith in our great country, our extraordinary talent and our ability to thrive outside the EU. And, if they respect the democracy that has put them where they are, they must trust the decision we took.Todays “meaningful vote” amendment, if passed, would wreck the Government’s negotiating position in Brussels. That is already weak enough... Theresa May has made far too many compromises and is doing far too little to prepare Britain for a “no deal”. But this new move would be deadly.It would enable Parliament to reject any deal we strike with Brussels and force the Government to go back and keep negotiating. It would strip Mrs May of the power to walk away.The EU could offer us a derisory and punitive deal knowing Parliament had compelled the Government to accept it in the end. It would be like haggling with a used car salesman who knows you have to pay whatever he wants.The diehard Remainers running an orchestrated, multi-million pound campaign to keep Britain in the EU are relying on this vote to upend the process. It could trigger a second referendum or an election which Corbyn’s Marxist wrecking crew could win.Tory rebels must have nothing to do with it. It is their duty to give the Government the strongest possible hand in negotiating our exit and a future trade deal.Another vote on Wednesday seeks to push us into a restrictive customs union with the EU. That would place us permanently and powerlessly under Brussels’ control — with no say over it, nor any ability to sign our own deals around the world.Free trade with America, China, India, Australia, Canada and New Zealand? Forget it.Remain-backing MPs pretend this — and staying in the single market — represent “soft Brexit”, a compromise to reflect that 48 per cent voted Remain. But they are fatal to Brexit and they know it.Either would be a far worse deal than we have had before. They are a ruse to engineer a new vote to stay in.We get that Europhile MPs hate Brexit. But they are there to represent their voters, not advance personal agendas.For some Tories and many Labour MPs the decision should be blindingly obvious: their own constituencies voted Leave. The manifestos on which they then stood for election last year promised to leave both the single market and customs union.Do they seriously believe it right to betray their voters and their own doorstep promises?Most people are too busy to follow the daily ins and outs as the Brexit debate grinds on. Outside the London political bubble, they imagine it’s done and dusted. They just want to get on with leaving. And in full.It has barely occurred to them that many politicians never accepted the result, have waged war on it relentlessly and are closer than ever to victory.Imagine the explosion of anger if that happens. If, today or next month, Tory Remainers vote with Labour’s opportunists to defy the biggest democratic mandate in British history. If MPs, having approved the EU Withdrawal Bill once already, back wrecking amendments drafted by unelected peers bent on destroying Brexit.That rage won’t even be limited to Leavers. Many Remainers also consider it vital to fulfil the result of the vote in full. They know staying in the single market or customs union is not leaving. It is a suicidal, half-baked Brexit.Why would anyone trust our democracy again if we took such a course, in defiance of the referendum result?The Sun understands the Tory rebels’ fears for the economy and jobs post-Brexit. We believe we may well be in for a rocky ride short-term, before the longer-term benefits pan out.But everyone should read the authoritative view from ex-Aussie Prime Minister Tony Abbott — who initially backed Remain but is brimming with confidence over what he considers a golden opportunity for this country, even if we never strike any deal with Brussels.The Sun understands, too, the worries many Remainers have that Britain could become less ­liberal, less open and more prejudiced against foreign migrants after Brexit. We whole-heartedly believe that’s unfounded.Brits are becoming MORE welcoming, secure now in the knowledge we are at last about to get the same control over numbers every non-EU country enjoys.On these two ​vital days for Brexit — and further votes next month — The Sun says this to backbench Tories: Have faith in the people of Britain.They made the right decision on Brexit and they will make it work... if you allow your Government to give them the chance.THE most Eurosceptic people in Britain are calling on Theresa May to make good on her promise that Brexit means Brexit.The Lincolnshire town’s Tory MP Matt Warman was a Remainer but now advocates a “clean break” from Europe in agreement with 74.9 per cent of his constituents.Office worker Beverly Iles, 67, said: “We should have come straight out. We shouldn’t be still messing about with all this.”Retired council worker Brian Isam, 75, said: “We don’t need soft Brexit. We didn’t pay Europe a penny when we went in and we should not pay them a penny to get out.”THE people of Hull want Theresa May to wave goodbye to the Eurocrats now.In the East Yorkshire city, the leave vote was 68 per cent, although Labour MP Karl Turner was a Remainer.Happy Cakes manager Debbie Scaife, 56, said uncertainty had driven up the price of ingredients.She added: “Mrs May, I call on you to do this for us now.“The British public voted to leave. They didn’t want five years of hell.”Retailer Vicky Paddey, 37, said: “I voted for Brexit and I’m proud to say that — it was what people wanted then and they still want it now. If we end up with a soft Brexit, a lot of these shops in this city centre will not survive it.”IN the North East, some impatient voters are calling for dithering Mrs May to go.Voters in Gateshead went 56.8 per cent in favour of leaving in 2016, against the wishes of Labour MP Ian Mearns.Florist Dawn Athey, 41, said: “I think Theresa May should resign.“She’s not the person I thought she was going to be.“I think she’s scared of being the Prime Minister who’s going to take us out of the EU.”And Jude Ditchburn, 51, from Gateshead, said: “I think she is betraying the country and not doing what people want.FORMER Tory Cabinet minister Nicky Morgan is a leading Remoaner — but in her Leicestershire constituency people want to get on with Brexit.The area voted 50.1 per cent in favour of leaving the EU.Brexit backer Andrew Cooper, 56, said: “They are dragging their feet, the people have voted for this and they need to do what the people asked them to do.”Cedric Hewitt, 90, said: “I think Theresa May ought to get her finger out and get on with it. It’s what the British people wanted.”And David Greasley, 85, a former quality control engineer, said: “I voted out and simply want out.”HARD Brexit opponent and Conservative MP Anna Soubry wants Britain to be shackled with a customs union.Now, they want her party to carry out their wishes.Ray James, 82, and Elsie James, 80, said: “We think the Government are failing to get things sorted. It is taking a long, long time and no people thought it would take this long.”John Wilson, 68, said the Government was clueless on disentangling from the single market. “It has become a shambles,” he added.TOTNES MP Sarah Wollaston switched sides during the referendum campaign and became a Remainer.But she is out of step with her Devon constituency, where 53.9 per cent voted in favour of leaving the EU.Christine Williams, 64, said she was disappointed with Dr Wollaston.“I don’t know if I can now vote for her in the next election,” she added.Butcher Chris McCabe, 70, blamed Theresa May for the slow progress.He said: “This is like the Champions League final and we are at half-time.“She still has a chance but she needs to get her team in order so they can go back out and win this.”WHILE the capital was the heartland of Remain, in Bromley, South London, there was a paper-thin majority of 50.6 per cent in favour of staying in the EU. Tory MP Bob Neill is a Remainer.Gardener David Alden, 52, said: “It’s been dragged out for a reason. They know how to grind people down and tire them out. The elites want one thing and try any way to get it. They want to stop Brexit.”Retired software developer Steve Johnson, 58, said: “They are trying to come up with these fudges — ways to try to renege on the will of the people without outwardly doing so.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A Brexit that leaves it half in, half out and subject to EU rules it has no say over would be a disaster but that’s what seeking a deal at any price will lead to.As one of Britain’s many friends abroad, please accept my assurance that you don’t need a customs union to prosper.Without being in a customs union with Europe, and without any free trade deal with it, Australia does nearly $100billion a year in trade with Europe.In the two years of my prime minister-ship, Australia finalised free trade deals with our three biggest export markets: China, Japan and South Korea.So my advice to Britain is: Stop fretting! It IS possible to trade successfully under the WTO rules which already govern 55 per cent of Britain’s exports and it IS possible to do good deals with your main trading partners once you are free to do so, as Australia’s experience abundantly demonstrates.Let’s say, out of spite, the EU refuses to offer Britain a satisfactory bargain.Britain already imports goods from Europe free of tariffs and quotas. Britain already recognises European standards and credentials. Just declare that you will continue to do so.Trade from Europe to Britain would be absolutely free. And even if the Europeans — in an attempt to hurt Britain that would actually damage them — apply the same tariffs to Britain as they do to the US, the fall in the Pound would make British exports at least as competitive in Europe as they are now.Britain should still be the best place from which to export to Europe or to service Europe — because it has the freest markets, a can-do culture and will no longer have EU officials trying to harmonise away its competitive advantage.No new Brussels directives will apply in the UK. British courts will no longer be subject to European ones. And Britain need no longer admit everyone with an EU passport.Importantly, Britain will be able to strike trade deals with anyone it chooses without waiting for 27 other countries to sign up too.The coming Britain-Australia Free Trade Agreement should mean a dramatic increase in trade opportunities between our two countries without disadvantaging anyone else.First, there should be no tariffs or quotas on any goods traded between our two countries — there should be no exceptions, no carve outs, nothing. And second, there should be full recognition of each country’s credentials and standards.Because Australia and Britain are like-minded countries with similar systems and comparable standards of living, there should be no need for tortuous negotiation and labyrinthine detail.After all, Brit and Australian workers enjoy similar protections in the workplace: So why should they need elaborate protections against each other?Britain and Australia have comparable attitudes to job qualifications and product and service standards, so why should British rules be insufficient for Australia and vice versa?And Britons and Australians already have more than 200 years’ experience of each other, so why not allow them more freely to travel and work in each other’s country?This could be a template for the trade deals Britain could swiftly do with New Zealand and Singapore.On a similar basis, Britain could seek to join NAFTA, (North American Free Trade Agreement) which could become the North Atlantic Free Trade Area — and perhaps open to other free market economies seeking to escape the regulatory restraints and statism of the EU.Brexit could begin a process leading to genuinely freer global trade, rather than protectionist trade blocs.Brexit is a wonderful opportunity for Britain and the wider world — if only British leaders are prepared to make the most of it.So go for it Britain, for all our sakes!Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

An endless, choking diet of documentaries, live events, lectures, news items and outright bollockings, from the BBC, all to celebrate the 100th anniversary of women getting the vote.Not one of which had as much impact as Love Island’s “Girl Power” task on ITV2, involving super-hero capes, bikinis, large items of fruit and narrator Iain Stirling explaining: “The girls will squish melons with their bums. Slowest girl to crush her melon is out of the contest.”Just part of the reason I adore a show which pricks pomposity and political correctness like ­nothing else on British television and is dedicated to no other purpose than entertaining its viewers. That’s the ideal, anyway.The reality’s been a bit more disappointing, so far, probably due to the excessive hype and sense of deja vu with contestants on either half of the gender divide.Both operate a squad rotation system, of course, but among the main players on the blokes’ side, we have painfully shy ­doctor Alex, with all the presence of a fire extinguisher, Jack who “got his teeth in Turkey”, possibly by ripping them from a feral mountain goat’s mouth, and this year’s comedy figure Niall, who’s “an investment for the future”, a bit like Betamax video tapes, and “multi-layered”, like a landfill site.Click here to play our Love Island games - and win a £10,000 holiday for you and three friendsThere’s the compulsory personal trainer, as well, of course — Adam, who seems to have the run of the females, plus strong silent type Wes and fluffy-haired Eyal, pronounced “Eeeeh-al”, “Oooh-all”, or just “Aaaah-sole”, if you prefer.Quite the ­profound one, is Eyal, forever banging on about “auras” and his spirituality while insisting: “I want to find someone here with depth.”A claim which, surely, represents the very height of human optimism given the most profound question all of the girls were asking last week was: “Where’s your head at?”In Kendall’s case, it was “literally all over the place”. One of her eyes was in Majorca, another in Ibiza and her ­forehead was somewhere in the Cote d’Azur. She’s gone though now, leaving, among significant others: Samira, Georgia, Rosie, super- manipulative Hayley and Laura, a former air stewardess who’s ­covered in more make-up than the giraffe in a theatre ­production of The Lion King.Most of the hype, however, has centred around the ­presence of Dani Dyer, the daughter of EastEnders actor Danny Dyer. But you knew that already, didn’t you, possibly because you read it in the paper and possibly because you saw her perform exactly the same big reveal on ITV2’s Survival Of The Fittest a couple of months ago. A doubling up that blows my mind, frankly.Because you expect hit shows to be copied by other fringe channels.What you don’t expect is ITV2 to abuse the basic law of ­supply and demand by copying its own format. A move that doesn’t help Love Island at all. It stops it being an event, in fact, and just makes viewers think this sort of crap is on all year.Personally, I think that’s a shame. Love Island genuinely deserves to be a huge success again. Not only is it one of the funniest and most UN-PC shows on TV, it’s also a series that can actually make you feel glad to be old and half-crippled by your medical complaints, rather than the youthful insecurity and stupidity which has gripped this bunch, who really did surpass themselves, on Friday.Georgia: “What do you think of Brexit?”Hayley: “What’s that?”“We’re leaving the EU so things like welfare and, like, things we trade with would all be cut down.”“So that means we wouldn’t have any trees?”“Cheese?” “No, trees.” “Oh.”Emmeline Pankhurst, your work here on Earth was not in vain.(Love Island, ITV2, 9pm).HAVING discovered Danny Dyer is the rightful heir to the English throne, BBC1 really should’ve knocked it on the head with Who Do You Think You Are?Until such time as one of the researchers can prove Danniella Westbrook is the rightful heir to the Romanov dynasty and the Imperial Highness of all Russia.So they must have been flipping cartwheels at HQ when they discovered the great-great-grandmother of this week’s guest, ex-Corrie star Michelle Keegan had her birth certificate signed by registrar Emmeline Pankhurst, leader of the Suffragettes.A much greater honour, in the Beeb’s book, than three wise men and some shepherds turning up at your crib, but a detail that was probably as dull as ditch water for most viewers.The far more interesting thing to emerge during the hour, I thought, was Michelle’s own staggering ignorance of life, the world and everything.She had, for instance, no idea where Genoa was and gave a genuinely staggering response when a local historian told her: “By 1940 your family will have been torn apart, like every other family in Gibraltar, at the time.”“Why?”(Pause) “The Second World War.”You wondered then if the show would ever get round to revealing if the plank gene had entered her family tree through the maternal or paternal line.Then Michelle Skyped her mum and, waving a frothy cup of coffee at the screen, said: “Guess where I am. I’ll give you a clue, I’m drinking a cappuccino . . . ”“France?”Mystery solved.Loose Women, Russell Brand, with Janet Street-Porter: “Everyone is so beautiful here.”Good Morning Britain, roly-poly Piers Morgan: “When I grew up, I loved Frosties and it never did me any harm.”And Love Island, Samira: “I can sing, I can dance, I can act.” (Bursts into song).She can’t sing.NEVER, in all its ten-series history, has ITV’s love lift been quite as badly needed as it was on Saturday’s brilliant, one-off Take Me Out special for the “over-50s”.A slightly generous description, I thought, given the 30 game old birds looked like they had the combined age of the Pyramids.The fire still burns down below, though, evidently, as a queue of lights remained on for George, the midget Zumba teacher with the wooden teeth, Lawrence, the Billy Connolly lookalike from Ibiza, and even “bouncing Bill”, the ex-policeman, above, who emerged from Paddy McGuinness’s love lift gasping for breath and telling the women: “Every night, when I go to sleep, I like to think I’ve made someone’s life better. What would your motto be?”Fingers crossed, I’d imagine.Lee Dixon: “I like Alexander-Arnold because he gives you half a goal.”Ian Wright: “Harry Kane is still getting back to where he is.”And Glenn Hoddle: “By the time the World Cup starts, today will be history.”(Compiled by Graham Wray)Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “In 1883 which luxury train service ran between Paris and the city now called Istanbul?” Alice: “The Eurostar.”Ben Shephard: “The former Labour MP Ed Balls married which politician in 1998?” Phil: “Theresa May.”The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “The plumage of what flightless bird was used as a medieval helmet decoration?” Geoff: “Eagle.”And Ben Shepherd: “How many of the eight planets in our solar system have the letter A in their name?”Harj: “I think the answer to that is one.

If youre looking for a watchdog, this is not the breed for you.A Malamutes size might scare off an intruder, but thats about the only protection youll get from them.They do best in situations in which they have plenty of room and opportunities to exercise so they dont become bored and restless.The twins will give you years of enjoyment as active playmates and companions who keep their puppy energy well into adult life. 2. Settling inJust like us, dogs can get scared or worried sometimes, especially in an unfamiliar new environment.If they had a favourite toy or blanket at the RSPCA centre, put that in there so they have at least one thing that smells familiar.Establishing a routine is key. Walks, feeding and bedtimes should be around the same time each day so they will know what to expect and build a trusting relationship with you.Take your time. Going from an RSPCA kennel to a new home can be overwhelming so just be patient, let them settle into the new home first and get to know you and the immediate family. Then gradually introduce them to new people and environments.3. Keep them happy and healthyDogs are intelligent and inquisitive so along with lots of exercise they’ll need toys and training activities to keep them entertained.They communicate through body language so owners need to learn to recognise what their signals mean so you can protect them from things that make them anxious or sad. Follow these tips and youll enjoy life with your new rescue dog and know that you’re giving a dog that may never have had a happy home a second chance at a happy life.Name: LillyLilly was taken into RSPCA care after her owner was made homeless and could no longer look after her.Like a lot of dogs who find themselves at the RSPCA, she has struggled to adapt to kennel life and is missing life as a beloved pet.Staff are keen to get her into a home as quickly as possible.She spends lots of time out walking with volunteers and absolutely adores people. Lilly thoroughly enjoys her walks and loves to investigate everything she is currently walked on harness and Gencon as she can be strong on lead so would suit a strong, active owner.She’s eager to please and will do anything for a stroke and a tummy tickle.She can be unsure of other dogs but enjoys walking with those she is familiar with. That said, she would be better suited to a single-dog household where she can have all the attentionShe has a lovely, gentle nature but can get very excited so would be best in a family home with older children from around age 12.The staff caring for her say she is a gorgeous girl with so much potential and will make a superb addition to a family.More info about LillyName: ChicoChico is a regal gent looking for his queen to guide him into his new life. Sadly, he came into care with a broken leg which has now fully healed.His previous history means he also prefers women to men but has formed good relationships with both.He has a gentle disposition and forms strong bonds with people.While hes only two years old, as a very young pup, he was not given the opportunity to experience the life and social skills he needed so he can sometimes become worried when he encounters busy or new experiences.His new owner will need to be prepared to spend time introducing him to new things and encourage him to not see them as a threat.Salukis are generally gentle and curious dogs and this brown and fawn pooch is just the same, with so much love to give.More info about Chico There will be an adoption fee to pay that goes towards helping the RSPCA continue rescuing, rehabilitating and rehoming more dogs.These fees vary by centre from around £135 for adult dogs to £200 for puppies under six months.All RSPCA dogs are spayed, vaccinated and microchipped. And they come with free MORE TH\u0026gtN pet insurance for the first six weeks.Name: DaisyHomeless for: 5 months Daisy arrived at the RSPCA when she became extremely unsettled and unhappy after a family member moved out of the home.Daisy is an affectionate and friendly girl once she gets to know you but can be a little worried when meeting new people.She’d like a quiet, adult-only home where her new owners can continue to help her build in confidence.She’s very food orientated and absolutely loves her treats, which makes training much easier.However, her favourite thing of all is playing in a ball pit.The English bulldog has a sweet, gentle disposition and only needs 20 to 4o minutes of exercise a day.The breed usually have laid back temperaments, which makes them excellent companions, even in smaller households.More info about DaisyName: BenjaminMore info about BenjaminOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Without that ultimate weapon we are certain to get a poor deal.The Prime Minister cannot accept what a small handful of Remainers determined to stop Brexit are demanding.As she has rightly said, “No deal is better than a bad deal”.The people said leave, not leave when the EU gives us permission.The EU Withdrawal Bill, which MPs voted on this week, is about ensuring legal certainty at our point of departure.Jeremy Corbyn voted against the Government on this key bill, cynically trying to frustrate the Brexit process for his own political ends.If Conservatives do not demonstrate discipline in support of Theresa May on this, then we risk letting him into power.The Government has already said the EU Withdrawal Bill can be framed so as to give Parliament a vote on the final outcome, but without blocking the UK’s departure even without a deal.The Bill will go back to the House of Lords on Monday, and is likely then to return to the House of Commons.We need to get this out of the way, because it is 14 months on from triggering Article 50 and we still have not discussed the vital trade relationship between the UK and the EU.This is because the EU Commission deliberately set out to ensnare the UK in a tortuous bureaucratic process designed to leave us in the weakest position, bound to the EU as some sort of vassal state — as a rule-taker.In this, the EU has been emboldened by the appalling behaviour of the unelected House of Lords, which made it clear they want to reverse the result of the referendum. One peer even spoke arrogantly of now bringing the British people to heel.You only need to have watched as the EU’s negotiators have gratuitously and remorselessly set out not just to be difficult but, it has become clear, to humiliate us.For example, their refusal to agree to our continuing involvement in the Galileo satellite project, despite the fact that we have invested heavily in it, demonstrates how their behaviour has been calculated to offend.Even the UK’s offer of defence intelligence co-operation, which the EU needs, was brushed aside.That the EU is now strutting like the school bully should not surprise us, because of its ideological commitment to the European project at all costs.Yet, for all their bluster, this masks a weakness.The EU is deeply worried the UK will leave the EU and become a serious trade competitor, thus not only damaging the EU’s trading position but encouraging those in the EU who oppose this centralised, protectionist behemoth.We have reached a critical moment in the Brexit process. Because of the EU’s inflexibility, the Government has been forced to make concessions in the hope of discussing that all-important trade relationship.This has left many of us concerned that the process has been too one-sided.The UK has been behaving as a friend who wants an amicable divorce, while the EU has behaved like an opponent who wishes to impose their will and force the UK to repent what they believe is the folly of Brexit.That is why the UK needs now to change its negotiating stance, once the Brexit bill is passed.Too often it seems as though it is the UK which negotiates as a supplicant — despite the reality that, as the EU’s largest trade partner and the fifth largest economy in the world, with the world’s fourth most potent defence forces, the UK is deserving of much more respect from the EU.After all, there is a great deal at stake for the EU if these negotiations go wrong.There are many among the EU 27 who, like us, are growing weary of the EU’s arrogance. After all, it is many of them who stand to lose jobs if we fail to reach a trade arrangement.The EU Council meeting later this month has now become critical. It is there we should say that, notwithstanding any ongoing issues concerning the Irish border, our requirement is we move now to negotiate our post-Brexit trade relationship.If they refuse, and want instead to continue their border demands, then we must have the resolve to leave the table.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So far all I’ve come up with is Iggle Piggle, from TV’s In The Night Garden.I think negotiating Brexit would be a stretch for the friendly blue woollen creature with the red Mohawk.But maybe I’ve got him wrong, underestimated his abilities. He has a bell in his left foot. Theresa May seems to have a brain in her left foot. Given the choice, maybe I’d take the kid with the bell.We are in chaos. Not because we voted for Brexit, far from it. The economy is doing well. The sky has not fallen in. Investment up, employment hitting record levels, inflation down.No, the problem is solely a consequence of our Government. Right now we don’t know exactly what deals have been done with the rump of Remainers within the Conservative Party.One moment we’re told the Prime Minister has caved in to their demands. Next minute she hasn’t. Nobody knows quite what to believe.She is tip-toeing between the two sides solely to stay in power. And she has to be told: It isn’t working. It sends out a message to the people we are negotiating with that we haven’t a clue what’s going on.That policy is formulated on the hoof. In fact, it’s not policy at all, just inept fire-fighting. Inept because the flames are spreading — and as a result, our negotiating position becomes weaker by the hour.Some will argue May can only play the cards she has been dealt. That she has a minority Government and a split in her own party.Well, sure. But then, to a considerable degree, she dealt the cards herself. She called an election a year ago expecting to get a huge majority.I could have told her she would lose, if she’d asked. But she didn’t ask me, she asked some other numbnuts instead. This holy mess is of her making.Britain voted to leave the EU. Not to stay in bits of it. Not to remain constrained by the EU’s regulations. The Remainers don’t like that?Don’t care. You lost the argument — so shut up for a while. Or work to get us the best deal we can, outside the customs union.We need to be clear to the EU negotiators that we will happily take a no deal Brexit. They don’t want that — and a tough line will make them respond. If it doesn’t — fine, no deal is still much better than a bad deal.The EU is falling apart, largely for the reasons that convinced us to leave. Bullying, dictatorial, corrupt, undemocratic.We need a leader who can exploit their manifest weaknesses. A lot — perhaps a majority — of European people are on our side.That leader isn’t Theresa May. It needs to be someone within the Tories who is A. a Leave voter and B. has a bit of charisma and nous.I don’t really care who, right now, David Davis, Boris Johnson, Priti Patel, Michael Gove. But ABM — Anyone But May.It is not the EU that is hampering our exit strategy. It is our own Govern­ment. It’s time for Theresa to say: “That’s it: I’m out.”Now, quiz fans, here’s a question for you. What do Terry and Andraya possess that may have helped them come first and second?Jet-powered roller skates? Performance- enhancing drugs? Nope.They were both born with male bodies. And they both competed as boys until very recently.But according to the growing trend, they are now able to identify as girls without question. And so are allowed to compete against girls.And that’s what happens. They win because of biology.SHOULD the Royal Family be allowed to get their baps out? An important constitutional point.Meghan turned up for a royal engagement with her shoulders uncovered. And many people thought this was “inappropriate”. Only a matter of time before the female royals start trying to outdo each other.Kate in a glittery boob tube and Princess Anne in a leather basque with split-crotch undies.Bring it on.THE brilliant writer Lionel Shriver has been sacked as judge of a short story competition.This is because she objected to publishers having quotas that are supposed to “reflect diversity”.She said: “If an agent submits a manuscript written by a gay, ­trans- gender Caribbean who dropped out of school at seven and powers around town on a mobility scooter, it will be published.Whether or not . . . it is an incoherent, tedious, meandering and insensible pile of mixed- paper recycling.”The magazine that runs the competition sacked her for this.It said her comments were “not consistent” with its ethos.What it means is it disagrees with her.Freedom of speech, huh. Well done, Shriver.IN Cretins Corner this week are the libtards criticising President Trump for his attempts to make peace with North Korea.Six months ago these same people were screaming that Trump was leading us all to death and destruction by threatening Kim Jong-un.Now he’s accused of cosying up to a horrible dictator.Truth is, he’s played it brilliantly. Acting tough brought the porky dog-muncher to the negotiating table.And now we have at least a chance of peace in the world’s second most dangerous area (after the Middle East, natch).Barack Obama was bunged a Nobel Peace Prize for, essentially, doing nothing, by the liberals who run the awards.How about one for The Donald for actually achieving something?IS Sadiq Khan going mad?The Mayor of London has demanded that Wikipedia must “close the gender gap” on its entries. Just 17 per cent of biographies on Wiki are about women, apparently.What’s it got to do with you, you bumptious midget?As someone cleverly tweeted, just zero per cent of Imams at Britain’s mosques are female – perhaps they should close the gender gap a little too.Listen Sadiq, just build a few more homes in the capital and stop young ethnic minority people macheteing or machine gunning each other to death.When you’ve sorted that out, mate, then maybe you can start worrying about American online publications.Listen, mate. That’s our money you’re spending. He could have done that trip for sixty quid on the train.And we’d have thrown in a fiver for a packet of cashews and some Red Bull.APPARENTLY, young people are getting thicker.Their average IQ is declining year on year.If you follow the graph to its natural conclusion, by about 2028 they will have an IQ of zero.They’ll be like the Viz character Jellyhead, who had lime jelly between her ears and just lay on the floor all day.They’re already about the level of another Viz character, Terry F***witt.

The tide of rage at this global humiliation would destroy the Tories.The EU question would not be settled. It would be reignited with new ferocity.

Get that, Leavers? Anna and her friends will effectively negate your vote. Suck it up.They were elected on Tory and Labour manifestos committed to leaving in full, but will betray those too. Suck it up.Such is the contempt these MPs have for democracy when it delivers a result they don’t like.We do not know if Theresa May can stop them wrecking Brexit from here.And they seem neither to know nor care what they will unleash.THE alleged Chinese plot to steal defence secrets at Rolls-Royce exposes their grave threat to global security.Russia gets all the headlines. It is more thuggish and blatant, with its invasions, war crimes and chemical weapons.China is far bigger, richer, more ­powerful and more subtle.It is massively expanding its economic empire throughout the world — along with its military and a network of spies and cyber-warriors dedicated to filching state secrets and intellectual property.We should have no desire to make enemies of China. Indeed, if we are ever able to strike our own trade deals post-Brexit, it should be among the first.But we must be alive to its dangers, and punish harshly those caught betraying us.WHAT a summer of passion, drama and potential heartbreak it’s going to be — we’ll be glued to every second.No, not Love Island.

The only tips we actually get are cash.I have just left this company as 70% of the card tips and 10% service charges go directly to the owners and are used to pay the salaried staff their wages.At the end of every night Albert’s take a percentage of our sales off us. Whether we have actually made the tips or not, they take a cut of everything we have sold from us that day. So theoretically we could end up paying out of our own pocket.“Then every fortnight we get a cheque showing us how much money we have made on card tips and then it shows the massive reduction that goes to ‘Albert’s house’ and the disheartening figure that we are actually coming away with.Payslips shared in the post show one example of £517.19 of tips earned in the financial year but £378.48 deducted to House Didsbury and another £75.70 to Kitchen Tip.Another employee, who wished to remain anonymous, provided a slip showing £138.30 of tips and deductions of £334.92 to House Didsbury and Kitchen Tip - resulting in take-home pay of £6.75 from £343.27 of earnings.James Ramsbottom, owner of Elle R Leisure who are behind Albert’s said today: “I cannot comment on specific allegations as that is now a legal matter.“However more than 90% of tips earned, go to staff on site.“Very occasionally, staff have been asked to contribute towards mistakes made but this has only amounted, in total, to £170 in the last 12 months. Again this system is in place to ensure good service.“If a server makes persistent errors, it can massively affect service, not just to the table in question, but the whole restaurant. However this is very rarely used and is at the discretion of the manager.”Tips are given voluntarily by customers to staff as a reward for the service theyve received.These tips can be kept by the employee, although technically they should be declared for income tax.If cash tips are placed into a central collection and distributed equally among staff, this should not be done by the employer.However, tips included in card payments are handled by the restaurant and can be pooled together and shared out among staff.Service charges are compulsory additions to a restaurant bill, typically for serving a large group, which are paid directly to the venue.With card payments and service charges there is no legal obligation for the restaurant to allocate a proportion of the service charge to employees. In August 2015, Elle R Leisure admitted that staff at Albert’s did not get all of their tips.The company said that some larger parties have a 10 per cent service charge added to the bill and part of that is kept by the company.They claimed this is used to pay for ‘staff welfare items’ - such as nights out, food and drinks and training for employees.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Body language expert Judi James said Meghan showed some nerves during the visit, but there was warmth between her and the monarch.Ms James said: \"The Queen was the happiest I\u0027ve seen her in a long time. They looked like naughty teenagers giggling together at one point.\"Meghan was still being very careful. She sat with her legs crossed at the ankles and was clearly seeking approval.\"Ms James also noted the Duchess repeatedly touched her hair, a \"self-checking gesture\" which surprised her as she is usually a confident woman. Adding of the Queen, she said: \"She looked positively girlish. When she smiles you can see the young princess coming out. She\u0027s got a beautiful childlike smile and her little hands were formed into fists at one point.\"Perhaps Meghan did bring a little bit more of that out in her.\"We saw displays which showed the pair genuinely having fun.\"Ahead of their engagement, the Queen and Meghan arrived by royal train before travelling by car to the bridge, a \u0026#1631.86bn project which should ease traffic between Runcorn and Widnes. They were greeted by local dignitaries as the streets around Runcorn station was lined by schoolchildren and well-wishers who waved flags and applauded as they arrived.Grange Hill, Hollyoaks, and Brookside creator Phil Redmond, whose wife Alexis is the High Sheriff of Cheshire, was also on hand to greet them.He joked he should have asked Meghan if she\u0027d like a role in Hollyoaks, adding: \"I didn\u0027t ask her, but there\u0027s still lunch yet. She\u0027ll have to go through the audition process like everybody else.\"His wife said: \"It\u0027s fantastic to have them here and it\u0027s a big day for Cheshire.\"Mick Noone, former operation director for the council, said the Queen asked how long the six-lane bridge had taken to build, while Meghan described it as \"magnificent\".   Queen Elizabeth wore a striking green outfit and hat for the event, as the country remembered the victims and survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire by going green for Grenfell.Buckingham Palace would not confirm that her colour choice was a show of solidarity with the survivors.Her outfit was by Stewart Parvin and hat was by Rachel Trevor Morgan. She carried her trademark black Launer handbag and opted for trusty black patent Anello \u0026 Davide low heels.Meghan was wearing Givenchy, the designer label behind her wedding gown.She wore a cream dress with a cape, adding a thin black belt around her waist. She carried a clutch bag, and opted to leave her hair down instead of wearing a hat. She also towered over the Queen in Sarah Flint stilettos.Her diamond and pearl earrings were a gift from the Queen, Buckingham Palace confirmed, but it isn\u0027t known exactly when she was given them.Although the Queen wore gloves, appearing to be neutral to match her granddaughter-in-law\u0027s dress, Meghan did not.The royal pair took part in a minute\u0027s silence to remember the Grenfell victims at noon. After the unveiling and ribbon cutting, Meghan and the Queen watched a performance by local schoolchildren called Bringing Communities Together, by performers from the Andrew Curphey Theatre Company.They appeared to be sharing a joke as they sat next to each other, and Mr Curphey said Meghan was \"really calm considering it was her first official engagement with the boss\".He added: \"The children have been hugely excited and it\u0027s been a massive treat for them.\"The Queen said she thoroughly enjoyed it and it was lovely to see the history of the bridge on the videos.\"As Meghan walked away from me she turned back and said \u0027the children did great by the way\u0027.\" The Queen and the Duchess were presented with flowers by Savannah Cafferty, 11, and Alarni Wain, who is celebrating her eighth birthday. She said both royals wish her a happy birthday.As they went from one part of the county to another, there appeared to be some confusion over which car door Meghan should use, and whether the Queen should get into the car first or second.The royal pair then went on to Chester, 20 miles away, for further engagements. They attended the official opening of Storyhouse, a library, cinema and theatre complex, where they had a tour of the building.They met a Syrian settlement group engaged in craft work, and watched a performance by Fallen Angels, a dance theatre company for people who are recovering from addiction.In the theatre, they saw a medley of songs from Storyhouse\u0027s latest production, A Little Night Music. After their tour, they greeted the hundreds who had packed the streets outside, as they walked to the City Council, meeting with flag-waving royal fans, some of which went for an American flag in a nod to Meghan\u0027s heritage.She and the Queen spoke to several people during their walkabout and Meghan was spotted showing her wedding ring to one group.They collected dozens of floral bouquets and gifts.She told one person that Harry was the \"best husband\" and said married life was \"wonderful\". In her second balcony moment with the Queen, Meghan appeared on the Chester Town Hall terrace, alongside Lord Mayor of Chester, Councillor Alex Black, to deafening cheers from the crowds below.The Queen and Meghan had lunch at Chester Town Hall, as guests of the City Council, concluding their visit.Meghan married Prince Harry in Windsor in May and since then, has joined the royal family for Trooping the Colour, also known as the Queen\u0027s birthday parade, and has announced her first royal tour.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are to make an official visit to Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and the Kingdom of Tonga in the autumn."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/06/2048x1152/skynews-queen-world-cup-kim-jong-un_4336240.jpg?20180614165303 ","title":"russia 2018 the people are welcoming and the beer is cold","story":"Perhaps it was the infectious enthusiasm of the Peruvian masses that kickstarted the party.

Late payments were delayed on average by four weeks.From January to October last year, 40% of those affected by late payments waited around 11 weeks or more, and 20% waited nearly five months.The report authors found the use of foodbanks increased more rapidly after universal credit was rolled out to an area.\"The benefits that it set out to achieve through universal credit, such as increased employment and lower administration costs, are unlikely to be achieved. Yet the Department has little realistic alternative but to continue with the programme and hopefully learn from past mistakes.\"The NAO also found the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) had not shown \"sufficient sensitivity\" towards some claimants and that it does not know how many are having problems with the programme or have suffered hardship.Reacting to the report, Frank Field, the chair of the work and pensions select committee, said: \"This report blows up the DWP\u0027s constant assertion that everything is going well and that any criticism comes from those who wish to make trouble for universal credit.\"The points that individuals have raised with the select committee are now writ large as systemic faults within the system and the government is caught in a trap of its own making.\"The universal credit we have seen is a shambles, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake. Sadly, this report will make little difference if the senior officers running universal credit remain firmly entrenched in La La Land.\"In response to the report, a spokesperson for the DWP said: \"Previous administrations poured billions into an outdated system with a complex myriad of benefits, which locked some people into cycles of welfare dependency.\"Whereas we are building a benefit system fit for the 21st century, providing flexible, person-centred support, with evidence showing universal credit claimants getting into work faster and staying in work longer."},{"url":null,"title":"fit work benefit assessors quietly","story":"NewsFit-for-work benefit assessors quietly ordered not to make people show self-harm scarsThe booklet, uploaded online without fanfare, stresses it is \"not appropriate\" to ask the distressing question - months after complaints by MPs\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByDan BloomPolitical reporter20:48, 14 JUN 2018Updated20:52, 14 JUN 2018NewsThe change comes after complaints - the DWP claimed staff already follow the rules (Image: iStockphoto)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailStaff running divisive \u0027fit-for-work\u0027 tests have been ordered not to ask people to show their self-harm scars. The instruction is in new guidance that\u0027s been issued to benefit assessors by outsourcing giant Maximus, and uploaded without fanfare online. The booklet stresses it is not appropriate for staff to ask people to reveal their scars if they have a history of self-harm. Such questioning may distress the individual, the guidance adds. Questioned by the Mirror this week, Maximus insisted the new guidance simply formalised rules that staff already follow.  But it comes months after MPs heard claims that people had been questioned while they were “curled up crying on the floor” and asked “why haven’t you killed yourself”.  Ayaz Manji, of mental health charity Mind, said the fact the new guidance was seen as necessary at all was hugely worrying.  He added: This suggests that until now, assessors deemed it appropriate to ask about this. Even the implication that this has been happening is shocking. The guidance is for Work Capability Assessments (WCAs), known as \u0027fit-for-work\u0027 tests, that decide if people can claim sickness and disability benefit ESA. Private firm Maximus carries out WCAs on behalf of the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). Maximus won a \u0026pound595million, 40-month WCA contract in 2014 that\u0027s since been extended to March 2020. But MPs claim there have been worrying cases that raise questions over how mentally ill people are treated. Labour MP Ruth George claimed in December that people with suicidal thoughts had been asked: Why haven’t you killed yourself then. She added at the time: There are people curled up crying on the floor. At the time, DWP minister Sarah Newton said it was “really important” to establish if benefit claimants were suicidal but such a question would be totally unacceptable.

St Edmund Campion Catholic Primary School in Maidenhhead, Berkshire, has sent a desperate email to parents with a link to an Amazon ‘Wish List’ page, asking them to buy essential items. The 420-pupil school is struggling to balance its books and has turned to parents for urgent help. The Mirror revealed last year that rising numbers of head teachers were begging for cash from parents to offset Tory cuts - some asking for \u0026pound20 a month to buy basic teaching materials, such as textbooks. The school’s Wish List allows online shoppers using the retail giant to buy additional items when making purchases and send them to the school.  Among the 17 items on the list are toilet paper, which the school says “never ending supply required” and office and classroom supplies including pens, pencils, erasers and felt-tip pens. Parents are growing increasingly concerned and one says she was ‘shaken and nearly in tears’ after discovering the school is ‘begging for toilet paper’. Mrs May has represented the constituency of Maidenhead for 21 years. In March she told the House of Commons the Government was spending more on schools ‘than ever before’. One parent, Catherine del Campo, whose 10-year-old daughter attends the school, says she is worried about what the future holds for the school. She said: “I was shaken and nearly in tears, this is really desperate, the fact they are asking for office supplies and toilet paper. “As a parent, if the school is begging for toilet paper then it makes you wonder what’s next?” Ms del Campo says the new National Funding Formula, which was designed to iron out discrepancies in the way funding was applied to schools, is seriously underfunded if schools are begging for essential items.

The spending watchdog found it has not delivered value for money, its rollout has been slower and costlier than promised, and it\u0027s caused hardship for many people. It\u0027s a devastating blow to the six-in-one benefit that was announced in 2010 as the pet project of former Tory welfare chief Iain Duncan Smith. It has since been taken over by a string of Work and Pension Secretaries and now rests in the hands of Tory Esther McVey. Labour MP Frank Field, who chairs the Work and Pensions Select Committee, today brands the benefit a “shambles, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake”. And campaigners have used the report to call for reform of the benefit, which has already cost the state \u0026pound1.9bn to date. Here are 5 of the most devastating findings in the report.  Last year along a quarter of new claims were not paid in full on time - a total of 113,000. And from January to October 2017, 40% of those affected by late payments waited for 11 weeks or more. A fifth of those with late payments waited almost five months. But despite improvements, in March this year 21% of new claimants did not receive their full entitlement on time with 13% receiving no payment on time. The DWP does not anticipate that delays will improve this year, the NAO said. And the DWP believes it will never achieve 100% payment on time because of the need to verify claimants\u0027 eligibility, the NAO warned. 2. It\u0027s taking far, far longer than expected  It\u0027s hard to believe it now, but Universal Credit was originally due to be rolled out fully by October 2017. Yet eight years after it was announced, only around 10% of the final expected caseload are currently claiming Universal Credit. There have been a string of delays and it\u0027s now due to end by March 2022. 3. It\u0027s could cost even more than the old system  The NAO said the system\u0027s running costs are currently \u0026pound699 per claim - against an ambition of \u0026pound173 by 2024. And it warned UC may cost more to administer than the system it replaced, which included job seeker\u0027s allowance, tax credit and housing benefit. Universal Credit has not delivered value for money and it is uncertain that it ever will, the NAO said. The project is not value for money now, and that its future value for money is unproven. 4. Its entire selling point could be an empty promise  Universal Credit was sold to the nation on the basis it will encourage people into work. That\u0027s because it is designed to make work pay by ensuring people aren\u0027t accidentally penalised for every extra hour they work.  However, the NAO said we doubt it will ever be possible for the DWP to measure if Universal Credit has increased the number of people in work. 5. It drives people to food banks - and the DWP\u0027s in denial  Since the introduction of UC there have been increases in rent arrears and the use of food banks, the NAO reported. The watchdog added private landlords have become reluctant to rent homes to people on the flahship benefit. In three of the four areas the NAO visited that had proper data, foodbank use increased quicker after Universal Credit was rolled out fully. But the report warned the DWP does not accept that Universal Credit has caused hardship among claimants. The Department has not shown sufficient sensitivity towards some claimants, the NAO said. It does not know how many claimants are having problems with the programme or have suffered hardship. Amyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office, warned the DWP has shown a lack of regard in failing to understand the hardship faced by some claimants. But we\u0027re so far down the track, there\u0027s no way it can stop  NAO chief Amyas Morse added: The benefits that it set out to achieve through Universal Credit, such as increased employment and lower administration costs, are unlikely to be achieved. Yet the Department has little realistic alternative but to continue with the programme and hopefully learn from past mistakes.”   How have campaigners reacted?

The 40-year-old is ex-Head of UK and Europe Public Affairs at Serco, working there until nine months before he was elected MP for Charnwood in 2015.  Serco was caught up in a huge row in 2013 when it agreed to repay the government \u0026pound68.5m for overcharging on a criminal tagging contract.

His call will heap pressure on PM Theresa May, who has repeatedly signalled that she plans to increase NHS funding but has yet to do so. Lord Prior is the first top Tory to call for the change, which could raise \u0026pound11billion in 2019. He follows ex-Labour PM Gordon Brown, who demanded it in a Mirror article earlier this month.  Lord Prior, 63, told the Mirror: “The pressures are growing by the day. By 2030, the number of people over 65 will increase by a third. Only a serious injection of cash will allow us to deliver high-quality care that people expect. I’m calling for 1p extra on National Insurance.” Last week, a ComRes poll for the Mirror showed 82% support among voters for a 1p rise.

But Janet Daby could end up being just as tricky for him as her predecessor - Remainer rebel Heidi Alexander. She\u0027s the centrist favourite who triumphed over Momentum candidates in a bitter selection battle that ended in the local party chair being suspended. And she\u0027s made clear she\u0027ll fight to keep close links to the EU - even when it\u0027s against Mr Corbyn\u0027s policy. I will fight for UK to remain in the customs union and the single market, she told one journalist on the campaign trail. Leaving the customs union and single market will have a disastrous effect on the economy and, as usual, it will be the poorest who suffer the most.  Lewisham backed staying in the EU by a whopping 70%, and its previous MP Ms Alexander led a battle to stay in the single market. Mr Corbyn has insisted Britain will leave the single market. But Ms Daby has said she will need to have conversations with the party leader and signalled she could vote against him. I would not put myself in a situation in which I have to make the short journey back from Westminster knowing that I have just voted to make the residents of my community poorer, she told the Independent. Ms Daby, a mum of two in her mid-40s, was born to two Windrush migrants from Guyana and Jamaica and has lived in the south London constituency for 22 years. She was brought up on a council estate where, as a child, racist thugs pelted her windows with eggs three nights in a row.

It\u0027s environmentally friendly. It\u0027s fun. It even has its own celebratory week. Yes, this is the week where we celebrate all that\u0027s great about cycling. June 9 – 17 is Bike Week 2018, a week where we recognise the social, health and environmental benefits of cycling. Believe it or not, Bike Week has been running for 95 years – but with concerns about the health of the nation and the environment more pressing than ever, cycling has never been more important than it is today. There are lots of great events taking place up and down the country during Bike Week. Thinking of getting involved? Make sure your bike is ready to go with our complete guide. Get a free bike check  Like any mode of transport your bike needs to be looked after and regularly checked for wear and tear. If you aren’t sure where to start, head to Halfords – its team of bike experts are happy to answer any questions and recommend the best bikes and accessories for you. To ensure your bike is fit for summer, Halfords also offer a free bike check . The 32 point inspection includes:  Frame, saddle \u0026amp handlebar Wheels including tyres, rims, spokes and hubs Brake system including levers, calipers, pads and cables / hoses Drivetrain including gears, levers, chain, bottom bracket, cranks and cables  Starting out  Bike week is all about encouraging more of us to get out on our bikes and embrace the benefits cycling has to offer. If your little ones have never cycled, now is the time - the younger they start, the more confident they\u0027ll become. A balance bike is a great way to encourage your child to get the feel of riding a bike without relying on stablisers. The Carrera Coast Balance Bike is incredibly lightweight, making it perfect for tots to learn how to balance, steer and lean. Accessories that team well with it are the Blue flames helmet, blue horn, and blue pad set. If your child prefers to start out with stabilisers, the Apollo range comes in great designs they\u0027ll love - including the Apollo 12 Cupcake Bike , \u0026pound70 (save \u0026pound5) which looks good enough to eat and comes with matching helmet , bell, mitts and bike pads set . For kids graduating up to their first mountain bike, the Carrera Blast Junior Mountain Bike - 24 , \u0026pound232 (save \u0026pound58) is an ideal choice, with matching accessories such as helmet , gloves and mudguard.  Alternatively, the Apollo Gridlok Kids\u0027 Mountain Bike -24 , \u0026pound155, is a more budget-friendly option that\u0027s still perfect for kids who are raring to get outside and race down the hills. Its front suspension absorbs the bumps, while the Shimano 18 speed gearing lets them fly along flat roads. For added peace of mind, Halfords offer free bike building service on all of its children\u0027s bikes. This includes a 22-point safety check and free 6-week service to ensure everything is running as it should. Plus, until June 21, buy a kid\u0027s bike and get \u0026pound10 worth of kids\u0027 accessories for free.  Time to upgrade?  If you don\u0027t currently own a bike or you\u0027re thinking of treating yourself to a new model, Halfords has a huge range of bikes for sale online and in its stores, and its expert staff can help you find the one that best suits your needs - whether you\u0027re looking to head to the hills on a mountain bike or get a helping hand from an electric bike . Bike maintenance and accessories  Wheels Before setting off on a cycling trip, there are a number of things you need to check to keep things safe - starting with your wheels. If you haven\u0027t been out on the bike recently then the tyres may have deflated. To test them, inflate them, and check them after a few days. If they\u0027ve deflated, you might have a puncture. A tyre sealant, like Slime Bike Tyre Sealant , \u0026pound9.99, can help to prevent punctures. This liquid is pumped into the tyre to prevent future holes from causing a problem.  If you have a puncture, you\u0027ll need to remove the wheel to repair the puncture using Halfords Puncture Repair Kit, \u0026pound12. If you aren\u0027t sure where to start, Halfords offer a useful video guide to puncture repair. If you\u0027re planning a big family cycling trip then you\u0027ll also want to make sure you have a compact pump with you when you\u0027re out and about. Check out the Bikehut High Pressure Bike Pump (now \u0026pound15, save \u0026pound4). Chain  In the unlikely event that you suffer a broken chain, it\u0027s really worth having a repair kit with you, especially if you\u0027re mountain biking. Check out the Park Tool Mini Chain Brute Tool for just \u0026pound9.98, which is ideal if you need to repair a broken chain on the road. It\u0027s important to use chain oil or lubricant to keep the chain in good working order. The cheapest option is to use cycle oil - costing just \u0026pound4 - but you may choose to opt for a more expensive lubricant like Muc-Off , which is weather resistant. You should clean your chain before applying lubricant - there are special cleaners to help with this. Gears    The best way to keep your gears in check is with regular servicing, but if you do encounter a problem, it\u0027s best not to attempt to fix it yourself. Instead, get an in-store Halfords expert to help you get your gears working again. If your family does a lot of cycling, then taking out a Halfords Bike Care Plan is a worthwhile investment. These plans are a great way to leave the dirty work to someone else, as well as providing peace of mind that your bike is being looked after by Halfords\u0027 highly trained experts. Prices start from \u0026pound15 for kids\u0027 bikes and \u0026pound25 for adult bikes and include free fitting on parts and accessories bought from Halfords, as well as a free Silver Bike Service worth \u0026pound50. Brakes Every bike needs regular checks on its braking system, as you ride it\u0027s inevitable that cables stretch slightly and brake pads can wear down. It\u0027s another good reason to invest in a regular service at Halfords. But you can, and should, test them yourself as well to ensure they stop the wheels. Inspect the brake pads regularly to make sure they’re aligned with the rims.  Bolts    The last step for bike maintenance should be to check the bolts, like those on the wheels, are well tightened. There\u0027s no need to over-tighten, as this can cause problems too, but make sure nuts are all firmly secured. A spanner set or special bike tool will be needed, but the Halfords Basic 6 Piece Allen Key Set is just \u0026pound5.99 and should cover most bike nut sizes.  Lights   Make sure there are good lights attached to your bikes in case your cycle ride goes on later than planned! Halfords has a Silicone Light Set for just \u0026pound15 that attaches to pretty much any bike in seconds. If you\u0027re off on a cycling trip, the last thing you\u0027ll want to be doing is carting batteries around, so consider investing in a Rechargeable Bike Light Set, \u0026pound25. They recharge by USB, and feature high, low, and flashing modes. For little cyclists there are also a brightly-coloured Silicone Bike Light available for \u0026pound4 in blue, green and pink for all tastes. Cycling clothing   Like any sport, cycling involves wearing the right kit - both to keep you visible to other road users, and to keep you safe in the event of an accident. A well fitting helmet can seriously reduce the risk of a head injury, so you should get your kids in the habit of wearing one whenever they are out on their bikes. Halfords stock a range of fun designs like Paw Patrol and Disney Princesses , with prices starting at \u0026pound10, while older kids might like the Purple Swirls Kids Bike Helmet which looks cool and offers excellent protection. But the best way to encourage your kids to wear a helmet is to lead by example by wearing one yourself. The HardnutZ Stealth Hi Vis MTB Helmet is a good choice at \u0026pound35 (down from \u0026pound55), and is available in four colours. One of its key advantages is that its highly reflective under street lamps and car headlights.  Being seen is crucial for any cyclist, young or old. Grab a family pack of Halfords Hi Vis Vests for just \u0026pound11.99 and the four vests (two adult-sized and two kid-sized) will make everyone much more visible on the roads. Vests are also available individually .

He also beat music mogul Simon Cowell, Britain\u0027s Got Talent judge David Walliams, presenter Simon Thomas and Made in Chelsea star Josh \u0027JP\u0027 Patterson to the title Mark, who is from from Nottinghamshire, picked up over three million social media fans by posting videos chronicling his parenting experiences.

Shocked is an understatement, he told the Daily Star Online. “Full credit to my awesome army of fans and followers who all made it their mission to help me take home the award.” Mark said there were no hard feelings to the other celebrity dads who lost out on the coveted award. If Anthony Joshua, Simon Cowell or Prince William want to pop round to my house and see some of my dad hacks in action I’d be happy to stick on the kettle, he joked. The designer turned internet star previously said that, since winning the award was so unlikely, he would get a tattoo marking the occasion if it happened.

CCTV shows how the rival gangs lashed out at each other with a flurry of kicks and punches inside McDonald\u0027s in Penge, south-east London, knocking over an elderly woman during the melee. The teenagers, armed with knives, race into the takeaway, attempting to stab each other, and continue to fight in the doorway and outside on the pavement. One of the participants of the violence was later jailed for his part in the fatal stabbing of 17-year-old Karl Yule in Gillingham, Kent on October.  Tyler Ralph, from Hetfordshire, will now serve a life sentence with a minimum of 16 years for the killing of Mr. Yule Judge Adele Williams drew attention to his history of violence with knives - he was also convicted for possession of a blade in 2014 - when she sentenced him at Maidstone Crown Court on Thursday.  Aged just 16 at the time, he was convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, affray and possession of a blade for the incident. Judge Adele Williams drew attention to his history of violence with knives - he was also convicted for possession of a blade in 2014 - when she sentenced him at Maidstone Crown Court on Thursday to detention for life with a minimum term of 16 years after the murder of Mr Yule. She told the court how he and his four other co-defendants all regularly carried knives, and videos of Ralph found on his phone showed him with a fearsome array of knives and weapons.  In other footage, which can now be published, he films himself picking up with a gloved hand an array of weapons laid out on a bed, and brandishing a sword.  All of the footage was shown in court to a jury weeks ago as part of the trial but the press were prevented from publishing it until now.  A court order continues to prevent the press fully identifying Ralph and any of his fellow co-defendants who are still under the age of 18.  They can now be named, and the town in which they lived reported, but their faces must be obscured in any images or footage used and their street address must not be published, Judge Williams said.

It is only when Khalil goes to hug him, you see the tattoo on Ivan’s right bicep. ‘EDL’ it says. ‘East Anglian Division’. “This is where I’ve come from,” Ivan, 47, says, touching the tattoo. “And this is where I’ve come to.” He shows us his left forearm. There in indelible ink, are the words ‘More In Common’. The day we meet is the third anniversary of Jo Cox’s maiden speech to Parliament where she said she believed her constituents “have far more in common with each other than things that divide us”. Today, Ivan, once the English Defence League’s East Anglia regional organiser and a friend of its then leader Tommy Robinson, tells me those words have come to define his life. “It all starts with Khalil,” he says.  The day they met in December 2011, Ivan was deep inside the EDL. He had become a loner who lived online, inside secret chat rooms that spread poisonous hatred about Muslims. He spent his weekends organising and travelling to demos. “I was a single dad neglecting my kids,” he says. “All my money and all my attention went on demos and the EDL.” That day, he was shopping with his kids when they passed two Muslim women in headscarves. “I spent all this time hating Muslims but I’d never actually met any,” Ivan says. He followed the women to where the local Muslims were meeting. “I banged on the window,” Ivan says. “I was probably hoping for confrontation. But Khalil came to the door and spoke to me.”  “The first thing I said to Ivan was ‘about time’,” Khalil says. “Why didn’t you come to speak to us before instead of just holding demonstrations?” Ivan says: “We talked for about 20 minutes. I was just totally shocked. I didn’t expect the warm welcome. Why didn’t he have a go at me?” Khalil invited Ivan for coffee the next day and they found they shared many thoughts about Britain. “That’s all it is, conversation,” Ivan says. “It’s where it all starts”. Khalil, a 42-year-old graphic designer from Edinburgh, converted to Islam in 2001.  Ivan, from Lowestoft, Suffolk, joined the EDL in 2009 after commenting on a Facebook video about Muslims protesting against a British troops’ homecoming parade.  “Very quickly I was hooked,” he says. “But I wasn’t radicalised by nobody. I was angry and frustrated already. “I was angry for my town – no factories, no fishing industry left, people being forced into a hole. I was working for a forces charity, so attacking our troops made me even more angry.” At that time Ivan was recovering from a breakdown. “I found this whole community online. It was all about Anjem Choudary who was preaching hate and Muslim grooming gangs.  “I thought I was protecting my children. I believed we were in a war. But now I had a Muslim friend and that confused me. Khalil is a white guy, but the EDL wasn’t about skin colour. “We hated black, white, brown Muslims all the same.” In 2012, vicar Dr Alan Clifford was banned from holding a stall at Norwich market after giving out “hate-motivated leaflets” against Islam. Ivan organised an EDL demo to support Clifford, but worried it might be dangerous for Khalil. “So I rang him to warn him it was happening,” he says. The far-right demo was one of Ivan’s division’s most successful, attracting 1,000 protesters, but still left him questioning. “You came to the mosque for Eid when you were still in the EDL,” Khalil says. “Someone came to me and said there is a man here and he’s got a tattoo saying East Anglian Division EDL and I said ‘Oh good’. Ivan was welcomed by everyone, including the imam.” The same year, Manwar Ali, a former Jihadist turned charity worker, bought an old church in nearby Ipswich. “Instead of calling a demo I went to see him,” Ivan says. “Manwar explained he was actually trying to save a historic building and make it into a community centre for everyone. “He said his life had been saved by a blood transfusion in the UK and he no longer knew if he had white, black or Jewish blood.” The encounter left Ivan reeling.

Victim Nigel Hassall, 36, said Gavin Murphy, 27, led him to believe that they were in love. But their relationship took a violent turn when Murphy kneed Mr Hassall in the face - knocking out his two front teeth - and then punched him and bit him.  The victim was left badly injured and has now bravely spoken out after his attacker was jailed for 12 months, Stoke-on-Trent Live reports.  A court heard the pair had a sexual relationship although Murphy denied this was the case.  Mr Hassall said: Gavin beat me up, it was like something you would see on a TV show. It will cost me thousands to repair the damage the assault did because I will have to get my teeth done - it\u0027s horrible. We were in a pretend relationship together, because it turned out he was straight. He had me believe we were in a relationship but now he says he\u0027s not gay. I suppose I will just have to move on. It seems like something you would make a film out of rather than the reality. When I first met him we were neighbours and he was with a lady at the time. We then fell in love, but that turned out to be just a lie. Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard Murphy had arranged to stay with his victim in Leek, Staffordshire for a few days on March 5 but decided to leave after 15 minutes. Murphy then launched his attack after Mr Hassall went after him mistakenly thinking he had taken his phone. "},{"url":null,"title":"happy eid al fitr 2018","story":"NewsHappy Eid-al-fitr 2018!

People around the UK have just broken their final fast after the news was announced earlier this evening that the festival would begin on Friday June 15. Eid is not a fixed date, but is dependent on the sighting of a new moon - marking the start of the Islamic month Shawwal. It is celebrated by the gathering of family and friends and many will also attend special Eid prayers in the morning. The most common greeting to say to Muslims is Eid Mubarak.  In some cultures it is traditional to wear new clothes on Eid and many will bake sweet treats ahead of the celebrations.  Muslims also use Eid as a time to donate to charity, as the whole month of Ramadan is a time of reflection.   Ramadan is the ninth month in the Islamic calendar, which is determined by the lunar cycle.   When it starts is based on the sighting of the new moon, which marks the beginning of the month.  If the new moon (hilal) is spotted, fasting begins the following day.  Similarly when determining the last day of Ramadan , if the new moon is sighted the holy month is complete and Eid is celebrated the following day.   Local sightings of the moon can differ, which is why there can be discrepancies between the days different countries start and end their fast. It moves about 11 days each year in the Gregorian calendar, which is based on the solar year. Ramadan can last either 29 or 30 days.

Children from local schools lined up in the street before the Queen made her way through, followed by Meghan. The Queen and Duchess of Sussex then departed by car to travel to Mersey Gateway Bridge, which the monarch is officially opening.  Her Majesty’s outfit is by Stewart Parvin and has previously been worn in France D Day and Ireland state visits. The Queen\u0027s hat by Rachel Trevor Morgan, while the Duchess’s outfit is by Givenchy. Birthday girl Abigail Grimes, aged five today, a pupil at Beechwood Primary School in Runcorn, was chosen to present the duchess with a posy of flowers, the royal visitors nodding and thanking the youngster for her gift.  Meanwhile the Queen was given a posy by Jack Jackson, aged 10, from St Michael\u0027s Catholic Primary School in Widnes. By mid morning, the Queen and Duchess had arrived at the Catalyst museum in Widnes. Schoolchildren and dignitaries gathered in the grounds of the museum on Spike Island.  Grange Hill and Brookside creator Phil Redmond and wife Alexis, the High Sheriff of Cheshire, were among those gathered to greet the royals. Mr Redmond joked he should have asked Meghan if she wanted a part in his soap Hollyoaks. He said: I didn\u0027t ask her, but there\u0027s still lunch yet. She\u0027ll have to go through the audition process like everybody else.    Mrs Redmond said: It\u0027s fantastic to have them here and it\u0027s a big day for Cheshire. At midday, a minute\u0027s silence was held to mark the one-year anniversary of the Grenfell Tower disaster. A siren will sound across Town Square at the start and end of the silence, Cheshire West Council tweeted as a reminder to all those in Chester for the visit. The fire killed 72 people at the high rise tower block in north west London in the early hours of the morning on June 14 2017.  As the pair walked through the streets lined with royalists and schoolchildren, the Queen appeared to take the lead with Meghan closely following. As they arrived at Storyhouse in Chester, the Queen delighted crowds with a royal wave and flashed a smile.  Once inside Storyhouse, the royals took a tour of the building and library, before chatting with members of a craft group and watching performances. Hundreds of people gathered outside Chester Town Hall - the royals\u0027 final stop of the day as they attend lunch as guests of the city council.

The brothel called Mr Magoo\u0027s had dancing poles, a wooden frame covered in buckles and restraints on a wall.  A photo showed to a court had a sign saying discrete location, stunning ladies 24/7,” the Liverpool Echo reports.   Michael Kolokotroni, 53, and Adam Weir, 43, were jailed in 2015 for two years for the seedy brothel and a proceeds of crime hearing has now been heard at Liverpool Crown Court.  After out-of-court discussions it was agreed that Kolokotroni had benefited from the enterprise by \u0026pound214,500 and Weir’s benefit was agreed to have been \u0026pound671,434. Brian McKenna, prosecuting, said financial investigations revealed that Weir, of Birkenhead, has realisable assets of \u0026pound172,963 and Kolokotroni has assets of \u0026pound87,500.  The judge, Recorder Richard Pratt, QC, ordered that those sums are confiscated and ordered that the two men, who were both present in court, hand them over within three months. If they fail to do so both Weir and Kolokotroni, a father-of-three, of Prenton, face 18 months in prison in default. The two men had denied keeping the ‘gentlemen’s club’ in Birkenhead, as a brothel between January 2013 and June 2014. But a jury found them both guilty and they were jailed in February 2015. During their trial, the court heard that when police raided the premises in June 2014, they found it contained dancing poles and a wooden frame covered in buckles.  Pictures of the inside of the venue show a \u0027Fifty Shades\u0027-style cross with wrist restraints on a wall in one of the rooms. A open plan kitchen-living room, which includes a kettle, microwave and washing machine, also boasts a metal pole in the middle of the room. One of the pictures shows a small bedroom in the brothel, with floral patterned wallpaper on one of the walls. The premises had an adult entertainment licence, but this did not allow it to operate as a brothel. Mr McKenna showed pictures of the brothel to the court. He described how one showed “a mirror on the ceiling” and a contraption attached to the wall with buckles, telling the jury: “You can make up your own minds as to what that is used for”. One photograph showed a sign saying: “Mr Magoo’s Gentleman’s Club – discrete location, stunning ladies 24/7”.

Terry Loong, 40, opted for what is known as postpartum confinement – a practice she says is common in Asian culture, where a new mother does not leave the house, have visitors or, in some cases, bathe for a month following delivery.  The thinking behind it is that it helps protect both mum and baby from infections, gives the mother a chance to recover and recharge, and allows the two uninterrupted bonding time.  Aesthetic doctor Terry admitted she did smell of bodily fluids but she said she didn\u0027t care. She believes it helped her bond with little Matthew, free of any distractions, while giving her body the rest it desperately needed.  Terry, who is of Malaysian heritage and lives in Harrow, north west London, said: “I remember my mum having a period of confinement when I was little. I’m the oldest of five so I saw it a lot. “It is common in Asian culture. Some of my Chinese friends here in London have done it too but adapted it to what works for them, picking different parts of it. “I don’t know many people that did it fully, like me. The biggest thing is that people couldn’t believe I hadn’t showered. It wasn’t pretty, but it was important. If I had another baby, I would definitely do it again.” Following a textbook pregnancy, Terry went into labour with Matthew, now two, at just 37 weeks. Her contractions started as she was on a Skype call to a patient. Coincidentally, she had been due to throw a baby shower days later – but as her son arrived early she ended up holding it eight weeks after the birth instead. She continued: “I remember calling my friend who had organised the shower and saying ‘I don’t think I can make it – I’m having the baby now.’ “I got an Uber taxi to hospital and was in absolute agony, screaming the whole way. “Within three hours of that first contraction, I’d had my baby.”  After giving birth to Matthew naturally at St George’s Hospital in Tooting, south west London in April 2016, Terry said she felt “like she’d been hit by a bus”.   But despite experiencing a first degree tear, her baby was a healthy lad. Keen to give herself a proper chance to heal, she decided to try postpartum confinement. She explained: “It takes an enormous amount of energy to make, carry and deliver a baby. “The sheer exhaustion I felt was a shock to my body. I knew I needed to rest, so decided to try confinement as I thought it would give me a chance to heal properly and mentally rest so I could be the best mother possible.” So a day after the birth, Terry, who is married to 37-year-old business consultant Kurt, headed home without showering. She added: After the birth I had blood down below and was covered in sweat. My hair was really greasy to start with and I did smell of bodily fluids, but I didn\u0027t care. It was the most natural thing in the world. Because she had sutures (stitches) in following the birth, Terry ensured she maintained a level of hygiene by washing her intimate areas with a witch hazel solution. She also sprinkled baking powder into her hair to absorb the grease as it got dirtier. But, for a month she didn’t properly wash her hair or shower. She said: “I almost got used to it by the end, but I could tell I was smelly. I was committed to completing it though. “By the end of it, Kurt joked ‘Thank god you’re allowed to shower now’. So much dead skin came away in that first shower – it was almost like I had cocooned myself. We did wash the baby though as we wanted to keep him clean. There was more to confinement than not washing however, and Terry adhered to strict rules covering physical exertion and staying indoors. For 30 days she read books and spent time with her baby, but did not even open her windows or venture into the garden.

A jury also heard how Ian Robertson\u0027s nine-year-old son was upstairs while he carried out the brutal attack on Robert Sempey. Robertson had used a voice recorder on his mobile phone to capture himself asking the fatally wounded 37-year-old “how are you still alive?” after the frenzied attack at his home in Beilby Road, Haydock. Mr Sempey\u0027s family cried in Liverpool Crown Court as they heard how twisted Robertson asked his victim: “Do you want to tell your kids you love them?”  The court heard how Robertson later texted his boss asking for help burying the body, the Liverpool Echo reports.  Robertson, 33, has been jailed for life with a minimum of 21 years in prison at Liverpool Crown Court today after admitting murder.  The court heard his partner Kirsty Jervis, 31, who also lived in Beilby Road, helped the killer clean up after the murder and failed to raise the alarm. She was locked up for two years and eight months after admitting assisting an offender. The court heard “old friends” Robertson and Mr Sempey met at a pub in St Helens before returning to Robertson\u0027s home to continue drinking on the evening of January 19 this year. Christopher Tehrani, QC, prosecuting, said the pair had argued during the night and that witnessed described Robertson as “bullying” Mr Sempey, who was described as polite and friendly. At one point Robertson stabbed Mr Sempey in the arm and punched him, but even then the pair calmed down and continued to socialise. However Robertson\u0027s son saw them fighting again that night, with Mr Sempey holding a knife to defend himself, before being told to go to bed by his father. Judge Andrew Menary, QC, passing sentence, told Robertson: “I am sure that Robert Sempey was not then intent on causing you harm so much as attempting to defend himself from the threat posed by you. “Given the terrible injuries suffered by him and the complete lack of injury suffered by you, you must have quickly overpowered him, retrieved the knife and used it to butcher this man. “What you did then beggars belief.  Having fatally wounded him, but while he was apparently conscious, you used your mobile phone to record his last dying minutes.” Judge Menary said the recording was “too shocking” to be played in court but ordered that whenever Robertson\u0027s sentence is reviewed, decades from now, it should be heard by a Parole Board. He said: “On it you can be heard clearly and calmly talking to Mr Sempey, asking him with feigned incredulity why he was still alive despite what you had done to him. “Mockingly, you ask him if he wants to tell his children that he loves them you tell him he\u0027s like the Terminator while you hum the tune to the movie and ask him if he wants you to stab him in the throat again or in the heart.” The court heard between four and six “thuds”on the audio recording, consistent with further knife wounds being inflicted on Mr Sempey\u0027s chest. A post-mortem exam revealed a horrendous category of injuries, including around 12 knife wounds to the throat, chest and abdomen. The court heard Robertson enlisted the help of Jervis, who had been sitting upstairs with the children. She cleaned the house while at some point Robertson dragged Mr Sempey\u0027s mutilated body into the garden, where it was partially covered by two old doors. Shockingly, the court heard how his son heard him asking Jervis for help with the body. The following day Mr Sempey was reported missing by his sister and police attended.

Charlie Bartlett climbed the crane while still dressed in his dinner suit and was not found until the next morning when a construction worker found his body at the former site of the BBC studios in Manchester. Tragedy struck after Charles, who was in his first year of a computer science degree at Manchester University, told another student attending the Owens Park Ball that his supply of the recreational drug had run out. Tests showed that he would have been the equivalent of three times the drink drive limit when he lost his footing on the crane and plummeted to the platform below.  His untimely death on the 7th May came just weeks after his parents sat down to have a proper parent chat with Charles regarding his habitual drug use. The teenager, a former pupil at the \u0026pound21,600 a year Kings College School in Wimbledon, had been captain of his house rugby team and hoped to use his cyber expertise to one day work for surveillance agency GCHQ. But an inquest into Charles\u0027 death heard that he would regularly smoke cannabis and would also take cocaine, MDMA or Ecastasy ketamine. He is also believed to have used the tranquilliser Xanax which he is said to have acquired through the dark web. Despite friend Sylvia Copley telling the hearing that Charles was a very safe drug user, he had recently been asked to leave student halls because of his drug use.  His eviction from halls was the first time Charles\u0027 parents were given any indication that he was a regular drug user. The inquest heard that Charles had been upset in the week before he died after arguing with his mother on the phone. Miss Copley told the hearing: He was nervous because he thought she had found a package of drugs delivered to his house. He was nervous to return home to potentially receive a telling off. However Miss Copley added that on the night of the tragedy, there was nothing out of the ordinary about Charles\u0027 behaviour. When you\u0027re with him, he makes everyone around him feel really happy all of the time, she said. On that evening Charlie was drinking wine, and had also taken ketamine but he told me that he had ran out at about 10-11pm.

Kyle Yule was murdered after being spotted sat alone in a silver Renault Clio when it was surrounded by the five thugs who smashed the windows and slashed a tyre .  New video which can only be shown for the first time today shows how they chased him down a street - before stabbing him to death. Kyle ran from the car to a friend’s house but as he banged on the door was knifed five times by the gang who ignored his pleas for mercy. A court heard how he was heard pleading with gang leader and pharmaceutical science student Victor Maibvisira, 19, known as Vee: “Vee stop, I’ve had enough. I get the point.” One of the knife blows from Maibvisira pieced his right armpit and severed an artery.  The hooded and masked teenagers then fled on foot or bikes, leaving Kyle bleeding to death in the front garden. He died on the operating table The murder in Gillingham in Kent last October was a culmination of a feud when the gang accused one of Kyle\u0027s friends of stealing a bike. Just five days before the murder CCTV captured Maibvisira, Ephrain Akinwunmi-Streets, 17, and Shezakia Daley, 18, attempted to attack two men outside a pub with machetes, knives and a belt. All five admitted being there but denied stabbing Kyle. Maibvisira and Daleywere were the only two to give evidence, each blaming the other for inflicting the fatal blow. But after a trial at Maidstone Crown Court all five were convicted of murder and sentenced today.  Maibvisira was handed the longest minimum sentence of 24 years while Akinwunmi-Streets, Daley, Tyler Ralph, 17, and Jordan Dania, 16, were given a minimum of 16 years. Kyle\u0027s mother Nikki Yule wept as she read out a moving victim impact statement to the packed court the murder of her eldest child of four was savage She told the five teenagers: The night you took the life of my beautiful loved son has ruined my family\u0027s life forever. Ms Yule said Kyle was looking forward to his 18th birthday in November last year, but never got to celebrate it.  He said “His funeral was two days after his birthday. To those involved in taking his life, how dare you sit there and look forward to your birthday? “He will never get to see another birthday or Christmas again. He will never get married, never have children, never have a chance to see his brothers and sisters grow up. She branded the five “cowards running around with knives” and added: Nobody has the right to take somebody else’s life. That night I have been told my son was screaming, begging you to stop, and you just carried on.  “He would not hurt anyone. He was not in a gang. He would not start a fight. I know my baby was petrified. He never stood a chance. Sentencing Judge Adele Williams said: This case illustrates the problems which occur when young men such as you carry knives and use knives. “You all had a fascination with knives. I have no doubt you all thought it was glamorous and macho to carry a knife. “You, Ephrain Akinwunmi-Streets, said in interview you all sometimes wore masks to scare people. You all though it would make people look up to you and to fear you. “You were all running out of control at this time. You believed the law did not apply to you. During the trial, you all sought to blame each other. “This was a revenge attack upon another group. “It was a senseless, ruthless and calculated killing, for which not one of you has at any stage shown any sign of remorse.” Maibvisira, of Gillingham, Akinwunmi-Streets, from Sittingbourne, Ralph, from Stevenage, Hertfordshire, Daley, 18, of Gillingham, and Dania, from Croydon, south London, all denied murder and violent disorder but were found guilty last week.

Siberian-born Pletnyova, head of the Russian parliamentary family committee, said young women should “get something clear in their heads regarding foreigners”.  She warned about mixed-race children from such liaisons, as she said happened after the 1980 Moscow Olympics. And Western men could “snatch” babies from them, she claimed, urging Russian women to have relationships with men from their own country. But Alexander Rolbinov, 53, deputy premier in Kaliningrad, accused Pletnyova of turning the clock back to Soviet times. “It reminded me of a phrase during a televised conference between the USSR and America,” he said. “When asked about sex, (a Russian woman) said that we do not have sex in the Soviet Union. “But the heart wants what it wants. “Love will surely come. “And as for international marriages, in such families appear very beautiful children.”  Moscow\u0027s top WAG however backed the call for Russian women to say no to sex with foreign football fans. Inna Zhirkova, 28, wife of ex-Chelsea star Yuri Zhirkov, said: “I totally agree that during the World Cup it is better not to have any sexual relations with foreigners. “We are decent girls.” Inna was declared winner of an extraordinary contest by a Russian women’s online magazine to find the country’s “hottest” WAG. In the contest run by Spletnik online magazine, also known as Russian Tatler, former Miss Kaliningrad Inna took first place. Inna - who has lived in London - strongly backed Pletnyova, saying she only ever wanted a Russian husband.  But she admitted people fall in love at first sight and it doesn’t depend on the nationality. “It is complicated for me to say, as I always dreamed about a Russian husband, she said. “And I have a Russian husband. I got married quite early.” Journalist and TV presenter Yelena Khanga accused Pletnyova of making “immoral” comments about mixed-race children.

It sees Debbie Ocean, played by Sandra Bullock, attempt to steal a \u0026pound113million diamond necklace from Anne Hathaway’s film star character. She enlists Cate Blanchett, Sarah Paulson, Rihanna and Awkwafina to help pull off the heist at the star-studded Met Gala in New York. While the fictional gang have set themselves an ambitious target, there are some real-life con women who have pulled off even more impressive scams. Jeane De Valois-Saint-Remy Jeanne was born to a poor family in 18th-century France. Disappointed with her lot, and the lifestyle her husband offered, she decided to con her way to riches.  She heard that a jeweller was trying to sell an diamond necklace to King Louis XVI for his queen, Marie Antoinette. But he was refusing to buy it. So Jeanne saw an opportunity. She took a gigolo, Retaux de Villette, as her lover. She then became the mistress of Cardinal Prince Louis de Rohan, who wanted desperately to befriend Marie Antoinette. Jeanne got Retaux to forge letters from Antoinette to the cardinal, claiming she and Jeanne were friends, and asking if he would lend her cash to buy the necklace. Jeanne set up a meeting between the cardinal and the “queen”, played by a lookalike prostitute. The cardinal was fooled and went to buy the necklace, giving it to Jeanne to pass on. Jeanne fled, but was eventually arrested. She later escaped from prison and scampered to Britain. Juliette D\u0027Souza While many con women have targeted the wealthy or privileged, Juliette D’Souza sought out much more vulnerable victims. Over a period of 12 years, the fraudster, now 63, convinced people in North London that she was a shamanic healer.  She told victims she could cure terminal illnesses, help disabled children and enable women to conceive if they sent her money. She said the cash was a “sacrifice” used as a spiritual offering, and would be hung off a sacred tree in the Amazonian rainforest. Shamans would then perform rituals around the tree and their problems would be solved, she told her victims. But in 2014, a court heard how she had raked in over \u0026pound1million, and spent money on luxury flats in Hampstead, holidays, designer handbags, clothes and watches. She was convicted of 23 counts of obtaining property by deception and fraud. Sentencing her to 10 years in jail, the judge said: “It seems to me that you have wrecked the lives of a number of victims and you have done it out of pure greed.” Diamond Doris Payne At the ripe age of 87, “Diamond” Doris Payne is now known as the Granny Gem Thief, but was once dubbed America’s most successful jewel robber. Doris, who was raised in West Virginia and Ohio, would dress in her finest clothes, go to a jewellery store and ask staff to show her a number of diamond rings. She would try to confuse them about how many they had taken out to show her, and slip one into her handbag. She would then ask to see that ring, causing a panic when they couldn’t locate it. Doris would then come to the rescue by apparently finding it.  Having earned the staff’s trust, she would then walk out unsuspected, having swiped another ring during the commotion. One of her biggest hauls was in Monte Carlo in the 70s, when she stole a \u0026pound283,OOO, 10-carat diamond ring from Cartier, after being inspired by the novel To Catch a Thief. Doris was sentenced to three years, but claims authorities never found the ring. She said in a 2014 film: “I looked at that ring and saw nine zeros. The first thing I said to myself was, ‘You should not have done this’.”  She has been arrested at least 22 times – once in 2015 on suspicion of stealing diamond earrings while on parole – but only convicted a handful of times. Authorities claim she’s had 20 identities with nine different dates of birth. She said in 2015: “There’s never been a day that I went to steal that I did not get what I went to do. I don’t have any regrets about stealing jewellery. I regret getting caught.” Last year, she vowed to give up her life as an outlaw, after pleading guilty to the rather less glamorous crime of stealing \u0026pound70 worth of items from a Walmart store. Rachel Lee and The Bling Ring Savvy Rachel Lee loved two things – celebrities and jewels – thus the infamous Bling Ring was born. The eight-strong posse were all obsessed with reality TV, and despite having a privileged life in Los Angeles, they wanted more. So they worked out when stars such as Paris Hilton and Orlando Bloom were out at events, and raided their homes, stealing jewellery and designer clothes.  Over several months, Lee and her group stole around \u0026pound1.3million in jewels and valuables from Hilton. And in May 2009, the Ring burgled The OC actress Rachel Bilson’s house five times, and also raided Bloom’s Rolex collection. In all, the gang took nearly \u0026pound3million worth of merchandise from celebrities, but eventually got caught. In 2011, Lee was sentenced to four years in prison, serving two. Her prison coach said after she got parole: “Rachel has gotten lots of therapy. She’s gotten clean and sober, and closer to her mum.” In 2013, her story was turned into a film called The Bling Ring. Alice Diamond and The Forty Elephant Gang This shoplifting girl gang was run by the aptly named Alice Diamond, born to a convict father in Elephant and Castle, South London. In the early 1900s, she became the leader of a group of thieves who would steal from luxury department stores and use their wiles to get into exclusive hotels.  Posing as posh, they conned their way into jobs in rich households – using fake references and names – in a bid to steal valuables and clothes. They were caught and jailed repeatedly but thought it was worth it to avoid poverty. Alice died in 1952, aged 55, of multiple sclerosis. Barbara Erni In the 18th century, Barbara Erni, from Liechtenstein, was one of the most prolific thieves in Europe. She used an ingenious ruse to get her fortune. Born to a homeless couple, Barbara learned to graft from a young age. She came up with a scam where she would dress as a wealthy woman and turn up at inns and hotels with a large suitcase. She would tell the owners that it contained expensive treasures and had to be kept in the best room in the hotel overnight.

Researchers watched as the black hole\u0027s gravity grabbed the star - twice the size of the sun- and tore it apart. The star came too close to the hole, which was more than 20 million times as big as the sun. Scientists saw what happened as the vast blast thrown out by the hole was launched like a fast-moving jet.  They saw the blast happen for the first time and were able to do so using special telescopes, the Independent reports.   These telescopes are trained on colliding galaxies almost 15million light-years from Earth. It was in the middle of one of these galaxies that the star was torn apart. Miguel Perez-Torres, of the Astrophysical Institute of Andalusia in Granada, Spain, said: Never before have we been able to directly observe the formation and evolution of a jet from one of these events.

It would support the artists and their work.”OpenClose will be hosting a market in August at Stobswell’s Celebration in the Park event, at which artists will be selling their

Neil told us that if he thinks young players are good enough he’ll stick them in and he’s done that.“That’s great for us and a great selling point if we’re trying to convince kids to join us rather than somebody else because you can see the pathway.”The former Livi, Coventry and Hibs man has learned plenty – good and bad – from every coach he’s come across but very much plans to be his own man.“I’ve picked up lots from the managers I’ve worked under – Chris Coleman at Coventry was great and so have Paul Hartley and Neil McCann been at Dundee.“I try to get bits and pieces from all the coaches I see, whether it’s good, bad or indifferent, and mould it all into the way I want to coach.“Being able to text guys like Chris Coleman and pick their brains is fantastic.“I’ve also seen some very, very bad things over my career and want to do the opposite!“I’ve got my own take on how I want to go about it and the way I want the game played.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/ms-car-park.jpg ","title":"dundee supermarket car park could get cameras to monitor number plates","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPlanning permission is being sought for automatic number plate recognition cameras at the car park at Marks \u0026amp Spencer in Broughty Ferry.Member of the council’s planning committee will be asked to approve two cameras at the car park at the Simply Food store on Brook Street.A report to go before councillors stated: “Two cameras would be fixed to the west elevation of the building and an associated wall-mounted cabinet is also proposed on the south elevation.“The cameras would identify registration plates for cars entering and leaving the car park.“The cameras are proposed to assist with the day to day running and management of the car park while reducing long-term running costs for the supermarket.“The system would allow customers to access short stay free parking while visiting the shop.”The report added: “One objection has been received from neighbours on grounds of privacy and overlooking.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/794603-806x564.jpg ","title":"dundee uniteds 25 mile rule worked for kids under jim mclean but might prove difficult attracting experienced pros","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWhen Dundee United chairman Mike Martin last week announced the club would restore a historic rule from Jim McLean’s era, it sparked a host of memories for former defender Jackie Copland.\u0026nbspThe ex-Terror, who played for the Tannadice club from 1970-76, was a defensive stalwart under McLean – who brought him to the club from Stranraer after a spell in the juniors with Beith.As a young player, Jackie was subject to McLean’s rule that players must reside in the Tayside area while playing for the club.Something not dissimilar to Martin’s vision of Csaba Laszlo’s squad living within a 25-mile radius of the city.Jackie, who started and finished his football career at boyhood heroes St Mirren, admits the move will have pros and cons for United.“When I first moved up to Dundee it was a rule that you had to stay within the local area,” he said.“The club had a hostel in Broughty Ferry for young players, the likes of Walter Smith stayed there.“He would stay there during the week and travel home to the west at the weekend, like a lot of boys did.“I think it was beneficial as it gave the manager a chance to assess the young players.“It was fine at first but when I became a senior player I wasn’t happy with it.“I spoke to Jim McLean and, eventually, made an agreement that I would travel up with Andy Gray from Glasgow every day.“Trying to get senior players to come through might, obviously, become an issue. However, a few guys like Alan Gordon would travel through from Edinburgh.“It may be difficult, now, to get experienced players to relocate with the commitments they have like young kids and houses – that could cause an issue for Csaba.“That’s before you even get to the problem of fighting other teams financially.”Jackie left the club to re-join the Buddies for a successful period in their history from 1976-1983 before moving into various administration roles at the club.Of the move back, Jackie added: “Initially it worked at United but then it became a bit difficult.“The manager understood that and he was really good about it before I moved to St Mirren.“I always lived locally and followed the team so it felt right to move back at that time.“It’s funny how you get an association with a club and have an affinity with it.“I enjoyed my time at Tannadice as much as I did my spell at St Mirren.“Obviously, I finished my career at St Mirren and became a bit of a club legend but I still miss the Dundee days. I’m coming up in November for a reunion with the 1973/74 Scottish Cup Final team so it will be nice to catch up with everyone.”Of his former sides’ recent history, Jackie has watched United flounder from afar as St Mirren won promotion to the Premiership last season under the now-Sunderland boss Jack Ross.“Dundee United is a great club and I hope it can be restored in the top league because the fans deserve it.“St Mirren were going good.

It’s great for them to have the affiliation but it’s also great for the club to be able to spread the name of Dundee.“You see Celtic and Man U shirts all over so it’s good to see some Dundee ones as well.”McPake accepts this week will be a challenge for him to test his skills as a young coach – particularly his communication skills.“You couldn’t say football, or soccer as they call it, is the biggest sport out here but it is really growing,” he said.“The MLS is getting bigger all the time and the national team has been quite successful, though they’re not at the World Cup this year.“The kids who are starting to choose football as their sport really take it seriously and they are desperate to learn.“I’m really looking forward to it. It is a challenge for me to get the kids to understand what I’m trying to tell them.“It’s the same language – though I struggle to speak English sometimes! – but there’s a lot of different words and sayings.“It will be a wee test for me to get my point across and then see how the players react. I’ll be out of my comfort zone and that’ll be a challenge.“Last year, we went and watched some of the age groups in training and I was really impressed with the standard of players.“As a coach, its great to work with kids like this because they are so keen to learn.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"parking fees plan for local town centres scrapped","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPeople power has forced Angus Council to scrap plans to bring in parking charges in town centres.Campaigner Jill Scott warned the implementation of on-street parking charges would have turned the burghs into “tumbleweed towns”.She said: “The voices of 9,066 voters have forced the council to not just do a U-turn but to somersault away from its original plan.“I am delighted our population has recognised we do not have to lie down and accept ill-researched, money-grabbing policies that damage our high street businesses and fleece the general public.“I want to thank Councillor Bob Myles for working with me and for exerting pressure on his 27 colleagues to make them see sense.“This decision will come as a great relief to the many high street traders and their customers.

People want it open more often and to accommodate all age groups. It could be based on water fountains/jets, as in an installation in Southend which includes colour changing lighting.Another option is to create a three-storey adjacent lido with open-air pool on the top floor and spa facilities on the first floor.A further option is to take over the nearby council-owned Nairn Leisure Centre pool, give it a glass roof and create a training and competition facility to complement a lido.The lido proposal was inspired by Bath\u0027 dramatic Thermae Spa.Lessees of the neighbouring links tearoom and James\u0026rsquo Caf\u0026eacute have put forward proposals to improve their facilities.Community leaders are excited but have urged sensitive handling of the initiative.Nairn River Community Council chairman Tommy Hogg said: \"That area is part of Nairn\u0027 heritage so they\u0026rsquove got to do it sympathetically or it\u0026rsquoll cause massive problems.\"A council consultation keen to include input from local schools and youth groups is expected to follow in August.Planning officers say \"the time is ripe for a development plan\".Their report suggests building on a trail around Nairn from the Links through Viewfield and along the riverside featuring various attractions for \"people to linger, to learn about Nairn, to take part in an activity and to enjoy their surroundings\".Each point would incorporate a theme and\u0026nbspa dolphin-inspired artwork has been mooted.A draft plan is currently evolving for Nairn\u0027 77-pontoon harbour and waterfront to improve the harbour basin, surrounding buildings and maximise its potential to boost Nairn\u0027 economy.Planned projects include expansion of the pontoon system, increasing capacity to 97 boats and to develop a watersports centre.Other than driving to the links, people generally walk there as there is no public transport to the beach area.The planners say \"there may be an opportunity to operate a land train type tourist train in the summer months, taking people round the links, the harbour, Viewfield and Fishertown.\"Alternatively, there may be potential to develop a miniature railway, of the type used at Whin Park in Inverness.\"Friday 15 Jun 2018 8:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04111000/04111982.jpg","title":"Stateside search for market dog answers","story":"\u0026nbspA DETERMINED local historian is hoping a letter to America may finally solve the mystery of a faithful dog that died in a catastrophic fire in Inverness in the late 19th century.Norman Newton has been delving into the poignant tale of the canine superhero that refused to leave the butcher\u0027 shop it was guarding when the inferno destroyed what is now the Victorian Market in June 1889.The story will feature in a trailblazing digital project to be launched by Highland Council at the end of this month, bringing city legends and landmarks to life \u0026ndash but despite extensive research no one has been able to discover the dog\u0027 name.Undeterred, Mr Newton is pinning his last hopes on a Scottish-born woman now living in New York \u0026ndash the great-granddaughter of the butcher who owned the dog.\"She is perhaps the last possibility for more information about the fire and the dog through family stories,\" said Mr Newton, of Blackwell Road, Culloden.\"The rational part of me says it is unlikely.

new artistic works.A sum of £5,500 is also being given towards a Year of Young People showcase event highlighting local talent in conjunction with the Youth Ambassadors.Councillor Lesley Dunbar, vice convener for education operational delivery, said: “We have had a phenomenal response to our £100,000 Year of Young People Creative Fund and we had, in fact, a total of 30 applications for funding support totalling £133,000.“We are delighted to be able to support 20 of those projects which were successful in their applications.“It was our young people themselves who were instrumental in

deserves his chance in the Highland League.The Broch have recruited the striker from Junior side Longside.Butcher has penned a two-year deal at Bellslea after he netted over 40 goals for Longside last season.Duthie, pictured below left, and manager Mark Cowie have been aware of his quality for some time and also saw Butcher in their own side after he played a few trial games towards the end of last season.Duthie said: “We watched him a lot throughout last season and had seen him in the Juniors.“He did well and previously when I was manager of Buchanhaven Hearts I had set teams up against him.“He is a player I’ve been aware of and Mark Cowie has been aware of him as well.“Willie West’s dad Charles is the manager of Longside so he was willing to let him come along for a couple of trial games and we really appreciate that.“He played against Cove and did fine and played in a couple of other games.“He scored over 40 goals in the Juniors and his attitude is great so we thought he was worth a chance.“He knows it will be difficult and there is a lot of hard work in front of him to get into the team because we have a lot of good strikers at the club.“But he’s up for the challenge and deserves his opportunity.”Duthie believes Butcher is a good all-round striker and says it’s now up to the attacker to take his opportunity in the Highland League.Duthie added: “He’s got decent movement, his link-up play is good, he’s not too bad in the area and he’s a good finisher.“He has good attributes and we hope to try to make him a better player.“It’s a good opportunity for Sean and it was a good deal for the club because he was at the end of his contract. “So it’s up to him to take his chance.”Butcher will face plenty of competition in the Broch squad.Scott Barbour has returned from Formartine United and Gary Harris, Paul Campbell, Willie West and Graham Johnston will also want to play up front next term.Duthie believes the competition will be good for Butcher andhe can learn from his fellow attackers.He said: “Scott Barbour is back, there’s Paul Campbell, Graham Johnston, Gary Harris, Willie West.“We’ve got a lot of good strikers with experience that will help him adjust to the Highland League.“He’s a hard working lad desperate for the chance and now he’s got it, it’s down to him and us to make the most of it.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest. We can still see her face full of horror and hear her cry.Otherwise we had a lovely holiday. You have a most beautiful part of the country to live in.Name and address supplied.Sir,It has been announced recently a Scottish Conservative government would invest £100 million into fixing potholes over the course of the next parliament.We all rely on our roads but they are now plagued with potholes which are damaging cars. Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade.

This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity.

These had a variety of riding and control of paces challenges including an unusual off piste element using the quarry area of the field.Judge Debbie Hay Thorburn was very impressed with the independent riding of the youngest members who tackled all the tasks with confidence and determination. The show jumping catered for all ages and abilities and there were exciting jump-offs to entertain spectators. In fact many of the passing ferry passengers stopped to watch from the road.The new timing equipment, purchased with aid of a grant from Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust, was in full use by judge Mairi Henderson and made for more professional accuracy in timing aspects.The final Grand Prix had only two competitors but it was a masterclass of style and competence from Jojo and Katie which made it a joy to watch.As usual the event ended with some fast and exciting games and after the field was cleared there was the prizegiving in the Pony Club’s brand new blue tent.The Junior Trophy for the day was won by Louise Ralston from Campbeltown and Iris McMillan from Tayvallich took the Senior Trophy for a second year while the non-members trophy was won by Andrea McShannon.Pony Club PonyClass 11 Frazer Prentice, Firefly2 Louise Ralston, Nero3 Rory Shaw, Libby4 Jake Rowan, AliceClass 21 Willow Ryan, Ryan2 Zoe Prentice, Cowal3 Isla McShannon, ColeyClass 31 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Katie MacKay, Eva3 Josephine Boase, ValerieClass 41 Andrea McShannon, Nicole2 Julie McLeish, Eclipse3 Shelagh Oakes, Pery4 Catriona Ryan, DoneyShow JumpingStars of the Future \u0026#8211 Lead Rein1 Louise Ralston, Nero2 Frazer Prentice, Firefly3 Rory Shaw, Libby4 Jake Rowan, AliceStars of the Future1 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Zoe Prentice, Cowal3 Isla McShannon, Coley4 Willow Ryan, RyanNewcomers1 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Andrea McShannon, Nicole3 Michelle McAloon, Eclipse4 Catriona Ryan, DoneyDiscovery1 Josephine Boase, Valerie2 Andrea McShannon, Nicole3 Katie MacKay, Eva4 Michelle McAloon, EclipseGrand Prix1 Josephine Boase, Valerie2 Katie MacKay, Eva\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 07/06/18, 4:46 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.This week\u0026#8217s photograph comes from Jacqui Barker of Tarbert.

After a pit stop in the Royal Burgh it was on to Fort William, then Inverness and back home again- all to raise money for Cancer Research UK and Target Ovarian Cancer.Spokesperson for Breast Way Round, Laura White, said: ‘This year was full of fun, laughter, meeting new family members and although the daily miles are hard going, the weather and the beauty of the Scottish scenery made it that little bit easier.’As well as the sponsored trek, the bikers raised money in more traditional ways, such as bucket shaking (the men wearing bras) and hosting a raffle and auction in Caol Community Centre. The most coveted item, a patchwork quilt made by rider Cathy Anderson, went for a whopping £700.The annual trip was started in 2008 by Shirley-Ann McKnight as a last tour of Scotland for fellow biker and close friend, Alyson Porter, who was suffering from cancer. Sadly, Alyson never made it to her trip and now each year the journey is retraced in celebration of her life and all those affected by cancer.Since 2008, more than 600 riders have participated, each clad with a pink mohawk courtesy of Hairy-RS, and the team has raised £347,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.

They won a throw-in deep in the Glasgow Red Star half, taken by Craig Aitken. After playing a neat one-two with Woody Hoad, Craig sent in a teasing cross for Keiran Caskie to glance past the Glasgow Red Star keeper.Lochgilphead introduced Jamie Stewart and Ciaran Gibson who helped freshen things up and work hard to close the game out.Special mention to subs Lee Harris, just returning from injury, and the ever reliable Calum Paterson.At the end of the game the Lochgilphead boys were presented with the League Cup and also the League Championship for 2004 age group teams to make it a double celebration.With three games still left to play the boys are looking to make it through the season with only one league defeat.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/06/18, 3:50 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.The last thing David MacInnes sees himself as is a hero.Be we believe differently.

The pair were seeded car 30 in the two wheel drive section, run first on the day in a new schedule being piloted by the rally, the two wheel drive cars covering the stages before the four wheel drive cars followed in the afternoon.With the dry conditions in the weeks running up to the event dust would be the main problem for those running further down the field. Douglas attacked the first stage, Twiglees, and was catching the car in front when, unfortunately due to the dust being created by that car, came out of a 90 degree corner with zero visibility and connected heavily with a rock, damaging the suspension and forcing his early retirement.The car, and the driver, are noticeably quicker  each event they compete in and it\u0026#8217s only a matter of time before the results are there.The other Argyll car out on the stages was Ally Currie from Mull and Grant McNiven in the Ford Fiesta ST picking up 9th overall and 1st in Class 6.The next round of the Scottish Championship is Argyll Rally, based in Dunoon on June 23 \u0026#8211 the closest round for most Argyll rally enthusiasts and one not to be missed. The stages look absolutely breathtaking this year and well worth a watch.The Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship continues as well with round three being the Granite at Leuchars Stages hosted by Aberdeen and District Motor Club at the MOD base in Leuchars, Fife.Argyll was well represented both in the drivers seat and the co-drivers. All Argyll crew Willie and Steven Beattie were out in the newly finished and beautifully finished Escort MkII. They were absolutely flying and really getting to grips with the car when a sixth gear lock-up threw them into a spin and off the stage, clouting a fairly substantial fence post in the process.The navigators side now looks decidedly second hand, but nothing a few hours in the workshop won\u0026#8217t sort. A bent bottom suspension arm put paid to them re-joining but they will take the positives and the blistering pace into the next round for sure.Willie Beattie Snr in his equally exquisite Escort was also beginning to get the hang of the car, with some more seat time this year, not to mention experienced co-driver, Phil Sandham, pushing him on. He, after making sure his boys were okay when they didn\u0026#8217t show up at service after their spin, continued on to secure 12th overall and second in class: his first honours since building the car.The next round may see some family ties severely stretched, at least until the final results are announced.Ian Parker was also out in familiar machinery, co-driving for Fraser Smith in his Canal Garage-prepared Honda Civic. The pair were also making good progress up the class rankings until the diff decided to implode and finished their rally on Stage six.The drive of the day was not in question. Alan Kirkaldy led from start to finish despite some interesting issues in the first test. His door came loose after about a third of stage and he continued, holding the door shut by the open window whilst steering, changing gear and waving with the other.Astonishingly he still managed quickest stage time by five seconds. His co-driver for the day could forgive himself for being a little green about the gills after that.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was lucky enough to win the seat in a charity auction at the Annual STRC Dinner earlier in the year. An experience he is unlikely to forget in a hurry, although some of the memories may be a little bit blurry and perhaps just a little sideways. The top three were rounded out by Ian Forgan, ably guided round in his Subaru by his daughter in her first rally and the final position on the podium went to Ian and Allan Paterson, also in a Subaru.The next round is this weekend at Crail where the Beattie boys will be back out, Ian Parker swaps a Civic for an Escort MKII and Donald Bowness is set to get back out in the Nova.PICS:Photos: Gavin Brown, West Coast PhotosRed Escort (Car 1) Alan Kirkaldy/Eoghan Anderson (first overall) no_a24rally01\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"cadets flag up lochgilpheads big day","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 14/06/18, 1:03 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAfter weeks of brilliant sunshine, the weather took a turn for the damp just in time for the flag raising ceremony.This annual midweek event marks the beginning of Lochgilphead Armed Forces Day commemorations, and cadets from D (Argyll) Company ignored the rain to perform the flag raising with their usual efficiency.\u0026nbspThe flag was saluted as it was raised accompanied by tunes from piper John Hunt, before Lochgilphead Armed Forces Day chairman Geordie Rhodick inspected the assembled cadets and thanked them for their attendance.Lochgilphead Armed Forces Day will take place on Saturday June 16, starting at midday with a march down Argyll Street from the Drill Hall, followed by a parade on the front green and an afternoon of fun activities for all the family.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"high tech preparation for mid argyll art show","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 14/06/18, 7:45 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThis year has seen a lot of preparatory work ahead of the 2018 Mid Argyll Art Society exhibition in August.The popular show will again be held in the Drill Hall, Lochgilphead and will run from August 6-11.As in the last few years, the Mid Argyll Camera Club will have photos on display.The society is harnessing modern technology in a campaign to raise the profile of this year\u0026#8217s event.There is now a Mid Argyll Art Society Facebook page that can be used to get updates on what is happening.There will shortly be a website giving details about the art society, its history, information on the exhibition and how to participate, and photos of past exhibits to give a flavour of what the event is like.A lot of work has been done on modernising the entry process.

There is also a small fee to be paid by each exhibitor for every painting or photo that is hung, and this goes to help to cover running expenses.With over 500 people having visited the exhibition in 2017, organisers hope this excellent support from the community will continue. Both professional and amateur artists in the area are encouraged to make use of the exhibition to display their work.The overriding aim of the exhibition, since its beginning in 1967, has always been to foster interest in locally-produced art and to give people from the community the opportunity to let others see, appreciate, and maybe buy their works.Organisers wish to thank the Army Cadet Force for permission to use their building.Details about how to enter exhibits will appear in adverts in the Argyllshire Advertiser, Facebook and on the exhibition website.

The astonishing cave-in by wobbling South Ayrshire Council came amidst a 1700-name petition signed by furious residents and businesses. The council ARE pressing ahead with fees at a third Troon car park, at Bellevue in Prestwick and Ayr Blackburn. They argued the \u0026pound2 charge would destroy much-needed trade and lead to chaos in surrounding streets in Troon The U-turn was revealed by Councillor Craig Mackay at Troon Community Council last Tuesday. He managed to finally nail down an answer from his officials, admitting: “This issue has caused confusion within the council.” There will be no charges at the car park at the Walker Hall or the Italian Gardens.  But council officers are pressing ahead with a \u0026pound2 fee at the South Beach car park next to Royal Troon. This lead to anger from Community Councillor Robert Milligan, who said: “I suggest if you are going to charge for South Beach you actually need to provide loos, even temporary between May and September, to meet demand. If people are paying for parking the least we can do is to have toilet facilities without peeing in the dunes. “People are urinating in the sand dunes and residents can see it from their houses.” At the community council police revealed Troon only gets a traffic warden once every 2.8 days. And townspeople feared cars would be abandoned on the streets rather than pay for parking. The Ayrshire Post has led the way on the issue, revealing Troon has NEVER had to pay parking fees. Councillor Mackay said: “ We were working on the basis of parking charges being introduced to three car parks in Troon.  “I had a meeting with senior officers to discuss concerns of residents and businesses, in particular at the Walker Hall. “The knock-on conserquences are complex, particularly with displacement into residential streets.” He finally got an admission the council were axing the charges in a statement from SNP party colleague Ian Cochrane. Councillor Mackay added: “I was still struggling to get full clarity. “Traffic Orders are being progressed at Royal Troon, Belevue Road in Prestwick and Blackburn Road in Ayr. “It came as a surprise to me as the statement said no other parking charges are proposed at this time and that is quite a changes from what we were looking at.” Troon council vice-chairman Dougie Graham added: “We will wait to see what happens.” Five days after being asked for a comment on the U-turn, South Ayrshire Council would only say: “We’re currently finalising plans for the introduction of charges at Blackburn Road, Bellevue Road and Troon seafront car parks – all of which will require a new Traffic Regulation Order (TRO). We’ll soon be getting the TRO process underway, which will include a period of public consultation, and further details on this will be shared in due course.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12539593.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/14478946.jpg","title":"lawrence shankland agrees new deal","story":"NewsLawrence Shankland agrees new deal to stay at Ayr United for Championship pushThe 29-goal striker has put pen to paper on a new deal at Somerset Park.\u0026nbspShareByStuart WilsonLochlin Highet13:14, 15 MAY 2018Updated13:18, 15 MAY 2018NewsShankland is staying on at Somerset (Image: Daily Record)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLawrence Shankland insists money can’t buy happiness after he sensationally spurned a host of lucrative offers to pen a new deal at Ayr United.

Shankland, 22, told the Ayrshire Post: “It’s a great club to be a part of. The main thing for this decision is that I am enjoying my football. The gaffer has been great with me and that’s why I came here. He gave me a chance to get back into football. I am happy and I don’t think there’s any amount of money that beats happiness.

Boss Ian McCall said: Lawrence could have doubled his money elsewhere and had offers from the Premiership up here and League One down in England. But the affection he has had from our supporters has played a huge part in his decision. It’s a huge piece of business for this club. Be in no doubt that Lawrence could easily have gone, but he has made a footballing decision.

Mhari said: “We had the perfect day with amazing weather and a beautiful sunset.  “All our closest friends and family joined us for a simple but loving ceremony carried out by Peter Clark of the Scottish Humanist Society.” The bride wore a Mori lee dress from Bijoux Bridal, Hamilton. Mhari’s veil held a special sentimental value to it. She said: “The veil is 25 years old which was worn by my aunt on her wedding day.” The groom and best men wore Grey Spirit kilts from Slaters, Ayr. The couple’s wedding party consisted of bridesmaids Sara Bryce (bride’s sister) and Lyndsey Bickerton and best men Grant Russell and Mark Rowe (groom’s brother).

Mhari added: “Both Barrie and Jim were fantastic all day, with us and all the guests. “The pictures are just too hard to pick from.” Stems and Gems in Saltcoats created the bouquets, buttonholes and flowers for the centrepieces while the cake was made by a relative.

Stuart Laing gets a glittering OBE for nearly 50 years hard graft in the shiny world of jewellery. And Kirsty Letton is now an MBE after more than four decades of dedication to Scottish curling. That they live within 500 yards of each other in Troon is highly noteworthy in that NOBODY else who lives in mainland Ayrshire received anything this year. Stuart,68, has been honoured not just for running the family’s firm Laings, but his foundation of a UK consortium that allowed independents to flourish. He said: “I am thrilled and delighted to speak about it . . . this has been very difficult not to mention.  “I am proud and honoured, but also very humbled as well.” In 1970 he joined the family firm which was begun 130 years earlier. He expanded it to seven branches and started the Houlden (his mother’s maiden name) buying and professional services group for independent jewellers. Stuart remains active as executive chairman of Laings, though his son-in-law Joe Walsh is now chief executive. The father-of-three and now grandad-to-five has been such an influence in the jewellery market he’s regarded by the trade throughout the world. He said: “Strengthening and creating a strong, independent retail sector and giving the UK industry a global identity has been extremely rewarding.” “But this honour is for my entire family and colleagues as a lot of people have been with me on this journey.”  Stuart and his wife Lynda have three children - son Simon and daughters Susanna Laing, and Wendy Walsh. Stuart added: “I would like to pay tribute to my wife Lynda, she has been a wonderful support, a real rock. “We have travelled the globe together representing the UK trade.” He also created the ‘Jewellers of Excellence’ brand, which is a hallmark of trust within the industry. Stuart has been involved in all aspects of the industry and was the only UK Director of SIHH (Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie), a renowned association of the best jewellers in the world, in co-operation with high-end watch houses. Curling champion and coach Kirsty Letton reckons her MBE is an accolade for the entire sport. She says: “Of course I am thrilled and proud. It was a big surprise, I must admit.”  And so are the family - husband Jimmy and children Avril, who now lives in Ascot, and Keith who is in Grenada. Superfit Kirsty - now a 77-year-old grandmother of three - is still playing on the rink as well as coaching at Ayr and manages to find the time to grab an oar for some coastal rowing. Last year she picked up a Sportscotland lifetime volunteering award. And although moving to Ayrshire 21 years ago and joining the Troon Portland club the link with her orginal Glasgow four has never been broken. The highlight of Kirsty’s playing career was winning senior silver in the World Championships in Finland in 2008. She is particularly proud of motivating South Ayrshire primary pupils to have fun on the ice, with 269 youngsters participating in her taster sessions last season.  As well as inspiring the stars of tomorrow, Kirsty instigated the strongly contested World Senior Curling Championships in 2000. She also set up the Glynhill Ladies Curling International event, which attracts world-class teams. Kirsty added: “I don’t know where I would be without curling. It has been a huge part of my life for 40 years. “Last week Ayr Curling Club got the active schools gold award for South Ayrshire and it is things like that which keep me going.” Ayrshire’s Lord-Lieutenant Iona McDonald congratulated the pair. She said: “They have made a considerable contribution to our communities and I am sure that this award comes as a great surprise, as many of them do not seek any recognition for the work that they do. •The Edinburgh-based business grandee Sir Brian Gammell Ivory, gets a CBE for his chairmanship role at Dumfries House.

The bill for absent workers comes on the back of 42,736 days lost during the last 12 months. Employees recorded an average of nine days on the sick during 2017/18. Psychological reasons (30 per cent) were cited as the leading cause for absence, followed by musculoskeletal (19 per cent) and hospitalisation (12 per cent). By far the biggest service to feel the strain was the Health and Social Care Partnership, where an average of 16 days per employee was lost. Teachers, who account for 23 per cent of the council’s workforce, were the best performing ‘directorate’ with a loss of just five days per worker.  All figures were recorded between April 1, 2017 and March 31, 2018. Council officials said trends were showing a “gradual and consistent improvement”. An average of 11.7 days were lost to absence by local government employees (all staff bar teachers) in 2010. The revised figure stands at 10.06 days for 2017/18. A council spokesman said they were “committed” to supporting staff and have a “number of policies and supports in place to maximise employee attendance”. They added: “In recent years, more robust monitoring and reporting arrangements have been introduced which have seen a steady improvement in this area, with our figures below the national average. “We continue to closely monitor employee attendance levels and take all appropriate steps to ensure appropriate standards.” "},{"url":null,"title":"A7 driver was almost five times the legal limit","story":"A MOTORIST who was almost five times the legal alcohol limit while driving on the A7 has been banned from the road for 14 months at Selkirk Sheriff Court.\nHeather Condon had a breath/alcohol count of 103 microgrammes - the legal limit being 22 - after police caught up with her at Heriot on March 9 last year.\nThe 42-year-old of Moss Place, Livingston, had denied the offence but was found guilty after a trial.\nIn addition to the disqualification period, she was fined \u0026pound400.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Lowood Bridge closure  SBC release update","story":"GOOD news for motorists - council bosses have confirmed that works to Lowood Bridge are set to be complete in time for Melrose Festival Week.\nThe project is in its final stages and remains on schedule to be completed by Monday, June 18, the day of the Melrosian Rideout.\nSo far, the temporary scaffolding has been removed, which means works on the bridge deck area can start.\nRepairs to the bridge\u0027s stonework are now complete, as well as resurfacing of the Waverley Road/Lowood Road junction.

It might make you laugh.Somewhere along the line, in the last five or six years, the world seems to have developed a serious crack in its funny bone.And I do mean serious, no crack intended.And there I go again, being flippant, trying to raise a smile in one or two readers, even if it might resemble a risus sardonicus. (It’s how people on Sardinia used to grin, that’s why.)It’s a congenital condition – like my idiocy, claims my wife– that ever since I was young I made outrageous statements and people would say to me: \u0026#8216You can’t be serious.\u0026#8217 \u0026#8216Not on a regular basis, no,\u0026#8217 was my usual reply.For the greater part of my 70-odd years, while laughter was still an acceptable knee-jerk reaction to almost anything, I prospered, in a vaguely penniless way, as a freelance writer of would-be humorous journalism.Nothing too fancy, no slipping on banana skins, but not rocket science either.  (Although the rotation of the Earth really makes my day.)In retrospect, I see now that my humour wasn’t serious enough. It had no underlying message.  It had no sociological content.  It was not of the variety that allowed people to feel wise, nod wisely, and say something wise, like: \u0026#8216Very wise…\u0026#8217The mistakes of the past – of my past – included trying to make people lose control and laugh aloud, rather than just being able to smirk knowingly at my cleverness, if I ever was.We live in a much more buttoned-up, uptight and insecure society than we used to (do you feel my sociological message approaching?) and it has affected the sort of things we feel we are permitted to laugh at, or not permitted to laugh at.Scorn and ridicule can no longer be directed at certain people with impunity – the dishonourable exception being bankers and politicians, of course, who are still fair game, and rightly so, even if out on bail and technically innocent because they haven’t been charged yet.But when did you last hear a blitz of jokes from a television comedian about a small, ethnic, obese, female bishop, even if she was his mother-in-law?Don’t worry, the news isn’t all bad, and I can report that sometimes outbreaks of laughter can occur in the most unusual places – Dundee, for example – and at the most unexpected times.Not long ago I saw a funeral procession led by a slow-marching, black-suited chaplain who was laughing his head off as he walked along in front of the hearse.As I watched in amazement, his happy demeanour began to affect his slow progress, which became a sprightly strut, and it seemed at any moment he might twirl his top hat in his hands, or even produce a rabbit from it.Only when I caught sight of the wireless device attached to his ear did I guess he was probably listening to dance music on a radio earbud. Death is no respecter of parsons.Let’s hope the worst extremes of political correctness will gradually fade away, as common sense brings a return to humorous nonsense, and seriousness wilts in the face of jocularity.A life without laughter?You must be joking.David Aitken,Dundee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter mok run thankyou","story":"The continued outstanding success of Mok Run race weekend is a reflection of the ever-increasing dedication and commitment its hard working committee, community volunteers, local businesses, enthusiastic runners and crowd supporter’s display year after year.On behalf of myself and the Mok Run committee I would like to say a massive thank you to those who contributed their free time and energy to make this happen for the 13th consecutive year.Each year we are given tremendous support from many individuals and organisations listed here and this is very much appreciated.Sincere thanks to: Campbeltown Co-op, Wee Toon Sports , McFadyens, Mach Dunes, Tunnocks, AM Transport, Argyll Bakeries, Seafield Hotel, Campbeltown Pottery, Kintyre Agricultural Society,  Jim Martin Supplies, Killegruer Caravan Site, Machrihanish Holiday Park, Glen Scotia, Spring Bank, Beinn An Tuirc, Live Argyll,  Stewart Balfour and Sutherland, Campbeltown Running Club, Jogscotland and Wee Toon Warriors.By supporting this event, you have made a concrete contribution to the greater community.I would also like to extend my grateful thanks to: all the MOK Run committee members who work tirelessly behind the scenes our race marshals \u0026#8211 without whom this event would not happen race sweepers  race day commentator Councillor John Armour Gavin Reid Johnny Durnan David McMillan Willie Ralston Barrs Clochkeil Councillor Donald Kelly Argyll and Bute Council amenities team Campbeltown Police Office Southend Scouts Campbeltown\u0026#8217s: Young Fire Fighters Coastguard Sea Cadets Police Scotland Youth Volunteers massage therapists Brass Band Kintyre Schools Pipe Band West Coast EMT Jamie G  South Kintyre Sports Council \u0026#8211 for making our legendary post race ceilidh such a success Dalintober primary pupils for their motivational posters to our photographers: John McFadyen Campbeltown Courier\u0026#8217s Mark Davey Kenny Craig and Greg and Norma Grogan for capturing the spirit of the weekend Fiona and Donna Robertson and all the Junior MOK Run volunteers and to many of our other volunteers who took the time to help on race day.Apologies if I have missed anyone.A special thank you once again goes to the residents of Limecraigs, for taking the time to decorate the street, provide well received ‘showers’ along with the local fire brigade ‘shower’ who came out in full force to cheer the runners on in the final leg of the 10K route.As one runner summed it up on our facebook page: \u0026#8216Fantastic day !\u0026#8216Thanking all the organisers, marshals, water-givers, water-hosers, sweety-givers, pipers, drummers, sandwich and pastry makers, and everyone else involved.

For services to the Scottish seafood industry.\u0026#8217Mr MacMillan, from Carradale, East Kintyre, has already been invited to the Palace of Holyroodhouse garden party on Wednesday July 4.During more than half a century in the industry, Mr MacMillan, 72, has moved from working on a fishing boat, ring netting herring, to fine tuning a computer-controlled smoker to create smoked products for worldwide export.Mr MacMillan, has six employees, one of whom said: \u0026#8216Archie was awarded an MBE for being the best boss.\u0026#8217He took control of the artisan business in 1988 and has incrementally improved it ever since, eventually buying a £60,000 computer controlled smoker which it took him three months to fine tune.Mr MacMillan\u0026#8217s life in the seafood business started at the sharp end. Aged 15,  in 1961 he went to sea in the Amy Harris with an uncle.Mr MacMillan, who eats fish most days, said: \u0026#8216Sometimes in the mid-1960s we were earning between £9 and £11 a week which was a good wage.\u0026#8216It was spring 1962 when we started fishing for scallops and the price of a dozen sold to London was 12/6.\u0026#8217It was a brother of his mother, Mary MacMillan, née Paterson, Archie Paterson, who taught him all he knew, in a decade aboard Harvest Queen.By 1972 some Clyde boats were gearing up for pair trawling, where a net is trawled between two boats.Mr MacMillan, helped with a £12,000 loan from the Highlands and Islands Development Board, bought his own boat, Remembrance, from Finlay Cunningham.For pair trawling Mr MacMillan worked with a partner James Rennie on Monarch and in the 1980s they began exporting scallops to markets, including Belgium, Barcelona and Johannesburg.At the same time as fishing from a boat Mr MacMillan was learning about smoking products.\u0026#8216I used to come to the smokehouse when the weather was too bad to go out on the boat,\u0026#8217 said Mr MacMillan, \u0026#8216That is how I learned to smoke fish \u0026#8211 such as kippers.\u0026#8216It was different days there were not environmental health officers coming chapping at the door,\u0026#8217 added the man who has a prized certificate from SALSA \u0026#8211 Safe and Local Supplier Approval for hot and cold smoking of salmon. Cold smoking of haddock, herring, scallops, mussels and cheese.MacMillan Food\u0026#8217s environmental efforts have also been recognised by the Carbon Trust.That certificate states: \u0026#8216Cutting carbon emissions.

Six-year-old Maisie, who plays the main character, Libby, in the film, in what was her first ever acting role, was accompanied to the glitzy ceremony in Los Angeles by her mother Elizabeth, co-star and writer Rachel Shenton, and the short film\u0026rsquos director Chris Overton.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

Between April 1 last year and the end of March 2018, 2,006 three-day emergency food supplies were given to local people.  Excluding holidays and weekends, it means that, on average, between eight and 10 food parcels are handed out Monday to Friday by the charity.  The number of three-day emergency food supplies distributed rose by 12 per cent from the previous year.  The figure mirrors what is happening across the UK, which has shown a 13 per cent increase in food parcels given out.  In 2017-2018 benefit changes/delays accounted for 757 East Lothian cases with 1,666 people affected, including 617 children. In addition, 595 cases were referred for emergency food due to being refused a crisis grant, affecting 937 people, of which 253 were under the age of 16.  A total of 31,604 kilos of food was given out last year by the county\u0026rsquos foodbank, with 50,292kgs donated.  Peter Dicker, foodbank manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll continue to provide vital support when it matters most \u0026ndash we\u0026rsquore dedicated to ensuring that people in our community with no money for food are able to access emergency support, and that has only been possible in the last year because of the incredible generosity shown by local people in donating food, time and funds.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray condemned the figures, saying: \u0026ldquoThese shocking figures underline the fact that problems with changes to the benefits system have made a significant contribution to the rise in foodbank referrals.  \u0026ldquoGovernments at Holyrood and Westminster can no longer sit back and accept the ever increasing number of people being forced to use foodbanks.

As many as 1,600 homes \u0026ndash as well as business units, a supermarket, primary school and various green spaces \u0026ndash are planned for the former opencast mine site at Blindwells.  The first housebuilder is expected to be announced this summer, with work on housing getting under way potentially by the end of the year.  In the meantime, preparatory work has been carried out on the site, which is sandwiched between the A1 north of Tranent and the A198 south of Cockenzie and Port Seton.  Now Hargreaves, which is behind the proposals, is looking to create an access to the site off the roundabout to the north of the A1 at Bankton Junction.  Iain Slater, development and estates director, said the new exit would be permanent, although it would initially be limited to construction traffic.  Other works are planned for the junction, which links the A1 with the A198.  Mr Slater said: \u0026ldquoAs part of the permission the road layout will be altered to allow for the additional cars generated from the Blindwells development.  \u0026ldquoThese works include widening of the A198 approaching the roundabout to increase capacity [as well as] the installation of a filter lane to allow cars leaving the A1 heading east to go round to Tranent without stopping at the roundabout. There are also plans for traffic lights to assist with traffic flows should the need arise.  As many as 350 jobs could be created during the lengthy building period at the site.  Construction work on the 1,600 homes could take 12-15 years, with early plans already drawn up for a second phase further to the east which could see another 1,600 homes, as well as leisure space and a cemetery."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7870497.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Tranent singer Caitlyn Vanbeck  39 s first single takes charts by storm","story":"              TRANENT singer Caitlyn Vanbeck\u0026rsquos first single flew up the charts when it was released on Monday.

Plain clothes police officers joined colleagues in uniform and members of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos community warden team at John Muir Park and Lochend Woods.  John Muir Park has regularly been used by teenagers who are celebrating the end of their exams.  But in recent years there have been complaints regarding underage drinking, with about 200 people at the park\u0026rsquos Bullet Hill in 2016.  Police have patrolled the area after concerns at public meetings regarding underage drinking and the flouting of local bylaws involving drinking in a public place.  On Friday and Saturday, police and community wardens seized the alcohol from youngsters aged 14 to 21, with a variety of lager, cider and spirits, including 12 litres of vodka, taken.  Inspector Andrew Harborow said: \u0026ldquoEvery year around this time we are aware of youths congregating at Bullet Hill. Whilst this started out as an end-of-school celebration involving those mainly in S6, the ages of those taking part has clearly widened.  \u0026ldquoIn order to reduce the risk to those involved, we have taken action over the weekend and seized alcohol to prevent harm being caused and will be making follow-up enquiries with parents, carers and local shops as to where the alcohol came from.  A council spokeswoman confirmed they had and would continue to work closely with police colleagues in \u0026ldquotackling anti-social behaviour in its many forms.  She said: \u0026ldquoThis can involve action being taken against the individuals responsible for the behaviour itself, alongside engagement with parents or s when appropriate.  \u0026ldquoOn the back of operations like the one at Bullet Hill, we also work with colleagues from other council departments to co-ordinate the clean-up of any affected areas so that members of the public can continue to enjoy our open spaces without debris from anti-social behaviour."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/4089089.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=180\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Residents call for change on recycling boxes","story":"              LOCAL residents have urged\u0026nbspEast Lothian Council to ditch recycling boxes for wheelie bins after the local authority produced a video about the\u0026nbsprecycling process.

The Musselburgh MSP met with doctors and staff at the surgery, along with representatives from East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership.  Mr Beattie said: \"There is no doubt that there are issues around patients\u0026rsquo communication with the surgery, particularly at peak times.

During the visit, Mr Beattie had the chance to discuss other new initiatives which were \"positively transforming the surgery\".  He said: \"While much work seems to have been done, more still has to be achieved to improve the service to patients.  \"I am confident that Riverside and East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership are seriously addressing their remaining issues and I will be keeping in close contact going forward to ensure that my constituents receive the service they should expect.\"  He added that the practice was looking at introducing an online appointment booking system, which it is anticipated would reduce phone calls to the practice.  Riverside was also looking at different options as to how to more effectively manage phone calls at the volume it was receiving, he said.  Mr Beattie said: \"I have encouraged the practice to expedite the introduction of the online appointment booking system, which I feel will have the greatest and quickest effect on the experience of patients contacting the surgery.\"  He also raised the concerns of patients who might have to speak to multiple staff over a period before they were dealt with.  \"Clearly a single point of contact who can immediately direct the patient to the correct destination would be cheaper for the surgery and more efficient and less frustrating for the patient,\" added Mr Beattie."},{"url":null,"title":"Fund in memory of much-missed Jess Mackie helping others","story":"              A MEMORIAL fund set up following the tragic death of a caring 14-year-old girl is on target to reach \u0026pound10,000 raised.  Jess Mackie\u0026rsquos family created the fund in her name after the Gullane youngster, who loved to sing and help others, passed away suddenly on January 2 this year.  The North Berwick High School pupil was a member of the National Youth Choir of Scotland and sang with Aberlady and Gullane Parish Churches, at care homes and for charities, and at school concerts.  Despite her young age, she had a sense of how music could help people in need.  And now the Jess Mackie Memorial Fund will \u0026ldquohelp her to keep helping others, as she had always done, and would have continued to do if she was still with us, said parents Michael and Jackie.  \u0026ldquoWe cannot let our beautiful daughter\u0026rsquos name and character be forgotten, they said. \u0026ldquoShe had so much to offer.  All monies raised will be used to provide support and comfort through music therapy at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh.  Dad Michael, long-standing chairman of Gullane Sports Development Trust, said: \u0026ldquoWhen Jess passed away, we had a memorial service for her and decided to use it to donate to the Edinburgh Children\u0026rsquos Hospital Charity. Quickly thereafter, we learnt about an initiative involving music therapy they were running with Tinderbox Orchestra in the hospital. We met with one of the trustees initially and we decided to put in place something that would allow Jess to help other kids.  The memorial service, which was held at Aberlady Parish Church, raised more than \u0026pound2,000, with money continuing to be donated by members of the public and through organised events.  Michael, 52, said: \u0026ldquoWe were approached by Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches and they asked if they could run an event in Jess\u0026rsquo memory, which they did last Sunday.  \u0026ldquoFrom the family point of view, it was another show of overwhelming support by the village and the community. We have raised a substantial amount of money. Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches posted on Facebook that it had raised about \u0026pound1,800 for the fund and Gullane Athletic [FC] are running an event in August in support of the fund.  Twelve members of staff at North Berwick High School also took part in the recent Edinburgh Marathon Relay.  Split into three teams, they raised more than \u0026pound1,500 for The Royal Hospital for Sick Children Jess Mackie Memorial Fund, Richmond\u0026rsquos Hope and Leuchie House.  Jess, who was in S3 at the secondary school, was, like her twin sister Lauren, a keen singer.  Her dad told the Courier Jess \u0026ldquoloved singing and tried to help people and raise their spirits through her voice.  That love of singing and trying to help people has been mirrored through the success of the memorial fund, which sits at about \u0026pound9,800.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoI think that the fund reflects Jess completely. It reflects the impact she had while only 14 years old.  \u0026ldquoIt reflects the impact she had on people that she met and what she did in terms of her church singing, singing in local care homes, school concerts, helping out at various events like for the Bethany Christian Trust and Leuchie House. I think that reflects what she did while she was here.  The project aims to ensure children and young people who are feeling vulnerable in hospital are given the chance to enjoy music, which can have an enormous and positive impact, helping ignite a spark in them and giving them back a sense of control.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoMusic is a great comforter at times and what Tinderbox do is amazing for the kids.  \u0026ldquoWe had no hesitation in supporting what they do.  Janet Anderson, who is involved with the choirs at the two villages\u0026rsquo churches, also paid tribute to the talented teenager.  She said: \u0026ldquoI could not speak more highly of Jess.  \u0026ldquoShe did not think she had a special talent, she was just the most unassuming, normal girl you would ever meet.  \u0026ldquoShe was so pretty, so kind and so thoughtful and generous and she never thought she was anything special.

Chester, from Dunbar, is one of 13 pets, including cats, dogs and even a rat, taking part in the PDSA Pet Fit Club.  Together they weigh more than 200 kilogrammes and need to shed 75kg to reach their ideal weights.  Ten-year-old Chester, who lives with the Gilmour family on Newhouse Avenue, is looking to shift 2.6kg \u0026ndash or six pounds \u0026ndash to reach his ideal weight.  Chester, who tips the scales at 7.6kg, was gaining so much weight that his owners thought he must have an underlying medical condition. But when tests came back negative, it was clear Chester\u0026rsquos appetite and lazy ways were the root of the problem.  Owner Lisa said: \u0026ldquoWe realised everyone in the house was feeding him without knowing he\u0026rsquod already being fed, so he was getting fed by all four of us every day!  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove tried to help him lose weight, even putting a collar on him that says \u0026lsquoDo not feed me!\u0026rsquo for the neighbours, but that hasn\u0026rsquot worked.  \u0026ldquoHe eats whatever he can find including crisps left on the floor by the kids. He even stole my dad\u0026rsquos cheesecake that was on the kitchen counter! Another time my son woke up to the sound of rattling and he was trying to claw his way into a box of chocolates.  Lisa, along with partner Lindsay and sons Rhys and Ryan, got Chester when he was just a kitten.  Now they are determined to do what they can to help their pet lose some weight and be happier.  Lisa, who works in the family newsagent, added: \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos getting older now and his weight will play on his joints if we don\u0026rsquot do something to help him. He can\u0026rsquot be comfortable carrying all that weight around and we want him to be happier and healthier as he ages.  Chester\u0026rsquos six-month Pet Fit Club diet and exercise programme will be specially tailored and overseen by the vets and nurses at Edinburgh PDSA Pet Hospital.  He is up against seven dogs, including a Cavalier King Charles spaniel who once ate a set of false teeth, a cat too fat to fit through the cat flap, and a rat who is double his ideal bodyweight.  If crowned the winner, Chester will receive a year\u0026rsquos supply of pet food, a pet-friendly holiday and a pet hamper.  Kathryn Marshall, PDSA Veterinary Care Assistant, will be helping to oversee Chester\u0026rsquos diet.  She said: \u0026ldquoWith the help of PDSA and Pet Fit Club, Lisa and Chester are making the necessary diet, exercise and lifestyle changes to help get Chester down to a healthier weight.  \u0026ldquoWe will support them every step of the way over the next six months to ensure they succeed."},{"url":null,"title":"Log found at Yellowcraig beach transformed into stunning violin","story":"              A VIOLIN maker has crafted a violin from driftwood found on an East Lothian beach to help raise awareness about the environment and the plight of the oceans.

Len Smith, 92, was conscripted at the age of 18 and was a supply lorry driver for the British Liberation Army.  He landed at Gold Beach, Normandy, where he said he was not shot at and saw little combat.  But he drove some of the first troops into Berlin in 1945 and moved supplies through a war-ravaged France, Belgium, Holland and Germany.  Despite his actions, modest Len, who went on to work in the civil service, said he had never thought of himself as veteran, never mind a hero.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoThere were thousands of young men like me. I never considered myself a veteran until the recent events marking the anniversary led to me looking back.  \u0026ldquoAt the time we just got on with it the real heroes are the soldiers who fought and died over there.  Mr Smith was one of eight children born in Pencaitland to local couple John and Euphemia Smith.  His sister Ellen, 97, still lives in Pencaitland and he visits the area regularly but after he was demobbed in 1947, Mr Smith moved to Longlevens, Gloucestershire, to find work.  Now a widower, Mr Smith\u0026rsquos sister sends him the Courier every week so he can keep up with local news.  His L\u0026eacutegion d\u0026rsquoHonneur medal was sent to his home in Cheltenham by post and contained a letter from Jean-Pierre Jouyet, French ambassador to the UK, which said: \u0026ldquoI offer you my warmest congratulations on this high honour, which recognises your military engagement and steadfast involvement in the liberation of France during the Second World War.  \u0026ldquoAs we contemplate this Europe of peace, we must never forget the heroes like you who came from Britain and the Commonwealth to begin the liberation of Europe by liberating France.

I was a young lad and I had no fear.  \u0026ldquoI just thought \u0026lsquoget on with it\u0026rsquo.  However, he remembers thinking about how worried his mother would be.  Len\u0026rsquos brothers James and Thomas were also in active service and James was in the D-Day landings. All three came home.

Inspectors returned to the school 12 months on from the original report for a follow-up inspection, which led to a new report being published on Tuesday.  The inspection team talked to young people at the school and worked closely with the interim headteacher Lauren Rodger, who is returning to North Berwick High School after the summer holidays.  She will be replaced by Susan Cook, currently acting headteacher at Trinity Academy, Edinburgh  Other members of staff were also spoken to, to hear about the steps the school had taken to improve on areas previously identified in the original inspection.  Education Scotland noted the following key improvements:  - The interim headteacher has provided effective leadership in taking forward work to secure improvements, including a review of the school values  - Staff have developed a range of policies to improve practice in equalities and inclusion, including a new safeguarding policy  - The recently created Pupil Support Faculty is now better placed to address the needs of young people, and those with social, emotional and behavioural needs in particular  - The school has made progress in establishing a more positive learning environment for all.  The report did note that there were still some improvements to be made.  Issues highlighted included using evidence from self-evaluation activities to ensure consistency in learning and teaching across the school reviewing the purpose of the pupil support base to ensure there was a greater focus on learning for the young people using it and ensuring there was a whole school approach to equalities and inclusion.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, praised staff at the school for their efforts.  She said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that Education Scotland acknowledges that Knox Academy has made important progress since the last inspection, and I would like to thank all the staff and pupils for their hard work and commitment in making these improvements.  \u0026ldquoIt is really encouraging that the positive relationships between pupils and teachers, and the fact that almost all young people recognise the value of learning in their lives, was noted.  \u0026ldquoThis is a strong basis for ensuring that the school continues to be a positive learning environment for staff and pupils alike.  And she added: \u0026ldquoWe will continue to work with the school and Education Scotland to make further improvements, and to working with Susan Cook, our new headteacher, who joins the school in August.  Education Scotland will continue to work with East Lothian Council regarding the school\u0026rsquos capacity to improve and will return to carry out another inspection within 18 months."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7898185.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Thousands oppose Dunbar town centre parking charge plans","story":"              MORE than 2,000 people have signed a petition against the idea of parking charges being introduced on Dunbar High Street.  A public consultation looking at potential parking solutions throughout East Lothian came to a close last month.  Meetings and workshops were held throughout the county by East Lothian Council, including one in Dunbar Royal British Legion.  A number of suggestions were put forward, including for a disc parking system where visitors to the busy street would set a disc showing when they had parked.  Another idea being explored is parking charges \u0026ndash but that has met with the opposition of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association (DTA).  Philip Mellor, DTA chairman, said that the group \u0026ldquostrongly oppose the introduction of parking charges.  A petition, which was put in various businesses in the town, has attracted more than 2,000 signatures.  Mr Mellor added: \u0026ldquoThe DTA feel introducing parking charges to High Street and other key off-street parking areas will have a detrimental effect on our High Street and the local economy.  \u0026ldquoThe current system since the introduction of traffic wardens has already addressed concerns around space for shoppers on High Street and it now seems counterintuitive to then introduce a measure which will drive more customers away to out-of-town developments.  \u0026ldquoWhilst parking during heavy summer visitor times can be difficult, it is very few special event days where parking is congested enough to even consider parking charges viable the majority of the time parking is available and this potential charge seems to be nothing more than a money-raising exercise at the expense yet again of already-struggling independent business owners.

Plans to close Haddington Infant School and King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School were revealed last autumn.  East Lothian Council intends to create a new primary school, operating from the existing school buildings, which will cover nursery through to primary seven. The proposal was approved by East Lothian Council in April after a public consultation. It has now also been approved by the Scottish Government.  Combined, the two schools currently have a school roll of about 700 pupils. However, it remains unclear who the new headteacher for the primary school, which is yet to be named, will be.  Current headteacher Seonaid McGillivray is set to be appointed at another as yet unnamed school in the county, with the final details expected to be tied up within a matter of days.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, said: \u0026ldquoWe believe that the decision to establish one new primary school, operating under a single management structure, offers the best solution to not only developing a stronger and more cohesive curriculum, but that local children will benefit from improved progression planning and transition as they progress from infant to upper stage.  \u0026ldquoOur education service will work closely with our current headteacher Mrs McGillivray, and the chairs of both parent councils, to recruit a headteacher for the newly established school.  She added: \u0026ldquoI would like to take this opportunity to thank Mrs McGillivray for her service and leadership of King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School and more recently Haddington Infant School.

Five retail units are planned for a site at Gateside previously earmarked for a Sainsbury\u0026rsquos supermarket and petrol station.  The site, which totals about 60,000 sq ft, could be made up of units ranging from 7,500 sq ft to 20,000 sq ft in size.  Alastair Dickie, development director with Ediston Real Estates, which now owns the site, attended the town\u0026rsquos community council meeting on Tuesday, one week before plans are unveiled to the public.  He told members the proposal was for the site to include three food retailers, with the other two units including \u0026ldquoa household-type retail business and a coffee drive-through facility.  However, he was keeping tight-lipped on the identity of the businesses until legal agreements were in place.  Mr Dickie hoped planning permission for the site, off Oak Tree Roundabout west of Haddington, could be achieved by the end of the year.  He said: \u0026ldquoIf we submit an application in August, we would hope. . . we would hopefully have a consent in December or January next year.  \u0026ldquoWe could be on site quarter one of 2019.  It is then hoped that the retailers could be trading in the lead-up to Christmas that year or early in 2020.  The development, which has been described as \u0026ldquoEast Lothian\u0026rsquos first retail park, will involve in the region of \u0026pound14 million investment, with 150 jobs potentially created, as well as those during the construction process.  It has already been revealed that talks are ongoing with \u0026ldquoa number of major retailers who will be new to East Lothian.  Concerns have been expressed by a number of retailers in the town centre that the creation of a retail park on the outskirts would be detrimental to their business.  But Mr Dickie, who previously lived in the town and continues to stay in the county, was hopeful the additional retailers would encourage people to remain in the area rather than heading further afield to retail parks in Edinburgh.  The proposals are on display to the public from 2pm to 7pm on Tuesday at the John Gray Centre.  The developer is also continuing to make progress at a second Haddington site for retail development \u0026ndashat Harperdean, between the A1 and the A199, east of Aberlady Road.

The new scheme offers people an opportunity to support Our Community Energy \u0026ndash a partnership between not-for-profit Scottish firm Our Power and Mongoose Energy, which manages community energy assets \u0026ndash and hopes to find investors in the county.  They say that the site at Pogbie Windfarm \u0026ndash already home to the turbines \u0026ndash will create enough energy to power 7,200 homes and believe that, when they combine it with a second site in Berwickshire, the scheme will raise an estimated \u0026pound1.9 million in surplus profit over 25 years.  Our Power said that profit from the wind turbines it takes over would then be used to keep energy prices down, helping people who are struggling with the costs.  They need to raise just over \u0026pound3 million for the project, which covers both sites, and community groups and individuals are being invited to invest in bonds and shares to raise the money needed to get the project up and running, with investments ranging from \u0026pound500 to \u0026pound100,000.  Andrew Smith, Our Community Energy acting chairperson, said: \u0026ldquoFuel poverty is a huge issue for Scotland and we\u0026rsquore proud to be launching such an important fundraising opportunity to directly tackle it.  \u0026ldquoInvesting with a social purpose is something close to the hearts of many Scots, and these bond and equity offers provide the chance to have a huge impact locally.  \u0026ldquoThese offers aim to support those who struggle to afford sufficiently heated homes, as well as providing investors with an exciting new option which not only targets a significant social impact but a positive environmental one too.  \u0026ldquoHowever with these types of investments there are some risks and funds are not readily realisable.  \u0026ldquoInvestors should note that capital is at risk and returns are not guaranteed.  A fuel poor household is defined as one which needs to spend more than 10 per cent of its income on all fuel use and to heat its home to an adequate standard of warmth.  Last year, the East Lothian Poverty Commission found that almost half of local pensioners were forced to spend more than 10 per cent of their income on energy bills.  Mark Kenber, CEO of Mongoose Energy, added: \u0026ldquoWith the majority of Scots recognising the critical level that fuel poverty has reached, it is now more important than ever for investors to put their money into causes that work for the social good, not just their own.  \u0026ldquoOur Community Energy not only gives investors the potential to earn competitive interest rates on their money, but also the opportunity to support the wider Scottish community.

A pressure group called \u0026lsquoBowls for Gullane\u0026rsquo was established on Facebook in the wake of concerns that the village\u0026rsquos bowling club \u0026ndash with a membership of only about 30 \u0026ndash was to be sold to developers.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay, ward member and former chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoAll three ward councillors are behind the campaign to save the club and we hope that the members understand the feeling in the village.  \u0026ldquoI understand that the committee own the club and it would be the members who benefit from any potential sale.  About 50 residents gathered outside the bowling club on Monday evening to show their displeasure at the possible loss of the club.  The group told the Courier they had had hundreds of offers of support.  Catherine MacKenzie said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove had people phone up, email and text us \u0026ndash and face-to-face \u0026ndash to tell us that they\u0026rsquore willing to become a member.  \u0026ldquoSome of them don\u0026rsquot live locally, or won\u0026rsquot be able to bowl, but they are willing to pay the membership fees. People do not want to see the club close.  Gordon McLelland, a local resident and member of the community council, added: \u0026ldquoThe community council want to save the club for the community.  \u0026ldquoWe have tried hard to offer the club our support to work with them but so far they have turned that down.  Billy Mellors, the county\u0026rsquos bowls development officer, said: \u0026ldquoThe overwhelming support from the local community indicates to me the future of Gullane Bowling Club can be sustained if the current members accept it.  Many locals have tried to sign up as members but have been turned away by the club, it has been claimed.  Another member of the group said: \u0026ldquoWhat has shocked us as a group is how many people have been refused membership in recent years \u0026ndash young and old have come forward with their personal experience of being turned away.  Mr Mellors added: \u0026ldquoTime will tell on the way the club want to go but we all hope a common sense approach is taken to preserve this community facility.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray met representatives of the Bowls for Gullane group last week and is keen to find a solution to ensure the club\u0026rsquos survival.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis is an unfortunate situation Gullane has lost too many local assets recently, so every effort should be made to avoid losing another. I did meet with representatives of the campaign and have said that I will support them in trying to find a way the land, and preferably bowling too, can remain part of the village community.  Ian McMillan, CEO of Bowls Scotland, said that he was \u0026ldquodelighted to see local residents lend their support to the campaign to save the 116-year-old club.  He added: \u0026ldquoI would encourage all in the village to support their historic club, get on the green, enjoy the great game of bowls and ensure future generations can benefit from the opportunity to play an accessible, inclusive sport. Bowls Scotland fully supports the work being undertaken to keep bowls an important part of Gullane\u0026rsquos community fabric.  Les Ritchie, secretary of East Lothian Bowling Association, told the group: \u0026ldquoWe are ready to support you and the community in whatever steps might secure a future for bowling in Gullane.  Attempts by the Courier to speak to Michael Baxter, vice-president and secretary at the bowling club, were unsuccessful this week. In April, Mr Baxter told us: \u0026ldquoThere are not enough members to support the running of the club.  He had said then that the club was \u0026ldquotrying to find a solution but that it was not viable to continue with a dwindling membership.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council confirmed the land was earmarked for leisure and recreation use in the Local Development Plan and any deviation from that would require planning permission for a potential change of use."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7413616.jpg?htype=81\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Plans for 1 500 homes and new school on edge of Musselburgh","story":"              A PLANNING application has been lodged for 1,500 new houses, a primary school and employment land at Craighall, by Musselburgh.  Persimmon Homes is hoping to get the go-ahead \u0026ldquoin principle from East Lothian Council for the mixed-use development, which includes a commercial hub with hotel, retail facilities and cafe/restaurant.  Community facilities such as a residential neighbourhood centre, playing fields, changing facilities and public parks are proposed.  Also planned is the construction of a grade-separated junction on the A1, roads and foot/cycle paths, as well as improvement to the Musselburgh rail halt.  Submission of the planning application in principle follows a Proposal of Application Notice and public consultation exercise for the major scheme, which included an exhibition on the draft masterplan at The Brunton last year.  A planning statement from Holder Planning, acting for Persimmon, read: \u0026ldquoThe application site is allocated for the mixed use development proposed in the soon-to-be adopted East Lothian Local Development Plan.  \u0026ldquoThe proposed development will deliver 1,500 homes across the site. These homes will comprise a range of housing types. Twenty-five per cent of the housing provision will be affordable as defined by the council.  \u0026ldquoA primary school is proposed that will accommodate the requirements arising from residential development on the wider site. It is located centrally in the application site within walking distance of new homes via a network of paths that offer safe and convenient links. The detailed design will be in accordance with the requirements of the education authority, East Lothian Council.  \u0026ldquoThe masterplan proposes enhancing a pedestrian link under the A1 that will link the site areas together, allowing new neighbourhoods and services to the west, identified in the wider masterplan, to gain access to Musselburgh Station and services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThe proposal incorporates a significant network of multi-functional open spaces and semi-natural landscape areas, including allotments/community growing space, natural play areas, sports pitches and outdoor gym facilities, and seating. This framework of green space will contribute to the legibility of the neighbourhood\u0026rsquos spatial pattern, establishing distinct areas of new housing linked together via a network of green foot and cycle routes.  A new research and innovation quarter for East Lothian offering more than 20 hectares of new commercial space is proposed.  The planning statement added: \u0026ldquoWith strong links to the adjacent Queen Margaret University, the site offers the potential to build upon the reputation of Edinburgh and the Lothians for its research and innovation.  Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, said: \u0026ldquoThe issue at Craighall is that major development here will be very close to major development in Edinburgh at Newcraighall and in Midlothian at Shawfair, turning the whole area into a cross-boundary urban sprawl and effectively an extension to Edinburgh\u0026rsquos built-up area.  Predicting that the plan for 1,500 houses would be approved, given that was the number in the Local Development Plan, he added: \u0026ldquoAll that we can hope for is that conditions will be put in place to make this amount of housing as acceptable as possible in terms of layout, design, amenities and access to walking and cycling routes and to public transport.  \u0026ldquoOf note is that the secondary-age children here will have to get to Musselburgh Grammar School, which is some distance away and not an easy walk, certainly not from the other side of the A1.  \u0026ldquoThe recently promoted Active Travel Network shows no cycle link to Musselburgh Grammar School. We are worried about the prospect of increased car usage to get kids to and from school thus adding to the gradually worsening traffic problems in the town.  Jim Kirkpatrick, managing director of Persimmon Homes East Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoWe have had extensive engagement with East Lothian Council and the local community prior to the application being lodged and have generally been encouraged by the positive response to our masterplan.  \u0026ldquoThe comments of Musselburgh Conservation Society are noted and we believe the issues raised are addressed in the suite of information provided to the council.  \u0026ldquoThe application is fully compliant with the proposals contained within the emerging East Lothian Local Development Plan and we look forward to working with officers and other stakeholders during the determination process."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7868119.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"12 new rules the council is making over selfish parking in Musselburgh","story":"              A RAFT of traffic restrictions are to be introduced in Musselburgh to control inconsiderate parking.

Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard MSP last week met East Lothian Labour Party campaigners at Holyrood as they delivered a petition signed by more than 1,000 people to Kevin Stewart MSP.  While Councillor Lachlan Bruce, ward member for Preston, Seton, Gosford was joined by South of Scotland MSP Michelle Ballantyne, both Conservative, as they sent letters to Mr Stewart calling for the same action (see image inset).  The campaign comes after the minister called in a planning application by Inch Cape Offshore Ltd (ICOL) to build a substation \u0026ndash which would bring energy ashore from a planned offshore wind farm \u0026ndash on a large section of the site, which was recently purchased by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower.  That sparked cross-party condemnation from county politicians, who fear it could jeopardise local plans to create jobs and boost the economy on the site.  Mr Leonard added his signature to the Hands Off Cockenzie petition before it was submitted.  Iain Gray (Lab), East Lothian MSP said: \u0026ldquoMinisters claim the call-in is because the site is of national importance, but even the leader of the SNP Group on East Lothian Council has condemned the decision as unnecessary.  \u0026ldquoBy signing our petition in such large numbers, local people have sent a clear message they want East Lothian to decide on decisions about the future of the site.  Meanwhile, Mr Bruce said he had asked Mr Stewart to send the decision back to the council. He said: \u0026ldquoI think it is only right that this decision is made locally by the council on behalf of local residents. The people who are affected most are local residents and it is the people they elected, not a Government minister from Aberdeen, who should be making the decision.

It comes amid on ongoing row over the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos handling of FoI requests and the involvement of special advisers.  Critics branded the findings \"outrageous\", and accused the SNP of meddling in the FoI process to \"stop bad news happening\".  In a\u0026nbsphumiliating intervention, the Scottish Information Commissioner Daren Fitzhenry called on the Government to end its practice of\u0026nbsptreating journalists, MSPs and political researchers differently \u0026ldquobecause of who or what they are.  His report found: \u0026ldquoJournalists, together with MSPs and political researchers, are expressly made subject to a different process for clearance than other requester groups.  \u0026ldquoThis is inconsistent with the applicant-blind principle of FoI legislation. Their requests are almost invariably subjected to an additional layer of clearance which is likely to delay consideration of the case.  In 2015/16, only 27 per cent of media requests were met with full disclosure, compared with 42 per cent of FoIs submitted by others.  When she took office, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon vowed to lead the most open and accessible government ever.  But Scottish Conservative MSP Adam Tomkins insisted the report \u0026ldquoexposes Nicola Sturgeon\u0026rsquos secret Scotland.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt reveals an SNP government which not only deliberately stands in the way of legally-binding FoI requests made by the media, but goes to great lengths to delay or influence what information is provided.  \u0026ldquoThat is completely contrary to Scotland\u0026rsquos FoI legislation. People will see this report and conclude the SNP government is trying to stop bad news happening, and its woeful performance being publicised, by meddling in this process.  \u0026ldquoThat is outrageous, and all cabinet ministers involved, and indeed the First Minister, have urgent questions to answer.  Scottish Labour\u0026rsquos parliamentary business manager Rhoda Grant called on Ms Sturgeon to \u0026ldquoaddress the findings of this report and apologise for bending the law to suit her narrow political interests.  Scottish Green MSP Andy Wightman said: \u0026ldquoThis is a damning report, and vindicates the complaints of many journalists and researchers that Scottish ministers are slow and inconsistent in how they release information that the public are entitled to.  Mr Fitzhenry launched his formal investigation at Holyrood\u0027s request after a series of complaints were raised by journalists last year.  He said that by singling journalists and researchers out, SNP ministers were offending the spirit of FoI legislation and potentially damaging trust.  The Scottish Government said it would accept the findings of the report in full, and confirmed\u0026nbspits internal guidance will be updated with immediate effect.  Joe Fitzpatrick, minister for parliamentary business Joe Fitzpatrick, said: \u0026ldquoBeing open and transparent is a priority set out in our current Programme for Government.  \u0026ldquoWe welcomed and cooperated fully with the Scottish Information Commissioner\u0026rsquos review and are happy to accept his recommendations in full to support our continued improvement.  \u0026ldquoAs the report highlights, we have already implemented a number of changes that have resulted in significant improvements to our FoI performance.  \"In the first five months of 2018 we responded to 93 per cent of FoI requests on time, exceeding the 90 per cent target set by the Information Commissioner and a 10% increase on last year.  \u0026ldquoOutside the FoI process, last year the Scottish Government responded to over 5,000 queries from journalists in a matter of hours."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7919182.jpg?type=article-full","title":"Watch  Ian Blackford leads dramatic SNP walk-out from Commons","story":"              THE SNP has staged a dramatic walk-out in the House of Commons after Ian Blackford its Westminster leader defied the Speaker, insisting the UK Government had shown total disrespect and discourtesy to Scotland by its actions over the Brexit Bill.  The Conservatives, he later suggested, had returned to the days of Margaret Thatcher and were acting in an \u0026ldquoanti-Scottish way.  In developments that stunned MPs during Prime Minister\u0026rsquos Questions, the Nationalist leader attacked the Conservative Government, which he said was implementing, through its legislation, a power-grab against Holyrood and had not even given Scottish MPs the chance to debate it during Tuesday\u0026rsquos consideration of the Bill.    Using a rare parliamentary device, he called for a \u0026ldquoprivate sitting of Parliament, which would have removed the public from the chamber\u0026rsquos gallery.  The move appeared to take John Bercow, the Speaker, Theresa May, and others totally by surprise.  As the chamber descended into confusion, Mr Bercow hurriedly consulted the Commons lawyers and suggested a vote on Mr Blackford\u0026rsquos request be taken after PMQs. But the Highland MP insisted he wanted an immediate vote, declaring: \u0026ldquoI beg to move.  At which point as Nationalist MPs cheered, Opposition MPs jeered. The Speaker took more advice, repeating that the vote should take place at the end of PMQs. \u0026ldquoThat is the end of the matter, declared Mr Bercow, calling the PM to respond.  But Mr Blackford continued to stand as the Speaker urged him amid the roar of the chamber to sit down, insisting: \u0026ldquoNo, you\u0026rsquore not moving anything.    As the volume in the chamber rose further on all sides, Labour frontbenchers were engaged in hurried private conversations.  As the Speaker again insisted a vote could take place at the end of PMQs, SNP backbencher David Linden shouted: \u0026ldquoNow!  Mr Bercow responded by telling the Glasgow MP: \u0026ldquoI say to you in the kindest possible spirit, don\u0026rsquot tell me what the procedures of this House are. I\u0026rsquom telling you there can be a vote at the end of this session and not now.  As Mr Blackford rose again to applause from some of his SNP colleagues, the Speaker shouted: \u0026ldquoOrder. Resume your seat Mr Blackford! He then said in light of the party leader\u0026rsquos refusal to resume his seat, he ordered him to leave the chamber immediately.  At first, the Highland MP did not go. As MPs continued to shout, Mr Bercow could he heard saying to colleagues: \u0026ldquoHe won\u0026rsquot, so we\u0026rsquoll have to have the vote.  At one point, Joanna Cherry, the Nationalist MP, could be seen shouting at the Tory benches before Mr Blackford dramatically walked out followed by his SNP colleagues. Ms Cherry as she left waved to the Speaker, saying: \u0026ldquoGoodbye.  As the noise level began to subside, Mr Bercow said it was a pity as Nationalist MPs had questions down on the Order Paper.                         .bc-player-rkgvgWjWCG_default .vjs-tech { position: static !important }                       .bc-player-rkgvgWjWCG_default { height: auto !important width: 100% !important}                       .vjs-playlist-description { display: none }                       .vjs-big-play-button { top: 0pxleft: 0pxright: 0pxbottom: 0pxmargin: auto }                       .vjs-mouse.vjs-playlist { background-color: #f7f4f1color: #000min-width: auto }                       .vjs-playlist cite { overflow: initialtext-overflow: initialwhite-space: initialfont-weight: 600font-size: 16px }                       .vjs-mouse.vjs-playlist time { color: #fff }                       cite.vjs-playlist-name { text-align: left }                       .story-credits { margin-top: 20px }                       #liveMultiHide .vjs-dock-description { display: none }                       .vjs-playlist-thumbnail { margin-right: 10px !IMPORTANT }                        /* Style the overlay */                        /* Hide the overlay */                        .hide-countdown {                            display: none                        }                        .hide-overlay {                            display: none                        }                        /* Style the overlay */                        .vjs-overlay,                        .vjs-overlay.vjs-overlay-top {                            position: absolute                            top: 0px                            left: 0px                        }                        .vjs-overlay p {                            width: 100px                            background-color: #000000                            color: #fff                            padding: 10px                            margin: 0                            margin-bottom: 0                            border-radius: 0px                            text-align: left                        }                                               width=\"100%\"                            data-account=\"64298557001\"                            data-player=\"rkgvgWjWCG\"                            data-embed=\"default\"                            data-video-id=\"5797134990001\"                            class=\"video-js\"                            playsinline                            data-random-id=\"1101423159\"                            controls  Earlier, in Commons exchanges, the SNP leader had pointed out that despite the declaration that Scotland would be a partner of equals in the UK, the Tory Government had pressed ahead with a \u0026ldquopower-grab in direct opposition to Scotland\u0026rsquos Parliament and had \u0026ldquosilenced Scotland\u0026rsquos voice.

He called on her to bring forward emergency legislation so that the \u0026ldquowill of the Scottish Parliament can be heard and, more importantly be respected.    Mrs May stressed how the outcome of the Brexit process would increase Holyrood\u0026rsquos powers in 80 areas, declaring: \u0026ldquoIt is not the case that this is in any way a power-grab. She went on: \u0026ldquoOnly the SNP could say that getting 80 more areas where they are going to take decisions was a power-grab.  Pointing to how there was just 15 minutes on Tuesday night for debate on the Scottish clause to the EU Withdrawal Bill, the PM blamed Labour for using \u0026ldquoprocedural manoeuvres in calling unnecessary votes.  Mr Blackford replied that the reality was powers enshrined under the 1998 Scotland Act were being \u0026ldquograbbed back by Whitehall and Scottish MPs were \u0026ldquonot given the courtesy of even debating it last night it\u0026rsquos a democratic outrage.

Outside the chamber, the MP for Ross, Skye and Lochaber said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not prepared to stand back and see Westminster engage in a power-grab against the Scottish Parliament and to do so on a basis that Scotland\u0026rsquos parliamentarians have not been given the opportunity to debate what this Parliament is doing. It\u0026rsquos an outrage.  He went on: \u0026ldquoWe are going to make sure we will be robust in using parliamentary devices to make sure we can hold this Government to account. We are in a situation that the Westminster Government has shown utter disrespect to the Scottish Parliament and the people of Scotland by wilfully ignoring that the fact that the Scottish Parliament has refused to give a consent motion.    \u0026ldquoThey are now acting outwith the support of the Scottish people. The Conservatives have returned to where they were before in acting in a manner that is anti-Scottish. We are not having it.  But Scottish Conservative MP Kirstene Hair decried the SNP\u0026rsquos actions.  \"This rehearsed move just demonstrated that the SNP care more about headlines than actually achieving anything for Scotland.  \"They are the masters of manufactured grievance and the people of Scotland are sick of it.  \"The SNP have played games with the constitution, played games with Brexit and now are playing games with Parliament.

The decline of traditional nine-to-five jobs and the rise of flexible working and 24-hour shift patterns has led to calls for businesses to provide more services outside of the \u0027normal\u0027 working day.\u0026nbsp  The changing way people spent their leisure time was reflected in a study by Barclays which found that they want services to be available round-the-clock.  Calls were made for museums to stay open late into the evening and for cinemas to show films into the early hours of the morning.  People also want to see takeaway hours extended through the night so they can pick up a meal until 5am.  But while habits are changing, the report found that only a quarter of UK hospitality and leisure businesses recognise this growing demand, and said that opening hours are not keeping up with changes to modern working lives.    Jamie Grant, Head of Corporate Banking for Barclays in Scotland, believes that businesses were losing out by not responding to the dawning of 24-hour culture.  He said: \u0026ldquoAdapting to the changing consumer demand presents a substantial opportunity for Scottish businesses.\u0026nbsp  \"Our research has shown that leisure operators across the country could access a staggering \u0026pound6.75bn per annum by accommodating their customers\u0026rsquo evolving needs which have been brought on by changing working patterns.\u0026nbsp  \"While that may be a challenge for some providers, understanding the value of the opportunity makes the prize more tangible.\"\u0026nbsp  The new Barclays Corporate Banking Hospitality and Leisure report, Open All Hours? found that only a quarter of Scots now work traditional 9-5 hours, with nearly a one-in-five saying they need different opening hours.\u0026nbsp  More than one in ten Scots now expect hospitality services to be available 24-hours, and may be disappointed if they aren\u0027t.\u0026nbsp  The study concluded that by responding to this demand, Scotland\u0026rsquos restaurants could benefit by \u0026pound126m each year, takeaways by \u0026pound144m, and pubs, bars and clubs could benefit the most by accessing a market worth almost \u0026pound100 million each.  One sector identified to be rising to the challenge of changing work patterns the country\u0027s gyms, with some allowing PIN-controlled access systems, smart lighting, temperature controls and extensive video monitoring to overcome the staffing issues that deter some businesses from after-hours opening.\u0026nbsp    Mr Grant added: \u0026ldquoThe current leisure environment does present a number of challenges for the sector\u0026rsquos businesses the labour supply is challenged by Brexit, rent increases and food inflation are all set within the context of an incredibly competitive market which is already heavily discounting. \u0026nbsp  \"However, those that don\u0026rsquot adapt to this type of newly developing consumer demand risk being left behind and in this ever-competitive environment, businesses need to weigh up the value of the long-term opportunity over the cost of the short-term investment.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Parents and teachers blamed for  obsession  with university education","story":"              PARENTS and teachers pressurise pupils to go to university without knowing whether it is the best option for them, a leading industrialist has claimed.  Sir Ian Wood, the former Wood Group chief executive and philanthropist, said the pervasive culture that higher education was \"the be all and end all\" was damaging to the large proportion of pupils who were not academically minded.  And he called for a greater focus on the importance of vocational qualifications - as well as a campaign to highlight successful and lucrative careers outside the traditional professions.  Sir Ian was giving evidence to the Scottish Parliament\u0027s education committee, which is looking at the options available to pupils when they leave school.  He said: \"There is a real cultural thing about university being the be all and end all and therefore anything that is not university frankly tends to get secondary consideration. Parents are at fault, teachers are at fault, some schools are at fault.  \"We are trying to change a long embedded view that somehow the really worthwhile thing in life is to go to university and so many parents have got that as the aspiration for the youngster.  \"Parents are the root of the problem, but teachers are the next stage up because a lot of teachers believe that their success is based on how many Highers their children get.\"  Sir Ian told the committee apprenticeships and trades occupations should be made more respectable and highlighted the fact many pupils who had a technical education earned higher salaries than those who went to university.  He added: \"Because of the culture issue a lot of people go to university because their parents want them to go to university ... but they come out and they are still not sure what they want to do and the qualification hasn\u0027t really helped them an awful lot.\"  Joanna Murphy, chairwoman of the National Parent Forum of Scotland, said pupils could be \"negatively influenced\" by parents, but this was often due to a lack of understanding of the alternative opportunities.  She said: \"Although career opportunities are being highlighted more frequently in schools, particularly the promotion of apprenticeships, this tends to be focused in fifth and sixth year which is far too late for parents.\"  Eileen Prior, executive director of parent body Connect Scotland, said many parents got the message \"loud and clear\" from schools that university was the desirable next step.  She said: \"Since it is well recognised that most parents receive their information about education from their child\u0026rsquos school we can\u0026rsquot be surprised at the result.  \"Parents tell us that they feel they receive little information about diverse routes both in and after school, and they often feel frustrated that their child is being ignored in a system which focusses on higher education if their child is not academically minded.  \"Some parents have a clear vision of what they want for their child based on their experience and often family tradition and it is up to schools to help families and young people see the value of wider approaches.\"  Larry Flanagan, general secretary of the Educational Institute of Scotland, said it was not teachers, but the Scottish Government and schools quango Education Scotland who \"obsessed\" about the number of Higher passes. And he also argued business had \"raised the stakes\" by making more jobs degree level entry only.  He said: \"I think teachers will bridle at his dismissal of their efforts to encourage vocational pathways. We have been arguing constantly that senior school has been overly focused on qualifications for the past four years.\"  A spokesman for Universities Scotland said: \"We have been absolutely clear that we need to a conversation about getting parents and schools to recognise that the best outcome for young people is the outcome that allows the young person to fulfil their potential.  \"We are also clear that for many people university is the right option for them later in life and we need diverse routes to success for diverse individuals.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Glasgow  is clogged with roads  traffic and pollution ","story":"              It is universally known as the Dear Green Place due to the number of parks and open spaces where the residents could enjoy some leisure time.

The report claims the city is in danger  of being strangled by too many roads clogged with slow-moving vehicles, choked by high levels of pollution and bereft of  city-centre residents.  As a result, it warns Glasgow is in danger of sliding behind rival cities in its ability to compete for jobs, investment and visitors.  Early findings from the Glasgow Connectivity Commission says there is a need to drastically \u0026ldquorewire the city\u0026rsquos transport system which sees city-centre buses crawl at an average of just 4.5mph and fails to meet the needs of destinations such as Glasgow Airport and Queen Elizabeth University Hospital.  The report, which has been looking at how to support economic growth by enabling more people to live, work and visit the city, claims Glasgow is already straggling behind its rivals with too many commuters travelling from the suburbs adding to congestion and pollution, and too few people living in the city\u0026rsquos centre.  It warns other cities which have boosted the number of inner city residents had gone on to see economic investment and jobs increase. A key problem, according to the report, is Glasgow\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquogrid system layout which it says hands significantly more space over to roads than other UK cities, despite it having one of the lowest car ownership levels.  Some 25 per cent of land in the city centre is covered by roads, while pavements take up just eight per cent.  In Edinburgh, however, there is a more equal balance, with roads using just 12% of space, while pavements have 10%.  The commission\u0026rsquos report also points to a rise in goods vehicles \u0026ndash such as home delivery services \u0026ndash and private-hire taxis which could be adding to congestion problems.  The independent commission was established by Glasgow Council leader Susan Aitken with a remit to rethink the city centre as a business, retail and leisure destination.  It is spearheaded by former government transport adviser Professor David Begg.  He said: \u0026ldquoA generation ago Glasgow  led the way across the UK towards  what was seen as a modernised transport system built for the car.  \u0026ldquoNow, with rapidly changing demands and a trend towards low-carbon infrastructure, the priorities of people have changed quite dramatically.  \u0026ldquoThe dominance of the road is being questioned not only in social terms  with its negative impact on air quality and road safety, but also economically as its rival European cities transform their environments in favour of pedestrians, cyclists and integrated public transport.  It pointed to a dramatic decline in bus use which has seen passenger numbers slump by 40% in the past decade. In the past four years, First Bus has lost 27 million passengers \u0026ndash a markedly worse decline than any other UK city.  Despite the introduction of cycle lanes and better walkways, evidence to the commission from SPT had shown  journeys by bike had increased by 3%  in the decade to 2016, and the proportion of journeys on foot had fallen from  15% to 11%.  The findings pointed to research that showed large increases in city-centre employment in Manchester and Leeds occurring at the same time as a population boom. Many new residents were young professionals attracted by job prospects and amenities.  Ms Aitken said: \u0026ldquoDavid Begg\u0026rsquos expertise and knowledge speaks for itself. I gave him and his commissioners a very broad remit \u0026ndash linked to improving the city centre experience supporting the local economy, and ensuring all of Glasgow\u0026rsquos people can share in the prosperity it creates.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom pleased to see them really take that challenge on and it is clear the commission has already gathered some very significant and sometimes uncomfortable evidence.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not going to try to second-guess what their final recommendations are going to be, but I\u0026rsquom convinced they will present a healthy challenge to the city and to members of all parties on the council.  The commission will produce its final report and recommendations in November."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7922625.jpg?type=article-full","title":"  Get into the summer spirit with these great Scottish gins","story":"              SCOTLAND\u0027S\u0026nbsplove of gin continues to evolve in new and interesting ways.  The juniper berry based spirit is being developed across the country with many craft distilleries popping up offering a new twist on the refreshing and versatile drink. Gin makes the ideal summer drink no matter the setting.  Below we have listed some of the finest concoctions of Scottish gins currently on the market\u0026hellip  Verdant Dry Gin  As winners of the Scottish Gin of the Year Award, their full flavour, no fuss approach, has gained Verdant Dry Gin widespread acclaim. Smooth and sophisticated, it has gained wide appeal thanks to its classic taste and style. Distilled in small batches from the highest quality ingredients in a 500 litre pot still named \u0026ldquoLittle Eddie after the old jute mill where it is made, Verdant Gin is the first and only gin distilled in Dundee. \u0027    Juniper-led, the spirit displays fresh notes of citrus from Spain, coriander from India balanced with warm, earthy undertones of spice. This carefully curated blend of botanicals was inspired by Dundee\u0026rsquos rich trading history and reflects the routes once sailed by traders to and from the city.  At just over a year old, the spirit is already packing a punch in the world of Scottish gins, beating off some stiff competition. Seeking to produce a modern yet classic gin, they have successfully created a rounded spirit with that can be enjoyed on its own, with tonic or in a cocktail.    They recommend Verdant Gin be served neat (on the rocks or not) or as a G\u0026ampT with your favourite tonic. Bottled at 43% ABV, it also has plenty of character to hold its own when used in the skilled mixologist\u0026rsquos hands, adding depth and vitality to new and traditional cocktail creations.

The still was made locally in Elgin by highly skilled craftsmen who carefully shaped copper sheets into a traditional 250l copper still making the micro-distillery one of the smallest in the region.    Gin enthusiasts will be given a rare insight into this Elgin based distillery as they open their doors with an upcoming special two day event. On Saturday 7 and Sunday 8 July, you will have the chance to join a small group for an intimate tour of the facility. During the open days you can taste their popular range of Avva Scottish Gins, along with their sister brand Berry Good Liqueurs.  Avva Scottish Gin was launched in 2016, with strong links to surrounding Elgin. The ethos behind the company is history, provenance and family, made evident through the personal details all intrinsically linked to the name, the design, the still, botanical selection, the Speyside region and the distillers\u0026rsquo family.    Jill Brown, the founder and owner of Moray Distillery, said: \u0026ldquoThe distillery is not normally open to the public, so we\u0026rsquore excited to host another open day. It\u0026rsquos a great activity for people to experience around the area, and something a little different, especially for anyone looking to have a day out and explore Elgin.  \u0026ldquoIt was important for us to create a product with links to our history and culture. Our still is called Jessie Jean- named after both my grandmothers, and Avva actually means respected grandmother. The \u0026lsquorose window\u0026rsquo design on each bottle was created to represent what it was thought the Elgin Cathedral window looked like.  \u0026ldquoThe feedback we\u0026rsquove had since the launch has been immense\u0026hellip I\u0026rsquom really proud of our gin.

As trains pass overhead on their way south from Glasgow Central station, Darran is busy distilling Illicit Gin using traditional methods. Botanicals infuse in a\u0026nbsp copper pot still over a naked flame, the process is truly small batch and each bottle is hand-filled and labelled on site.    With their first product launching in April this year Illicit Gin aims to take gin back to its roots, the way gin should be \u0026ndash with juniper firmly at the forefront. Other botanicals including liquorice, clove, cinnamon and nutmeg \u0026ndash which contribute a sweet, earthy flavour \u0026ndash along with perfumed notes from the likes of cardamom and orange and lemon peels provide citrus freshness.  The short, squat nature of the still used at Illicit Spirits helps produce spirits which are full-bodied, flavourful in character, and rich in texture. A spirit of this kind deserves to be enjoyed simply, neat over ice, or served with a premium tonic, slice of orange peel and a bruised cardamom pod.    \u0026nbspIllicit Gin is currently stocked in a small selection of independent bars and off-licences throughout Glasgow and beyond, and will be moving into UK-wide distribution later in the year.  en-gb.facebook/illicitspiritsco  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Isle of Skye Distillers  Isle of Skye Distillers\u0026rsquo story began in 2016, when brothers Alistair and Thomas Wilson combined their experience in the hospitality and construction industries and completed their vision: to build the first gin distillery on the Isle of Skye.    At Isle of Skye Distillers, provenance is everything. The distillery is proud to use locally foraged juniper berries and clear spring water from the Storr Lochs to create their small-batch spirits: Misty Isle Gin, and Tommy\u0026rsquos Gin, both infused with a true taste of Skye. Every part of the production process is carried out at the distillery in Portree, right down to hand-numbering and signing each bottle.  Alongside these locally grown juniper berries, Misty Isle Gin is distilled with a precise balance of botanicals, including coriander, grains of paradise, orris root, liquorice root, black cubebs, angelica root, lemon peel, lemon verbena, cassia bark, and another secret ingredient, which can only be found at high altitude on the Isle of Skye. Still crafted according to the original recipe first developed by Thomas and Alistair during the distillery\u0026rsquos creation, Misty Isle Gin is juniper-heavy with earthy undertones, a hint of spice, and best enjoyed with a Scottish tonic water and a twist of orange peel.  Distilled alongside Misty Isle Gin is Tommy\u0026rsquos Gin, which was created in memory of Alistair and Thomas\u0026rsquo late father, Tommy Wilson, who served in the Suez invasion. \u0026lsquoTommy\u0026rsquo is also a generic name and term of endearment for a soldier. For every bottle of Tommy\u0026rsquos Gin sold, a donation is made to local military charities.    Crafted with botanicals including poppy seed, coriander, liquorice root, blaeberry and sweet orange, Tommy\u0026rsquos Gin is best served with fresh Scottish blaeberries and garnished with a twist of lemon peel.  Pick up a bottle of Misty Isle Gin (RRP \u0026pound34) or Tommy\u0026rsquos Gin (RRP \u0026pound39.95) from Isle of Skye Distillers\u0026rsquo shop in Portree, from an independent spirits retailer, or order a bottle online.\u0026nbsp  For more information, a full list of stockists and to browse the distillery\u0026rsquos online shop, please visit www.isleofskyedistillers.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  McQueen Gin  Dale and Vicky McQueen, a husband and wife with a passion for gin and adventure, decided to embark on the McQueen Gin journey in 2015 after leaving their careers as a mechanical engineer and master baker and chef respectively. In the work they do (and have done!), Dale and Vicky have always focused on creating the purest, best possible standard of end product. The precision of an engineer and the taste of perfection from a master baker and chef made the perfect blend for the development of this award winning gin brand.    McQueen Gin is a true craft spirit gin brand, which shares Dale and Vicky\u0026rsquos taste of adventure. They are fulfilling their dream by creating a product made using the purest and most authentic of methods and sharing it with the increasing population of gin lovers. The McQueen gins are infused with natural notes of hand-selected botanicals during distillation, with no flavour elements added after it leaves their much-loved still named \u0026lsquoLittle Maggie\u0026rsquo. This trademark distillation method means that each unique flavour is pure and perfectly balanced, allowing the adventurous gin drinker an experience that is absolutely unrivalled.    Based at their much-loved distillery in Callander, Scotland they introduced true craft spirits with flavour profiles such as smokey chilli, mocha, mint chocolate and sweet citrus, with something for every occasion and flavour profiles that true craft gin drinkers can\u0026rsquot wait to try. The strong belief in their philosophy of bringing customers a taste of adventure and discovery, married with their unique distillation method, is what makes the product so unique. Craft gin drinkers increasingly want provenance and true hand-crafted products, something McQueen ensures. When developing the product, the team spent 6 months working on over 100 iterations to develop the initial product range which was a world first at the time.  At McQueen Gin, they continue to explore new innovative methods to ensure that their pure and exciting products deliver on all levels. This includes the imminent introduction of a stylish new glass version of their award-winning ceramic bottle and the build of a new and improved distillery on their land in Callander, which has recently got underway.

Each of our spirits is characterised by our use of locally grown botanicals, including a variety of Norse Angelica brought to the islands by seafarers centuries ago. We grow these botanicals in partnership with the Orkney Agronomy Institute in Kirkwall, ensuring consistent quality throughout the harvest.  If you\u0026rsquove not already experienced our gins, please allow us to share the highlights.  Firstly, we have our acclaimed Norse inspired signature gin, Kirkjuvagr, evoking the freshness of the Orkney seas and the purity of our island environment.  For the bold, we offer a 57% ABV, Storm Strength Arkh-Angell gin, which adds new depths to the renowned flavour profile of its elder spirit.  And, finally, we have our newest release, Harpa, a light and fruity gin that takes Kirkjuvagr\u0026rsquos character in a new direction for the long days of summer.  It\u0026rsquos a range that offers something for all occasions and every season.  This summer sees Orkney Distilling move to a permanent new home on the shores of Kirkwall Bay, representing the latest chapter in our saga.                         .bc-player-rkgvgWjWCG_default .vjs-tech { position: static !important }                       .bc-player-rkgvgWjWCG_default { height: auto !important width: 100% !important}                       .vjs-playlist-description { display: none }                       .vjs-big-play-button { top: 0pxleft: 0pxright: 0pxbottom: 0pxmargin: auto }                       .vjs-mouse.vjs-playlist { background-color: #f7f4f1color: #000min-width: auto }                       .vjs-playlist cite { overflow: initialtext-overflow: initialwhite-space: initialfont-weight: 600font-size: 16px }                       .vjs-mouse.vjs-playlist time { color: #fff }                       cite.vjs-playlist-name { text-align: left }                       .story-credits { margin-top: 20px }                       #liveMultiHide .vjs-dock-description { display: none }                       .vjs-playlist-thumbnail { margin-right: 10px !IMPORTANT }                        /* Style the overlay */                        /* Hide the overlay */                        .hide-countdown {                            display: none                        }                        .hide-overlay {                            display: none                        }                        /* Style the overlay */                        .vjs-overlay,                        .vjs-overlay.vjs-overlay-top {                            position: absolute                            top: 0px                            left: 0px                        }                        .vjs-overlay p {                            width: 100px                            background-color: #000000                            color: #fff                            padding: 10px                            margin: 0                            margin-bottom: 0                            border-radius: 0px                            text-align: left                        }                                               width=\"100%\"                            data-account=\"64298557001\"                            data-player=\"rkgvgWjWCG\"                            data-embed=\"default\"                            data-video-id=\"5797498382001\"                            class=\"video-js\"                            playsinline                            data-random-id=\"1582440305\"                            controls  We\u0026rsquove approached the creation of our new distillery and visitor centre with the same attention to detail that we apply to our gin production.

One of the few craft distilleries to be awarded brown sign status, it has been publicly recognised as a star-rated destination on the Scottish tourist map.  The stables-turned-distillery \u0026ndash which was voted Most Promising New Business at the Perthshire Chamber of Commerce Star Awards \u0026ndash is where Persie gin is hand-crafted in small batches. There are three richly aromatic expressions: Zesty Citrus Herby and Sweet \u0026amp Nutty Old Tom.    The three expressions were developed by the man behind Scotland\u0026rsquos first touring gin enterprise. Founded in 2013, Gin Club Scotland was launched with the sole purpose of hearing the voice of the customer and using these insights to make a home-grown Scottish gin that hit the spot. It worked like a charm: in under a year, Simon Fairclough had visited every Scottish region and heard from over 2,000 gin-lovers about what appealed to their taste buds, pocket and sense of style. He harvested this feedback and found out two things. Firstly, for cracking gin, you need more than a nice taste: you need aroma. With over 75% of flavour down to smell, the perfect interplay of aroma and taste is the single biggest influence among Scots for liking each gin. And, secondly, three profiles proved most popular at tastings by a wide margin \u0026ndash fruity, savoury and sweet.    The result is that Persie Gin taps right into that \u0026ndash with a family of three distinct styles of aromatic gin. Each gin is made with carefully chosen botanicals to evoke an emotive and comforting scent: Zesty Citrus is sharply fruity, chock-full of limes and oranges Herby \u0026amp Aromatic is dry and savoury, with fragrant rosemary and basil and Sweet \u0026amp Nutty is full-bodied and creamy,\u0026nbspwith fresh\u0026nbspvanilla pods, almonds and a hint of root ginger.  All three gins scooped awards in the first year of trading. Zesty Citrus was voted Best Gin in Scotland Under \u0026pound35 by Scottish Field magazine Herby \u0026amp Aromatic was awarded a Silver Outstanding for Gin \u0026amp Tonic by the International Wine \u0026amp Spirits Competition and Sweet \u0026amp Nutty Old Tom was awarded a Silver Medal in the Speciality Gin category at the Scottish Gin Awards.  The distillery is open to the public for drop-ins, tours and tastings.  www.persiedistillery  snifter@persiedistillery  @persiegin  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Porter\u0027s Gin  Founders Ben, Josh and Alex turned the basement of their award winning Aberdeen cocktail bar, Orchid, into a micro-distillery. They focus on modern gin recipes that pay respect to tradition.\u0026nbsp      The result is a modern classic gin with a punchy juniper and a unique citrus flavour profile. The fresh, light and clean flavour from the cold-distilled botanicals make this a perfect gin for long refreshing summer drinks.

The expansive ocean surrounding the beautiful Isle of Barra has inspired the island-born couple\u0026rsquos adventure into the world of distilling.    With many goals set for the future of the Isle of Barra Distillers, it is the deep sense of duty that drives the team on. With a firm belief of giving something back to the community and at the same time building something that will one day outlive anyone that walks through the doors.  Michael feels that \u0026ldquoabove everything else that we can achieve from this journey, it is the thought of both giving something back to this beautiful island and also putting the Isle of Barra on the \u0026lsquogin map\u0026rsquo that drives us forward. We feel we owe it to the island and its people - we have the opportunity to do something great and something great is what we are going to do.    The key botanical in Barra gin is sourced naturally from the crystal clear, pure shallows that surround the remotre isle of Barra.  Every piece of edible carrageen seaweed is meticulously selected and handpicked by us on Barra\u0027s beautiful beaches to provide the distinctive flavour of our unique gin.  The carrageen, also known by its scientific name Chondrus Crispus, is a species of red algae native to the cool Atlantic waters skirting Europe\u0026rsquos rocky coastlines, including our beautiful Isle of Barra. Like many of the other seaweed varieties found on the Scottish coast, carrageen is harvested after the spring tides, when the water is furthest from the shore.  It\u0026rsquos this passion and belief that must surely make the story of the Isle of Barra Distillers one to remember.  www.isleofbarradistillers\u0026nbsp  www.facebook/barradistillers  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The Teasmith Gin  The Teasmith Gin creators Nick and Emma Smalley have created something truly special - the first Scottish Gin distilled with hand-picked tea. \u0026nbspWhy? Because Scotland has many historical links with the tea trade with several stemming from Aberdeenshire which is where the Founders are based. \u0026nbsp    When they discovered the story of James Taylor \u0026ndash a young man from the area - who grew the very first commercial tea plantation in British Ceylon, they worked with tea consultant Beverly Wainwright to source a special loose leaf tea from the Amba Estate in Sri Lanka.\u0026nbsp It is both hand-picked and hand-rolled \u0026ndash much in the same way Taylor produced his first batches 150 years ago on the island. \u0026nbsp  When distilled, the tea provides fabulous citrus notes of blood orange along with a minty sweetness. \u0026nbspThese flavours are paired with more classic gin botanicals such as juniper, coriander seed, dried orange peel, angelica and orris root and a sprinkle of rose petals to create a smooth and fresh juniper-led gin with a citrusy lingering sweetness\u0026nbsp  Finalists in three categories at the 2017 Scottish Gin Awards and racking up 5 awards for brand design already, this gin doesn\u0026rsquot disappoint. A truly smooth gin packaged in a beautifully simple bottle with lots of hidden hand-finishes \u0026ndash it ticks all the boxes.    Serve this gin with copious ice, a premium quality tonic and sprig of fresh mint for a truly crisp and refreshing G\u0026ampT. \u0026nbspOr as a cocktail suggestion, The Teasmith Southside is a really simple drink that you can make at home.  The Teasmith Gin is available through The Teasmith Gin\u0026rsquos website for \u0026pound38.95 or through the Master of Malt. \u0026nbspAvailable in store at Valhalla\u0026rsquos Goat (Glasgow) and The Gin Company (Edinburgh) and many other stockists listed on their website.

The development and refinement of the gin began when Cameron took it upon himself to install in the family kitchen a micro still named Jinty\u0027. He then spent six months distilling and experimenting with around 60 different botanicals in various forms.    The McCann\u0027s then enlisted the help of several Stirling residents / gin enthusiasts by creating a tasting panel whom tested and validated the gin.

It\u0026rsquos actually so much worse.  There was a sombre start, with a minute\u0026rsquos silence in memory of Grenfell. Presiding Officer Ken Macintosh then nodded to the VIP gallery to welcome the latest visiting hardman.  \u0026ldquoAndriy Parubiy, Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada, the Parliament of the Ukraine, he said.

The SNP was planning \u0026ldquoto release more criminals back into communities, she said, and didn\u0026rsquot care if the blighters cut off their curfew anklets.  \u0026ldquoI certainly hope that the parliamentary authorities allow more than 15 minutes debate for those important issues, she quipped.  So far, so standard. The next 40 minutes stretched agonisingly over the horizon.  And then Richard Leonard showed us just what he\u0026rsquos made of. It was extraordinary. It was a revelation. It was truly the Scottish Labour leader at the peak of his powers  \u0026ldquoCan the First Minister give us another word for a hummingbird\u0026rsquos beak? he asked.  Now, you\u0026rsquore probably thinking I just made that up. But no. I\u0026rsquom a journalist not a surrealist.  \u0026ldquoEh, not immediately, no, replied the First Minister warily, groping for the security alarm under her desk.  The chamber fell silent. The tension crackled. The Ukrainian delegation stirred nervously. Hearts went out to the bloke in the translator\u0026rsquos box tasked with conveying that one to the Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada.  \u0026lsquoComrade Sturgeon, please to describe the mouth of a tiny chicken,\u0026rsquo he whimpered.  Mr Leonard said the FM\u0026rsquos reply was \u0026ldquounfortunate as the fabled \u0026ldquohummingbird\u0026rsquos beak question was one of the government\u0026rsquos standardised test posers for five-year-olds.  \u0026ldquoLittle wonder that Scotland\u0026rsquos teachers have told me how young and confident children are crushed by these tests, he said, miming the crushing of a five-year-old in a car compactor.  \u0026ldquoThere have been reports of children being driven to tears! he went on. \u0026ldquoTears!  One educational charity had even likened the tests to a traumatic \u0026ldquoadverse childhood experience, he said, conjuring up the image of a hummingbird silhouette slashing at a shower curtain with its hooter.  \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot know what Richard Leonard was doing yesterday, sneered Ms Sturgeon in a tone strongly suggesting she thought it involved concussion.  \u0026ldquoBut I talked to a range of primary school children, including some five-year-olds. I did not meet any who were in tears or see any who looked crushed. I saw confident, bright and enthusiastic young people.  Beaky Leonard reckoned that sounded thoroughly improbable. Standardised tests were flawed and had to stop, he said.  \u0026ldquoFM, will you stop standardised testing for five-year-olds now and put pupils first?  Ms Sturgeon said she would always listen to feedback from teachers - but not Labour.  As for the answer to Mr Leonard\u0026rsquos question? He managed to cock even that up.  It later emerged the test is actually a multiple choice that runs: \u0026ldquoThe hummingbird has a thin beak. What is another word for beak?  Kids, crushed and otherwise, are then asked to choose between skin, bill and body.  Mr Leonard\u0026rsquos choices, meanwhile, appear destined to stay ridicule, failure and obscurity."},{"url":null,"title":"Thousands join SNP after party  39 s dramatic Westminster walk-out","story":"              THOUSANDS of new members have signed up to the SNP in the wake of the party\u0026rsquos dramatic Westminster walk-out.  Nationalist MPs stormed out of the Commons after their Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, was ordered to leave the chamber following a row with the Speaker.  Since then, the SNP said its membership has surged by 5,085 in just 24 hours \u0026ndash putting it on the cusp of being the second largest party in the UK, ahead of the Conservatives.  Deputy leader Keith Brown said the SNP was \u0026ldquothe only party standing up for Scotland and doing all we can to defend the powers of our Parliament.  Mr Blackford was ordered to leave during Prime Minister\u0026rsquos Questions after clashing with Commons Speaker John Bercow.  The SNP Westminster leader had accused the UK Government of plunging Scotland into a \u0026ldquoconstitutional crisis over its decision to push on with its Brexit Bill despite Holyrood withholding consent.  He attempted to use a parliamentary device by calling for an immediate vote on turning PMQs into a private session. But after repeatedly refusing to sit down, Mr Blackford was ordered to leave the Commons \u0026ndash with the rest of his party\u0026rsquos MPs quickly following suit.  Mr Brown said: \u0026ldquoThe Tories think they can do what they want to Scotland and get away with it, but Scotland has told the Tories loudly and clearly \u0026ndash hands off our parliament.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos no wonder people are joining the SNP in their droves \u0026ndash we are the only party standing up for Scotland and doing all we can to defend the powers of our Parliament.

It is understood around 50-100 normally join or rejoin the SNP on any given day.  It comes as First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warned the Tories will pay \"a very, very heavy political price\" for their handling of the Brexit Bill.  Ms Sturgeon said Theresa May\u0027s party had effectively \"ripped up\" the convention underpinning devolution, and \"hoped that nobody would notice\".  Speaking at First Minister\u0027s Questions, she said events at Westminster this week were \"the most clear and powerful evidence so far\" that the system does not work for Scotland.  She addressed MSPs shortly after crowds gathered outside Holyrood to protest against what the SNP claims is a \"Westminster power grab\".  The party\u0027s MPs were left outraged on Tuesday evening when amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill affecting Scotland were passed after less than 20 minutes of debate, with the only speech being from Cabinet Office minister David Lidington.  Mr Blackford has warned the SNP will now take \"whatever action is necessary\" to press its case, and will work to \"frustrate\" Theresa May\u0027s administration."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/5072730.jpg?type=article-full","title":"Honeybees deployed to  sniff out  landmines","story":"              THEY are usually found bumbling around from flower to flower, their concerns chiefly revolving around the collecting of pollen and the making of honey.  But now the humble honeybee is being hailed as a potential warzone life-saver after Scottish scientists managed to train them to sniff out landmines.  Researchers at St Andrews University let slip the bees of war in a former Yugoslavian warzone, teaching them to find unexploded ordnance by sniffing out the smell of bombs.  The buzzing insects were released and tracked across what was once a battlefield in Croatia, and then examined when they returned to the hive for tiny traces of explosives.  Once confirmed, footage from drones was used to pinpoint the spot where the bees had been, allowing recover teams to go in and disarm any landmines they found.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspConservationists put out feelers to save Scotland\u0027s bees    Dr Ross Gillander, a research fellow in the department of physics at St Andrews, helped design the equipment which allows the bees to be examined when they come back to their hive.  The project borrows standard Apismellisera Carnica honeybees which are trained over two days by placing sugar syrup on top of some TNT.  \"Basically we teach them by a version of reward like you do with dogs,\" said Dr Gillander.  \"The bees fly out of their hive to go about their normal day to day job of finding pollen but instead of finding pollen they find explosives. It\u0027s the sugar syrup, which draws them out.  \"The training takes two days and is much faster and more efficient than training a dog. However, after three days the bees realise that they aren\u0027t getting reward from the TNT and as a result are disinterested in it and look for other things.  \"After three days we have to re-train the honeybees to detect the explosives.\"  Remarkable video shot from a drone shows how the movement of the mine-hunting bees can be detected by infra red cameras.    READ MORE:\u0026nbspSave our bees - why one Scottish estate is supporting bee keeping and why we should do the same  The footage followed the fluffy pollinators around in the test site, and when the bees stay in the same place, it indicates to researchers they have made a discovery.  Dr Gillander explained this was a first as the flying bugs \"are very small and very fast, which makes them difficult to track\".  Honeybees have an advantage over sniffer dogs when it comes to finding explosives as dogs only work for 15 minutes at a time. Dogs, which are more expensive to train, see it as a \"game\" and quickly get bored.  Bees will work tirelessly and are not affected by the chemical compounds found in explosives. They can get to areas that that are more difficult to get to than dogs.  Dr Gillander, a physicist, designed the equipment that tests the bees for explosives when they return to the hive.  The bees go through a special canvas-type material which is then exposed to light.  \"A drop in light emission (like a light dimmer switch) confirms the presence of explosives,\" said Dr Gillander.  Real-world tests started in Croatia in November last year, funded by NATO Science for Peace and Security, and using bees from local hives.  The types of landmines the insects are being trained to detect are Yugoslavian PMA-2 and PMA-3 mines, along with some Russian or Soviet anti-personnel devices.    READ MORE:\u0026nbspUniversity library in quite a buzz after colony of bees is found in the walls\u0026nbsp  The bees do have drawbacks, however. Rain and darkness will normally deter them from going out on their life-saving missions.  Precise details of the tests are being kept under wraps for now, but Dr Gillander said the use of bees looked \"promising\".  The academic revealed there had so far been just one casualty from the testing - PhD student James Glackin, who was strung three times while driving 6,000 bees to the test site.  The early results of the ongoing trials in Croatia hold out hope that more of the millions of abandoned mines around the world could be cleared up more quickly, sparing thousands of people from being killed or injured.  There are an estimated 110 million land mines lost across the world which kill or injure between 15,000 to 20,000 people annually."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7926358.jpg?type=article-full","title":"Comradeship can never be underestimated","story":"              Scotland\u0026rsquos largest membership charity for veterans is seeking more volunteers to help tackle isolation and loneliness among the Armed Forces community.

One teacher in Edinburgh said they had spent around 70 hours administering the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos standardised tests on their school\u0026rsquos 54 primary one pupils.  It comes as ministers came under increasing pressure to scrap the assessments amid claims some children have been reduced to tears.  In an email sent to Scottish Labour MSP Iain Gray, the Edinburgh primary teacher said they had overseen 30 hours of testing for numeracy and 40 for literacy.  They added: \u0026ldquoThe amount of progress that could have been delivered if those hours were used for effective teaching is significant and instead we were required to use that time to run testing which\u0026hellipis problematic in almost every regard.  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon introduced the new tests last year as a response to concerns over falling standards of literacy and numeracy and a lack of consistent data across the country.  But critics insist testing pupils in the first year of primary \u0026ndash as well as in P4, P7 and S3 \u0026ndash piles too much pressure on children and teachers.  Raising the issue at First Minister\u0026rsquos Questions, Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said teachers had told him that young, confident children had been \u0026ldquocrushed by the assessments.  Calling for them to be scrapped, he said: \u0026ldquoAt SNP conference John Swinney claimed that we are seeing the start of a renaissance in Scottish education. This \u0026lsquorenaissance\u0026rsquo is driving primary school children to tears.  \u0026ldquoThese tests have been flawed from the very start. Delivered late, \u0026pound2 million over budget and have led to weeks of valuable teaching time lost.  In their email, the Edinburgh teacher \u0026ndash whose identity has been kept anonymous to protect their job \u0026ndash also raised a number of issues with the design and wording of the tests.  They wrote: \u0026ldquoMany of the questions in the tests are very poorly phrased \u0026ndash often at best they are ambiguous and at worst they are so badly written that they are actually misleading.  In one example, children were presented with the problem: \u0026ldquoJane had six grapes on her plate, she ate three of them, choose Jane\u0026rsquos plate.  The teacher said the phrasing of the question made it unclear whether pupils should choose the half-eaten plate, or the original.  They also noted that out of the 54 pupils tested, \u0026ldquonot one child came out as low on the numeracy test, even though some of them only gave a handful of correct answers.  They added: \u0026ldquoThe only conclusion I can reach having watched this process from beginning to end is that these tests have been set up to give a deliberately vague picture which broadly supports the idea that the attainment gap is closing.  \u0026ldquoI cannot use the data from these tests to support my teaching in any way. It does not provide reliable information on any aspect of my children\u0026rsquos learning or development.  Larry Flanagan, general secretary of the EIS teaching union, said many of the concerns raised by the teacher had also been brought up by other members.  He said primary teachers faced a logistical challenge as they administered the tests, which require pupils to have access to computers.  He added: \u0026ldquoWe had people at the [latest] conference talking about children being distressed.  Responding to Mr Leonard at FMQs, Ms Sturgeon said: \u0026ldquoWe are determined, as I have said on so many occasions, to continue to raise standards in our schools, and to close the attainment gap.  \u0026ldquoAnd being able to assess, in an age-appropriate way, how our young people are doing in school is an important part of that.

She said: \"The First Minister is proposing to release more criminals back to communities, and under those plans a serious offender could be released from prison, could be given a tag, cut it off, breach the terms of their release and incredibly that wouldn\u0027t automatically be considered an offence.

One pro-EU Conservative branded the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos strategy \"sneaky\" while another claimed the wording of a new UK Government amendment was changed to deny MPs the chance of blocking a \"no-deal\" Brexit and sending UK ministers back to the negotiating table should Westminster reject the final agreement.  Earlier this week, Mrs May avoided an almost certain Commons defeat by inviting potential rebels into her private office and assuring them that their concerns about having a \"meaningful vote\" on the final Brexit deal would be addressed.  Yet the PM\u0026rsquos new amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill, tabled Thursday evening, leaves Parliament facing a stark \"deal or no deal\" choice.  It says if MPs rejected the final agreement, then Parliament would be offered the opportunity only to vote on a \"neutral motion,\" saying MPs had considered a minister\u0027s statement on the matter.  Crucially, this motion would be unamendable, so MPs could not order Mrs May to go back to the negotiating table, extend the Brexit transition or revoke the UK\u0027s withdrawal under Article 50.  Leading pro-EU Conservative Dominic Grieve said he believed, after a very sensible negotiation with the PM, there had been an agreement, but \u0026ldquoat the last moment part of the text was changed to make the final motion unamendable\u0026hellipIt is unacceptable.  Mr Grieve tabled his own amendment, enabling MPs to dictate the next steps the Government should take in the event of a no deal.

Creative Scotland must urgently address its strategic failings, the Culture Committee has written, in a 12-page letter to its chief executive, Janet Archer.  In a particularly damaging comment, the cross-party committee says that its handling of the decision making processes for long-term funding of touring theatre and dance \"fell well below the standard that is expected from a non-departmental public body.\"  READ MORE: Inside the Creative Scotland crisis  Creative Scotland now has until the end of August to answer a series of further questions that the committee raise.  The committee has, in particular, criticised the way that Creative Scotland withdrew stable long-term funding from theatre companies, telling them they could apply to a new Touring Fund instead.  The Touring Fund, a source of much of the confusion and anger over the funding decisions, has yet to be officially launched.  The letter says: \"Creative Scotland should have made a decision about touring companies\u0026rsquo eligibility for regular funding before applications were opened and communicated its decision clearly to the sector.  \"The failure to do so has meant that artists and organisations have committed staff and financial resources unnecessarily to complete regular funding applications.  \"This approach has hampered the sector\u0026rsquos trust in Creative Scotland and added to ongoing uncertainty for the sector at a time when the funding pressures on the sector are already high.\"  Read more: The Herald publishes Creative Scotland FOI documents  Creative Scotland, and its funding-decision making process, was plunged into the crisis earlier this year, when it made a series of cuts to theatre companies as part of its crucial Regular Funded Organisation (RFO) spending round.  The uproar over cuts to companies such as Catherine Wheels and Birds of Paradise, as well as other companies such as NVA and the Dunedin Consort, led two board members to resign.  After an emergency board meeting, a U-turn on some, but not all, of the cuts was announced.  MSPs of the committee, which is led by convener Joan McAlpine, heard evidence from Ms Archer and the then-interim chair of the Creative Scotland board, Ben Thomson, on February 22.  It has also gathered evidence, more than 50 responses, from artists and organisations - some of which is scathing.  Ms McAlpine said: \"We received unprecedented levels of representations from within the sector following Creative Scotland\u0026rsquos handling of regular funding for 2018-21.  \"With more than 50 responses from artists and arts organisations, it is clear to us that the confidence of a significant element of the cultural sector in Creative Scotland\u0026rsquos regular funding process has been badly damaged.  \"In particular we felt that the handling of the process in relation to touring theatre and dance companies fell well below the standard that is expected from a non-departmental public body.\"  The deputy convener, Claire Baker, said: \"The committee has expressed serious concern over Creative Scotland\u0026rsquos Regular Funding for the 2018-21 period.  \"We keenly await its written response to the issues we have raised and have set a deadline of 31 August.  \"We will also invite representatives of Creative Scotland to appear before the committee again when Parliament returns from summer recess.\"  Other findings include that the Committee considers it a \"a serious matter that Creative Scotland\u0026rsquos evidence about whether the Board was aware of factual inaccuracies contained in assessment reports before its emergency meeting on 2 February has been challenged by the written evidence received.\"  It also adds: \"The Committee is disappointed that the strategic issues identified by Creative Scotland were not recognised at an earlier stage so that they could be addressed before applications for regular funding were opened.  \"The failure to do so left the sector in a very challenging position and has ultimately had an impact on a significant element of the cultural sector\u0026rsquos confidence in the regular funding process.\"  The Committee also expresses doubts over the decision to award long term funding to \"network organisations\" - bodies which represent or lobby for certain art forms.  It says: \"The cultural sector is concerned that too much regular funding is being directed away from artists towards network organisations.  \"The Committee therefore invites Creative Scotland to consider an alternative model for the funding of network organisations going forward.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Obstructionist tactics of Parnell  39 s Irish Nationalists should be SNP   39 template   39  say party insiders","story":"              THE obstructionist tactics of the Irish Nationalists under Charles Stewart Parnell in the 19th century should become the \u0026ldquotemplate for the SNP at Westminster in its threat to frustrate UK Government business, party insiders have suggested.  Taking a leaf out of the Irish Parliamentary Party\u0026rsquos book could mean Scottish Nationalist MPs making lengthy speeches, creating innumerable amendments to bills and calling for unnecessary votes tactics designed to \u0026ldquogum up the Westminster system.

Mr McDonald told MPs: \u0026ldquoParnell, of course, along with his colleagues at the time, successfully used the standing orders of the House to frustrate Government business - which is an entirely legitimate tactic - to force them to take Irish issues seriously, including in a 45-hour sitting on the 1877 South Africa Bill.  \u0026ldquoGiven the way that Ireland has this Government over a barrel at the minute, it might just be that those tactics are of interest to honourable members at the present time, said the Glasgow South MP.

The Department for Work and Pensions has admitted itself that it cannot measure whether managing the programme but has itself admitted that it cannot measure whether UC is achieving its policy goal of getting an additional 200,000 people into work.  The roll-out was initially intended to be complete by October 2017, but at present only around one in ten of those eventually expected to be on UC are claiming it.  The NAO also queried claims by the department that people were not suffering difficulties and hardship and satisfaction rates among claimants are high.  It said the DWP had not shown sufficient sensitivity towards some claimants and that it does not know how many claimants are having problems with the programme.  Its report concludes that there is no practical alternative to continuing with rollout of UC but said ministers should make sure the programme does not expand before it has learned from insights it has gained from the roll-out so far.  Amyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office, said \u0026ldquoThe Department has kept pushing the Universal Credit rollout forward through a series of problems. We recognise both its determination and commitment, and that there is really no practical choice but to keep on keeping on with the rollout.  \u0026ldquoWe don\u0026rsquot think DWP has shown the same commitment to listening and responding to the hardship faced by claimants.  \"We think the larger claims for Universal Credit, such as boosted employment, are unlikely to be demonstrable at any point in future. Nor for that matter will value for money.  Critics of the Government\u0027s Universal Credit have seized the report to call for changes to the flagship benefit.  Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: \"While Universal Credit is working well for some, more than a quarter of a million people are expected to wait longer than five weeks for their first full payment. This puts them at risk of falling behind on bills and getting into debt - a heavy price to pay for a system that isn\u0027t working properly.\"  Alison Garnham, the chief executive of Child Poverty Action Group, said: \"The picture the NAO presents is justifiably bleak.  \"On the ground, new claimants can\u0027t even be sure they will be paid in full and on time, and how many people will be helped into work by the benefit is far from clear.\"  Margaret Greenwood, shadow DWP secretary, said: \"The Government has shamelessly ignored warning after warning about the devastating impact their flagship welfare reform has had on people\u0027s lives.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Ian McConnell  Britain seems like such a funny little country when the Brexiters bluster","story":"              BRITAIN sometimes seems like a funny little country these days.  True, it still ranks as one of the world\u0026rsquos big economies. But Chancellor Philip Hammond conceded in November that it had fallen from fifth to sixth-biggest, having been overtaken by France. And the UK\u0026rsquos own woeful performance and policy errors, and the rise of other countries, such as India, look set to ensure the drift down the rankings continues.  It is important to recognise that a country\u0026rsquos standing on the international stage is about much more than just size. It is also about influence, and attitude, and behaviour. Unfortunately for the UK, there is surely no arguing with the assertion that, in the strange days since the Brexit vote, the description of \u0026ldquofunny little could be applied to the mindset of so many Brexiters when it comes to the wider world.  It has been another most curious, though unfortunately no less lamentable, week on the Brexit front.  Read More: Ian McConnell: Taiwan strives for regional cooperation as UK turns back on partners with Brexit  We have had blustering Tory Brexiters in the House of Commons declaim (to summarise) that the people voted for Brexit and they must not be denied it.  In the same week, we have had a further raft of dismal economic figures which show the UK, weighed down by Brexit uncertainty, is in grim shape even before we get to the horrors of the actual breakaway from the huge free-trade bloc.  Yet, we are told, the Brexiters will jolly well have what they voted for. They will not be swayed by the realities of the situation, which they seem to regard as propaganda by people they oh-so-tiresomely refer to as \u0026ldquoRemoaners. Albeit the schoolboyish \u0026ldquoRemoaner jibe is certainly preferable to the \u0026ldquotraitor comments you sometimes hear bandied around when it comes to Brexit. \u0026ldquoTraitor is an extreme word, and its use by some Leave voters underlines the divisive and intolerant nature of Brexit.  Fears over the state of the UK economy intensified this week when official data revealed the sharpest monthly drop in manufacturing output since October 2012. The 1.4 per cent month-on-month plunge will surely be a disappointment to some in the Brexit camp (even if they will not admit it). It highlights not only the domestic economic malaise but also the fact that sterling weakness arising from the UK\u0026rsquos Brexit vote does not appear to have been the catalyst for a lasting export boom.  Read More: Fears over UK economy intensify as manufacturing output plunges  Not than anyone should have expected it to be such a catalyst. After all, you would imagine all the uncertainty around trade arrangements after Blighty quits the European Union would not be trumped by a pricing advantage for UK exporters arising from sterling weakness. Especially given the pound\u0026rsquos troubles have sent UK companies\u0026rsquo import costs rocketing.  Also this week, we have had figures from the Office for National Statistics signalling underlying weakness in the UK construction sector. The data showed construction output rose by just 0.5% in April, having tumbled by 2.3% in March as freezing weather disrupted activity. Economists had forecast construction output would have bounced back by 2% in April.  Meanwhile, trade figures this week from the ONS were dire.  The UK\u0026rsquos global goods trade deficit widened from \u0026pound12 billion in March to \u0026pound14.04bn in April, much worse than the \u0026pound11.35bn forecast by economists, as exports fell sharply and imports rose. The deterioration was driven by a widening of the UK\u0026rsquos deficit on trade in goods with countries outwith the EU, from \u0026pound3.79bn to \u0026pound5.37bn.  Read More: Ian McConnell: Man in Lego boat without paddle sums up Brexit fiasco frustration  Many Brexiters still believe that increased trade with non-EU countries \u0026ndash perceived by the Leave camp to be wildly enthusiastic about doing more business with the mighty UK \u0026ndash will be an economic panacea. The Brexiters\u0026rsquo head-in-the-British-sand attitude has meant the absence of any catalyst for their imagined boom in UK trade with countries outside the EU has not dampened their bizarre enthusiasm.  At the end of the day, Brexit is a fool\u0026rsquos errand driven by ideology and not by considerations of people\u0026rsquos standards of living, which are dictated in large part by economic success or otherwise. Xenophobia and opposition to immigration look to have been key factors in the Brexit vote.  You still hear the Brexiters bang on about the benefits of leaving the EU. These remain entirely elusive but that, it seems, does not matter one whit to the Brexiters. All the while, some of them harp on about the fabulous bounties which Blighty is going to reap from a raft of new free-trade deals. This would be laughable in its ridiculousness if the consequences for the economy and people\u0026rsquos living standards were not so serious.  Read More: Ian McConnell: Fears for economy grow as millions hit by Brexit cost of living crisis  And what about the growing protectionism when it comes to world trade? One of those countries at the forefront of this is the US, which some in the UK Government seem to believe is going to be falling over itself to do one of the fastest-arranged trade deals of modern times with Britain, even though nothing of substance has happened on this front in the two years since the Brexit vote.  Meanwhile, there is no sign that the other countries which the UK Government has had its sights on, in its desperate lobbying mission to try to make Brexit look like a good idea, will be putting Britain ahead of the massive and powerful EU bloc in the queue for trade deals. Why would these countries prioritise foolishly by putting an isolated UK ahead of the huge EU bloc?  And this brings us back to the essence of the problem.  The UK is a sizeable economy. However, its influence is dwindling as other countries rise. Faced with such challenges, being part of a powerful bloc such as the EU has been hugely important.  Many in the Brexit camp seem to believe the UK is the most important country in the world. They need to wake up to the fact the UK Government\u0026rsquos ridiculously over-elevated sense of the country\u0026rsquos importance does not chime at all with the reality of today\u0026rsquos world.  Chance would be a fine thing though. Instead, the Brexiters and their Government at Westminster seem hell-bent on pursuing a dream of making the UK an economic backwater, with a funny little mindset when it comes to the big world out there."},{"url":null,"title":"animal welfare charity welcomes new addition","story":"\t\tA foal has been born at the Scottish SPCA\u0027s Aberdeen Animal Rescue and Rehoming Centre.\t\t\t\tScotland’s animal welfare charity welcomed the healthy colt into the world at 7.30am yesterday (Tuesday, June 12).
