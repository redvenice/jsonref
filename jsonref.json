I didn’t realise I was an addict until I finally stopped. When I was working I was always ultra-professional and nothing would interfere with the football.‘But when you’re a footballer you have a lot of spare time on your hands after training. It’s easy to sit around and gamble.’Shilton represented England in three World Cups, and said for most players gambling was a way to keep them occupied during long tours away from home.He recalled acting as a bookmaker for the England squad in the 1986 World Cup, when Maradona famously scored with his ‘Hand of God’ goal.When Shilton hung up his gloves in 1997, having competed in more than 1,000 professional matches, he says gambling had begun to rule his life.He said: ‘It’s so easy just to get on that buzz and get hooked. When you gamble you are on a high whether you’re winning or losing. Getting that high to me is what gambling is about, you’re in a world of your own. Shilton said that his problems gravely worsened when online gambling came along, and he set up an account with Betfair in around 2005.‘For the first time I could sit on a computer and bet,’ he said. ‘I just had one account with Betfair. But you could gamble into the early hours of the morning. If I got on a roll I would stay up, on odd occasions to 2am or 3am.’         Goalkeeper Peter Shilton and his ex-England team-mate Gary Lineker (left) at the Marriot Hotel His first marriage broke down in 2011, and he met his second wife Steph in 2012.The couple married in 2016 and live together in a bungalow in West Mersea, Essex.Shilton finally gave up gambling in 2015 with the support and encouragement of his wife.He called up Betfair to ask them to cancel his account – only for them to try and entice him to stay.He said: ‘It was thanks to Steph I was able to give up. The penny suddenly dropped – I thought: “I’m not winning and I never have won ... why should I put myself through this and risk losing Steph?”‘I’ve won at most things in my life, in terms of my career, but I’ve never won at gambling. What’s the point of me carrying on? I’m just losing.’Shilton, who has been plagued by debts from his 45 years of gambling, has now not placed a wager for five years. He said: ‘I could be a lot richer than I am now, but I have never been happier. I will never have another bet again in the rest of my life.’Last Thursday, Shilton and his wife had a meeting with sports minister Nigel Adams and arts minister Helen Whately to discuss the steps needed to tackle the menace of problem gambling.They are also working with the charity Gambling with Lives, which was set up by bereaved parents.Shilton said: ‘I’m now 70, I could just go out quietly. But I just thought I should try and make a difference. Gambling caused me a lot of problems in my life – financial and emotional. I want to help, just one person would be enough.‘I want people to know there is light at the end of the tunnel. You can stop, that’s my message to anyone who is struggling. I understand what you are going through and it’s never easy, but with the right help you can stop.’ Shilton said there should be stricter regulations around betting, adding: ‘What’s frightening is the amount of new methods and games cropping up. The gambling epidemic can only get worse.‘I used to be able to detach a little bit, and wouldn’t bet if I was on holiday. But these days it’s on your phone so you can be sat on a beach placing a bet.’ Shilton said a ban on credit card betting, which was announced last week, was a ‘huge step forward’.But he added: ‘I would like to see gambling education rolled out nationally. I don’t see any difference between that and drugs and sex education.’ He also called for an end to the pervasive advertising and incentives that keep gamblers betting. ‘There are more and more incentives. I used to get a hamper at Christmas from Ladbrokes, when I told a friend of mine – they said, “Well you’re not winning then are you?”’ he said.Shilton said he hoped to work with the Professional Footballers Association to raise awareness of gambling within the game.He and his wife were shocked by the story of Mr Keogh, who was 34 when he took his own life in 2013.He had played for amateur side Headingley FA and secretly accumulated £55,000 in debt from online gambling.Gambling addiction has been linked to self-harm, depression and anxiety and causes two suicides a day in the UK.Shilton received no fee for this article. A donation has been made to Gambling with Lives.  Wife quit job to save him from addiction          Peter Shilton and his wife Steph are pictured at home in West Mersea, Colchester, EssexSteph Shilton emailed Betfair six years ago begging them to cut off her husband Peter’s account – but says they failed to act.She was shocked by the grip gambling had on the football legend when she met him in 2012, and embarked on a mission to get him to quit.She left her job to help him through withdrawal symptoms, and will next week meet Government ministers to discuss ways to help other addicts.‘It was heartbreaking to think this national treasure, this wonderful football icon, had this problem,’ she said. She decided to become an ‘investigator’ and rifled through the footballer’s bank statements to uncover the scale of his addiction.Mrs Shilton, 51, who worked as a manager in NHS primary care for 20 years, said: ‘It was a chronic illness and I knew he needed me. I looked at it as a medical condition, just like a drug addiction.’In 2014, she emailed Betfair, ‘begging and pleading’ with them to close her husband’s account. But she said they replied claiming they were unable to take any action because of data protection rules.‘I am so angry at the way they treated him, and the fact I made them aware of my concerns but they ignored my plea,’ she said.She was forced to try other tactics, including separating herself financially.‘I told Pete for a long time that I didn’t have a credit card when I did,’ she said. ‘I told him I had lent a friend my savings, I said anything so I didn’t feed him the drug which is money.‘A lot of men find it hard to seek help or open up about their financial disasters. I kept reiterating that he could tell me anything. I also tried to replace the mentality of winning with that of losing, calling the Racing Post the Loser’s Post.’In 2015, three years after they got together, the former goalkeeper placed his last bet.Mrs Shilton said: ‘I remember the day where he did give up. He said “I’m losing, and I’m worried I’m going to lose you”. I said, “You’re never going to lose me, but we’ve got to move on”.’Shilton then picked up the phone to Betfair to cancel his account. Stopping gambling caused three months of withdrawal symptoms including sleepless nights, mood swings and irritability.Mrs Shilton said: ‘I gave up work to commit to helping him. I wanted him so much to overcome it that giving up my career was unquestionable. Each day we went on long walks.‘It took me about a year to stop worrying, I was still checking his laptop and throwing away the racing pages in the newspaper.’She now hopes to return to work in the NHS, and is determined to help other families struggling with gambling.She will meet health minister Nadine Dorries next week to discuss becoming involved in the 14 NHS gambling clinics around the country.She said: ‘It is so right that the NHS look after the addicts, but the public should not foot the bill. Gambling firms must take their responsibility.‘GPs also need to get on board and be educated far better on gambling addiction.’Mrs Shilton added: ‘As long as you love each other, you will pull through. We now have a second life. We have disposable income and can go on nice weekends or nice meals.’Shilton split from his first wife in 2011. They married in 1970 and have two sons.A Betfair spokesman said: ‘We cannot publicly comment on inidual customer accounts. Over the past few years we have significantly strengthened our responsible gambling practices, including limit-setting and other tools, and have invested in technology to help us proactively identify and engage with customers who may be at risk.’The Shiltons are supporting the charity Gambling with Lives which was set up by bereaved parents who have lost children to gambling addiction. "},{"url":null,"title":"Were hidden messages Prince Harrys speech","story":"Share this article          In his speech (pictured), the Duke of Sussex said he and his wife were standing down from the Royal Family with \u0027great sadness\u0027, but there was \u0027no other option\u0027  For the Queen\u0027s sake, when WILL Harry start to think before he acts? The Duke of Sussex brusquely rips up royal unity again by saying deal is NOT what he wanted, writes RICHARD KAYWere these the first cracks in the highly polished exterior, an unmistakably emotional outburst ripping up the carefully choreographed royal script and, for the first time, appearing to directly question the agreement struck with his grandmother the Queen?Privately, friends insisted he was doing no more than clarifying his position when he forthrightly spoke out about his future at a dinner in a fashionable restaurant.But others around Prince Harry fear it was a sign of something more fragile, something that has echoes of his late mother Princess Diana.With the ink barely dry on the deal that allows him to escape the straitjacket of being a working royal, Harry\u0027s sudden decision to use a private event to pass a very public judgement on it was not just discourteous to the Royal Family, but also dramatically undermined the harmonious accord it had been presented as hours earlier.         Above all Harry\u0027s speech demonstrated how raw and how unpredictable the drama over his and Meghan\u0027s split from the royals really isNo wonder there was consternation at the Palace yesterday. Above all Harry\u0027s speech demonstrated how raw and how unpredictable the drama over his and Meghan\u0027s split from the royals really is.Harry\u0027s intervention has been likened to that of a merger between two companies when, after it has been successfully concluded, the chief executive of one of the firms suddenly announces \u0027this isn\u0027t what I wanted\u0027, blindsiding directors, shareholders and workers.His remarks – included in a speech he delivered on Sunday evening at a glossy event at Chelsea\u0027s Ivy Garden in aid of the charity Sentebale, which he founded to honour his mother\u0027s legacy supporting those affected by Aids and HIV in the African kingdom of Lesotho – addressed the crisis over his future head on.Coming just 24 hours after he had apparently signed off on the agreement struck between him, the Queen and his father Prince Charles, Harry\u0027s anguish couldn\u0027t be clearer: he was telling the world that this was not what he wanted.He had, he said, hoped to continue to serve the Queen and Commonwealth and, crucially, retain his military associations.\u0027Unfortunately that wasn\u0027t possible,\u0027 he declared.For all his optimism about leaps into the future, it was a speech tinged with regret. \u0027It brings me great sadness that it has come to this,\u0027 he said at one point.           The Harry I know will be desperately torn over the repercussions of his decision to walk awaySomething, surely, with which the Queen would heartily agree.Her Majesty may be less pleased, however, that her grandson decided to speak out at all. In her own measured and generous statement the previous evening, the Queen deliberately spoke warmly of Meghan, describing her pride at how quickly the 38-year old duchess has become \u0027one of the family\u0027.And in promising that Harry, Meghan and their son Archie would always be \u0027much-loved\u0027 members of the Royal Family, she was mapping out a future in which they would not be exiled. These words were intended to be conciliatory, a peace-making gesture.Did Harry wilfully misinterpret this kindness or was he simply hell-bent on showing that his exclusion from those aspects of his royal life which mean the most to him was not his doing?As someone who has followed the fortunes of Prince Harry for this newspaper since his first day at nursery school, I would like to think that it is the latter.Less charitable voices within the Queen\u0027s household are not so sure. One figure suggested that at the very least Harry had demonstrated an act of incivility to both his father and his grandmother.This was hardly the first time Harry has so brusquely intervened as the crisis unfolded in ways not to his liking.It is almost two weeks ago that he sensationally announced that he and Meghan were quitting their frontline royal roles – without forewarning the Queen, Prince Charles or Prince William. Indeed, the first the Queen learned of it was from an evening television news bulletin.The reaction of the Queen – and Charles – since has been informed by their desire to avoid repeating the mistakes that occurred with Harry\u0027s mother over her split from the Prince of Wales.Almost exactly 24 years ago the long-term discussions about Diana\u0027s future also erupted into the public consciousness with the princess accusing the Palace of playing \u0027ping-pong\u0027 with her.It concerned her status as a orced woman outside the Royal Family and also pivoted on a title, in her case the style Her Royal Highness. Like Harry, she viewed the handling of her issue quite differently from the Palace.Royal officials claimed she had offered to surrender the HRH title without duress. Diana angrily disagreed insisting it had been a \u0027pre-condition to any orce negotiation\u0027.The Palace hit back with a chastening statement oozing with disdain, which spelt out that it did not \u0027say something specific on a point like this unless we are absolutely sure of our facts\u0027.Shattered by the ferocity of the negotiations, Diana did not fight the title issue and in the end it helped secure her £17.5million orce settlement, a sum that Charles\u0027s then financial adviser said had \u0027taken him to the cleaners\u0027, forcing him to sell his entire investment portfolio. But Diana bitterly regretted losing the HRH style and pointedly quit as patron of 100 charities as a result.She felt passionately that organisations like Help the Aged and British Red Cross Youth deserved a royal patron and that the loss in her standing as result of her title being forfeited would be to diminish them.           The reaction of the Queen – and Charles – since has been informed by their desire to avoid repeating the mistakes that occurred with Harry\u0027s mother over her split from the Prince of WalesHer only consolation was the promise from the then 14-year old Prince William that he would restore it when he became King.There are other parallels with the Sussex crisis, too. Diana was constantly linked with commercial deals, from a fragrance named after her by a French perfume house to being the face of a high street fashion brand.They offered her mega-bucks but she turned them all down – just as she did Kevin Costner who wanted her to star with him in a remake of The Bodyguard. She could have made millions but didn\u0027t.Significantly, she also resisted the constant blandishments of money-rich US TV networks. In her case she was pursued by the veteran Barbara Walters.Did all this turbulence in his mother\u0027s life resonate with Prince Harry at the Ivy on Sunday evening?Certainly, he made no fewer than four references to his mother during his brief speech, including one poignant reference to her death. \u0027When I lost my mum 23 years ago, you took me under your wing,\u0027 he said.And to be fair there was humility in his words too as he spoke of his \u0027utmost respect for my grandmother, my commander in chief\u0027.He also acknowledged how grateful he was to the Queen and \u0027the rest of my family\u0027 for the support they have shown Meghan.But that gratitude is somewhat tested by remarks made as he attempted to put his side of the story.\u0027What I want to make clear is we\u0027re not walking away,\u0027 he said. \u0027Our hope was to continue serving the Queen, the Commonwealth and my military associations, but without public funding. Unfortunately that wasn\u0027t possible.\u0027As an ex-soldier, with distinguished service in Afghanistan, quite apart from his work with veterans and the Invictus Games he founded for wounded, injured and disabled veterans, losing those Army links clearly hurts.Elsewhere in the speech, if it wasn\u0027t his mother\u0027s influence it was his wife\u0027s, who he was proud to say \u0027upholds the same values as I do\u0027.

And using an Americanism he added: \u0027I know I haven\u0027t always gotten it right, but as far as this goes, there really was no other option.\u0027Really? Some might say that after less than two years as a working royal couple, Harry and Meghan had barely got started.After all he stresses his commitment to duty and service. You can almost hear the anguish in his voice when he says at one point: \u0027We were here to serve.\u0027So why aren\u0027t they? And what went wrong in his mind that stopped them doing just that?When royal couples in the past have struggled matrimonially or with the burden of their role, the Queen has always been a sympathetic ear.But she also has the \u0027five-year test\u0027. Don\u0027t do anything hasty, let\u0027s see how things work out over five years, is her measured response. In recent years both the Duchess of Cambridge and the Countess of Wessex have been challenged by searching public criticism and they have emerged as two of the most reliable and popular members of the Royal Family.And what about Camilla, Harry\u0027s stepmother? No royal figure has taken more knocks in public life but she has been quietly transformed as Duchess of Cornwall performing a vital role as Prince Charles\u0027s consort.Even Charles and Diana delayed their separation at her request to try to make the marriage work.The more one looks at the whole sorry situation it does seem the Sussexes decision to walk away is one made in haste. But then everything about them has happened at speed.From that first meeting – a blind date in a London restaurant – to Harry almost immediately whisking Meghan away to camp out in the Botswana bush to her settling in to cosy Nottingham Cottage, his London home at Kensington Palace, everything has been at pace. Everything conducted like a holiday romance – him in Canada, both going to Africa, she visiting England – but with drama at every turn. And in the flash of an eye they were engaged, married and undertaking big overseas tours.Was it any wonder that after that breathless trip to Africa – its brilliance overshadowed by the spectacularly misjudged decision to complain about their life in the spotlight in a television interview – they needed a break.Seven weeks of introspection later they appeared to make their announcement without any real thought about its impact and now find themselves fire-fighting public anger and disappointment at their treatment of the 93-year-old Queen.Perhaps this was really why Harry spoke as he did. The Harry I know will be desperately torn over the repercussions of his decision to walk away. One thing he could do which would assuage public criticism concerns his promise to repay the £2.4million of taxpayers\u0027 money spent on Frogmore Cottage.Rather than have it transferred into an anonymous fund where it will be used to the repair costs of royal properties, a friend of the prince has suggested he earmark it for a specific project such as a school or a hospice.Diana would certainly have approved. When she learned of the money being used to build the Millennium Dome in 1997, she pleaded with ministers to spend the estimated £750million on a new regional hospital instead. Her wishes, alas, were ignored. "},{"url":null,"title":"RICHARD KAY Queens sake Harry start think acts","story":"Share this article And to be fair there was humility in his words too as he spoke of his \u0027utmost respect for my grandmother, my commander in chief\u0027.He also acknowledged how grateful he was to the Queen and \u0027the rest of my family\u0027 for the support they have shown Meghan.But that gratitude is somewhat tested by remarks made as he attempted to put his side of the story.\u0027What I want to make clear is we\u0027re not walking away,\u0027 he said. \u0027Our hope was to continue serving the Queen, the Commonwealth and my military associations, but without public funding.

It rained for three days during the festival, though the throngs of people suggest that didn\u0027t deter many of the attendees         Friends in Soho Square in the 1970s. Mr Mazzer said: For a long time I thought that I\u0027d only taken one shot of these seemingly conjoined persons, but while looking for pics for this book I came across several of this little group showing that I had snuck up on them from behind, then having got their approval, sat down with them.

As he unveils a powerful virtual reality artwork, he talks about needing a monster to fight – and why he’d like to be a barber‘When we filmed this,” says Ai Weiwei, “the elephants didn’t know what to do.” The artist is talking about the groundbreaking documentary he has just made about unemployed logging elephants in Myanmar. You watch the film, shot with 360-degree virtual reality technology, through a special headset. Turn your head slowly and your view gradually changes. Turn your head 180 degrees and the picture changes completely.“Once they were used for labour,” he goes on, “and now they have lost their job. And when they lost their job, each elephant had a few people to take care of it, so those people also lost their job.” Ai (Weiwei is his first name and means unknown or future) relates to the elephants and their handlers as readily as he does to the subject of the second part of his mesmerising VR project – this one about the lives of Rohingya refugees in a Bangladeshi camp.The Chinese artist and activist understands loss, displacement and existential danger as well as anybody. And what he wants to talk about today is his personal sense of threat. It’s four months since Ai quit Germany for Britain, and he is adapting quickly to his new home. He orders English breakfast tea and lays into the country that gave him refuge after fleeing China in 2015. Germany is intolerant, bigoted and authoritarian, he says. And he’s barely started.Does he really believe that post-Brexit Britain will prove a haven of tolerance? He smiles and says he’s here primarily for his son. He believes 10-year-old Lao will get a good education in Britain – and will be safe. “I don’t want him to live in harsh conditions. I don’t think Germany provides a good environment for foreigners.” He mentions that Lao was recently threatened by a shop owner there.While Ai insists he has no illusions about Britain, he still thinks it will be better for his family. “In Britain they are colonial. They are polite at least. But in Germany, they don’t have this politeness. They would say in Germany you have to speak German. They have been very rude in daily situations. They deeply don’t like foreigners.” If Britain does let him down, he assures me he’ll let us all know.We meet at an upmarket hotel in Cambridge, where the 62-year-old now lives. He is dressed in trademark black, head shaved and beard clipped. There is something mesmerising about him: he has the appearance of a bouncer, the manner of a priest and the language of a revolutionary. With the gentlest of voices, he continues to eviscerate Germany. “I don’t like a state or culture that so obeys authority.” Ai has never been one for obeying authority.He slurps his tea and smiles. “Germany is a very precise society. Its people love the comfort of being oppressed. In China, too, you see that. Once you’re used to it, it can be very enjoyable. And you can see the efficiency, the show, the sense of their power being extended through the connected-mind condition.” You mean there is no room for iniduality? “Yes. They have a different kind of suit: it doesn’t look like what they wore in the 1930s, but it still has the same kind of function. They identify with the cult of that authoritarian mindset.”Is he comparing today’s Germany with Nazi Germany? “Fascism is to think one ideology is higher than others and to try to purify that ideology by dismissing other types of thinking. That’s Nazism. And that Nazism perfectly exists in German daily life today.”Then there is his own experience. He mentions the three times he has been thrown out of taxis. There was no overt racism, he says, but he was pretty sure what lay beneath it all. Tell me, I say. “It’s a long story,” Ai replies, as he often does. “On one occasion, there was a strong perfume. I am sensitive to perfume, so I have to take down the window, and they say, ‘Pull up the window.’ I say, ‘No, the perfume is too strong.’ And they say, ‘Just get out of my taxi.’”Where was this? “Berlin! Berlin, every time. And another time in a taxi, the driver was listening to music and my phone rings. My mum calls me from China, I have to answer. He says, ‘Shut off your phone.’ I say, ‘This is my mum.’ He says, ‘You have to shut off your phone.’ Then he suddenly braked and me, my son and girlfriend were thrown forward.”Ai has spent his life fighting for justice. Perhaps it’s in his blood. His father, the poet Ai Qing, was sent to a labour camp in the countryside for criticising Maoist communism. Ai shows me a photo of the family home – a cave in the middle of nowhere. “My family had to live in this black hole for five years.” Ai Qing’s new job was to clean the ditch that served as the village toilet. How did he cope with his change in circumstances? “He was a man with a big heart, and had great acceptance.”Following Mao’s death in 1976 and after 19 years of manual labour, Ai Qing and the family returned to Beijing. His work was “unbanned” and he regained his prominence. “He is still considered the number one national poet,” Ai says proudly. “They call him the people’s poet. He was a really passionate, romantic fighter. A soldier. He always talked about justice, beauty and integrity. He believed in a perfect world. I believe life is a struggle for it.”Ai enrolled in the Beijing Film Academy and studied animation – one of many courses he failed to complete. He then became one of the first of his generation allowed to study in the US. He was told by his tutor that his drawings lacked heart. He never drew again. (Ai shows me a drawing of a forest he did as a student, which his father used to illustrate a book of poems. It is exceptionally beautiful). He did all sort of jobs to support himself: collecting rubbish, factory work, carpentry, babysitting and barbering.He befriended beat poet Allen Ginsberg, went to the same parties as Andy Warhol, whose work he adored, discovered Marcel Duchamp and dadaism, and began transforming readymade objects into art (including Hanging Man, a homage to Duchamp made from a wire coat hanger).Ai returned to Beijing in 1993. Since then there is little he hasn’t done in the name of art, protest and fun – often in the same work. So we have the 100m hand-painted porcelain sunflower seeds that filled the floor of the Turbine Hall in London’s Tate Modern the gorgeous Forever Bicycles sculpture composed of 1,254 stainless steel bikes and Dropping a Han Dynasty Urn, in which he smashes a 2,000-year-old vase. His art delivers social critique as visual puns. With the sunflower seeds, he suggests we are all different despite appearances with the vase, he destroys history just as Mao did and with the bikes, he comments on cultural uniformity.Some work is more solemn: a list of names of the 5,219 schoolchildren who died in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake (obtained from a year’s research) the documentary Human Flow, in which he visits refugee camps around the world and reflects on man’s inhumanity to man. Other work has transformed the landscape – Ai co-designed the Bird’s Nest, as the 2008 Olympic stadium in Beijing became known, though he has since said he regretted creating such a monument for the state and has never stepped foot inside the finished building. And some work, if it is work at all, is just plain bonkers, such as the joyous video of Ai and his friends dancing Gangnam Style.With the Bird’s Nest, he became famous as a dissident artist and seemed untouchable, protected by his popularity. Then in 2010, he claimed to have been beaten by police while trying to report a previous incident, in which he was punched in the head by a policeman, leading to him suffering a brain haemorrhage. “I was hours away from dying,” he says. That same year, the authorities tore down his government-funded studio. Rather than protesting, he turned the event into a piece of performance art, holding a crab feast to celebrate the act of destruction. (This was another classic Ai pun. Hexie, the word for crab, sounds just like “harmonious” in Mandarin – a word used by the government to describe society, and reclaimed by critics to mean censorship.)In 2011, Ai was jailed and told he faced 13 years in prison for subversion of state power, but was released after 81 days and given a $2.4m (£1.5m) fine for tax evasion. The money was raised by supporters worldwide. Ai’s passport was confiscated and he was placed under house arrest for four years. When his passport was returned, he left for Germany, where he had been offered a professorship at Berlin University of the Arts.I ask if he thinks he would have been an artist if he hadn’t grown up in China. “No,” he says. “No, I would not be an artist because an artist is not something I would have rated as important. My interrogator in the secret police once asked me, ‘Weiwei, if we don’t give you so much pressure, you would never be so famous, right?’ And I said, ‘Yes, you are right. It takes an enemy to make me a soldier. If I don’t have a great monster to fight, who am I?’”Ai is clear about the purpose of his art: it is not primarily aesthetic or cerebral, it is political. “If my art has any meaning, it is as a tool for freedom. If I see people victimised by authoritarianism, I am a soldier in defending their freedom. I can be as brutal as any animal to protect the essential value I love.”As I’m talking, I notice him taking a picture with his phone. Was he taking a photo of me? He laughs. “No, the camera is taking the photo.” He has been doing this for years wherever he goes. Ai really is gloriously eccentric. Whether his selfies are in the name of art, entertainment or bearing witness, it’s hard to know. I’m not sure he even knows.Ai has spent a great deal of the last five years filming displaced people (and now animals) in the world’s troubled spots. And he’s exhausted. He thinks his days as an artist may be coming to an end. For 15 years, he adds, the world has treated his work with respect, and that is never good for creativity. “I almost don’t think of myself as artist now,” he says. “My curiosity is getting less and less. The art culture institutions say, ‘Oh, Weiwei have a show next year with us.’ I’m suddenly very privileged, but now I’m getting tired.”Privilege does not sit easily with him. You sense part of him would like to return to his days in the cave with the family, or struggling on $3 a day in the US. Will he retire? He looks at me in disbelief. “I cannot say I’ll retire, but maybe I’ll disappear.” Where to? “Maybe I’ll disappear in Cambridge!” Will he go back to China? “I want to. My mum’s old and I want to see her. I’ve not seen her for a few years.” But he worries that he may be arrested or have his passport confiscated.So what would he do if he stopped making art? He smiles mischievously, slurps his cold tea and takes out his phone again. He shows me four short films of young people with trendy haircuts. Their hair is entirely shaved on one side, then they flick their heads and magically they have a full head of hair. “When I was young I used to cut all my classmates’ hair. Three days ago, I cut the hair of these four students.” He looks so chuffed with these “optical illusion” haircuts. “I did four in 20 minutes. I am a proper professional! I may open a barbershop in London.”He seems to be getting more into the idea by the second. “I think it is more fun to be a barber than an artist,” he says. Couldn’t he mix art with barbering? He shakes his head vehemently. No, he says, definitely not. “You would never mix such a holy profession with art.”• Omni will be shown at a  event with Ai Weiwei on 30 January at Cadogan Hall, London."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e904c64013425f650ee52cfc2ed74eed3c86ba62/537_453_5369_3221/master/5369.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90227ea198c8bfdd94a8791b6ec4bfbe","title":"buy a classic sport photograph penny farthing racing","story":"The latest in a  Print Shop series featuring classic sports images from the likes of Gerry Cranham, Mark Leech and Tom Jenkins – yours to own for just £55 including free deliveryImagine the perils of riding a penny farthing at high speed while wearing only a crude helmet.

But this gaudy $1.5bn colossus in the Florida swamps is also a triumph of Native American resistance. We check out the Beyoncé SuiteIt doesn’t get much more rock’n’roll than standing stark naked at the top of a 450ft tall mirrored-glass guitar, taking an al fresco shower on the balcony of your penthouse overlooking the sun-soaked plains of Florida, as millions of dollars are gambled beneath you. With its own rooftop swimming pool and butler service, the Beyoncé Suite (as it’s now known following the singer’s stay here) is one of the more surreal features of the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel – a building that, more than any other, embodies the end-of-the-world hedonism of the new roaring 20s.Near Fort Lauderdale, and wedged between the busy highways of Florida’s Turnpike and Route 441, the $1.5bn complex takes the roadside architecture of the Las Vegas strip to the ultimate extreme, bringing a dose of razzmatazz to the southern swamps.“It was certainly built to be noticed from afar,” says Gary Bitner, spokesman for Hard Rock International, as we stand beneath the twinkling cliff face of LED lights that transforms the building into a dazzling son-et-lumière spectacle every evening, an eruption that is visible on the horizon for miles around. As classic 80s rock ballads boom out over the vast 13-acre, palm-fringed swimming pool, crowds of gamblers stumble from the casino to gawp up at the glitzy sight. The curving colossus pulsates with neon stripes, rising up the body of the building to its crown – where six laser-beam “strings” shoot light 20,000 feet into the sky, creating a phantom guitar neck that dissolves into the clouds.It is an unlikely thing to find standing in the middle of this non-place of parking lots, e bars and pawn shops. And it is all the more remarkable given that it has been built by a community that was almost hounded from existence. The hotel is the work of the Seminole Tribe of Florida, a Native American group whose population on the peninsula numbered 200,000, when Spanish colonisers first arrived in the 1500s. Following centuries of persecution and displacement, the tribe now has just over 4,000 members, scattered across six sites around the state and headquartered in the 500-acre Hollywood reservation, where the Hard Rock hotel now stands.In many ways, the flashy new building is a fitting symbol of Seminole defiance. Known as the “unconquered tribe”, they have long boasted of their status as the only Native American tribe to refuse to sign a peace treaty with the US government. Following the Indian Removal Act of 1830, the vast majority of tribe members were forcibly relocated to the Indian Territory in Oklahoma, over 1,000 miles to the west. But a couple of hundred Seminoles hid in the Everglades, led by such legendary chiefs as Osceola and Billy Bowlegs, where they camped out for decades and resisted government forces. With a name that derives from the Spanish word “cimarrones”, meaning runaways or wild ones, the Seminoles have proved a force to be reckoned with ever since.They began their entrepreneurial endeavours by opening lucrative tax-free tobacco shops in the 1970s, then became the first tribe in the country to establish a casino, in the form of a high-stakes bingo hall in 1979. The legal battle that ensued ended with a district court ruling in favour of the Seminoles and ultimately led to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988, a federal law allowing all Native American tribes to operate casinos, as long as they shared some of the revenue with their state’s governments. It has since mushroomed into a $34bn industry.“The Seminoles really are the pioneers of Indian gambling,” says Professor Bob Jarvis, expert in gaming history at Florida’s Nova Southeastern University. “They went from being an extremely impoverished tribe, eking out a subsistence living, to being fabulously wealthy in a generation.” A year after the Seminoles’ bingo hall opened, revenue had reached $1m a month. By 1999, gambling was generating about $96m a year for the tribe. After acquiring the Hard Rock International brand in 2006, and pursuing an aggressive programme of global expansion, their income now stands at over $5bn a year.The change in fortunes has seen tribe members going from living in primitive thatched “chickee” huts to owning fleets of SUVs, boats and swamp buggies, along with second homes on the coast. Each tribe member receives an annual allowance of around $128,000, plus access to free private school and college tuition and universal health care. By the time Seminole children turn 18, they are already multimillionaires. The wealth is only set to grow, too, particularly as the tribe recently suspended its revenue-sharing agreement with the state of Florida over an exclusivity rights dispute.With this history in mind, the brash swagger of the new hotel seems apt. It stands proudly as a huge guitar-shaped middle finger up to the white man who tried to eradicate their entire race, making do instead with corralling them into the most inhospitable parts of the country – which they have turned to their advantage. “We always exiled the Indians to the worst possible land, the land no white settler wanted,” says Jarvis. “The Hollywood reservation was way out in the middle of nowhere, where civilisation was never going to come, but they’ve transformed it into a destination.”Not far from where the original bingo hall still stands, now just a low-slung shed marooned in a parking lot, they have created a tropical mirage, complete with its own water-sports lagoon and beach, along with poolside suites where you can swim up to your front door. Visitors are welcomed into an atrium where a circular waterfall gushes down from a timber halo, while marble-lined corridors lead to 19 different restaurants and cafes, a gambling hall the size of three American football fields and a 7,000-capacity concert venue opened by Maroon 5. Other attractions include a nightclub that transforms into a “dayclub”, so you can party and gamble 247, immune from the sobering glare of daylight.At the same time, the newfound riches of the Seminoles have had their own damaging effects, leading to high levels of drug and alcohol abuse, obesity and mental health problems. The Seminole tribe says it has worked with the Florida Council on Compulsive Gambling to create a “comprehensive array of programmes that ensure a safe and entertaining gaming environment”.The development is the brainchild of Jim Allen, the man who has led the Seminoles to unimaginable riches since he started working for them in 2001. As a gaming industry veteran and former vice-president of the Trump Organisation, he was the one to convince the tribe to acquire the Hard Rock company in 2006, for $965m – the first time a Native American tribe purchased a major international corporation. As tribe member Max Osceola Jr said at the time: “Our ancestors sold Manhattan for trinkets. Today, with the acquisition of the Hard Rock Cafes, we’re going to buy Manhattan back one hamburger at a time.”Under Allen’s leadership, the company has tripled the number of hotel outposts, including resorts in the Dominican Republic, Mexico and India, and has further plans for bases in Dubai and China. But Allen wanted an unmistakable landmark for the Seminoles’ spiritual home. “We were really interested in the big guitars that were in front of many of the Hard Rock locations,” he says, recalling the origins of the design. “So I said in passing, ‘Wouldn’t it be cool if we could do a hotel out of this?’ I didn’t specifically mean to do it – it was just a throwaway comment.”His architects, the Las Vegas entertainment specialists Klai Juba Wald initially came back with a square box with a guitar shape stuck on the front. “I said no,” says Allen. “The actual building needs to be shaped like a guitar. That was it.”The resulting structure is as bluntly articulated as Allen describes it. It has the crude detailing of architecture designed to be seen from a distance, but it is a finish that fits with the unashamedly tacky nature of the whole endeavour. This is a machine for attracting attention, for pedalling fantasies and extracting people’s money. And, judging by the crowds at the slot machines on a Thursday afternoon and the dozens guzzling down $75 steaks in the grill house, it appears to be doing quite well."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1decb826b5a62eb174b1688e8fb59b41ee6c113e/0_0_4256_2832/master/4256.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84132e2b090318ba899c0d6848fd121f","title":"jobs market employment bank of england rates","story":"Number in employment hits joint record high of 32.9 million in three months to NovemberBritain’s jobs market staged a stronger than expected recovery in the three months to November, according to official figures, easing pressure on Bank of England policymakers to cut interest rates at their meeting next week.The number of people in employment jumped by 208,000 over the period to a joint record high of 32.9 million, nearly double the 110,000 increase forecast by economists.The figures from the Office for National Statistics appeared to show a slowdown in job creation over recent months had turned a corner.Signs of weakness in the jobs market prompted two of the nine-member committee of Bank of England interest-rate setters to vote for a cut to borrowing costs at the end of last year.A statistician at the ONS, David Freeman, said: “While pay growth has eased since last summer, with inflation remaining subdued, earnings are continuing to increase in real terms.”The TUC general secretary said strong wages growth had proved to be short-lived and the Treasury should focus on ways to improve living standards in the March budget.“The long-promised return to healthy pay growth still hasn’t happened and working families are being forced into the red to get by,” Frances O’Grady said. “No more excuses: the government needs a plan to boost workers’ pay and living standards.”The official data represented a snapshot of the economy before the election on 12 December. John Philpott, a labour market analyst and the director of the Jobs Economist, said the latest figures represented a surprising jobs surge that exceeded expectations.“However, the jobs surge has made no difference to wage pressure. This combination of employment and pay figures presents Bank of England interest-rate setters with a dilemma,” he said. “Hawks will see the jobs surge as a signal to be cautious about a possible rate cut, whereas doves will point to slower wage growth as evidence that the economy needs a cut.“All, however, may be concerned by the hidden message in these figures: a jobs surge in a stagnant economy means even weaker labour productivity, highlighting a threat to long-term sustainable growth.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f37557c1bf891a4d3a9603077dddcc45227c690/0_185_5561_3336/master/5561.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a57c053c1fb48c0b42d97a4f89e82d58","title":"house of lords york uk regional inequality","story":"This tokenistic plan undermines the government’s claim that it wants to tackle regional inequalityA new House of Lords will not be built in York for a simple reason: such an endeavour is replete with political risk for the governing party while unlikely to sway many votes at the next election. Building a fully functioning modern legislature would cost hundreds of millions while paying the expenses of peers between London and York would invite the same ridicule as the European parliament’s daft journeys between Brussels and Strasbourg. Poring over the details of construction costs would be a boon for tabloid journalists but a millstone for the Tories at the next election. And even if it were to happen, it would be a mere token. So what would a real plan to address regional inequality entail?But infrastructure alone is not enough. Better public transport and improved road maintenance would certainly improve the quality of life in the regions and nations of the UK, and thousands of construction jobs would be created at the same time. Yet to close the gap in economic performance, the UK also needs to support new economic activity. That means ersifying the country’s economy, developing the industries of the future and leveraging the know-how locked up in Britain’s world-class universities – which are located across the whole UK. The country needs to embrace a new era of industrialisation, with well paying jobs created outside London and the south-east.That will require a much more proactive and well-financed industrial strategy that stretches across the country. Even when recent governments have claimed otherwise, they have in fact pursued a narrow industrial strategy. Each of the UK’s most successful sectors – financial services, pharmaceuticals, aerospace and defence, as well as the automotive and creative industries – have been backed by government. From the implicit guarantees given to the banks, to successive prime ministers acting as salespeople for weapons makers, these strongest sectors have been beneficiaries of government intervention. And they are all predominately located in London and the south-east.Reversing decades of structural economic decline will not be easy. These kinds of changes are highly complex, and the lead time from intention to impact is decades not years. Starting with an unlikely plan to shift the House of Lords to York is nothing but a waste of precious time. A large majority in parliament and a full parliamentary term ahead may have lulled Johnson into believing that time is on his side. In truth, with rising discontent after a decade of austerity and stagnating living standards, he has no time to spare. In December the voting public demanded change, and many have merely lent the Tories their votes.

He does, however, have one superpower: scandal doesn’t stick to him. Having spent several weeks keeping a low profile following the whole being chummy-with-a-sex-offender thing, it looks as though Andrew has crawled out of the woodwork and is being rapidly rehabilitated.On Sunday, the Queen appeared in public with her 59-year-old son for the first time since his car-crash Newsnight interview in November. Photographs of the two going to church show Her Majesty looking pleased and the prince looking pleased with himself. The man claims he has had trouble sweating, but by God can he smirk.He certainly has a lot to smirk about: the coverage of his outing with Mum was a PR coup. “Disgraced Prince Andrew has become the Queen’s ‘rock’ during Megxit, royal insiders have revealed,” bellowed the Sun. According to these “insiders”, Andrew has been a “tower of strength” recently, “supporting his parents in their hour of need”.Talk about a tale of two princes. While Andrew is described as a rock (he has the charisma of one), Harry is torn apart by the redtops, painted as an entitled brat who has abandoned queen and country to jet off and start a new life. Andrew has kept his titles and stipend from the Queen since the Epstein scandal, when he was made to step back from his public duties for the “foreseeable future”. On the other hand, Harry and Meghan have been forced to make a clean break from the firm and relinquish their Royal Highness titles and taxpayer funding. The Sussexes will also pay back £2.4m in public money spent renovating their home Andrew has made no statements about his debts to the taxpayer.The parallels between the princes are fascinating and infuriating. They were born into the same job: “spare” heir. Andrew is eighth in line to the throne, while Harry is sixth, so neither has much hope of becoming king constitutionally speaking, it doesn’t much matter if they step away from their roles. They have been forced – in very different circumstances – to resign from their “jobs”. Yet their resignations have been treated wildly differently by the media. Harry and Meghan’s decision to relocate has been treated as a far bigger story than the fact that the Queen’s son was friends with Jeffrey Epstein, a child sex offender, and has been accused of having sex with a teenage girl who claims she was trafficked by Epstein, an allegation Andrew denies.Why the discrepancy? Most obviously, there is racism towards Meghan. Then, as Alan Rusbridger pointed out in the , there is the fact that the “major newspaper groups most obsessed with Harry and Meghan are … being sued by the couple for assorted breaches of privacy and copyright”.Another reason is old-fashioned misogyny. The accusations levelled against Andrew aren’t reputation-ruining, because society doesn’t care what powerful men do to vulnerable women. Look at the president of the US, for God’s sake.In many ways, the narratives around Andrew and Harry represent age-old archetypes. Andrew is the prodigal son Harry is a hen-pecked husband. After decades of dissolute living, Andrew is proclaiming how sorry he is inevitably, he will be forgiven. But the one thing society won\u0027t forgive, as Harry is finding out, is a man putting a woman’s needs first."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2a5e7a1b18cb5b66f3bc7de1d4255344764343f/0_15_2835_1702/master/2835.jpg?width=645\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9834229887705aff935a81dd6f65b49d 1290w","title":"how help children grasp holocaust michael rosen","story":"Remembering the questions of his own childhood has helped Michael Rosen to tell pupils difficult truthsAs a very young child, the only inkling I had of the Holocaust was that every now and then my father would say that he’d had two uncles in France who were “there before the war and weren’t there afterwards”. I’d wonder, how could they have just disappeared? How could there only be a nothing?When I am drawn into doing Holocaust education with children of the age I was then, I often think of how I heard these terrible things without understanding them or fully feeling them. To put it crudely, these things sounded to me, as a child under the age of 10, as sad but strange, with no connection to the safe kind of life I lived.A bit later, on a trip to Germany in 1957, my parents said that they were being taken on a visit somewhere that was too awful for my brother and I to go with them. It was Buchenwald. When my mother came back, her face was grey. She tried to explain that thousands of people were tortured and killed there, people like us: Jews. I was 11. I thought of a place I had visited a few weeks earlier: the torture room at the Tower of London. Again, I think now of how my mind worked then: using a horror that I knew as a way of trying to understand the horror my mother was talking about.All this was before the days of the internet, Wikipedia, documentaries about the Nazis on TV, or novels for children such as Judith Kerr’s When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit.My childhood curiosity about the disappearances of my relatives turned into an adult quest, fuelled at first by irritation that nothing more was known other than my father saying he didn’t know. Later, I became infuriated that the Nazis had not only eliminated people from our family but that there were no traces. They had got away with it. When, in the late 80s there seemed to be concerted efforts to try to make Holocaust denial respectable, it felt more urgent to find out more.Over the next 30 years, I pieced together the stories of how the two French uncles were seized and deported to Auschwitz, one as part of a Nazi roundup in Nice, the other as a result of ordinary French village gendarmes doing what they were asked to do: knocking on a door at 2.30 in the morning and arresting a Jew for being Jewish.Because I started writing short pieces about these things, I found myself on several occasions in front of school students telling my family stories, thanks to teachers asking me in. At this point, let me acknowledge the years of work in Holocaust education by organisations such as the Holocaust Educational Trust, University College London’s Centre for Holocaust Education, the National Holocaust Centre and Museum, the Holocaust Research Institute at Royal Holloway, University of London, and others.On other occasions I worked with the Anne Frank Foundation and later with children and survivors for a Radio 4 programme about memorialising the Holocaust.Then, in one college, a young man raised his hand: “But none of this happened, did it?” It stopped me in my tracks. I had shown the students photos, lists, maps, diagrams, letters. Why hadn’t it convinced him? What should I have presented him with? More facts? More details? Eyewitness accounts? I still feel uneasy about this moment.A couple of years later, Helen Weinstein, a public historian and the creative director of History Works, a media production company, asked me to take part in workshops across Cambridge schools – primary and secondary.She had been asked by Cambridge city council to work with the schools in the lead-up to Holocaust Memorial Day ceremonies.She wanted me to mix several of the things I do: tell the story of what I had found out about my family, write poems, read them to the school students, write lyrics for songs that children, teenagers and adults would sing, help the children write poems, and offer ideas for teachers to carry on the work in their own ways. I’ve since taken part in Holocaust Memorial Day ceremonies at which a survivor, Eva Clarke, has spoken alongside Eric Eugène Murangwa, a survivor of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda against the Tutsi, and other witnesses of discrimination and persecution.Each time I take part in these activities, I have to check with myself: why are we doing this? And are we going about it in the right way?Adrian Kidd, the headteacher of Trumpington community college, Cambridge, where we’ve worked several times, says that Holocaust education has demonstrated to his students “the power of propaganda, extremist ideologies, hate, violence and the abuse of power”.Tony Davies, the headteacher at St Matthew’s primary school, Cambridge, says that through hearing the stories from Clarke, Murangwa and me the children have come to understand that “genocide is not some abstract event that happens to ‘others’. It happens to real people, people like themselves, and it has happened in the past and in the present also.”I’m glad of that. Clarke talks in a quiet, calm, determined way about the horrors faced primarily by her mother. Murangwa tells of his own survival in the teeth of what seemed like certain death.Davies says children today are already very much aware of the terrible tragedies that occur across the world. “And of course, some of our children are refugees who themselves have fled genocide. So learning about these experiences, discussing them, expressing our feelings about them in a safe environment – this is essential.”A year 6 girl at one of the Cambridge schools wrote:Leaving my heart behind …I will take the lullaby I knew when I was young.This feels very different from my own childhood, and yet the way I tried to understand my parents’ visit to Buchenwald through making analogies must, I sense, work like that with children now. Sometimes we must be prepared for these children’s analogies and make space for them, in whatever shape they appear. A child in year 5 at St Matthew’s, wrote:I sit on the warm spring grasslooking at an old, old bee dying on the leaf of a maple tree …snatched away from its one and only home …I sit on the warm spring grass …Davies says: “The children have learned that when we remember the atrocities of the past we honour those who have been lost.”A girl in year 7 wrote this:Remember itRemember itthe day they camethe day they asked my nameI packed a bagand was never seen again.Davies believes the children have learned “that it is possible to meet prejudice, hatred and ision with fortitude and love, and that when we stand together to do so, as we do on Holocaust Memorial Day, we truly are better.”• Michael Rosen’s latest book is The Missing, about his search for information about his own family.

This would have been a big win for climate.”Scientists say the fact they found emissions had risen is a puzzle and could have implications for the Montreal protocol, an international treaty that was designed to protect the stratospheric ozone layer.Kieran Stanley, the lead author of the study, said that although China and India were not yet bound by the agreement, their reported reduction would have put them on course to be consistent with it.“Our study finds that it is very likely that China has not been as successful in reducing HFC-23 emissions as reported,” he said. “However, without additional measurements, we can’t be sure whether India has been able to implement its abatement programme.”HFCs were hailed as an answer to the hole in the ozone layer that appeared over Antarctica in the 1980s because they replaced hundreds of chemical substances widely used in aerosols that depleted the thin layer of ozone that protects Earth from harmful rays from the sun.But in recent years there has been mounting concern at how the potent greenhouse gas was undermining efforts to keep global heating below dangerous levels. Scientists say one tonne of HFC-23 emissions is equivalent to the release of more than 12,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide.Experts estimate that had the HFC-23 emissions reductions been as large as reported, the equivalent of a year’s worth of Spain’s CO2 emissions would have been avoided between 2015 and 2017.

While all the other girls were wearing figure-hugging outfits, I was just doing my own thing and loving every minute of it. I’ve still got that outfit.As a girl with an eye patch, I was used to being different. People were like: “Oh, Gabrielle’s giving us a bit of a pirate look,” but I was rocking it. I liked wearing glittery or sequinned patches because it felt girly. I liked the idea that, since the eye patch alone was a talking point, I made it something you could talk about. It was dazzling and it was bling – I had an array of them.I had a lazy eyelid and knew that by concealing it I could feel confident I felt I could put my best self forward. I have totally embraced it being part of my look, but what I find hilarious is that I only wore it for about a year. By the time it came to my second album, I didn’t have it on at all, but I will for ever be associated with the eye patch. I don’t mind, I actually love it.The music industry still has a long way to go in terms of body ersity, but it has improved since then. Back in the day, I remember reading an article on the largest women in pop and I was in there – but so was Geri Halliwell, who’s teeny-tiny!

The loss of the Kaiser inevitably overshadowed Viard’s first Chanel collections, so her outings have until now been defined by Lagerfeld’s absence: the first ready-to-wear, the first couture show, the first cruise and Métiers d’art shows without Karl were all measured against what had been before.The ghost of Lagerfeld is receding, and Viard’s Chanel coming into sharper focus – with a few surprises. Having been Karl’s righthand woman for 36 years, Viard was Chanel’s continuity candidate. But she is pivoting the brand away from his legacy and back to its roots, reconnecting the house to the life and work of Coco Chanel.For this springsummer haute couture catwalk show, Viard recreated the cloister garden of the abbey of Aubazine, the orphanage where Coco spent six childhood years after the death of her mother.Before the show Viard said of a recent visit to Aubazine that “what I immediately liked was that the cloister garden was uncultivated”. An apparently throwaway comment but it flags a key difference between Viard’s aesthetic and Lagerfeld’s. Where Lagerfeld loved the grand gesture, Viard’s taste is simpler and more stripped back.It was a sunny spot, she said, that made her “think of the summer, of a breeze fragranced with flowers”. This is the third time Viard has evoked Coco at home, following a recreation of the famous mirrored staircase in her atelier, and a three-story library styled to resemble the designer’s private rue Cambon apartments.But where those sets celebrated Coco’s glamour, this one was notable for its austerity. The planting which stretched over most of the Grand Palais’s vast floorspace was unmanicured. Flowers grown leggy flopped on to the brick paths, while tendrils found their way seemingly at random around simple stick trellises. The show space was open on all sides, its edges delineated only by embroidered tablecloths on laundry lines, a nod to the sewing skills which Coco learned from the nuns at Aubazine.Viard’s version of Chanel is the Coco who advised taking one accessory off before leaving the house, the designer who made a simple striped T-shirt a byword for chic. By conjuring the years Coco spent as an impoverished boarder at Aubazine – rather than the era she spent living it up in dubious wartime circumstances at the Ritz – Viard brought that version of Coco into focus.“I liked the idea of the boarder, of the schoolgirl, the outfits worn by children long ago,” Viard said of this collection. There was a distilled, ascetic grace in the simple tunic shapes, pintucked blouses, and sash-waisted dresses. Most outfits were monochrome, so that the models with their neat side-partings and starched Bertha collars looked almost to have walked out of a black-and-white film.Viard does not go in for visual jokes in the way Lagerfeld did but there was playfulness in the riffs on that Chanel classic, a two-tone shoe – white booties were laced with black ribbon, or black velvet slippers were worn with chunky white socks.The ornament and embellishment that a haute couture client expects came in the detail. Gingham organza ribbons were woven into herringbone, for a new take on evening tweed, multicoloured pansies were brought to life on to a strapless blue chiffon gown, and jewelled buttons set with stars took their design from the stained glass windows of the abbey."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/740786fa615ac0a040405115110f651e37b1a3e7/0_42_6192_3715/master/6192.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce80ed62aae162c9ed552ffd721bcae3","title":"jonathan pryce theres a definite shortage of 72 year old welsh men","story":"The actor talks about his Oscar nomination for The Two Popes and his new role as Don Quixote, before moving on to the vexed subject of inequality in the movie industryIt is the day after the Oscar nominations, and Jonathan Pryce is perched at a corner table in a humdrum London bar, guest of honour at the saddest celebration in town. His first best-actor nomination has been a long time coming. At the age of 72, he has arrived. “Best newcomer,” he says ruefully. “Although I already do have a best newcomer award. It was for Breaking Glass. Back in 1980.”It is no surprise to see Pryce honoured for his lovely performance in The Two Popes, a likable Netflix drama that spotlights the bromance between Benedict and Francis, but it knocked him sideways all the same. He had not thought he stood a chance he had just come out of the shower when the news came through. Since then, his phone has barely stopped buzzing. Congratulations and requests. Demands on his time. “But it’s great,” he adds quickly, and almost sounds as if he means it.Whether by accident or design, Pryce has spent much of his career as the quiet man of British acting the coiled spring in the works, unobtrusive, precise and usually critical, whether he is playing a Bond villain on screen or Shylock on stage Cardinal Wolsey in Wolf Hall or the High Sparrow in Game of Thrones. Like Pope Francis, perhaps, he is the connoisseur’s choice, the progressive dark horse. Still, you should never make the mistake of confusing an actor with the characters they play.His latest appearance, in Terry Gilliam’s The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, brings him full circle. It was Gilliam who provided Pryce with his breakthrough role in 1985’s Brazil, and the two have remained firm friends ever since. The film itself is a rackety, rambunctious affair. Adam Driver headlines as a jaded commercials director at large in rural Spain. Pryce co-stars as Javier, a deluded old shoemaker who fancies himself as Quixote. He comes clip-clopping through the desert in tin-pan armour, his peevish stare fixed on the far horizon.The way Pryce tells it, he was essentially playing two men at the same time. “And that’s the get-out-of-jail card. Because if I’m not very good as Don Quixote, you can blame it on the shoemaker, who’s not a very good actor. But also Quixote’s playing a role himself, the noble knight. So it’s all role play and the masks are always slipping.”Pryce was offered a slot in Gilliam’s first, ill-fated, stab at the film in 2000, but turned it down because he thought the script was weak. Since then, the role of Quixote has bounced from Jean Rochefort to John Hurt to Michael Palin before landing in Pryce’s lap. Gilliam now suspects this was preordained. “Jonathan has basically been waiting to play this part ever since our first collapse,” he says.The director has said some other things, too. Earlier this month, Gilliam told the journalist Alexandra Pollard that #MeToo was a witch-hunt. He said that women in Hollywood should take more responsibility for themselves and that he was “tired of white men being blamed for everything”. But that’s Terry, Pryce says. “He’s always been a provocateur. That’s what he thrives on: being outrageous, going to extremes.” Besides, he adds, the whole #MeToo issue remains so fresh and raw people are still working out how to discuss it. “That’s not to say he was misunderstood or misconstrued,” he adds. “I think it was very clear what he was saying.”Until now, I have filed Gilliam and Pryce as odd-couple collaborators: the disreputable old goat and his cerebral, soft-spoken alter ego. Pryce nods. “The straight man and the clown. Except that, in this case, the clown is playing the role of straight man. Meanwhile, I’m stuck on the horse, playing the clown.”In contrast to Gilliam, Pryce would rather stay out of the limelight steer clear of trouble. By and large, he has been successful. But in 1991, he sparked fury in the US with his portrayal of a Eurasian pimp called the Engineer in the Broadway production of Miss Saigon. Equity labelled the role “an affront to the Asian community” and demanded he withdraw. The ensuing standoff almost derailed the production.I ask whether, three decades on, he has more sympathy for Equity’s objection. He says that, on the contrary, he had sympathy for it then. The experience was horrific. He felt like the lightning rod for a wider cultural storm. “I mean, I was always confident that I wasn’t portraying a stereotype,” he insists. “But all I could do was sit back and let other people have the argument. And I got support from very strange and unwanted quarters. Charlton Heston sent me a photo of him playing Fu Manchu. He signed it: ‘From one yellowface to another.’ And I thought: ‘That’s not what I’m doing, Charlton. Thanks for your support.’”The point is that Pryce had always been at pains to work with multi-ethnic casts. In Stratford, on Broadway, wherever it was. “So you’re thinking: ‘What the hell is this? I’m the nice guy here.’ But that’s the way change happens. It showed there was an inequality in the casting process. It’s just tough when you’re on the receiving end.”It infuriated him then. It still rankles today. “You know, I was in New York recently, at an influencer, as I think they call them. Academy members watch your film. You meet them. Schmooze-fest. And this Asian lady grabbed my arm and was shouting: ‘I protest you! I protest you!’ Talking about what she’d done 30 years ago. ‘I stuck paper down your toilet in the theatre!’ Because we had protesters who used to come to the show to disrupt it.”Pryce appears to be giving the protester a comedy accent. I hope this wasn’t the voice he used for his Eurasian pimp. Anyway, he continues, the upshot was that, at the end of this rant, she still wanted to have her picture taken with him. “And then, in the photo, she’s pointing like this in my face. Saying: ‘I protest him!’”We are still sitting in the corner of our becalmed London bar. By this point, Pryce has turned a little wild-eyed. A woman sidles over and apologises for interrupting, but says she simply had to say hello. She says she is from his home town of Holywell in north Wales and adds: “Did you know there’s a big picture of you up in the local pub?”Pryce shakes his head distractedly. “You should go back and see it,” she says.It is funny, he confides, people tend to think he is Jewish. Even Mel Brooks, of all people, assumed that he was. In fact, he is a Celt, raised Presbyterian, the son of a miner who later ran a grocer’s shop. “But I left home when I was 18,” he shrugs. “I’ve got fond memories of home and I’ve got negative memories of home. I don’t really get back there as much as I should.”Some years back, he returned to Holywell for a school reunion. It was nice he met classmates he hadn’t seen in decades. “But I was thinking: ‘Oh my God, they all look really old. Thank God I don’t look like that.’ Then we did a group picture. And then they sent it to me.” He dissolves with laughter. “And in among all those old people was just another old person.”Our conversation has been a little choppy. All the same, I am pleased Pryce is finally being honoured by the Academy. By rights, he should have been nominated for Brazil, for Carrington or for his role as Glenn Close’s preening novelist husband in The Wife. I ask which of his roles he feels was unfairly overlooked, and he chuckles and says it is not a question he can answer. “It reminds me of the argument we’re having now about women who should have been nominated, or ethnic minorities who should have been nominated, when people forget that it’s a competition, it’s a ‘Who’s best?’ I mean, when I vote or when I look at a film, I don’t think: ‘Oh, it’s a woman director, therefore I’ll watch it in a different way.’ I’ll watch it as a film and judge it as that.”Hang on, I tell him, it is not as simple as that. He is assuming there exists an objective standard of excellence. The truth surely, is that our ideas of what is good and what is bad are conditioned by a whole bunch of factors: gender, ethnicity, class, what have you. If people are angered by this year’s Oscars, it is because they feel the Academy is not representative of cinema as a whole. If you broadened the voter base, you would get a richer spread of nominees.The actor winces. “Well, you can have that argument,” he says. “But it is rather patronising, the idea that if you get more African-Caribbean voters they’ll only vote for African-Caribbean films. And I’d only vote for Welsh films. Sometimes I can’t believe that we’re still having that argument. It’s only a fucking prize.”He reaches for his water he is practically spluttering. Yes, of course, he admits, people are herd-like and tribal. You can see it in politics, in society and in the film industry, too. People view the world – or the Oscar nominations – from their own particular vantage point. He gulps his drink and attempts a joke. He says: “I think there’s a definite shortage of 72-year-old Welsh men.”The Man Who Killed Don Quixote is released on 31 January.

Having risen through the ranks at Sporting Gijón, the Spanish defender made his La Liga debut in 2011 on the final day of the season. He retired that summer having made that one appearance for the club. He was 23 years old.“What I’ve seen from within makes it clear: professional football is only money and corruption. It’s capitalism, and capitalism is death,” said Proves. “I don’t want to be part of a system based on people earning money at the expense of the deaths of others in South America, Africa and Asia. To put it simply, my conscience will not let me continue with this.”Football clubs have always represented their local communities. More recently, some clubs have taken on bolder messaging, such as Deportivo Palestino in Chile, who were founded by a group of Palestinian immigrants, or St Pauli in Germany, who represent their politically left-leaning fanbase. Flat Earth FC is the first professional football club that represents a conspiracy theory.“Football is the most popular sport and has the most impact worldwide, so creating a club dedicated to the flat earth movement is the best way to have a constant presence in the media,” said Poves earlier this year. “Flat Earth FC is the first football club whose followers are united by the most important thing, which is an idea.”The club’s crest is now a circular image of the earth, pressed flat on to all kits, and fans are encouraged to spark regular conversations in their pursuit of answers from the powers that be. The team mascot? An astronaut. It’s a radical move, but the club is bringing in supporters from afar. “It’s really amazing to be part of this amazing movement,” says Flat Earth player Mario Cardete. “I think it’s more than a club.”“More than a club” is a familiar phrase in Spain, given it is the adopted club motto of current La Liga champions, Barcelona. But, as journalist Rodrigo Fáez explains, Flat Earth FC are trying to push an even more radical message. “The rest of the clubs try to change something in people’s lives,” said Fáez in our film. “Poves tries to change everything in people’s minds.” What started out as local controversy may soon become national debate. Who knows, in years to come we may well see Flat Earth FC lining up at the Camp Nou, as “més que un club” meet “mas que un planeta”.• Follow Copa90 on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram• Follow writer Charlie Carmichael on Twitter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0829d774d9f26248946b1df7e2b4cb3bacf9e93/0_89_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f4e6f23472af9a55d7faf9e62650655a","title":"what happens when we dont believe women","story":"Not listening to women’s experience of abusive men – and of other areas from health to the economy – harms all of society It’s become a grim ritual among the women I know: as soon as there is news of another mass shooting, we wait to hear the inevitable story about the shooter’s history of hurting women. (The shooter is always a man.) Sometimes he’s been violent to his mother or grandmother. More often, police reports reveal his history of abusing his girlfriend or wife.But almost always he practiced his violence on a woman long before he planned his massacre, and within a day of the slaughter we’re sharing this history with impotent grief, asking again and again, what will it take to take women’s lives seriously? If we took women’s lives seriously, if men who abused the women in their lives faced any kind of real consequences, would the people we are now preparing to bury be alive today?That’s a complicated question, tangled up with gun politics and our failed criminal justice system. But the core reality remains stark: it’s impossible to contain the suffering that stems from discounting and disbelieving women.If we refused to accept the daily suffering of women and girls at the hands of men who claim to love them, we would have a federal policy removing guns from abusers, and we would ensure that it worked in practice. And we would have a lot fewer gun deaths. Period.It’s vile to have to make this argument. It should be enough that women are hurt. But it’s not. Women’s pain is expected, part of the wallpaper of life. In her indelible essay “The female price of male pleasure,” Lili Loofbourow points to the chasm between what men and women define as “bad sex” to illuminate this basic fact of modern culture: if men find a sexual encounter boring or unsatisfying, they call it “bad”.But we’re not. And when you don’t listen to us, we’re not the only ones who pay the price. Our national failure to take women seriously is a public health crisis, and not just because of bad guys with guns.Take, for example, the medical establishment’s long-documented refusal to take women at our word about the symptoms we’re experiencing. Whether we’re suffering from acute and chronic pain, mysterious weight loss or gain, neuromuscular conditions, or depression and anxiety, we’re suspected of being melodramatic, told that all we need is an attitude adjustment and some self-care.The result? Increased healthcare costs, lost workplace productivity, and the worst maternal death rate in the developed world. This last cost is borne disproportionately by black women, who are treated as even less trustworthy than white women. And mistrusting black women has this massive public health cost as well: if Congress and President Clinton had listened to black women in the reproductive justice movement in 1994, we could have fixed our healthcare system decades ago.Or consider that if we could simply all agree to believe trans women that they exist and are the experts on their own gender identity, the sky-high rates of murder and suicide in the trans community (a recent study found that trans girls have nearly double the suicide attempts of their cis girl peers) would surely be reduced, as would the elevated rates of housing and job discrimination, sexual violence, and street harassment they are currently forced to suffer.Imagine the lives and livelihoods that would have been saved if we had listened to Brooksley Born. In 1996, as the new head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, she realized that the derivatives market, if left unchecked, would eventually cause a catastrophic economic collapse. She spent years trying to get powerful men like then-Fed-chair Alan Green and treasury secretary Robert Rubin to help her sound the alarm. Instead, they fought her every step of the way, until she finally gave up on them and released a report about her predictions on her own. It was ignored and derided by the powers that be. A decade later, the very dynamics she warned against caused the Great Recession.The list seems endless. If we trusted poor women, we wouldn’t withhold aid from their kids to prevent them from procreating as some kind of “scam”, and poor kids would grow up with better nutrition, more stable family dynamics, and better education. If we trusted women to make their own reproductive decisions, we would have unfettered access to safe, reliable birth control and abortion care, and that would likely decrease poverty levels, improve women’s mental and physical health, and create better outcomes for the children they choose to have.Consider how brief and unimportant the Flint water crisis could have been if Michigan officials had trusted the mothers of Flint when they said their water was suddenly undrinkable. How many kids would have grown up without lead exposure? What could those kids have achieved without the lifelong cognition problems and emotional challenges that can result from childhood lead poisoning?And of course, any discussion of the public health costs of disbelieving women must address itself to Hillary Clinton. It was so hard for voters – including white women – to believe in Clinton as a leader that we are all now suffering through the age of Trump. One chilling experiment suggests that the simple fact of Clinton’s gender could have cost her as much as eight points in the general election.We don’t need science to tell us that it was more believable to almost 63 million US voters that Trump, a man who had never held a single public office, who had been sued almost 1,500 times, whose businesses had filed for bankruptcy six times and who had driven Atlantic City into decades-long depression, a race-baiting misogynist leech of a man who was credibly accused of not only of sexual violence but also of defrauding veterans and teachers out of millions of dollars via Trump University, would be a good president than it was to imagine that Clinton, a former first lady, senator and secretary of state and arguably the most qualified person to ever run, would be a better leader.It is not an exaggeration to suggest that every public health impact the Trump administration is having on us – and the list is long and includes making quality healthcare access less accessible for millions, enabling rapists to roam free of consequences on American campuses, and literally speeding up catastrophic climate change by pulling out of the Paris accords – can be linked to our stubborn unwillingness to believe a woman about her own competence, or even just her assertion that a man is dangerous.The truth underlying the public health crisis of women’s believability is even worse than it looks. That’s because social researchers have long demonstrated that it’s not just that we hold women to much higher standards than we do men before we believe them. It’s more perverse than that: we prefer not finding women credible. As a culture, we hate to believe women, and we penalize them for forcing us to do so.In other words, as women’s credibility increases, especially in ways that defy gender norms, their social likability decreases. They become shrill bitches, ball busters, too aggressive, too bossy, such intolerable know-it-alls. It is not enough that we demand women clear a much higher bar than men do to prove their trustworthiness. It’s that we’re mad when they manage to succeed anyway. And we’re all paying the price for that anger.Some of the losses are literally immeasurable. I know of no woman who doesn’t house inside her the nagging feeling that maybe what she has to say is not that important, or will cause too much trouble, or will put her in danger. I know of no woman who has not at least some of the time allowed that feeling to prevail, to smother her impulse to speak. I am haunted by the losses to humanity those infinite silences represent.What inventions and innovations are we suffering without? What tragedies proceeded un-prevented? What kindness and community are we starving for that we could be sustained by, had women not silenced ourselves? For that matter, what offerings could we be benefiting from if women simply didn’t have to work so hard to prove our credibility to ourselves and others? How many hours of our lives have been stolen from us in this way?And yet still today, how many women does it take to overcome the credibility of one man? It took 60 for sexual abuse allegations to become credible against Bill Cosby. For Harvey Weinstein to be credibly accused of sexual harassment and assault, the number is more like 80. For some, we have yet to find the number. Over a dozen accused Donald Trump of sexual assault and he is still the president of the United States as of this writing.Ultimately, the systemic disbelief of women is less about actually seeing women as untrustworthy, and more about fearing what happens if we are able to step into our full power. Not that this distinction matters in practice: do anti-abortion activists really think women are so easily duped by doctors, or is it just more convenient for them to blame “doctors” and posit women as frail-minded and in need of protection than it is to admit that they just want to dictate what we do with our own bodies? Do we not believe that trans women know themselves better than we do, or do we just fear how destabilizing it is to admit that gender is a construct? The damage is done either way.But it’s important to understand how deeply rooted this dynamic is. As has been observed of many oppressive institutions, the delegitimization of women’s authority isn’t the unfortunate side-effect of a broken framework. It’s the grease that makes the entire system go. Women’s erasure is an essential part of the deal powerful men have always made with the men they would have power over: let me have control over you, and in turn I will ensure you can control women. It’s the same bargain white women make when they support misogynist white men in power: if I acquiesce to you demeaning me because of my gender, you will at least allow me to demean others because of their race.But those who refuse to take women seriously rarely admit – to themselves even – what they’re really defending. Instead, they often imagine they have more “rational” concerns. Won’t innocent men be falsely accused? Will women have too much power? Can we really assume women are infallible? These are less questions than straw men, a sleight of hand trick drawing our focus to a shadowy boogeywoman who will take everything you hold dear if you don’t constrain her with your distrust.There is one meaningful way in which the fearmongers are right. Because the existing power structure is built on female subjugation, female credibility is inherently dangerous to it. Patriarchy is called that for a reason: men really do benefit from it. When we take seriously women’s experiences of sexual violence and humiliation, men will be forced to lose a kind of freedom they often don’t even know they enjoy: the freedom to use women’s bodies to shore up their egos, convince themselves they are powerful and in control, or whatever other uses they see fit. When we genuinely believe in women’s leadership capacity, men must face twice the competition they previously had to contend with. And none of us, whatever our gender, are immune from the tremors that can come when the assumptions at the foundation our social contracts are upended.But while we’re constantly obsessed with how risky it is to trust women, what we most of the time fail to consider is the cost of our ongoing mistrust, the cost of missing out on the unfettered power of women. A world in which we treat women as de facto credible is not a world in which men are doing women a favor. It’s a world in which everyone benefits from women’s increased power and knowledge and talent, one in which we recognize that addressing women’s suffering makes it more possible for people of every gender to thrive. The data bear this out in every sector: when girls and women have access to secondary education, their communities and future children have better outcomes. When women are well-represented in the top management of companies, those businesses do better. Even movies that pass the Bechdel test do better at the box office than movies that fail it.Seeing women as fully human may cost men certain kinds of oppressive power, but it pays idends to the human race in nearly every other way. It should be enough to believe in women simply because it’s better for women. But for every time it isn’t, remember this: the costs of disbelieving us are astronomical, and no one escapes the bill.From Believe: How Trusting Women Can Change the World (28 January, Seal Press), an anthology edited by Jaclyn Friedman and Jessica Valenti"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8a7fbef157d6be5faa01d88a1b9fec7535d7646/0_0_3750_2250/master/3750.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8f0bbb9e98195f5b2755e68ddab0222","title":"water worlds the magic of new south wales ocean pools","story":"We start on the southern edge of a small curved beach in the Clarence Valley.

A canonical composition reinterpreted and disassembled by both new players and established elders, they are works that cement their place in tradition through virtue of their lasting capacity to be transformed yet maintain the essence of their identity.Defined like this, saxophonist and composer Anthony Braxton is something of a standard himself. With more than 350 works to his name, he has been heralded as a luminary of free jazz, bearing influences such as John Coltrane and Eric Dolphy, as well as a radical composer of opera and orchestral pieces in the lineage of experimentalists such as Karlheinz Stockhausen. His music often encapsulates what might be seen as “difficult” in jazz – rattling bursts of energy, woozy and unpredictable harmony, outright guttural noise – yet he always keeps a guiding hand on melody, maintaining his ineffable sonic identity.Things come full circle with his Standard Quartet and their three-day residency at London’s Cafe Oto. It’s a suitably intimate and welcoming space for the group, who take to the stage on evenings one and two for two sets of recomposed standards, a lithe and indefatigable 74-year-old Braxton commanding the sold-out crowds.Testament to the group’s inventiveness, the music played each night is typically broad, from Bill Evans’s Waltz for Debby to Simon and Garfunkel’s Bridge Over Troubled Water and Bing Crosby’s Out of Nowhere. Yet Braxton twists and pitch-shifts each melody into unfamiliar territory, pushing pianist Alexander Hawkins into a frenzy of chordal voicings before bringing it back to a cathartic familiarity, expertly straddling the line between tension and release.On ballads such as Waltz for Debby and Where Are You, there is a glacial awakening of melody through the rhythm section’s textural haze, while on more propulsive numbers such as Thelonious Monk’s Epistrophy, Braxton reaches a sky-scraping intensity, swapping out his alto for a sopranino sax. And each evening’s audience is transfixed – whooping, nodding and clapping along to the changes as Braxton breathes endless life into these compositions. It’s an understandable reaction: it’s hard not to feel as if we are witnessing the necessary vitality of jazz in action, a timely reminder that standards can always be bettered."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d675423d5d1f73c0bac3bb0e13517dc623afae2/516_307_1464_878/master/1464.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe70798d9a7fa4bd62c676d9c1c98f56","title":"happy fleet could electric vehicles enhance the joy of driving","story":"EVs mean cleaner cities, but could they improve the experience for drivers too? One ground-breaking partnership piloted by Audi and Addison Lee Group uncovered some surprising benefits to going electricFor companies that rely on fleet vehicles, change is inevitable. A raft of green policies have introduced zero-emissions targets, along with financial incentives encouraging businesses to adopt cleaner cars and vans, such as no vehicle tax for electric company cars in 202021.However, as well as helping the planet and improving a company’s bottom line, the “greening” of vehicle fleets by going fully electric could bring additional benefits. A recent widely reported study found that jumping behind the wheel of an electric car – rather than a traditional petrol or diesel – could also make drivers happier, calmer and less stressed too.Those findings are backed up by Audi’s own research, which found that electric vehicle drivers typically get more pleasure from the experience. According to a combination of 1,350 surveys and 2,000 minutes of interviews, the benefits include a reduction in vibration and engine noise, which can leave drivers feeling less drained after spending time in traffic. EV drivers also reported being able to perform difficult manoeuvres much more easily, and a greater sense of control. Others felt more at one with the vehicle as a result of all the technology. As one respondent put it: “It’s part of me when I drive. It has so much tech involved in it.”That Audi research is now being put to the test as part of a forward-thinking pilot partnership with the Addison Lee Group’s business class car service, Tristar.Addison Lee Group has added five new luxury e-tron SUVs, Audi’s first fully electric cars, with a range of up to 237 miles, to its premium London lineup. The aim is to offer chauffeurs, customers, and both businesses a unique opportunity to understand the real-world performance, opportunities and challenges of going fully electric to achieve a zero-emissions future.The Addison Lee Group chauffeurs underwent simple training with Audi’s electric vehicle specialists before going out to work as usual, driving premium customers around the capital.The ongoing trial enables Addison Lee Group and Audi to see how the cars perform in a real-world, business-critical situation – where running out of battery is not an option. That includes collecting hard data on mileage and usage from the car’s telemetrics, along with the driver’s subjective feedback on the challenges of adopting electric in real-world conditions, including things such as the availability of charging.The proof, though, is in the driving. So what did Addison Lee Group’s trialists make of the experience behind the wheel?“From the beginning I said that I was going to drive it the same way I would a diesel car and that’s what I’ve done,” says Alan Meere, a platinum chauffeur for Tristar. “I feel more relaxed when I get home because I haven’t spent the day fighting the steering wheel. There’s also no droning constantly in your ear like you can get with diesel cars, and you notice that especially after a motorway run. You still get the noise of the tyres but even that’s quieter.”According to Meere, who lives in Sittingbourne, Kent and has been driving for the Addison Lee Group for nine years, any potential anxiety about range soon subsided.“When I came into the pilot, my main reservations were things like whether there would be enough chargers,” he says. “Also, would living so far from London make a difference? But once you realise how good the car is, and you start to understand how to fit charging into your daily routine, that all goes away. Many service stations now have these chargers.”“Being able to plug it in and leave it overnight is hugely convenient,” says Meere. “But if I’m not home long enough for work reasons, then there are also options close by where I can charge it quickly, ready for the next day.”According to figures from Zap Map, a listing app that helps you find your nearest charge points, there are more than 10,000 charging locations in the UK. Finding nearby charge isn’t dissimilar to seeking out your closest petrol station – you learn the locations of the points you use most often.“I’ve developed a map in my head of where I can charge,” says Meere. “If I need a speedy charge, there are three places I use regularly – one at Heathrow and two near where I live. On the 150Kw points I can get close to full in 40 minutes,” he adds.This partnership has been so successful that it’s been extended beyond the initial six months. “I believe our collaboration with Addison Lee Group has been invaluable as a means of further demystifying the concept of the fully electric Audi,” says Andrew Doyle, director of Audi UK.“Although the e-tron is revolutionary as far as our brand is concerned, this project has helped to emphasise its uncomplicated, user-friendly normality to everyone who travels in one. On the one hand, it has proved that it requires minimal compromise as a daily-use proposition by meeting the understandably rigorous demands of Addison Lee Group’s professional drivers in an undeniably challenging working environment. On the other, it has driven home the fact that in terms of comfort, configuration and general usability, the car is a home-from-home for anyone familiar with a contemporary Audi.”Paul McCabe, corporate director at Addison Lee Group, says the pilot has helped to inform the group’s decisions about the fleet choices it will make as it works towards its target of having a fleet capable of zero emissions by 2022. “By generating data-driven insights, the e-tron pilot has allowed us to evaluate the real-world performance and requirements of electric vehicles in our fleet of the future,” he says.Although big change is coming, much will stay the same, and that’s a comfort for those who will experience the revolution first hand.“It’s still a car and you still just drive it the same way,” says Meere, “but it’s just more pleasant to drive. If I had the choice, I’d stay with the electric vehicle now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b554c589762cbd4d108fea72ed3bcf8cedbe873c/646_413_1251_751/master/1251.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a32d4d67e74e507fc122efad1cc75337","title":"five ways to resist the seductive allure of pointless technology","story":"When faced with shiny new tech, many companies and startups feel the urge to jump on the bandwagon, but innovating for the sake of it is rarely a good idea. Here’s how to avoid the pitfalls …Whisper it quietly, but often it’s much simpler to push an old-fashioned light switch than to shout three or four times at a hard-of-hearing voice-activated smart assistant. And, let’s face it, do workplace managers really want to install motion scanners under the desks of their employees to see who takes the longest toilet breaks?Sure, it’s obviously important for businesses to stay on top of tech advances, but there’s a thin line between innovating with purpose and innovating just for the sake of it.Ryan Abbott, professor of law and health sciences at the University of Surrey, specialises in the impact of AI, machine learning and technological advances, but even he believes that common sense sometimes makes more sense than deep learning: “It’s not clear there’s value to technology for technology’s sake and people may adopt it for the wrong reasons – maybe because there’s hype associated with it, rather than considering whether it’s really efficient to use things like artificial intelligence for different tasks.”He’s also less than convinced about all of his smart watch features: “I’m not sure I need my watch to tell me to breathe every five seconds either. I’m not sure it does much more than raise my blood pressure.”Bear in mind that there’s a litany of wonder-technology fads that led nowhere. Do you see many people wearing their computer screen in their glasses? Or using their telephones to monitor whether their toothbrush is scrubbing those hard-to-reach parts?A few years ago, the travel industry got very excited when Icelandair became the first ever airline to allow people to book flights through Facebook Messenger via a booking bot. It has quietly been retired.It’s also tempting to get caught up in the hype around the “smart city”, with its lamp-posts that listen for sounds of trouble. Even Laurence Kemball-Cook, founder and chief executive of Pavegen – which installs paving slabs that turn kinetic energy from people’s footsteps into electricity – thinks that a lot of city development is frivolous, not functional. “Everybody is talking about smart cities, but they are talking about smart for smart’s sake – Bluetooth umbrellas that tell you when it’s raining, multiple connected devices, smart watch, smartphone, smart shoes,” he says. “I’m fed up with that. Our mantra is technology that works for people.”In a world in which shiny innovations have become seductive siren calls, how can businesses resist the allure of pointless tech fads?TeamworkAbbott recommends involving the whole business in creating a new product from the start. “Make sure products are being developed by multidisciplinary teams – not just tech people who may be interested in doing something for the sake of technology but without an ultimate view of what would benefit the consumer,” he says.Explore low-tech alternativesAnother good tip is to consider whether a low-tech solution might exist to your problem before investing in the latest one. You could equip your reception with all kinds of gadgets, scanners, buzzers and heart-rate checks – or perhaps you could make a beautiful garden so everyone walks into work feeling a little more relaxed.Due diligenceOther experts suggest looking at the people behind the company of the tech you are considering: do they live their own principles or are they living the high life? “Do the founders have a purpose other than making money?” Kemball-Cook always asks. “Look at their values: I try to live as sustainably as possible. If your primary goal is making impact, all the good things will follow.”The sustainability testKeep an eye on the environmental impact of what you are doing. Prof Nikki Dibben, a University of Sheffield academic who worked on Bjork’s high-tech project Biophilia, an album that works with all kinds of tech and applications to teach elements of music and science to children, adds: “The value of technology has to be seen within a sustainability agenda. If we’re simply doing things for the sake of doing things, we are going to end up ultimately wasting resources.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d063051875aa97b3061f03360b8714a0ca3639f/0_2270_9536_5722/master/9536.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=288dcc731e2998c22028f8ba8895f7f0","title":"alan turing degree medal memorabilia recovered colorado","story":"The British scientist Alan Turing’s Princeton doctoral degree, OBE medal and other items of memorabilia have been recovered in Colorado, 35 years after they were taken from Sherborne School in Dorset.Turing, a great of British science, was persecuted for his homosexuality and died in 1954, aged 41, his death ruled a suicide. His reputation has since been fully restored and celebrated.In July 2019 a member of the government committee which decided he should appear on the new £50 note, Dr Emily Grossman, wrote in the : “His contribution to science is clear.In 2008, the Princeton Alumni Weekly named Turing the college’s second-most influential graduate, behind only James Madison, the fourth American president who was one of the authors of the US constitution. Six years later, in The Imitation Game, a film directed by Morten Tyldum, Turing was played by Benedict Cumberbatch.On Friday, in court filings reported by the Boulder Daily Camera and other outlets, federal officials said they had recovered and were seeking the forfeiture of Turing’s degree certificate, the medal and photos, reports and letters from his time at boarding school.The items were stolen in 1984, the filing said, after a woman asked to see the Turing archive at Sherborne. A note was later found which said: “Please forgive me for taking these materials into my possession. They will be well taken care of while under the care of my hands and shall one day all be returned to this spot.”In 2018 a woman named Julia Turing offered the items on loan to the University of Colorado Boulder. The court filing said the woman was not related to the British scientist but changed her surname from Schwinghamer in 1988.In a letter cited in the filing and reported by the Planet Princeton website, a Sherborne employee wrote: “I am familiar with the eccentricities of Americans but I got the impression that she has a ‘crush’ on Turing.“One of my staff took her over to the librarian who gave her access to Turing’s bits n pieces. I did not see her again but she wrote expressing her joy at having a collection of Turing items and included a photo of them laid out on a table – his photo, OBE \u0026amp so on. I was not aware that she had taken them, nor indeed was the librarian! I asked him to make a list of the missing items but it proved to be incomplete because we had no inventory anyway.“I gave up any hope of ever getting AT’s things back ’til one day she wrote saying she was sending them back. A parcel arrived. It contained more than the librarian had listed, which made me cross. I wrote thanking her and she told me she intended to join the US Army and was training hard for the US Olympic team (track). I wished her luck and heard no more.”That package evidently did not contain the certificate, medal and other items. In 2018, prompted by their being offered to the Colorado university library, federal officials searched a home and recovered the items. Should they ever reach the market, they could prove valuable: in 2015 one of Turing’s notebooks sold for more than $1m at auction in New York.In her piece for the  last year, Grossman wrote: “Turing’s importance goes beyond science.“Shortly after the war, he was prosecuted by the British government for ‘gross indecency’ due to his relationship with another man. He chose to undergo a year of chemical castration rather than face a prison sentence, but he died two years later, aged 41. The inquest found that his death from cyanide poisoning had been suicide.“In 2009 Gordon Brown issued Turing an apology on behalf of the government – and in 2013 the Queen officially pardoned him.“This may have seemed too little, too late, but such public acknowledgment of his mistreatment by the state helped pave the way for the subsequent government pardoning of nearly 50,000 homosexual men who had been historically cautioned or convicted for homosexual acts.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4b8ddbea84a0fc7866ca0216c19ee80b2cc6622/0_138_2120_1273/master/2120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e49cbc28cf6cc78ea7bae89cc9dcb358","title":"social workers tell us how you feel about your job","story":"Take part in our survey to have your say about the profession and the wider sectorWhat’s it like to be a social worker in the UK right now?We have launched the latest edition of the  Jobs Social Lives survey into the issues affecting staff at all stages of their careers – from the frontline to management.The research, carried out by Ipsos Mori on behalf of the  and new regulator Social Work England, is an opportunity to have your say about issues including workloads, pay and how the profession is viewed.Our last Social Lives study, published in 2017, found more than four-fifths of participants were proud of what they do, and more than three-quarters said they enjoyed their jobs, but most thought their caseloads were too high.Help us to find out whether the picture has changed.

But as a country we don’t really like to talk about thatIn September and October last year, with what we now have to say is slightly unfortunate timing, Saracens issued a series of short videos to commemorate the 10-year anniversary of “The Saracens Way”, the cultural transformation that is said to have turned them into one of the most irresistible forces in the history of English club rugby union.“The Saracens Way, quite simply, is the club,” Will Fraser beams into the camera. A former flanker who retired through injury, Fraser now sells Brand Saracens to a bulging catalogue of corporate clients. For a competitive day rate, including lunch and refreshments, Fraser and a current Saracens player or coach will instil in your company the cornerstones of the Saracens winning ethos: cultural change, strong values, an emphasis on happiness and making memories. “If we create good people,” Fraser explains, “we create good rugby players.”Of course, it was not just fund managers, insurance giants and private schools prepared to invest wholesale in the promise of their own Saracens-liveried epiphany. To read back some of the more reverential media coverage the club received during its glory years, knowing what we do now, is to be reminded of the way dominant sports teams are often accorded a fantastical quasi-shamanic quality, their every trait sanctified, their every twitch scoured for valuable learnings that might benefit the rest of us.The secret of Saracens’ success? It was the creche at the training ground, allowing players to work in a family-oriented environment. It was the microphones attached to players at training to improve communication. It was the team-building holidays to Budapest and Munich. It was the philosophy round tables where the club psychologist would initiate discussions of Descartes. It was the wolves that the then-defensive coach Paul Gustard brought to a team meeting to illustrate the club’s “pack” mentality.The Saracens Way was sold to us as an ideology, almost a lifestyle: a triumph of culture and values, of innovation and fresh thinking. For journalists and corporate bookers it held an instant, sticky appeal: Imagineer Your Way To Success With This One Weird Trick! For some of the sport’s more supercilious fans, seeing the likes of Brad Barritt and Owen Farrell taking on business degrees provided a handy contrast with those thick, vulgar round-ballers. And yet perhaps there was another lesson to be learned from Saracens, one that can really be appreciated only now the club have been found guilty of persistent salary-cap breaches and are facing relegation and ignominy as a result.It was telling, after all, how few of the treatments of Saracens’ unprecedented era of success mentioned its position as one of the Premiership’s financially dominant clubs. Underwritten for more than two decades by the multi-millionaire Nigel Wray and his family, who have absorbed immense debts in order to drive investment in the club’s infrastructure and academy, Saracens have enjoyed a long-term stability that most other clubs have not.Throw in almost £50m of written-off loans and the good fortune of a huge, affluent catchment area in north London, Hertfordshire and Essex, and perhaps you will understand why Saracens’ rivals are less than impressed by the news they have broken the salary cap in each of the previous three seasons and are scheduled to do so again this season by – according to some reports – more than £2m.This was the real One Weird Trick: not quite as widely discussed, perhaps, and a little less sexy than wolves and Descartes, but perhaps the single most crucial factor in those four Premiership titles and three European Champions Cups. None of which, of course, is to play down the graft and ingenuity of the club’s players or coaches, or the very decent work its foundation has done across north London, or the success of its talent pipeline, or the shambolic handling of the case by Premiership Rugby. All of these can be true at once: rugby’s governance structures are scarcely fit for purpose wealth is not the only determinant of sporting success other clubs may well have broken the rules over the years some of the biggest victims of this transgression will be the club’s own players and fans Saracens financially doped their way to success.There are parallels, perhaps, with the trials of Team Sky, that other feelgood British success story whose massive budget, lack of transparency and casual attitude towards sporting ethics were elided by an unquestioning media and a wider lack of curiosity. And to this day Saracens retain a small deranged core of press cheerleaders who regard their crimes as little more than a form-filling oversight, ignoring the potential for even a small overspend to distort the market: a marginal gain, if you like, but one that offers a decisive edge on your rivals.From the Champions League to Test cricket to Team GB: where money flows success often follows. But as a country we don’t really like to talk about that. We don’t like to talk about the ways in which financial clout can tilt the playing field, stockpile talent, buy political influence and favourable media coverage, hire batteries of lawyers to deter legislation and squash competitors.Instead we would rather talk about winning mentalities and virtuous cultures, about creches and team-building jaunts. To do otherwise, after all, would be to tear down the illusion that still props up the narrative of sport in this country: that through talent, hard work and innovation alone, you too can stand atop the podium. It is a maxim that has never been true in society and is rarely – if ever – true in sport. Anyone telling you different is probably trying to sell you something."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4d4d6a9d1ab81c8c91891b2c2a41cd41a2f0c26/0_259_4455_2674/master/4455.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06656ce155501f1c2dea71af32c4e3de","title":"16in macbook pro review bigger battery new keyboard new apple","story":"Apple shows it’s listening to pro users by producing a thicker, heavier and better machineApple’s new 16in MacBook Pro is bigger and heavier, but that’s a very good thing, with the largest battery you can have in a laptop and a new keyboard that looks to kick the troubles of the past few years to the kerb.It’s a bit of a U-turn from Apple and demonstrates that the Californian tech firm is finally listening to its hardcore audience: the professionals.The 16in MacBook Pro is the largest, most expensive laptop that Apple makes and is a direct replacement for the 15in MacBook Pro that was made up until November 2019. Starting at £2,399 and reaching £5,769 with all the options ticked, it’s clear this is no ordinary computer for general users.This is a machine is designed for developers, video editors, sound engineers and other people working in industries that demand power and performance for as long as possible.But there are two new things that might interest general buyers as a preview of what’s likely to come to Apple’s other laptops that are more suitable general computers: a new keyboard and a new battery.Fundamentally the design of the MacBook Pro hasn’t changed much since the introduction of the fourth-generation machine in late 2016. From the outside it looks practically identical, except it’s ever-so-slightly bigger than the 15in MacBook Pro.This fifth-generation machine is 8.6mm wider, 5.2mm deeper, 0.7mm thicker and 170g heavier than the old version, increasing the screen size from 15.4in to a round 16in on the diagonal. It has the same four Thunderbolt 3 ports and still has a headphone socket. The keyboard has different mechanisms under the keys but is otherwise very similar, as is the gigantic trackpad. Apple makes the best trackpads in the business and this one is no different.On the audio front the speakers and mics have been upgraded. The machine now comes with a six-speaker system built into it, which are still laptop speakers and won’t replace a set of headphones or a dedicated sound system, but sound phenomenal for what they are.A three-mic array is capable of beamforming, cancelling background noise and is of high-enough quality that you don’t necessarily need to reach for a dedicated microphone for impromptu recording sessions.Much has been written about Apple’s recent laptop keyboards. The butterfly keyboard introduced with the 2015 MacBook was thinner, crisper, louder and with only a small amount of travel. I quite liked it, but it was plagued with failures due to dust getting under the keys and stopping them from depressing.The 16in MacBook Pro has a new “magic keyboard” that moves back to the traditional scissor switches used by older Apple laptops and practically every other manufacturer. The keys are more stable and the travel is slightly shallower than Apple’s pre-butterfly keyboards, arriving at a nice combination of the best bits of the butterfly and scissor-switch keyboards.Most will like the feel. It’s stable and has enough travel. It’s also easier to repair, so while it shouldn’t suffer from the same dust issues plaguing the butterfly keyboard, at least it should be easier to fix if something goes wrong.Apple has also added a dedicated ESC key in the top left, which is separated from the Touch Bar. This is something developers in particular have asked for and was a welcome addition for the ’s developers’ team.The direction arrows are now back in an inverted T arrangement, too, which was a frequent request. The Touch ID fingerprint scanner has also been separated from the Touch Bar, which led to far fewer accidental triggers of Siri – the first key by default on the Touch Bar – when I attempted to authenticate something with my fingerprint.The screen is marginally bigger at 16in on the diagonal rather than 15.4in, although you can only really tell side by side. The display has a higher resolution, which provides slightly more screen real estate in use, as well as being slightly crisper on paper with a density of 226 pixels per inch (up from 220ppi).On the whole it’s one of the nicest displays I’ve used on a laptop. Rich, bright, easy to use in most lighting conditions, it is inidually calibrated at the factory and it has a mode that simulates high dynamic range. But it is not a true HDR display nor is it 4K, which may be an issue for those looking to work with content in both although most will likely transition to an dedicated edit suite for serious work. The MacBook Pro does support output to up to two 6K or four 4K displays simultaneously, for those who use this as their sole machine working at a desk.Other than the slightly bigger screen and marginally thicker keyboard, the majority of the increased weight and thickness of the 16in MacBook Pro is down to its significantly larger battery.But you’re looking more like a few hours of video editing, which is more than enough for quick adjustments in the field in between connections to a power socket. The larger battery was welcomed by the ’s video team, who said the increased weight was negligible in the grand scheme of things.If you were looking for a new Mac laptop as a workstation, but were put off buying one because of the troubles with the keyboard, or that it just didn’t last long enough to get whatever you needed to done in the field, the 16in MacBook Pro is the answer.Aside from the new keyboard, it’s clear Apple has listened to at least a few requests from power users. The escape key is back by popular demand, as is the T-shaped layout of the arrow keys, while a separated powerTouch ID button is much more user friendly. You can even fix some things without fully dismantling the machine, which is a step forward.There’s still no SD card slot or any port option not USB-C but by now most will have hubs, dongles or new replacement cables for the necessary things.The 16in MacBook Pro is most certainly not the laptop for general users who just want a big screen – the price alone should be able to tell you that. But if you know you need this sort of capability, then the MacBook Pro is in a similar price bracket to competitors and can be specified with a frankly absurd amount of capacity, which might make the difference.The first of the fifth-generation MacBook Pros is a return to form for Apple, and bodes well for further refreshes of the company’s slightly more affordable laptop lines expected in the near future.Pros: good keyboard compromise, escape key, t-shape arrow keys, 100Wh battery, gorgeous screen, brilliant trackpad, powerful and customisable (at point of purchase), USB-CThunderbolt 3, Touch IDCons: fairly heavy for some, no card slot or legacy ports, no user-serviceable RAM or storage, no Face ID This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

As he returns, he talks self care, sexism – and much more Heston Blumenthal doesn’t stop talking. At speed. His thoughts veer off in a thousand directions, seemingly simultaneously. “Question everything” is the motto the chef plumped for on the coat of arms he was granted a few years back, and he does just that: our conversation takes in Newton, Darwin, Homer, Harry Potter, the Bible, the Qu’ran, the invention of the telephone, the invention of social media, breathing, Jaws and saws.The violence of the last two make me blink. Having spoken out in 2015 about TV becoming “too formulaic” and subsequently disappearing from our screens, Blumenthal likens the need to take a step back to the scene in Jaws where Roy Scheider is on the beach and hears a scream in the water, as the camera simultaneously zooms out and moves in. He segues swiftly into another metaphor, of a carpenter sawing away with an ever-blunter implement. “He should stop and have a rest,” he says, “resharpen his saw and start again. But when you’re in the middle of it, you think ‘I can’t stop, I don’t have time.’” Is this a sign of the culinary wizard coming back an even more intense character? Or perhaps he’s just bringing the drama he’s famous for in the kitchen to our conversation. “I have some funny metaphors I still need to work on,” he concedes.In any case, Blumenthal is very much back. This week, the man famous for serving up giant lit candles, ‘dismembered corpses’ and edible icebergs as food returns to television as one of the “kitchen gods” on Channel 4’s super-kitsch new cooking show, Crazy Delicious. Styled like a cross between Willy Wonka’s garden and the My Little Pony universe, Crazy Delicious is all puffy clouds and cherry blossom, babbling brooks and blue skies. Crucially, it is TV’s first entirely edible set – just the thing to bring Blumenthal out of his hiatus.In each episode, three intrepid home cooks are let loose in the fairytale garden to go forth and forage. With their haul, they compete in three tasks, presenting their spectacular, offbeat creations to Blumenthal and his cronies – American soul-food big-hitter Carla Hall and Michelin-starred Swedish fire-pit master Niklas Ekstedt – to compete for the golden apple.“It taps right into my heart, my blood, my culinary DNA,” says Blumenthal. The challenge he has always embraced, he says, is to make things that taste as good as they look, while being at odds with exactly what they look like. Doing it all in chocolate would be too easy. Instead, unleashing wild creativity – travelling to the outer rim of Bake Off, so to speak – is what he’s all about.Creativity is one thing, but the past decade has also brought Blumenthal a lot of pain. A norovirus outbreak got his signature restaurant The Fat Duck shut down not once but twice, in 2009 and again in 2014. Blumenthal and Zanna, his wife of 28 years, split up in 2011, then orced six years later. And the tabloids had him in their gossip-spewing sights in the interim. The Daily Mail couldn’t stop quoting his next girlfriend, US food writer Suzanne Pirret, saying food and sex were her favourite two things, “best one after the other in either order I’m not picky.” And the secrets that followed – the affair, the baby and subsequent nuptials with French real estate agent and lover 20 years his junior Stephanie Gouveia – sent the red tops into a tail spin.“You know,” he says, “I wouldn’t want to go through those things again. But I wouldn’t want to change them either. I wouldn’t have anything to learn from if it wasn’t for failure.” All those experiences have given him the opportunity, he says, to question a lot about himself. The last time he was interviewed by the , he was asked if he’d been in therapy. “Of course I have,” he replied. Now, he tells me he’s been thinking a lot about the importance of breathing: “It’s the most intimate relationship a human being can have, that with themselves and their breath.”Meanwhile, last week, he’s taken flak for suggesting diners should stop Instagramming their meals and just eat them instead. “Oh keep up” has been the general response to that bit of boomerism, which makes the undeniable tongue-in-cheek quality of Crazy Delicious most welcome. When I said Blumenthal, Ekstedt and Hall were gods on this show, I meant it: they’re dressed in head-to-toe white and sit at a table up in the set’s clouds. It is ludicrous. But when you think of the pedestal on which celebrity chefs are placed – their books as Bibles, their followers as disciples (incidentally, in 2014 Blumenthal invested in a racehorse named Acolyte) – it is refreshing to see the three of them so game.Was irony part of the appeal? “No, I was very scared of that,” says Blumenthal. “When we first walked up the stairs with our white trousers and shoes on, Niklas and I looked at each other and went, ‘gods??’” White being the worst colour for food-tasting notwithstanding, they thought to hell with it, and tucked right in. And that is not a metaphor Blumenthal has actually been walking around eating the set.He wants the loopy ideas and bold dreams of Crazy Delicious to inspire everyone. “Imagine a candy floss cloud above the roof of your house attached with liquorice string, blowing in the wind,” he says – and I try to. Well, he continues, people imagining things like that collectively is how we talk on the phone, or interact on social media. After all, as he puts it, “we’re all born artists.” And if there’s anyone who can demonstrate how to stay that way, surely it’s the guy who brings fairytales to the table. Now, anyone for strawberry chicken wings?Crazy Delicious starts tonight at 8pm on Channel 4"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adef7602cf8cbbb934276af370a85cc349437fe6/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65b82f9d87ed3300ff1f275f03d32ee8","title":"heads could roll pwc isabel dos santos links chairman luanda leaks","story":"Exclusive: Bob Moritz says he is ‘shocked and disappointed’ by Luanda Leaks disclosuresThe global chairman of PwC has warned that heads could roll at the professional services firm over its links to Isabel dos Santos, Africa’s richest woman, who is battling allegations that she obtained her wealth through corruption and nepotism.Bob Moritz, whose firm advised companies belonging to Dos Santos and her husband across multiple jurisdictions, told the  he was “shocked and disappointed” by recent disclosures about the British-headquartered accounting firm’s work for the daughter of Angola’s former president.The complex financial schemes that helped Dos Santos amass an estimated $2.2bn (£1.7bn) fortune at the expense of the Angolan state have been revealed this week in the Luanda Leaks investigation, based on a huge cache of documents leaked from her business empire.The Luanda Leaks project is based on a trove of 715,000 emails, charts, contracts, audits and accounts detailing the business operations of Isabel dos Santos, the daughter of the former president of Angola.The files were initially obtained by the anti-corruption charity Platform to Protect Whistleblowers in Africa (PPLAAF), which shared them with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).The documents, which cover a period between 1980 and 2018, have been reviewed by more than 120 journalists from 37 media outlets, including the , the BBC and the Portuguese newspaper\u0026nbspExpresso.Moritz said a PwC investigation would examine whether any iniduals at the partnership should lose leadership positions, have their bonuses docked or lose their jobs.Dos Santos has denied that her fortune is the result of nepotism or corruption, and she and her husband have rejected any allegations of wrongdoing, saying their wealth is the result of decades of hard work, and that moves to freeze their assets in Angola are part of a politically motivated “witch-hunt” by her father’s successor as president.“There is an orchestrated attack by the current government that is completely politically motivated, it’s completely unfounded,” Dos Santos told BBC News. “I can say my holdings are commercial, there are no proceeds from contracts or public contracts or money that has been deviated from other funds.”The move comes as the fallout from the Dos Santos revelations shifts to the lawyers, accountants and other western companies that aided her business empire.Luanda Leaks is a cache of 715,0000 files from the administrators of her empire, examined by the  and media outlets in 20 countries in an investigation led by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).The documents suggest PwC, one of the big four global accountancy firms, acted as auditor, consultant and tax adviser to companies controlled by Dos Santos and her husband in Switzerland, Malta, the Netherlands and Angola. According to the New York Times, another ICIJ partner, PwC worked with 20 of their companies.Moritz said that from a reputational perspective, the Dos Santos story was the worst thing to have happened to PwC under his chairmanship, but he believed it was an exception and not the norm.The company, which made millions from its work for Dos Santos, previously said it was terminating any ongoing work for entities controlled by members of her family “in response to the very serious and concerning allegations”.After graduating from a British university, Dos Santos began her career at Coopers \u0026amp Lybrand, which went on to become PricewaterhouseCoopers, or PwC. She later hired former PwC staff as close advisers.They include the chair of Fidequity, the Lisbon wealth management outfit that helped administer her empire and whose data forms part of the leak. When Dos Santos was appointed to run the Angolan state oil company, Sonangol, she recruited her chief financial officer from PwC.Moritz said he was disappointed that PwC had not picked up warning signals from its work in Angola. “When we look at some of the signs that were there, we should have picked them up earlier, and that was our mistake,” he said.Moritz said the investigation at PwC would go as high as it needed to, but he denied that his own job was at risk. Appointed in 2016, he is the chairman of the PwC International Network, which supports more than 276,000 employees in 157 countries. In this capacity, he leads a network of PwC firms that serve clients around the globe from multinational companies to startups.“I’m not worried about my job, but I’m worried about making sure this organisation does what it needs to do,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b97c0d1cf6b53d1e3a9ab5258e7d1490b38a984e/0_19_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c5af5ab05717f678f516eec7b1d06b1","title":"hondurans no mans land mexican troops block path us","story":"Hundreds of migrants become stranded at river between Guatemala and MexicoHundreds of Central American migrants have become stranded in a sort of no man’s land on the river border between Guatemala and Mexico, after running up against lines of Mexican National Guard troops deployed to keep them from moving en masse into the country and north towards the US.The path forward was blocked by troops with riot shields, and about 100 National Guard agents with anti-riot gear formed a barrier into the night. But for many, a return home to impoverished and gang-plagued Honduras, where most of the migrants are from, was unthinkable.“We are in no man’s land,” said Alan Mejía, whose two-year-old son was cradled in his arms as his wife, Ingrid Vanesa Portillo, and their other son, 12, gazed at the riverbanks.Mejía joined in five previous migrant “caravans” but never made it further than the Mexican border city of Tijuana. “They are planning how to clear us out, and here we are without water or food,” said Portillo. “There is no more hope for going forward.”Unlike the case with many of the previous caravans, there was no sign of humanitarian aid arriving for those stuck at the river.Large numbers waded across the Suchiate into southern Mexico on Monday hoping to test Donald Trump’s strategy to keep Central American migrants away from the US border. The push also challenged Mexico’s tougher immigration policing that began last year in response to threats of economic tariffs from the US president, a change that in effect snuffed out the last caravan in April.Some scuffled with troops on the riverbank while others slipped through the lines and trudged off on a rural highway, with most taken into custody later in the day. Others were taken into custody on the spot or chased into the brush. Some people hurled rocks at the police, who huddled behind their plastic shields and threw some of the rocks back.Most, however, stayed at the river’s edge or stood in its waters trying to decide their next move after being blocked earlier in the day from crossing the bridge linking Tecun Uman in Guatemala with Ciudad Hidalgo in Mexico.“We never thought they would receive us like that,” said Melisa Ávila, who travelled from the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa with her 12-year-old son and was resigned to the prospect of spending the night outdoors. “They treated us like dogs.”In an approach that developed after the first migrant caravan in late 2018, Mexican officials seem to be succeeding in their effort to blunt large-scale incursions by breaking up the mass of people repeatedly and into increasingly smaller groups. Over the weekend, government officials convinced about 1,000 people they should enter legally via the bridge.The National Immigration Institute said it would detain anyone in the country illegally, hold them in detention centres and deport those who did not legalise their status. Any who made it through and continued north could expect a gauntlet of highway checkpoints."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96e235fb6e405d4cc1fb5557a8c3077a83bc5ea6/0_58_1728_1037/master/1728.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29612672fdece7c0d7076b25225429fc","title":"westminster cathedral to review sacred music after master resigns","story":"Timetable changes at world-class choir school put musical heritage at risk, say opponentsThe Catholic church has launched a strategic review of the role of sacred music at Westminster Cathedral following the sudden resignation of its music master and controversy over boarding arrangements at its world-class choir school.The diocese of Westminster said in a statement the review would consider “the steps needed to strengthen the role played by sacred music” as well as structures and “clarity of roles” needed in relationships between the cathedral, its music department and the choir school.The statement said: “The choir of Westminster Cathedral is recognised as one of the finest in the world. Since its foundation in 1901 it has occupied a unique and enviable position at the forefront of English church music, famous both for its distinctive continental sound and its repertoire.”Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the archbishop of Westminster, said: “Our musical heritage is precious and this strategic review is an opportunity to strengthen this heritage and look forward to the next 10 years with confidence.”The review will be undertaken by a four-person panel and is expected to be completed in April.As well as singing mass and vespers at the cathedral, the choir, which comprises 20 boy trebles and altos, aged eight to 13, and 10 professional adults, performs in concerts in the UK and abroad, and makes recordings.Earlier this month, Westminster diocese retrospectively announced the resignation of Martin Baker, the cathedral’s master of music. Baker, who had held the post since 2000, had reportedly opposed changes to the choir school timetable, which some parents and alumni argued put the cathedral’s musical heritage at risk.From September, the school required boarding choristers to be collected by parents at 4pm on Friday evenings and returned at 9am on Sundays in time for Mass. Previously boys had boarded seven days a week, allowing them to sing mass on Fridays and Saturdays.David Heminway, the chair of governors, told parents in May of the new arrangements, saying it had become increasingly difficult to recruit boarding choristers because parents wanted to spend time with their sons. The choristers board from the age of eight.A group of parents wrote to Nichols, arguing the change would strike “a critical blow to an important part of our national, international and Catholic heritage and tradition” and would “actively damage the world-class standing of the choir”.Colin Mawby, a former master of music who died in November, previously said the new timetable would “gravely affect standards and repertoire”. The practical difficulties of collecting and returning children within a tight weekend timeframe would mean “what is now an international institution will become localised,” he wrote in the Catholic Herald.Baker “did manage to put his case to the Cardinal but without effect”, Mawby added.Some parents and supporters of the choir school believe Baker was forced out because of his opposition to the changes.Michael Berkeley, the composer and peer who is a former Westminster cathedral chorister, said Baker’s departure was “a disaster”.“He has been very disciplined as I understand it, by not directly contacting people, but I have been informed by other people that he has essentially been forced out. He really couldn’t cope,” he told the Daily .About 250 boys aged four to 13 attend the academically selective Westminster Cathedral Choir preparatory school, where fees range from £5,641 to £6,765 per term. The 20 boarding choristers, who join at the age of eight, pay lower fees and are eligible for financial support."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0da62f03250c88a717e0beab4972cc7584b9e333/0_275_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=36c54c28278a25eb7cd76746d5feb38a","title":"what does your 10 manicure really cost the unvarnished truth about nail bars","story":"Are vulnerable young Vietnamese people being routinely trafficked into the UK to work in cut-price nail salons? Amelia Gentleman joins a police raid on one shop suspected of involvement in exploitationOnline reviews for this small south-London nail bar are mixed. “Best nail bar in Peckham,” one says. Most comments, however, are more grudging. “Suppose you get what you pay for,” another concludes (customers here do not pay very much, just £10 for a full manicure). Most telling are the comments about the staff. “The younger girls and boys seem to be learning as they go” “Communication is close to none as they don’t speak English.”It is this lack of English that is one of the warning flags that has put the shop on a list of nail bars requiring investigation for possible exploitation. On a slow Thursday afternoon, the shabby venue is being raided by 20 police officers three people are later arrested on human trafficking charges and four frightened young employees are taken temporarily to a council-run reception centre, where they are given medical treatment and advice.Cut-price nail bars have become a cornerstone of the high street, flourishing as more established shops close. In the past 20 years, manicures have gone from being an extravagant luxury mostly enjoyed by a moneyed elite to an affordable treat, easily accessible to everyone. But the public awareness of what the low costs may mean for those who work there remains hazy. It is easier to associate cannabis farms and brothels with exploitation. Operating in plain sight, nail bars seem more improbable fronts for modern slavery it is very hard to link such an innocuous service with such serious crimes.Kevin Hyland, the UK’s first anti-slavery commissioner, who stepped down in 2018, says people remain confused about the presence of exploitation on the high street because they expect trafficking to be hidden. “People see the shops, they’ve been there for years, police cars drive past them, the local authority collects their rubbish, so they assume they can’t be one of the places where modern slavery happens – an offence that carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.” Familiarity can also add a sense of respectability to the premises. “The longer the shop has been there, the more accepted it is,” he says.Unease about the treatment of vulnerable young Vietnamese people in the UK manicure industry, however, has been slowly rising over the past decade. Then, in October, 39 Vietnamese people were found dead in the back of a refrigerated lorry in Essex. Ten were teenagers. Pham Thi Tra My had texted her mother from the lorry: “I’m sorry Mum. My journey abroad hasn’t succeeded. Mum, I love you so much! I’m dying because I can’t breathe.” Anti-trafficking experts believe that they were brought in to the country to work in nail bars, restaurants and cannabis farms. Southwark council has been working with the politan police on inspecting nail bars since last summer, and the operations have been stepped up in the wake of the Essex tragedy. Yet even news of these deaths has done little to dampen customers’ enthusiasm for £10 manicures.The venue in Peckham is one of five in Southwark being raided simultaneously by 100 police officers. The shop’s thin veneer of frivolity is rapidly stripped away. Inside, there is confusion as eight of the 20 officers crowd inside the narrow space between a row of battered, mismatched treatment chairs, where two startled customers are having their nails painted, and a wall lined with rainbow-coloured pots of varnish. “This is a search warrant giving police the authority to search these premises for evidence of human trafficking,” one of the officers announces. The customers hurriedly leave, while police begin attempting to interview the seven members of staff, all of them Vietnamese.Unravelling who is a victim and who might be exploiting them in this kind of scenario is not always easy. And in this operation it is hampered by a decision to allocate just one interpreter to the 25-strong team of police, social workers, immigration officers and council staff squeezed inside the shop and gathering on the pavement outside.The nail-bar workers, who are told by the translator they face questioning, look alarmed, but say nothing. By the window, a boy in a grey top, clearly a teenager, sits on a swivel chair, his hands pressed anxiously between his legs, his feet not quite touching the floor. With the translator elsewhere, two social workers try without success to speak to him.“How old are you? How old are you? You don’t know how old you are? Your age?” one asks, using the time-honoured British technique of communicating with a non-English speaker, of slowly repeating the same question, louder and louder. He replies quietly in Vietnamese, looking unhappy. “How old are you? Do you speak English? I can’t get anything out of him,” she says, with unreasonable irritation.A teenage girl, who, like all the staff, is wearing a grey top, tells officers through the interpreter that she is 17, but says she isn’t actually working in the shop, and has just stopped by to say hello to a friend as she was in the neighbourhood. “Are your parents here? You mum or dad?” a police officer asks. She shakes her head.The only adult man among the staff is very agitated, and repeatedly requests to be allowed to go to the toilet. Police refuse, concerned that he wants to get rid of something incriminating. Instead, he sits gloomily, snipping his nails, dropping the clippings on the floor. An older woman says she is worried about her baby at home, and asks to leave, but she is told that no one can go until checks have been made on everyone’s immigration status she is later arrested. One of the younger women says all the takings (the nail bar accepts only cash) are put in a drawer until the end of the day no one will give a clear answer about how, or how much, they are paid.Outside the shop, more police officers are questioning a tired-looking Vietnamese man who has been peering through the back of the building, then watching proceedings from the other side of the high street and making calls. They ask him to hand over and unlock his phone.“It’s not my phone,” he tells them, speaking Vietnamese to the translator. “Some lady just gave it to me.”“Can you just tell him I’ve never heard such rubbish in my life,” the police officer says, holding the phone in front of the man’s face to see if it would unlock with facial recognition.“Tell him we are going to arrest him on suspicion of theft of a mobile phone.” The man unlocks his phone and officers look through the 20 calls he has made and received during the 45 minutes since the raid began, establishes that a number of calls have been made to staff inside the shop and decide to arrest him on suspicion of involvement in modern slavery and people trafficking.Shortly, another man comes to the shop, pushing a small baby in a pram, and looks through the windows at the staff inside. “Is this your shop?” police ask him. He shakes his head, but when asked to show ID, police recognise him as the man named as the shop’s manager on a notice inside. Another officer takes the pram, handcuffs him and tells him: “You are under arrest for arranging and facilitating modern slavery. We’ll look after the baby, don’t worry.”The mother of the baby has already been taken from the shop to a waiting police car. “He’s been nicked she’s been nicked. Do we bring the baby to the police station?”“We don’t want that. We’ll have to take her into care.”Beneath the pram’s plastic rain cover, the baby peeps out, waving its arms around peacefully.“Is there anyone else who can look after the baby?” a police officer asks the translator to ask the man, adding in an aside: “We’re getting our money’s worth out of you … Ask him: Is there another family member? When does the baby need food and drink?”A lorry driver waiting at the traffic lights by the shop in a truck piled high with scaffolding, shouts: “Let him off!” before driving away, laughing.In total, 13 people working in the five shops are arrested on suspicion of modern slavery and human trafficking offences, and another seven are arrested on suspicion of immigration offences and possessing counterfeit goods, mostly counterfeit cigarettes. Five children and nine adults are deemed to be vulnerable and taken to a temporary reception centre. The council says later that no one was taken into care, because “police weren’t able to establish that any of the young people were children”, although 10 children were found working in Southwark’s nail bars earlier in the year and placed with foster carers. It is unclear what happened to the baby.Mark Rogers, the detective chief inspector leading the operation for the politan police’s central specialist crime unit, says he is happy with how things have gone. “Human trafficking, modern slavery and sexual exploitation often occur in plain sight, and it is often the case those carrying out these offences exploit those from less fortunate backgrounds who have travelled to our country for a better life, in the knowledge these iniduals will carry out hard, labour-intensive work to provide for themselves.”So, how can customers tell if a nail bar is not all it seems? Kevin Hyland recommends looking out for anything that doesn’t look right. “The price is sometimes an indicator but there are other signs.” Are the instructions given through a third party? Are you told: sit here, and that person will do your nails? There should be some ability to interact with the staff does the worker carry on in silence, never removing the protective face mask? Is there a man sitting at the door, behaving in a dominant way?Samantha Sweet, who runs Creative Nail Design, says it is impossible to tell which discount salons are likely to be exploitative. “If we knew more about the discount places I think we would choose different places. Some of them are absolutely fine and employ people legally. But I don’t think the general public think about it they think – well it’s dead cheap and dead quick.” As a benchmark she said the average gel polish treatment should cost at least £25. But, she says “part of the problem is that in the cheaper salons, people don’t talk anyway – they hold out one hand and they’re on their mobile on the other, and then they swap hands.”Millie Kendall, CEO of the British Beauty Council, says two decades ago she only knew of two nail salons in London, but new products, (extensions, fillers, shellac) and the rise of instagram sharing of nail art has made this a rapidly accelerating industry with multiple shops on most high streets. “The business has changed beyond recognition. Nail art has changed the game and made it a more creative industry. The flip side is that we are very under regulated and that’s a real problem for us. Bad products are being used, people get funguses, skin problems and there are slaves.” She hopes the government will move to license the industry.Mark Rogers says he hopes media coverage of the arrests will “continue to raise the public’s awareness of these shocking crimes.” But even when people learn about the issue they tend not to believe it could affect the salon they use it is hard to understand that you could be in such close proximity to someone who has been trafficked, holding your hand, and silently painting bright varnish on your nails.Despite Southwark’s high-profile campaigns, online reviews of other nail bars in the borough continue to reveal how clients’ irritation with the language barrier is carefully weighed up against the joy of a cheap pedicure. Despite the intimacy involved in the treatment, hands and feet being washed and tended to by strangers, many seem remarkably uncurious about the workers, and concern for their welfare seems negligible. One customer writes: “The staff were rude both in person and on the phone, some barely spoke any English, you could clearly see they didn’t want to be doing the job. Got a manicure and pedicure – the job was just about mediocre.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"People aged 11 to 30 particularly hard-hit with 253 cases notified to HSE this monthEPA report calls for more focus on enforcing waste segregation in households and businessesSuspension has been lifted pending outcome of appeal against DMBB decisionElection campaign launch: Howlin says his party will \u0026lsquoend the waste of public money\u0026rsquoCharity wants would-be TDs to engage with the marginalised and take stand against racismHousing manifesto includes rent freezes and 20,000 new homes a yearMinister feels no pressure on Explorium visit while Donnelly tells us who\u0026rsquos really in chargeCourt told child suffered nightmares and post-traumatic stress after 2014 incidentVoters interviewed in Cork believe health service problems are institutional and that people have low expectations for ministers of healthDetectives investigating fatal knife attack at Cork party also examining a number of phonesCatherine Noone\u0026rsquos Volkswagen runs her into bother while Kevin O\u0026rsquoKeeffe\u0026rsquos joke backfires\u0026lsquoThe State built 8,500 social houses in 1975, but was able to build only 750 two years ago\u0026rsquoCardiff researchers find new immune cell that kills most human cancer typesHigh Court ruled in December that \u0026euro220m project properly assessed by An Bord Plean\u0026aacutelaPlans by hotelier Martin Keane for the site are declared invalidGroup seeks free contraception, universal pension system and support for lone parents"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4146486.1579598070!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"n%C3%B3ra quoirin s family sue resort owner and call for inquest","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe family of late Franco-Irish teenager Nóra Quoirin (pictured) is suing the owner of the Malaysian resort she disappeared from for alleged negligence. Photograph: Quoirin FamilyAFPGetty Images.The family of late Franco-Irish teenager Nóra Quoirin is suing the owner of the Malaysian resort she disappeared from for alleged negligence and has urged the government to hold an inquest to determine what happened to her.Nóra’s disappearance from her family’s cottage at the Dusun eco-resort in southern Negeri Sembilan state on August 4th last sparked a massive search operation. Her body was discovered on August 13th beside a small stream about 2km from the resort.Police said there was no sign that the 15-year-old was abducted or attacked, with a preliminary postmortem showing that she succumbed to intestinal bleeding due to starvation and stress.Sankara Nair, a lawyer for the girl’s parents Meabh and Sebastien Quoirin, said the family strongly believed Nóra was abducted as she has mental and physical disabilities and could not have wandered off on her own.The lawsuit says a cottage window was found ajar, with its latch broken, on the morning she disappeared. It says the resort gate was left open at all times without any security and there was no surveillance camera except for in the reception area.Nóra had a brain condition called holoprosencephaly which limited her development. She had poor motor skills and needed help to walk, and her mental age was about five- or six-years-old, her parents say in the claim.Mr Sankara said outside a court in Negeri Sembilan after a procedural session on the case: “The place was not safe for the child because of the negligence ...anybody could have come in and taken the child.”SufferingThe Quoirin family is seeking more than 180,000 ringgit (almost €40,000) over losses, bereavement costs and damages for pain and suffering from the resort owner, Helen Marion Todd. Ms Todd’s lawyers were not immediately available for comment.Mr Sankara said the family has asked Malaysia’s attorney-general to open an inquest because the postmortem inquiry would not include what happened to Nóra before her death. Police have said a complete postmortem report will be released soon.Nóra’s parents previously said they were shocked when Malaysian prosecutors classified her death as requiring “no further action” based on the preliminary coroner’s report, essentially ruling out any inquest. They said the move could prevent justice being done.In a statement issued by the Lucie Blackman Trust, a charity that helps British families in crisis overseas, Nóra’s London-based parents said: “It is crucial to understand how Nóra came to be found where she was. “As a vulnerable child, with significant physical and mental challenges, we strongly refute any conclusion that Nóra was alone for the entire duration of her disappearance.“We have repeatedly asked the police to clarify answers to our questions in this regard — and we have been repeatedly ignored.” - PA"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4146730.1579616811!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"election 2020 dublin central constituency profile","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLast time out in 2016, Mary Lou McDonald soaked up almost a quarter of all the first-preference votes cast in the constituency. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsDublin Central was for decades staunch Bertie Ahern and Tony Gregory territory. The only near certainty for being elected in the constituency now is Mary Lou McDonald.Last time out in 2016, the Sinn Féin leader soaked up almost a quarter of all the first-preference votes cast. Behind her in that election – by a decent enough margin – was Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe. It would be a huge shock if the high-profile Fine Gael frontbencher did not retain his seat this time around.But he would need to be careful about splitting his vote with a new running mate – former manager of the Together for Yes campaign Deirdre Duffy, who is ambitious in looking to pick up a second seat for the party. Dublin Central has switched between a three-seater and four-seater constituency over previous polls, and it’s back to four TDs for the next Dáil. The big question is who will take the other two seats, assuming no huge upsets for McDonald and Donohoe. The constituency is erse. It covers the capital’s north inner city and stretches out into the suburbs of Cabra, Phibsborough and Glasnevin. For 27 years before his death in 2009, Gregory was a prominent working-class voice of the north inner city, campaigning for better housing and against the drugs problem afflicting the area.Independent Maureen O’Sullivan ran as the “Gregory candidate” after his death, effectively taking over his seat for 10½ years. Her decision not to stand for re-election, along with an extra seat up for grabs, opens up the race significantly.Others to watchTwo others to watch here also took more first preferences than O’Sullivan last time around: Gary Gannon of the Social Democrats and Labour’s Joe Costello. Both are centre left and there is a sizeable left vote in the constituency. Both should also prove more transfer-friendly than some of the other candidates vying for that ground. It could be a question of who has the edge between them for one of the seats. Gannon is younger and has been effective at building a profile for himself. Costello, a former Minister of State, has experience as a veteran of election campaigns and previously represented the constituency, but lost his seat during the Labour rout four years ago. Former lord mayor of Dublin Christy Burke, an Independent, has run unsuccessfully for election in Dublin Central over several general elections, although he polled better than both Gannon and Costello on the first count in 2016. The Green Party’s Neasa Hourigan would need to massively improve on the party’s performance last time out if she was to become its first TD for the area.

The survey was conducted face to face among 1,200 adults at 120 locations in every constituency. The accuracy level is estimated at plus or minus 2.8 per cent.Excluding undecided voters and those unlikely to vote, 25 per cent of respondents said they would vote for Fianna Fáil (no change), 23 per cent for Fine Gael (down six), 21 per cent for Sinn Féin (up seven), 5 per cent for Labour (down one), 8 per cent for the Green Party (no change) and 18 per cent for Independents and small parties (no change). The comparison is with the most recent Ipsos MRBI poll last October.Margin of errorAmong the Independents and smaller parties, the breakdown shows a number of groups all within the margin of error of each other.Solidarity-People Before Profit are at 2 per cent (up one), the Social Democrats are at 2 per cent (up one), Independents4Change are at 1 per cent (down one), the Independent Alliance are at less than 1 per cent (no change), non-party Independents are on 10 per cent (no change) and other groups and parties are on 3 per cent (up one).While Fine Gael will be relieved to be only marginally behind Fianna Fáil after a difficult opening week to the campaign (and a poll over the weekend showing a 12-point lead for Fianna Fáil), there are other danger signs for Taoiseach Leo Varadkar in the numbers.The 23 per cent achieved by the party today is its lowest level of support since before the last election, and if repeated on election day would result in significant seat losses.In addition, satisfaction with the Government has dropped sharply from 42 per cent in October to 27 per cent today, while Mr Varadkar’s personal approval rating has plummeted from 51 per cent in October to 35 per cent today.Micheál Martin’s personal approval ratings have also fallen, from 38 per cent to 33 per cent, while Labour’s Brendan Howlin falls from 20 per cent to 17 per cent. Only Sinn Féin’s Mary Lou McDonald sees her personal rating rise, from 30 per cent to 34 per cent.Seven-point jumpAnd it is Sinn Féin that will be happiest with the findings of the poll, following a substantial seven-point jump in support since October. The recovery in Sinn Féin support comes in all regions but it is still at its weakest in Dublin, where it is in fourth place (at 14 per cent).However, Sinn Féin optimism will be tempered by the knowledge that the party has previously tended to underperform its opinion poll numbers when it comes to election day.The Green Party looks to be on course for seat gains on the numbers, and is particularly strong in Dublin, where it is in third place at 15 per cent. The Labour Party faces a fierce struggle to gain new seats.A fifth of voters (20 per cent) told the pollsters they were undecided. When they are included, the “core” vote of the parties is as follows: Fianna Fáil 20 per cent (no change) Fine Gael 18 per cent (down four) Sinn Féin 17 per cent (up five) Greens 6 per cent (no change) Labour 4 per cent (down one) and Independentsothers 15 per cent (no change).MethodologyThis survey in the Republic of Ireland was conducted exclusively on behalf of the  by Ipsos MRBI, among a national quota sample of 1,200 representative of the c.3.6m adults aged 18 upwards, covering 120 sampling points throughout all constituencies in the Republic of Ireland.Since February 2016, a question on voting importance has been included. All respondents are asked how much their vote counts on a scale from 1 to 10 where 1 means it “makes no difference” and 10 means it “makes all the difference”. Those answering 1 to this question are treated as non-voters and are excluded from our party preference calculation, along with those who don’t know how they will vote or say they will not vote.Extracts from the report may be quoted or published on condition that due acknowledgement is given to The  and Ipsos MRBI.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4146711.1579615900!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"seven stats and charts to ponder from today s irish times ipsos mrbi poll","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Farmers protest: Kevin Smith from Co Cavan outside Government Buildings last week. Have the farmers abandoned Fine Gael for Fianna Fáil?  Photograph Nick BradshawA fifth of voters are undecidedThe numbers show that undecideds are at 20 per cent. Remember that the headline figures from the poll exclude the voters who said they are as yet undecided about who to vote for. Because you can’t vote for “don’t know”, the figures for each party are then calculated from those who express a voting preference. So this is a chunk of voters who could have a decisive impact on the election. Beware though: pollsters say that even though people will change their minds, those who will actually vote tend to express a preference when asked. In other words: don’t knows don’t vote.Independents are likely to lose seatsBig national polls are not the best vehicle for measuring small party and independent support, because they depend on strong support in inidual constituencies for high-profile candidates. However, taken as an aggregate, it’s clear that the umbrella group of “Independentsothers” is on course to lose seats. At the last election, the group got a whopping 30 per cent of the vote, including the Green Party.But strip out the Green Party’s 8 per cent today and they are on 18 per cent, ided between the small parties of the radical left, Independents of various stripes, the Social Democrats and Peadar Tóibín’s Aontú. But some of these – including Shane Ross’s Independent Alliance – come in at less than 1 per cent. Taken together, it seems inevitable that there will be fewer TDs elected from this political archipelago. \u0026nbspFianna Fáil’s grey voteFianna Fáil is also strong among older voters. Among those aged 65 and over, Fianna Fáil is at 40 per cent, compared with\u0026nbspFine Gael’s 25 per cent. Older voters tend to be more reliable at turning out on the day than their grandchildren, so these voters are extremely valuable. It also explains why the parties are scrambling to make promises about the pension age.Where is the Green tsunami?The Greens are doing well – on 8 per cent – but the party will need to do better to make a big breakthrough. The regional breakdowns show the Green Party in 15 per cent in Dublin, which should make the party competitive in most Dublin constituencies and should net them several seats. But it is not yet the sort of massive wave of support that some anticipated. If the party manages to push that figure up by a few points, though, it will be winning seats in nearly all the Dublin constituencies and the commuter counties too. That would probably make it essential to constructing the next government. But it’s not there yet.Fine Gael is stronger with better-off votersIt’s not all doom and gloom for Fine Gael. For a start, the party is doing better than a Sunday Times poll suggested at the weekend. At 23 per cent in Dublin and 22 per cent in the Rest of Leinster, the party is still on top in crucial areas. It is also strongest among\u0026nbspABC1 voters, who are most likely to turn out on the election day.Sinn Féin’s remarkable recoverySinn Féin’s jump back into the 20s is remarkable – but it brings the party back to the sort of territory where it has been since the last election. The average support for the party in that series of polls is 19.14 per cent. At 14 per cent in Dublin, though, the party still lags in what was one of its strongholds – suggesting perhaps that further gains are possible. Against this, however, must be set Sinn Féin’s habit of underperforming opinion polls on election day – a fact of our electoral politics likely rooted in lower turnout among working class and younger voters. Those are the very areas where Sinn Féin is strongest.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4145269.1579516519!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit eu citizens want physical card to prove right to stay in uk","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA report found nine out of 10 EU citizens in the UK would prefer a card over digital evidence  of their rights. File photograph: Will OlivierEPAThe British government is facing fresh calls to issue EU citizens with a physical document to prove they have the right to stay in the country after Brexit.A report found nine out of 10 EU citizens in the UK would prefer a card over the digital evidence they have now to demonstrate their rights in future to employers, banks or landlords.Fears over discrimination, loss of identity and a continuing lack of trust in the government’s willingness to deliver guaranteed lifetime rights emerged as serious concerns in the research – the biggest survey of EU, European Economic Area (EEA) and Swiss citizens in the UK to date.Tanja Bueltmann, a professor at Northumbria University who designed and conducted the poll along with the campaign group the3million, said: “The survey documents, without question, we have an ‘unsettling status’.“This extends beyond the application process, revealing an erosion of trust an erosion of wellbeing and an erosion of the sense of belonging among survey respondents.“The government has a duty to finally give EUEEA and Swiss citizens certainty. Hollow words are not enough.”The findings came just days after the government gave the European parliament’s Brexit co-ordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, reassurances that EU citizens would not be automatically deported if they failed to apply for the settled status scheme.The survey, published on Monday, found that nine in 10 of those polled were unhappy about the lack of a physical document to demonstrate their right to remain in the country after they had been granted settled status or pre-settled status.As many as 11 per cent said they had already been asked for settled status proof, even though this is not legally required.This echoes a warning by private landlords that tenants could face discrimination because of the lack of a physical document.On the plus side, many of those surveyed reported a positive experience of the settled status app, with a majority of respondents saying the application process worked well.As many as 97.1 per cent of the 3,171 valid responses to the survey said they had received the status decision they expected.However, the emotional response to having to apply and the consequences of being labelled as someone with “settled status” was largely adverse. The words most frequently used by respondents to describe their feelings were “angry”, “anxious” and “unwanted”.Even those who had already been granted settled status felt worse off, with 80 per cent either strongly agreeing or agreeing that they felt anxious.Eight out of 10 said the process made them stressed and many thought citizenship was far more secure.Maike Bohn, co-founder of the3million, said the report underlined the lack of trust after three years of mixed messages.“Are we the much-quoted ‘neighbours, colleagues, friends’ or are we the ‘queue jumpers, benefits scroungers, unwelcome guests, draining the NHS’?“The government needs to step up local outreach and support, both to EUEEA and Swiss citizens but also to employers, landlords and others who will be forced to check the immigration status of these citizens in order to avoid huge fines.”The British Home Office said the scheme was working and a digital solution was better than a physical document. “This digital status future-proofs their rights and is linked to their passport or ID card, replacing physical documents which can get lost, stolen, damaged, tampered with and expire,” it said.–Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

His celebrity crush is Lily James.Meanwhile, the show has been sponsored by fast fashion brands (Missguided and then I Saw it First) for the last three years, giving viewers the opportunity to shop the female Islanders’ looks directly. Personally, I’ve always thought that Love Island contestants dress terribly: it’s Benidorm beaches meets Kardashian kitsch. But with prices starting at £5, the clothes are devastatingly cheap. Far cheaper than the designer garb we see on most TV stars. So I can understand the appeal. But I also know that every time someone buys one of those bikinis, or sparkly bodycon dresses, they’re adding fuel to fast fashion’s ever-blazing fire.But perhaps the onus is not on the consumer, or even the Love Island star. Lauren Bravo, author of How to Break Up with Fast Fashion, explains that the brands are the ones who should really be shouldering responsibility here. “These days we’re so used to instant gratification, and the idea that anyone can aspire to celebrity, that it seems reasonable for TV stars to sell us clothes and vice versa,” she tells me. “And it’s really hard, because I know what it’s like to love fashion and crave the clothes you’re seeing on people you admire, not to mention the huge social pressures on young people to keep that endless parade of new looks rolling over on their Instagram grid, so telling people who can’t necessarily afford to spend any more that their shopping habits are destroying the planet can feel snobbish and unfair.”Why I\u0027m giving up fast fashion #20PledgesBut, Bravo adds, the fact remains that those clothes simply cannot be made as cheaply as they’re sold. Somewhere down the line, someone is paying the price, whether it’s a garment worker barely surviving on poverty wages or a community grappling with industrial pollution.That’s not to say you can’t “get the Islander look” in a sustainable and eco-friendly way. Bravo suggests heading to secondhand shopping apps, like Depop, where you’ll find plenty of pre-loved items not dissimilar from the ones you see on the show. Some of them will be from fast fashion brands, but if you’re buying it there, you’re keeping that item in circulation as opposed to letting it wind up in landfill.\u0026nbspOr, you could take a closer look at some of the trends championed by Love Islanders, both past and present, and see that many (cycling shorts, mesh, high-waisted jeans and leopard print) hark back to another era, like, say, the 1990s. And what better way to shop Nineties fashion than by heading to your local Beyond Retro or Rokit, which will be jam-packed with original clothing from the decade that is not only more sustainable, but a hell of a lot cooler, too.How to Break Up with Fast Fashion by Lauren Bravo (£12.99, Headline Home) is out nowOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There are now record gaps in trust levels between these two groups in eight countries.Edelman said that businesses had a key role to play in restoring trust in the economic system. While business as a whole was deemed “competent” by a majority of those polled, it received a negative rating for ethical behaviour such as acting to halt climate change.“Climate issues are among the most important, and business leaders can no longer brush aside consumer concerns as brands can be quickly tarnished if they are deemed to be unethical,” Edelman said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

House of FraserHomebase has recently dropped the Bunnings association from its stores“The company is currently engaged in constructive discussions with both shareholders and potential new investors on the proposed equity raise.”An equity raise involves issuing new shares to raise extra cash – but this tends to push the current share price down, which could upset current investors.Matthew Roberts, Intu chief executive, said: “We are making good progress with fixing the balance sheet, our number one priority, and are confident we have the right strategy in place to enable us to prosper as we see continued polarisation between the best destinations and the rest.”He added that footfall to Intu’s UK centres was flat during the Christmas period compared with a year earlier – which was ahead of falls across the market more broadly.Around 95 per cent of space was occupied by tenants, with 97 per cent of rent collected for the first quarter of 2020, Intu said.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Intu banked €237.7m (£202m) from the deal as a part owner.The amount Intu hopes to raise from shareholders remains unclear, although reports in the Sunday Times put the figure at up to £1bn.Intu shareholder and billionaire businessman John Whittaker, who has a 27 per cent stake, is said to be in favour of the plan, according to the newspaper.Commercial property owners, particularly in retail, have suffered in recent years as several big name brands either went into administration or pushed through an insolvency process known as a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) to reduce rents.In November last year, Intu already warned that rental income in 2019 is likely to fall by 9 per cent, with more than half the decline coming from Arcadia and Monsoon using CVAs.Bosses said rent in 2020 is also expected to drop, but at a slower rate than 2019, and added that the political and economic uncertainty is putting off current tenants from signing up to new lettings.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailFears about the impact of automation, lack of training, immigration and insecure work are all eroding trust, as well as fake news and corruption, Edelman said.Distrust is being driven by a growing sense that capitalism in its present guise is unfair\u0026nbspand that institutions increasingly serve the interests of a narrow elite over everyone else.Governments have taken a bigger hit to their reputations than businesses, the media or NGOs, with a failure to tackle inequality the most important driving factor.Just 30 per cent of the general population said the government serves the interests of everyone compared with 57 per cent who said it serves only the few.Raise taxes on the rich to tackle inequality, IMF saysDeep-seated fears about the future have helped to foment growing cynicism about the economic system, according to the research.More than four in five respondents say they fear losing their jobs, citing concerns including\u0026nbspthe gig economy, a looming recession,\u0026nbsplack of skills, cheaper foreign competitors, immigrants who will work for less, automation\u0026nbspor jobs being moved to other countries.This toxic set of concerns has been blamed for the rise of populist, anti-establishment politicians and anti-immigration rhetoric in several countries.The survey found wealthier, more highly educated groups were significantly more trusting of institutions than the rest of the population. There are now record gaps in trust levels between these two groups in eight countries.Edelman said that businesses had a key role to play in restoring trust in the economic system. While business as a whole was deemed “competent” by a majority of those polled, it received a negative rating for ethical behaviour such as acting to halt climate change.“Climate issues are among the most important, and business leaders can no longer brush aside consumer concerns as brands can be quickly tarnished if they are deemed to be unethical,” Edelman said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Intu banked €237.7m (£202m) from the deal as a part owner.The amount Intu hopes to raise from shareholders remains unclear, although reports in the Sunday Times put the figure at up to £1bn.Intu shareholder and billionaire businessman John Whittaker, who has a 27 per cent stake, is said to be in favour of the plan, according to the newspaper.Commercial property owners, particularly in retail, have suffered in recent years as several big name brands either went into administration or pushed through an insolvency process known as a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) to reduce rents.In November last year, Intu already warned that rental income in 2019 is likely to fall by 9 per cent, with more than half the decline coming from Arcadia and Monsoon using CVAs.Bosses said rent in 2020 is also expected to drop, but at a slower rate than 2019, and added that the political and economic uncertainty is putting off current tenants from signing up to new lettings.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Some have suggested that the new phones could more closely resemble the iPhone 4.But a new report suggests that the new models will look largely similar, retaining the rounded rectangles of the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro. The only obvious way of telling the difference will be new camera technology, the report from\u0026nbspMacotakara claimed, citing sources in the supply chain.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe report contradicts a previous suggestion from reliable Apple analyst Ming-chi\u0026nbspKuo, who has said that sources in the supply chain had indicated that the new phones could have more square bodies, in line with the old iPhone 4.It will change size from the existing iPhones, the new report claimed.

Rather than two differently sized expensive models and a cheaper one in the middle, Apple is expected to release four different models, though in three different sizes.All of the phones are expected to include LED displays, which will come in three different sizes: 5.4 inches, 6.1 inches and 6.7 inches. But there will be two versions of the middle-sized phone, with one more premium than the other, reports have suggested.That model, as well as the bigger iPhone, will include new camera technology that will allow the phone to sense depth, according to rumours. That will help with Apple\u0027s plans to introduce more augmented reality technology, by allowing the phone to sense the 3D makeup of a room.The company is also rumoured to be preparing a successor to the cheaper iPhone SE – tentatively referred to as the iPhone 9 – which will borrow the design language from older iPhones but include newer components.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

His addition to the lineup – his latest of several major festival performances – is likely to fuel speculation that he will headline this year’s Glastonbury.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.The 50 best albums of 2019 Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The debut solo album of the art-punk pioneer was never going to be predictable, easy-listening. No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto. The follow-up to 2014’s LP1 is the sound of a woman teetering on the brink of collapse, gathering herself, and then erupting into a kind of defiance. (AP)2150 30) Bill Callahan – Shepherd in a Sheepskin VestBill Callahan returns after six years with this homely, career-best album in which he sings of his own contentment. “The panic room is now a nursery,” he observes on “Son of the Sea”. Death still looms – often in the form of a black dog that follows Callahan around various tracks – but its inevitability seems more of a comfort than something to be feared: “Everybody must walk the lonesome valley,” he sings firmly. “Yeah, they must walk it by themselves.” (RO)Arriving three years after the release of her debut, Nothing’s Real, Shura’s excellent second record is camp and theatrical, pivoting between a big, poppy sensibility and a minimalist, lo-fi one – sometimes on the same track. Lead single “Religion (U Can Lay Your Hands On Me)” is a slinky shoulder roll of a song, laden with passionate blasphemy: “I wanna consecrate your body, turn the water to wine, I know you’re thinking about kissing, too.” It’s laced, too, with piano – an instrument she’d always been “allergic to” before this record – and opulent orchestral strings. (AP)2350 28) Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date. Single “Ready to let Go” is by far the most explicit – a moody swamp-rock jam where Shultz comes to terms with his impending orce. He bares his soul on Social Cues, and apparently shakes off a few demons in the process. (RO)Howard listened to Brazilian artist Jorge Ben – “where there’s literally, like, 18 different things happening in the song” – while she was making the album, and it shows. “13th Century Metal” builds like an alarm, while “Baby” is scatty and scattered, like something off The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Sometimes, there is one instrument too many, but usually the components crash together well. (AP)Written during her recent pregnancy and the birth of her first child, Remind Me Tomorrow shows Van Etten dimming her spotlight on toxicity and instead casting a warm glow behind the record’s psychic overview. As well as expectations of confessional singers, she subverts folk music’s focus on bare-bones songwriting. But the daintiest composition “Stay” is her most perfectly realised yet, over music box chimes and heel-clicking percussion she coos: “You won’t let me go astray You will let me find my way.” After years of making peace with drift and uncertainty, she’s never sounded more sure of anything. (JM)Inspired by the improvisations he was creating while on tour with The xx in 2017, Sam Shepherd found himself making “some of the most obtuse and aggressive music I’ve ever made”. This newfound drive can be heard in singles such as “LesAlpx”, a mind-melting track that climbs breathlessly towards its summit with a pounding bass beat and high, whistling chirps that punctuate the tension. It’s an insight into his brilliant mind and – such is the sheer variety of the album – a way to inspire one’s own imagination. (RO)2750 24) Stormzy – Heavy is the HeadThere are three themes that run through the record: his defiance in the face of doubt the pressure of high expectations and his efforts to lift others up as his success continues to grow. He reminds himself constantly of who he is beneath the gloss that fame has brought: he’s “Rachael’s Little Brother”, “Big Michael”, a guy who likes to watch Avengers and Game of Thrones. All of his best traits are present and correct: sincerity, a smooth flow and forensic-like analysis of societal ills, laced with pathos and humour. The lasting impression is of an artist whose only way is up. (RO)A blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals. Songs such as “All Night” are so candidly carnal it feels inappropriate to listen to them in public notes of riot grrrl, pop and rock come together throughout the record to create something that is, at times, quite striking. (AP)2950 22) Solange – When I Get HomeThe decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)For her fifth studio album, Cate Le Bon went to live in a secluded cottage in the Lake District, where she sang to an empty house and took lessons in wood-carving. Yet her compositions on Reward are lush, warm and whimsical opener “Miami” is resplendent with stately horns and percussion that reminds you of childhood. There’s a fantastic sense of space, too, spun from diaphanous arrangements such as “The Light”, where she meanders delightfully from a clear, lilting call to a deep vocal rumble. It’s an album by an artist intent on readdressing her relationship with her own existence. (RO)Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (RO)Swift’s sixth album Reputation was camp and melodramatic, killing off “the old Taylor” and waging war on anyone and everyone who dared to criticise her. It was sincerity veiled as self-parody, insecurity veiled as breeziness – and all the better for that uneasy paradox. But Lover, her new, seventh album, feels like a partial resurrection of the Swift of old: moony romance and earnest earworms abound. It’s the sound of a singer excited to be earnest again. Taylor Swift is dead. Long live Taylor Swift. (AP)The record is an introspective mix of psychey soul, blues, rock and funk, which skips and strolls and swaggers through its 13 tracks – but it is not simply an exercise in nostalgia. Its influences  decades Gil Scott-Heron, Fela Kuti, Kendrick Lamar and Bobby Womack are all recalled. “I’m not going to have an alter ego, or becomes Sasha Fierce or Ziggy Stardust,” says Kiwanuka. “I can just be Michael Kiwanuka.” With an album this good, it’s hard to argue with that. (AP)On his sixth album, Kano’s powers of observation are at their peak. Home has always been at the heart of his music, so he maintains the close-quarters perspective of his 2005 debut Home Sweet Home the swaggering confidence of that record, though, is replaced by a more thoughtful gravitas. He’s an elder statesman of grime, and you can almost see his furrowed brow and shake of his head on “Trouble”, while the frenetic “Class of Deja”, starring fellow veterans D Double E and Ghetts, reminds the listener how he lit the path for future generations. (RO)3550 16) Hot Chip – A Bath Full of EcstasyLyrically, the band offer up some of their most poignant phrases to date on this – their seventh and best record. Second single “Hungry Child”, a trance-y floor-filler, contains the plaintive, “Dreaming never felt so bad Lonely never felt so wrong before” while, over the shuffling beats of “Echo”, Alexis Taylor sings of leaving your regrets behind while seeming to understand the effort required to achieve this. For all its glimmering synths and the robotic pathos of Taylor’s idiosyncratic vocals, this is a record with both heart and soul. (RO)3650 15) MUNA – Saves the WorldSaves the World should see MUNA joining the ranks of those who have brazenly borrowed their sound. Lead single “Number One Fan” banishes intrusive thoughts – “Nobody likes me and I’m gonna die” – just in time for a lavish, self-celebratory chorus, one part earnest, one part tongue-in-cheek. Elsewhere, they are downright defeatist, laments the inevitable pull back to a recent ex (“Stayaway”) or reflecting on a lover’s similarity to an adulterous father (“Taken”). “Hands Off”, meanwhile, toys with temptation before slamming the door shut. It is fierce and forthright. (AP)Fans have already drawn comparisons between We Are Not Your Kind and Slipknot’s seminal 2001 album Iowa. While the latter was even heavier (it would be difficult if not impossible to outdo), the sheer ambition on We Are Not Your Kind is just as staggering. If anything, the dynamic created by placing a bigger emphasis on melody allows you to consider everything without being engulfed by noise. Critics may question how relevant Slipknot are in 2019. The pummelling force of We Are Not Your Kind should be enough to silence them – this may be one of the band’s most personal records, but the rage they capture is universally felt. (RO)Each song is titled after a black woman Rapsody admires: Serena Williams, Sojourner Truth, Maya Angelou, Aaliyah, Oprah Winfrey… and for each one she explores these women’s traits, successes and strife. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as “Afeni”, are pure soul. Nina Simone said an artist’s duty, “as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times”. This is precisely what Rapsody has done, in the most resonant way possible. (RO)There’s a deeper sense of personal connection to anchor Julia Jacklin’s lyrical and melodic smarts. That snare drum on “Pressure to Party” keeps a relentless, nerve-snapping pulse throughout, while “Don’t Know How to Keep Loving You” nails a depth of intimacy while acknowledging relationship ennui. Grunge-rinsed, feminist-flipped, upcycled Fifties guitar an’ all: Crushing is a triumph. (HB)Philippakis’s voice is shrouded in the smoke from society’s wreckage. Lead single “Exits”, six scintillating minutes of Eighties “sledgehammer” pop that lumbers into view like a heavy artillery vehicle covered in sequins, concerns the one percenters building underground cities to escape global warming. “Syrups” has Yannis howling a passionate post-apocalyptic vision of robot invasions and sand-clogged towns over a corroded Gorillaz dub that builds to a motoric charge as global panic sets in. An inspired album of scorched earth music. (MB)A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity. On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album. (RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both. (AP)When Aldous Harding performed in London this month, an enamoured fan cried out that they loved her. “I appreciate that,” she replied softly. “But, I’m busy.” The response is Harding to a T – wry, weird, introspective, focused. Her spectacular, singular third album, Designer, is all of those things. Taking the left-field folk that made her name and splashing post-psych pop and jittery orchestral flourishes onto the canvas, the New Zealander harbours secrets while beckoning you in. The debut solo album of the art-punk pioneer was never going to be predictable, easy-listening. No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto. The follow-up to 2014’s LP1 is the sound of a woman teetering on the brink of collapse, gathering herself, and then erupting into a kind of defiance. (AP)2150 30) Bill Callahan – Shepherd in a Sheepskin VestBill Callahan returns after six years with this homely, career-best album in which he sings of his own contentment. “The panic room is now a nursery,” he observes on “Son of the Sea”. Death still looms – often in the form of a black dog that follows Callahan around various tracks – but its inevitability seems more of a comfort than something to be feared: “Everybody must walk the lonesome valley,” he sings firmly. “Yeah, they must walk it by themselves.” (RO)Arriving three years after the release of her debut, Nothing’s Real, Shura’s excellent second record is camp and theatrical, pivoting between a big, poppy sensibility and a minimalist, lo-fi one – sometimes on the same track. Lead single “Religion (U Can Lay Your Hands On Me)” is a slinky shoulder roll of a song, laden with passionate blasphemy: “I wanna consecrate your body, turn the water to wine, I know you’re thinking about kissing, too.” It’s laced, too, with piano – an instrument she’d always been “allergic to” before this record – and opulent orchestral strings. (AP)2350 28) Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date. Single “Ready to let Go” is by far the most explicit – a moody swamp-rock jam where Shultz comes to terms with his impending orce. He bares his soul on Social Cues, and apparently shakes off a few demons in the process. (RO)Howard listened to Brazilian artist Jorge Ben – “where there’s literally, like, 18 different things happening in the song” – while she was making the album, and it shows. “13th Century Metal” builds like an alarm, while “Baby” is scatty and scattered, like something off The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Sometimes, there is one instrument too many, but usually the components crash together well. (AP)Written during her recent pregnancy and the birth of her first child, Remind Me Tomorrow shows Van Etten dimming her spotlight on toxicity and instead casting a warm glow behind the record’s psychic overview. As well as expectations of confessional singers, she subverts folk music’s focus on bare-bones songwriting. But the daintiest composition “Stay” is her most perfectly realised yet, over music box chimes and heel-clicking percussion she coos: “You won’t let me go astray You will let me find my way.” After years of making peace with drift and uncertainty, she’s never sounded more sure of anything. (JM)Inspired by the improvisations he was creating while on tour with The xx in 2017, Sam Shepherd found himself making “some of the most obtuse and aggressive music I’ve ever made”. This newfound drive can be heard in singles such as “LesAlpx”, a mind-melting track that climbs breathlessly towards its summit with a pounding bass beat and high, whistling chirps that punctuate the tension. It’s an insight into his brilliant mind and – such is the sheer variety of the album – a way to inspire one’s own imagination. (RO)2750 24) Stormzy – Heavy is the HeadThere are three themes that run through the record: his defiance in the face of doubt the pressure of high expectations and his efforts to lift others up as his success continues to grow. He reminds himself constantly of who he is beneath the gloss that fame has brought: he’s “Rachael’s Little Brother”, “Big Michael”, a guy who likes to watch Avengers and Game of Thrones. All of his best traits are present and correct: sincerity, a smooth flow and forensic-like analysis of societal ills, laced with pathos and humour. The lasting impression is of an artist whose only way is up. (RO)A blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals. Songs such as “All Night” are so candidly carnal it feels inappropriate to listen to them in public notes of riot grrrl, pop and rock come together throughout the record to create something that is, at times, quite striking. (AP)2950 22) Solange – When I Get HomeThe decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)For her fifth studio album, Cate Le Bon went to live in a secluded cottage in the Lake District, where she sang to an empty house and took lessons in wood-carving. Yet her compositions on Reward are lush, warm and whimsical opener “Miami” is resplendent with stately horns and percussion that reminds you of childhood. There’s a fantastic sense of space, too, spun from diaphanous arrangements such as “The Light”, where she meanders delightfully from a clear, lilting call to a deep vocal rumble.

Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both. (AP)When Aldous Harding performed in London this month, an enamoured fan cried out that they loved her. “I appreciate that,” she replied softly. “But, I’m busy.” The response is Harding to a T – wry, weird, introspective, focused. Her spectacular, singular third album, Designer, is all of those things. Taking the left-field folk that made her name and splashing post-psych pop and jittery orchestral flourishes onto the canvas, the New Zealander harbours secrets while beckoning you in.

The varied landscapes and lives of residents wedged in these borderlands speak of two different systems that have coexisted on one another’s doorstep.Far from the marches and salvos of tear gas and petrol bombs over the past half-year of anti-government protests that have convulsed Hong Kong, the residents in this border realm have borne witness to both rapid urbanisation, as China booms, and the preservation of a slower pace of life.About 20 miles\u0026nbsplong, this boundary meanders between fish ponds, farmland, sleepy traditional villages and grassy hills on the Hong Kong side, with the gleaming skyscrapers of China’s high-tech city of Shenzhen on the other. Shenzhen, once itself the bucolic backwater, has risen into China’s giddy vision of a digital, high-tech future.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHong Kong is world’s most visited city in 2019We may have won the elections battle, but the war is ongoingHong Kong police ‘hack into more than 3,700 mobile phones’Mr\u0026nbspLam, now in his eighties, lives in a house without mobile phone reception, where he farms and catches crabs. A narrow sliver of water separates him from mainland China. He recalls living in a wooden cabin along the Shenzhen River\u0026nbspwith his family 70 years ago. There were only “old and broken” sheds on the far shore back then, he says, gazing into the distance. “Of course, the mainland is much more advanced than before. Everything is good, even the streets are beautiful.”Over past decades of political upheaval in communist China, waves of mainlanders flooded across the border into Hong Kong, seeking peace and a better life. Lam still remembers the flashlights of the British-run police piercing the dark as they chased illegal immigrants making a dash for freedom.Andrew Kwok, an old fish farmer living in the area, recalls those who drowned making the perilous crossing. “There were a lot of them, hundreds of dead bodies in the river,” he says.The flickering, lonely torches have now been replaced by a vibrant mega-city with a million flashing lights. The living quality for people on both sides may have converged, but a gulf remains. For these two peoples, it remains a struggle to reconcile shifting eras, values and dreams.Merrin Ke, 23, grew up in Shenzhen but got her masters degree from Hong Kong’s Polytechnic University. She had flitted easily between both sides, up until recently, when she moved to Shanghai. “I think the situation in Hong Kong is quite sensitive now, which is easy for people to have conflicts due to different political stands,” she says. “That’s why I’ve decided to leave Hong Kong to work and get away from the intense environment.”Even though the protests in Hong Kong show no sign of abating, Ke remains optimistic unity will overcome ision. She says: “Hong Kong people used to come to have fun in Shenzhen and people from mainland China also liked to visit Hong Kong. But now such things are becoming less and less. I still hope everyone can put differences aside, and it’s not enough for just one side to do this. It requires the joint efforts of both sides.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s incredible.“Me and my we are so happy he was found safe and well and we remain very grateful to the police and members of public who gave up their time to help search for him.”Umair, , from Nottingham., who runs a used car dealership, said: “The picture I am sharing shows how well and happy my son looks.He doesn’t want to talk about the incident, he just wants to forget it and we’re letting him forget it and not pushing him. He was not frightened, he was very brave.”The delighted dad previously told how he kept praying that his son Aadil would be found safe and well after he went missing .The frantic dad told The Sun Online: I had every faith that the police would find him. My faith helped me through a very dficult time.He told the BBC: Police told me he was sleeping when they found him.He said that his we, who had stayed at home with their younger son, had feared the worst but he “never gave up hope.”After being spotted by a helicopter nine hours later, the little lad, who only had a jumper to keep him warm, was reunited with his dad.More than , members of the public helped in the search for the schoolboy.Umair, , speaking exclusively to The Sun Online from his home in Nottingham said: “My boy was thankfully found safe.That’s all that matters. I never stopped hoping and police kept reassuring me they’d find him.He has no idea about all the fuss surrounding him.He had been wandering up and down the side of the motorway after going to the toilet and when he came out he couldn’t find the coach and he got lost from the rest group.Umair told how the horror unfolded when he got a call from the police saying his son was missing.The pupil at a school in Nottingham had been on a coach trip to London to visit some off the sights and a museum.The group stopped for a break at Newport Pagnell Service Station near Milton Keynes, Bucks, before continuing with their -mile journey north to Nottingham.Umair said: “You hear of children going missing and never being found after many years like the girl Madeleine McCann.But with my son we knew he couldn’t have gone far and was hopefully still somewhere nearby.“At the time you don’t really know but I couldn’t let silly thoughts get inside my head.I had to stay strong and hopeful. He hadnt been snatched by anyone, he had wandered off and got lost.Thankfully he didn’t get onto the M, he remained at the side of the motorway.”Umair said that his relatives and close friends were relieved to hear the good news of the six-year-olds .Aadil, however, was busy playing with his brother before being told by his parents to “get some sleep.”He said: “I cannot thank the police and local community enough. They are lesavers.They were excellent. My boy is fine, he is comfortable.”His we added: “Our child is safe, we are blessed and so thankful to everyone who helped find him. It is such a relief.”Superintendent Amy Clements said this morning: This was a very dficult operation involving a very young boy and we are relieved to say that Aadil has been found safe and well.I’d like to take this opportunity to thank the local community, who immediately offered help in trying to find Aadil.Also Id like to thank those who have co-operated with Police during this time.This was a large operation in dficult conditions so Id like to also publicly thank the search and rescue teams who assisted in the search and the large number of officers involved, including the National Police Air Service which helped bring this positive resolution.We are so very glad that he has been found and are thankful to everyone involved in assisting with that.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But not necessarily £.million.So Harry is doing the right and ­honourable thing.The title HRH is an automatic one for someone with Royal blood.Even when Edward VIII abdicated he dropped from being His Majesty The King to HRH the Duke of Windsor.Diana, Princess of Wales and Sarah Ferguson lost theirs because their courtesy titles were obtained through marriage. They were not born royal. But what is also notable is that it won’t stop the Americans using the titlethey wish to.When Edward married Wallis ­Simpson she didn’t get an HRH yet she was still sometimes referred to in America as HRH.I’m not saying it will happen on this occasion but it is possible as it sits quite nicely with Duke and Duchess.Harry is not using his HRH  because it would be a conflict of interest should he decide to embark on ­commercial enterprises.Harry knows full well that it is wrong to trade on your name.I don’t think not using it will have an impact. It didn’t affect Diana’s global appeal one bit. And Fergie had less of a profile but still made money.The Queen is pragmatic. She will be sad, too. She is very sensitive to Harry and his needs. She was there for him and William when their mother was killed in the car crash.She understands and she wants the best for her grandson, his we and her great-grandson.She has come to an accord that works for both sides and that is what is important to her.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If anything, our scoop simply sped up the process.Royal commentators trumpeting Saturday night’s declaration as a total victory for the Queen are somewhat missing the point – Harry and Meghan are DELIGHTED with this result too.With a few marked concessionsthey’ve got exactly what they wanted: The ability to make millions and millions without royal oversight, to spend as much time as they want in Hollywood and to avoid any duty in the UK.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes. For further details of our complaints policy and to make a complaint please click here."},{"url":null,"title":"samantha markle meghan harry never find happiness","story":"With this historic institution close to collapse, we have to ask whether peace can really be found.The statements from Buckingham Palace and the Queen showed the Royal Family want to repair the damage.There is no doubt that the decision of Prince Harry and Meghan to quit their duties so soon after their fairytale wedding has done great harm.It would have been betterdiscord had never been sown.Meghan knew the social requirements of joining the Royal Family. She should have asked herselfshe was willing and able to behave in accordance with the expectations.Her Majesty’s words show great diplomacy but Meghan’s behaviour has so far not been diplomatic. A diplomat wouldn’t fall out with her own family.Her friends leaked negative comments about the “toxic” Royal Family. She also allowed damage to be done against our family via friends and PR advisers.She watched the media taunt and torture my dad, never springing to his defence like a true humanitarian would.Thomas was an incredible dad. He paid every penny of her education and cared greatly for her.He is now frail, with a heart condition. He doesn’t have a PR team to spin him a good story.The Queen, at , shouldn’t have had to face the stress of seeing her family torn apart.Meghan hasn’t stepped forward to minimise the damage.She knows how Harry leaving has affected them, but she hasn’t spoken up in their defence.Yet in her statement, the Queen says she is “particularly proud of how Meghan has so quickly become one of the family”.Her Majesty is building bridges there. It would be goodMeghan could do the same.She could have expressed her thanks for the kindness of the Queen and Prince Charles.She could have expressed gratitude to her own father or her first husband, Trevor, who gave her career opportunities.My sister has become a totally dferent person, choosing wealth and fortune over family.Her decision to leave is nothing to do with the behaviour of the royals, or race.Her marriage to Prince Harry was so symbolic of ethnic unity.The preacher and choir were all of African heritage. It was a lovely joining together.The royals embraced that. They welcomed Meghan into their lives, into the culture, and allowed her to promote people of all races. I have never heard anything racist coming out of the Windsors about my sister.Supporters who claim a racist element forced Meghan out are frustrated their hoped-for fairytale princess didn’t work out.These social equality-obsessed people had pinned their hopes on Meghan. They hoped for an equality of race right at the higher echelons of society.At least Harry and Meghan were right to decide tothe £.million they received to renovate Frogmore Cottage and not take any more public funds.In the Queen’s statement, she hopes Meghan and Harry can “start building a happy and peaceful le”. We have to hope for the sake of my sister and for the Royal Family that this agreement achieves that aim.My fear is Meghan’s decision isn’t about moving to Canada for a quiet le as a young mother.Nothing about their actions so far suggest they truly desire a private le out the limelight.They have paraded themselves on the red carpet, tried to make deals with Disney, and become pals with the Clooneys and other A-list stars.Smooching up to Vogue magazine, to fashion and to the film industry is not consistent with taking a step back.Their objective is fame and fortune — to be Hollywood.Meghan’s goals are not consistent with those of the Royal Family. Personally, I don’t believe she ever expected to fit in with the strict structures and traditions of the Windsor household.Even after marrying she kept her lawyer and publicity adviser, suggesting she wasn’t willing to sever her ties with her old le.Perhaps she always had the idea toto her le as an actress and lestyle influencer.In the statement from Buckingham Palace, it says “the Sussexes have made clear everything they do will continue to uphold the values of Her Majesty”.My concern is that this is a face-saving statement, which won’t work in reality. The Royal Family has always been opposed to merchandising and corporate endeavours outside of them.If Meghan and Harry want to honour the Queen, they will consult her before doing deals.She thinks she can be at the top of the world, but using the royals to get that international notoriety is tacky.Meghan was a cable TV actress before marrying Harry and would not be on the front of every newspaper and magazine without him.In the US, the Press is still positive, praising her attempts to modernise the British monarchy and saying how cool she is.The media in Calornia and New York are likely to remain in her corner but I don’t think Meghan and Harry will ever be able to overshadow Prince William and his we Catherine.They are exemplary they are iconic. There is no comparison.It is clear Meghan cares for Archie, but I do worry about his future. There doesn’t seem to have been a lot of consideration given to his cousins George, Charlotte and Louis and how often he will see them. Harry has put Meghan above his brother, father and grandmother. A house ided cannot stand.I am worried that Meghan and Harry will never find true ­happiness. They could not find contentment with the Royal Family, will they be able to find it away from them Maybe they will meet up with counsellors who can help them to heal the wounds.Perhaps they will make amends by apologising.We need sincerity and dignity from Meghan in order to find peace. Then, perhaps, she will have the peace she needs to go forward.I loved my sister, but I do not like the person she has become.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We like — we love — our Queen here in Britain.But we are not prepared to pay the way for her multi-millionaire grandson — £million inheritance from his mum and £million from the Queen Mum —he no longer wishes to be a full-time royal.There is no royal halfway house — no one foot in, one foot out — as Her Majesty has rightly agreed.So yes, we want back the £.million we spent on the renovations of a “cottage” which he will seldom live in. So far, so good.But there are problems with this deal, some of which may well come back to bite Buckingham ­Palace and its push for a “hard Megxit”.Harry, a -year-old married father, is still taking money from his dad’s Duchy of Cornwall estate, despite his stated desire to live a financially independent le. This turbo-charged pocket money amounts to over £million a year at present.Traditionally, the sons of the heirs to the throne rely on the Duchy to fund their lives while they go about their royal duties, but without those duties Harry no longer needs to rely on the Bank of Dad.If the Prince of Wales chooses to fund his son and Meghan, it is his choice. But he will only do it in an attempt to maintain some necessary control over their expenditure. This is problematic for free-spirited Harry — and Charles, who will almost certainly not approve of everything this money is spent on.Sure, Harry and Meghan can make millions of dollars by lending their names to commercial ventures. But the Buckingham Palace statement says: “The Sussexes have made clear everything they do will continue to uphold the values of Her Majesty.” What an alarmingly vague and woolly line.We can take a stab at what these values are — ask any good Christian. But how do they relate to commercial deals with huge American corporations For example, Harry has been touting Meghan for voiceover work with Disney.But which characters are brand-safe  Presumably Cruella de Vil is off limits And what about interviews  A big- money sit-down with a US network — their pal Oprah Winfrey would surely be first in line — would net a huge fee. But what can they say and still uphold the Queen’s values The world is interested in Meghan and Harry’s touchy-feely philanthropic endeavours, but what they really want is the juice. What’s it really like in the Royal Family  How they approach this is crucial.Arguably, they should never discuss the “family” on TV — the Queen does not. If they write books, it should not be about their personal experiences within the “family”. And any products from their brand should be unrelated to the Royal Family.If their money-making ventures are focused on the charities they support, they will be fine. Their new foundation could make them millions but while doing so make millions for their charities, too. This is how they could get away with it. But will this be enough for the ambitious Meghan  I somehow doubt it.However nice Her Majesty appears to be, she has given up her le and much of her personal happiness to do her duty and it is a new world for her to see her grandson no longer feels capable of doing the same — albeit in a much smaller way — himself.While incredibly astute, the deal is not what the Queen wanted. She would have preferred to keep them within the royal fold, but she does not want another Diana disaster. Diana knew the system was not hers to change, and it is not Harry and Meghan’s either. It belongs to the Queen.She tried to accommodate Diana within it. What the Queen could not do was to restructure the monarchy to suit her daughter-in-law. As she now can’t reconstruct the monarchy for her grandson and his we. So, she has asked them to step away.The last thing the Queen wanted was for it to look asthe Duke and Duchess of Sussex had been thrown out of the royal fold. Archie Mountbatten Windsor is her and Prince Philip’s eighth great-grandchild. His future is important to them as it might also embody a small part of the future of a modern monarchy. But how much of a royal this soon-to-be largely Canadian-bred lad will ever be remains to be seen. Not much, is the best bet.The Sussexes have what they want. They don’t want to be criticised for taking monies from the British taxpayer. They don’t want to be seen as taking advantage of the Queen’s kindness. And whatever other members of the Royal Family might think of them, and be disappointed by them, Harry is the son of the future King.So Her Majesty has accommodated them. It is now up to them to show their loyalty to her.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He warned the Left’s obsession is providing a cloak for crime.The Sussexes’ decision to quit was “not racism”, he told a cheering crowd. “We’re the most tolerant, lovely country in Europe.”Signicantly, the applause came not from the far Right but from right-on BBC Question Time — an audience carefully chosen, stressed presenter Fiona Bruce, to reflect Britain by age, sex and politics.Fox — famous as DS James Hathaway in TV’s Lewis — was instantly denounced as a “privileged white male” and therefore with no right to an opinion.“Oh, God!” he cried. “I can’t help what I am, I was born like this. It’s an immutable characteristic, so to call me a white privileged male is to be racist.”His landmark moment went viral.Ricky Gervais spoke for the silent majority when he told the Golden Globes nominees “who know nothing about the real world” to tear up their political speeches.But it took the furore over Megxit — and Fox’s unanswerable case for the defence — to trigger Britain’s own fightback.Fox has given a voice to ordinary, decent citizens who are incensed by finger-wagging know-alls smearing them as racists, Nazis and fascists.These ugly insults were hurled at millions who backed Brexit and the overwhelming majority who voted for Boris Johnson.Until now we’ve been too polite to fight back, gagged by Thought Police who bark: “You can’t say that.”So we put up with politically correct sniping from such “identity” obsessives as rapper Stormzy, MP Clive Lewis and the entire Labour Party, who smell racism under every rock.Good Morning Britain host Piers Morgan sparked uproar when he challenged black and Asian commentators to produce a “shred of evidence” of Press racism. They failed.Fox’s one-man mission is more than a poke at the PC brigade. It is about free speech — and hypocrisy.Scattergun charges of racism offer an alibi to serious crime, he says, citing the Pakistani sex gangs who systematically raped and trafficked white victims across Britain — with police blessing.“It’s one of the dangerous things about throwing racism around,” the actor told Question Time.“People become so conscious of it that things like the Manchester grooming scandal get ignored.”He spoke as police finally confessed to deliberately turning a blind eye to decades-long vile abuse of vulnerable, underage white girls.A police report confirms a -year reign of sex abuse went unchecked after an unnamed chief inspector ruled: “With it being Asians, we can’t afford for this to be coming out.”Fear of the race card also partly explains why police failed to halt the slaughter of mostly black victims by mostly black kne gangs.The same “cultural cringe” stops prison staff tackling dangerous Islamist gangs who have seized control in Britain’s terror jails.It’s why forced marriage and honour killings go unchecked.Now, at last, black and Asian voices are bravely confronting the race zealots.Leading commentator and ex-Equality Commissioner Trevor Phillips, son of poor immigrants, condemns “feel- good” racism detectorists.“It might make ‘right-on’ white liberals feel better,” he says. “But the price of their smugness is an ongoing bloody massacre of black children.”Home Secretary Priti Patel, daughter of Uganda-Indian migrants, has declared war on the race industry.The BBC strenuously denies “institutional bias”, despite abundant evidence from within the Beeb itself – including from former Director-General Mark Thompson.Now Boris Johnson is in power and the bloated corporation’s £BILLION subsidy is at risk.Perhaps that’s why Question Time is now apparently balanced, Andrew Marr is being polite to Tory guests and on Radio ’s Today, Nick Robinson has gone almost silent.“We live in a great country, a land of opportunity for all,” she said. “Institutionalised, corrosive behaviour that disregards victims has to end.“Tackling this abuse is a priority for the Home Office. There will be no no-go areas.”At last, perhaps, we have a senior politician of colour who is prepared to follow Laurence Fox’s advice and “speak truth to nonsense”.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No Sussex titles to trademark. And no funding of their police guards.If those terms of abdication are proposed and accepted, then we, along with most reasonable British people, will wish Harry and Meghan Wales every happiness in beginning their new lives.A PEERAGE for any one of John Bercow, Karie Murphy or Tom Watson — let alone all three — would be a grotesque insult to the British people.Brexit-blocking former Speaker Bercow stands accused of bullying Commons staff.Murphy, Jeremy Corbyn’s bag-carrier, is being investigated by the Equality and Human Rights Commission for allowing anti-Semitism to fester in the Labour Party.And Jezza’s slippery ex-deputy Watson egged on the bungled VIP paedo ring investigation that ruined innocent people’s lives — and cost the taxpayer upwards of £million.The Lords was meant to be a crucial chamber where the wisest in the land could check and amend legislation.But it has mortally damaged its reputation by spending three years trying to thwart Brexit, the biggest democratic mandate in our history.If it now adds any of this trio of scandal-drenched Corbyn nominees to its already bloated ranks, then frankly, it is done for.Boris Johnson is said to be considering moving the House of Lords up to York.If Bercow, Murphy or Watson are to be anywhere near it, we’d rather relocate it to outer Siberia. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

owned by a mystery pal - in North Saanich where Meghan was waiting.Harry is expected to sleep off his jet lag before spending time catching up with his family and fine-tuning their plans for their new non-royal le.But questions remained on exactly how their £ million-a-year Canadian security costs will be met and whether Prince Charles should get tax breaks on the huge sums he is still paying his son.Harry and Meghan - whose loathing of “soul-crushing” royal protocols helped spark the crisis - must now decide where to relocate to when they begin reshaping their lives.But they are expected to take their time mulling over their plans while lapping up the luxury of their six-bedroomed dream home.Toronto is seen as the most likely new home for the Sussexes after Meghan spent seven years there while starring in TV drama Suits.She was pictured momentarily struggling to contain boisterous Archie in a baby sling while walking her dogs on a beautul woodland trail.She appeared happy and carefree as she soaked up the stunning scenery at Horth Hill Regional Park, a ten minute drive from her beachside mansion on Monday morning.Harry and Meghan took their beagle Guy and a black Labrador Oz to the exclusive Island for their six-week break before Megxit.Two royal protection officers watched from a discreet distance pacing behind Meghan as she strolled outdoors on the islan d for the first time with the tot.Sources close to the privacy-conscious couple say they will happily lie low there enjoying precious family time together before launching a strung of commercial ventures.She was last spotted smiling as she boarded a seaplane to mainland Vancouver to visit two women’s charities last Tuesday.They also appeared entirely at ease in public when she drove herself to the Island’s Victoria International airport to pick up pilates guru pal Heather Dorak.Harry has more engagements in Britain in the next couple of months as they transition away from being full-time royals so will have to be shuttle between the two counties - but Meghan is not expected back in the UK for the foreseeable future.It is not known when he willbut a Sussex source said there were more engagements to come in Britain for the prince before the spring.During their six-week Christmas break, Harry and Meghan stayed in an £ million waterfront mansion on Vancouver Island, located on Canadas southwestern coast.Archie has not been in the UK at all this year, having not ed since the festive holiday.The family could make the island their home base, while Meghan is said to be keen on Toronto, calling the city her second home after spending seven years there filming legal drama Suits.The city has well-heeled neighbourhoods including Forest Hill and Deer Park, home to Meghans best friend, Jessica Mulroney, and her TV presenter husband Ben, son of former Canadian Prime Minister Brian.She has praised the city for its lack of paparazzi.She said: Its really funny because I think as much of a big city as Toronto is, its so dferent from LA or New York. There [are] no paparazzi so its really easy to just have a normal le.In Canada, Meghan plans to campaign on issues close to her heart - such as the two organisations for vulnerable women and children in Vancouver where she made her first post-Megxit visits last week.Yesterday, Prince Harry met Boris Johnson and other world leaders at the UK Africa Investment Summit in Greenwich after he told of his great sadness at ditching the Royal Family.As he jetted off to Canada, big brother Prince William hosted a huge bash at Buckingham Palace for the  African delegations and their spouses.It is the first time the Queen has asked him to host a major state occasion inside the Palace as he gears up for his future role as King.It comes as The Sun revealed how Harry and William have ended their two-year feud after realising it was now or never.The pair made up in man-to-man peace talks away from the high-stress royal summit at Sandringham with their dad Prince Charles and the Queen.But sources say Harry is still at odds with his father over the sensational decision to quit the royal family.Meanwhile, the Duchess of Cornwall responded of course when askedshe would miss Harry and Meghan.On Sunday night, Prince Harry told of his great sadness over his decision to step down and move abroad with baby Archie.Speaking at a private event for his charity Sentebale at The Ivy restaurant, he said: The decision that I have made for my we and I to step back is not one I made lightly.Harry, , told friends and supporters: It was so many months of talks after so many years of challenges. And I know I haven’t always gotten it right, but as far as this goes, there really was no other option.The Duke claimed he wasnt walking away from the Royal Family but it wasnt possible to continue serving the Queen, the Commonwealth and the Military without public funding.But making a point of his new non-royal status, he said: I want you to hear the truth from me, as much as I can share — not as a Prince, or a Duke, but as Harry.He also expressed sorrow his military titles had been taken away from him - praising everyone who has supported injured veterans on Instagram today.On Saturday The Queen confirmed that from the spring they will relinquish their HRH titles as they seek a more independent le in North America.During the talks, all options were on the table and the Evening Standard has reported the Queen had the choice of stripping Harry of his dukedom and using one of his lesser titles.The newspaper quoted a source as saying it was seriously considered but another source told PA this was categorically untrue.The discussions to resolve the crisis between officials and members of the royal family were described as extremely friendly and constructive when they ended.The couple will not receive public funds anymore and will have to pay the taxpayer the £. million that was spent on refurbishing Frogmore Cottage.They will need to pay the estimated £, a month upkeep bills at the Windsor home - but will be allowed to keep funding from Charles person income from the Duchy of Cornwall and are now free to cash in on commercial ventures.And the reality is they do not want to avoid media. They want to avoid criticism. Indeed they crave media attentionit meekly writes their PR puff pieces.Corbyn’s Labour is the same.As for having no choice, what drivel.They could have grown up, developed a thicker skin and done their royal duty as they first promised.To pretend that dark forces made them seek a vast fortune as A-list celebs in the LA sunshine is self-serving cobblers.Questions have been raised about how Harry and Meghan will continue with their Sussex Royal brand when they cease being working royals.This issue and other questions - including funding for the couple and their son Archies protection - have yet to be resolved. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Which makes Hall’s defence of the licence fee even more ridiculous.In an era of multiple-choice subscription TV it is absurd for one broadcaster to be funded by a tax enforceable by criminal penalty.It is even more laughable to claim it “ensures independence­ . . . obliges us to serve everyone and reflect every part of the UK”.Hall’s BBC spent his entire tenure turning a deaf ear to half the UK. Hence its shock at last month’s Tory triumph.Hall’s decision to rob over-s of the free licences he agreed to in  was equally outrageous.The idea that the £million cost will harm vital BBC services, when so much of its content amounts to needless competition with commercial rivals, is fatally flawed.His successor must run a smaller Beeb, more in touch with the public, less in the grip of suffocating “wokeness”, focused not on gratuitous expansion but the high-quality shows it does best.This new chief should accept that non-payment of the licence must be decriminalised and the levy finally replaced with a voluntary subscription.Only then will the BBC join the st Century.THE problem with Harry saying he and Meghan had no option but to move abroad to avoid our “powerful media” is that not a word of it is true.It is sheer paranoia to say the Press has done anything but legitimately scrutinise a publicly-funded couple.And the reality is they do not want to avoid media.

Thats why his relationship with his mother in law has never been stronger.Prince Harry last night jetted to Canada to be with Meghan and Archie after sitting down in crunch talks with his grandmother the Queen over his future role as a royal.But just before he left, the -year-old said he was quitting with great sadness, adding: It was so many months of talks after so many years of challenges.And I know I haven’t always gotten it right, but as far as this goes, there really was no other option.”After the Sandringham summit, the Queen revealed Prince Harry and Meghan would be paying back the £.m spent refurbishing their Frogmore Cottage home.They will also no longer use their HRH titles.But it is believed Harry was particularly keen to keep his Royal links to the ious military charities he supports.Harry, who passed through Sandhurst and served in Afghanistan will lose all honorary military titles.Yet he has told those working with the organisations he supports he has no intention of stepping away.A source said: The causes that Harry believes in, around raising awareness of Aids, poverty, environmental damage and the support those injured fighting for our country need to receive are still his focus.Just because he is stepping away from the Royal family he is not stepping away from the things that he is passionate about. Harry is excited about the opportunities more freedom might give him - particularly when it comes to campaigning for better services for injured veterans.For years Harry has had to toe the line and follow a certain narrative.Now he can be more forthright in what he wants to say.Questions remained on exactly how their £ million-a-year Canadian security costs will be met and whether Prince Charles should get tax breaks on the huge sums he is still paying his son.Harry and Meghan - whose loathing of “soul-crushing” royal protocols helped spark the crisis - must now decide where to relocate to when they begin reshaping their lives.But they are expected to take their time mulling over their plans while lapping up the luxury of their six-bedroomed dream home.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And the convicted killer claims new evidence shows there was still le inside the house while he was speaking to dozens of police outside – which he hopes will clear his name. His lawyers say officers did not enter White House Farm where his -year-old parents Nevill and June, sister Sheila Caffell, , and her twins Nicholas and Daniel, six, were ­butchered for nearly four hours, amid fears someone was alive inside, possibly with a gun. Speaking from his cell in Wakefield, West Yorks, Bamber said: “It is the ultimate alibi that I was in the company of dozens of police officers when it was clear that a person or persons were alive in the house who I am convicted of murdering.” He claims schizophrenic Sheila murdered her sons and parents. But author Carol Ann Lee, who exchanged regular letters with Bamber for her book Murders at White House Farm, said she has no doubts about his guilt.  She said the overriding piece of evidence was a gruesome crime scene photograph, which has never been published, which showed the murders were committed by somebody “extremely adept with a gun, who knew what they were doing”. Ms Lee added: “Sheila didn’t, she was also on medication for her illness, which made her unco-ordinated.” Bamber’s girlfriend Julie Mugford also told police he planned the slaughter in a bid to get his hands on the family inheritance and had phoned her, saying: “Tonight’s the night.”The fresh claims from Bamber’s legal team come as the  murders are being portrayed in the ITV drama White House Farm, ­starring Freddie Fox as the mass killer. They will form part of an appeal bid in a submission to the Criminal Cases Review Commission. Bamber’s lawyer Mark Newby claims the new evidence is “strong”. Police have always maintained that everyone in the farmhouse at ­Tolleshunt D’Arcy, Essex, was dead by around .am. Bamber lived in nearby Goldhanger. But his legal team say a rle was spotted in an upstairs window by two separate firearms officers at around am on the morning of the murder. And included in the other new evidence is a claim that a  call was made from within the house at .am. Documents seen by the Mirror show a BT operator connected police to an open line at the farm at .am, meaning the handset must have been put back on to make the .am call.  When police eventually broke into the home they heard a noise upstairs, believing it may have been a person. On inspection, everyone was dead. But Bamber’s legal team claim the noise could have been Sheila killing herself. The gun was found on Sheila’s body. Ballistics expert Bruce Jones claimed the . rle used in the ­killings would not have been loud enough for police to “associate its noise with a shot being fired”. Other evidence shows windows at the farm may have been opened after .am and lights turned off between am and am.Mr Newby said: “Because I haven’t received evidence that contradicts it, I can’t necessarily say it isn’t anything other than it was Sheila."},{"url":null,"title":"kate middletons shares sweet family","story":"NewsKate Middletons shares sweet family moment with royal in-laws as she arrives at glitzy eventKate Middleton and Prince William hosted an event at Buckingham Palace on behalf of the Queen - and other members of the Royal Family were also there for supportShareCommentsByZoe ForseyLestyle Editor:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video kates-sweetness-kisses-princess-anne-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news kate-middletons-shares-sweet-family-\"\" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - Royal FamilySubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Robert Clegg, global head of staff digitisation, had an affair with Madeliene Luckham, head of delivery for the department. He told her it was not his first fling and that he did not love his we, she claims. When they split she said Mr Clegg would leer at her chest, touch her uninvited in public and make her feel professionally and personally worthless. She told the tribunal how he flirted with other women in front of her after they separated, getting aposvery handsyapos at work with another woman and whispering in her ear aposweaposd have great sexapos. Ms Luckham, , from Teddington in south west London, also accused Mr Clegg of rubbing against her in meetings.  After confronting him about cheating on her with another woman she was left feeling like a aposcheap fill-inapos as he said their relationship had been just aposcasual drunken sexapos, the hearing was told. Ms Luckham, who earned £ a day as a contractor, said she was promised a permanent job with a £, salary. That never materialised after they broke up and he turned against her, she claims. She is now suing both HSBC and Mr Clegg for sex discrimination, which both deny. Ms Luckham told Stratford Employment Tribunal that they split up in April . She had had her first doubts the previous Christmas after a trip to New York when she realised she would aposbreak the heartsapos of his four young children. But Mr Clegg, , from Newbury in Berkshire, told the tribunal he ended the affair in January  during a joint work trip to Hong Kong where Ms Luckham had made snide comments about him in a bid to embarrass him. He said he had told her aposweaposre doneapos and had started seeing a counsellor with his we to try and save their marriage, according to his witness statement.  She said the affair had started in October  at HSBCaposs fintech hub in Southwark when they had dinner together at Hicksteraposs after team drinks at Jackaposs bar, the tribunal heard. The pair shared a consensual kiss and ed to Mr Cleggaposs Mercure Hotel, opposite, where he invited Ms Luckham to spend the night and later asked her for WhatsApp sex after she refused, it was said. She said: We met the next day and discussed what had happened the night before as well as his marriage. He told me that his marriage was over and that it was a matter of financially getting to the position where he could orce. He said that he and his we were no longer intimate, he didnapost love her anymore, that they led separate lives and that they were only together for their children. He also told me I wasnapost his first affair. Three days later, Mr Clegg invited Ms Luckham for dinner and they later had sex at his hotel. The pair would send complimentary messages to one another at work, with Mr Clegg texting her you look good enough to eat today, the tribunal heard. She said they would kiss, hold hands and play footsie under the table at work. Mr Clegg had told her he loved her, Ms Luckham said.  But on April  she said Mr Clegg became extremely flirtatious with a woman from SOMO, an external contractor, in front of her eyes. She said she was heartbroken hearing rumours of him being very handsy with someone at a work social event around the same time. Ms Luckham said: He had walked behind her, placed his hands around her, resting at the top of her legs and said in her ear aposweaposd have great sex.apos I was heartbroken and decided to speak to Rob about it directly. In her witness statement, she said: Kai Karteland I discussed Rob, the way he looked at women like they were prey and the fact that he had even earned himself a nickname back at the SOMO offices, aposWeinsteinapos. Ms Luckham said Mr Clegg found the conversation about his flirting with other women very distressing, apologised and blamed it on their relationship not going well. She said: He then blamed it on his situation at home, the way his we was treating him and said that he did not feel like himself. He asked for another chance and I stupidly agreed. However in the blink of an eye on April , I discovered that he was sleeping with someone  in the office. Ms Luckham said the pair met the following day when she believes she ended the relationship.  She said: However Rob was quite dismissive of me and my feelings and started to belittle our relationship. He intimated that it was true he was sleeping with one of our colleagues. He minimised our relationship calling it casual drunken sex that he wasnapost getting at home, as though I was a cheap fill-in for him and that was that. During the conversation, he repeated that he aposcouldnapost afford to leave HSBCapos the clear inference being that I should leave instead. In the immediate aftermath of their breakup, Ms Luckham said things changed in the office and Mr Clegg told her out of the blue he was not entirely happy with her work and that he touched her in a meeting. She said: In one meeting we were in together he walked the long way round behind me and placed both hands on my hips as he slid by, rubbing himself behind me. I felt my body tense and recoil. This was just one of numerous examples of unwanted touching and sexual harassment over the next few months. On May , Ms Luckham discovered the permanent role she had accepted in writing with a £k base salary, was no longer available, she claims. But the tribunal was also told Ms Luckham was given until May  to apply for the role but did not do so. Ms Luckham said Mr Clegg would talk to her like dirt behind closed doors and blame her for everything that had gone wrong, only to switch the second they left the room. She said he would rub his leg against hers in meetings and stare at her chest while talking to her, which she found totally unacceptable.  She said: I felt violated. It was torture. Ms Luckham also recalled seeing Mr Clegg go into a staff toilet where she claimed he had sex with another woman after allegedly trying to prevent her from moving into the new role. She said: As I walked past, through the outer door, I saw her knock on one of the cubicle doors and it opened. Rob was already inside. Rob had just moments ago destroyed my career and was now having sex in the office toilet. Roughly ten minute later Rob ed from the toilets looking all sweaty and dishevelled and gave me the most sinister smile Iaposve ever seen in my le. I felt physically sick. By the end of June, Ms Luckham said she was very affected by stress and anxiety and had dropped more than a dress size. She claimed the treatment by the bank and Mr Clegg that almost drove her to suicide and left her with possible PTSD. But Mr Clegg denied most of the accusations and said he felt like his personality was under constant violent attack by Ms Luckham. In his witness statement, Mr Clegg said: On advice from HR, I eventually took the decision not to renew the claimantaposs contract which ended in August  because of behavioural issues which had ruined the previously positive working culture in my team and become impossible to manage.

With chilly temperatures hitting Vancouver Island, the former Hollywood actress was wrapped up in lots of warm layers and walking boots with Archie secured on her chest in a baby carrier. Two royal protection officers followed close behind as Meghan beamed and her two dogs, black lab Oz and beagle Guy, trotted along beside her in Horth Hill Regional Park.  In the unprecedented images, Meghanaposs face was partially covered under a fawn beanie hat, while her hair hung down in plaits. She also wore black leggings and Kamick ankle-high brown hiking boots, while baby Archie was wearing a white onesie and bootees. Meghan has been setting up temporary home in a £million rented mansion with the plan for her and Harry to settle somewhere in North America, likely Los Angeles.  The prince, meanwhile, left the UK after meeting Prime Minister  Boris Johnson  and world leaders at the UK-Africa Investment Summit in London, which is likely to be one of his few remaining official engagements. Later, brother Prince William hosted the leaders for a dinner at Buckingham Palace, which saw the Duke of Cambridge usher in a new era for The Firm, showcasing the new order post Megxit. Meghan and Harry had been due to attend the event but dropped out after quitting their le as senior royals.  Supported by Kate, as well as Prince Edward and we Sophie, and Princess Anne, he hosted  African delegations, but the Queen and dad Charles were not there. Earlier in the day Harry had held private bilateral meetings with Moroccan PM Saad-Eddine El Othmani Peter Mutharika, President of Malawi and Filipe Nyusi, president of Mozambique at the request of the Government, reports the Mail Online . Harry gave an emotional speech on Sunday night, saying he had no other option but to give up his official royal duties and forge a new le in Canada, where we Meghan and son Archie are setting up home.  Buckingham Palace last night tonight refused to confirm the Duke had fled the UK, saying: “We don’t comment or guide on private schedule.” At a private event for Sentebale on Sunday night in London, Harry spoke about leaving royal duties behind in a bid for a more peaceful le for his family. His comments came after Buckingham Palace released the outcome of talks between the Queen, the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Cambridge and Harry over the future role of the Sussexes.  Harry and Meghan had wanted to remain as working royals, although not prominent members, and drop their public funding so they could become financially independent - a dual role many commentators said was fraught with problems. In a statement issued on Saturday after royal family talks, the Sussexes announced they will stop carrying out royal duties from the spring, no longer use HRH and will repay the taxpayers millions spent on their Berkshire home. Under the terms of their aposabdicationapos Harry and Meghan will keep their titles of Duke and Duchess of Sussex and the courtesy HRH, but will not use the initials.  Harry was not officially attending the investment summit at a London hotel but was holding one-to-one meetings with a number of foreign leaders at the request of the UK Government. He sat down to talks with Moroccan prime minister Saad-Eddine El Othmani, Malawiaposs President Peter Mutharika, and Filipe Nyusi, president of Mozambique. It is likely the Government asked Harry to meet the African leaders because he has a keen interest in the continent and the royal family employs soft diplomacy to help strengthen Britainaposs ties with her allies.

The couple have trademarked the name for use in merchandise ahead of their bombshell announcement that they planned to aposstep backapos from royal le. The move is said to raised concerns at Buckingham Palace about the potential commercial use of the royal title, and comes as Harry touched down in Canada to be by his we and sonaposs side on Vancouver Island.Thomas Woodcock, Garter King of Arms, has warned the Queen the pair should not be allowed to use the title for their website, the Times reports today.His role includes ensuring that royal symbols are not used for commercial interests.  Lat month it emerged that the couple submitted trademarks for more than  items using the Sussex Royal aposbrandapos, including clothing with  sportswear, dresses, headbands and jackets, newspapers and magazines, newsletters, diaries, calendars and textbooks.Mr Woodcock told the newspaper it would not be apossatisfactoryapos for the couple to use the aposSussex Royalapos title for their website - insisting that while he was advising the Palace on the issue, he was giving his view in a personal capacity. The aide said: I donapost think itaposs satisfactory. One cannot be two things at once. You either are [royal] or youaposre not.  He added that it was much easier to enforce the use of trademarks in Britain than in the United States, particularlya trademark has already been registered there. The Sussex Royal brand has been trademarked in the UKaposs Intellectual Property Office, and the pair also filed an application to trademark the brand with the World Intellectual Property Organisation on New Yearaposs Eve. Meghan and Harry have already used the name for their new website, which they used to launch their shock announcement. It is also the name of their official Instagram account. and uses the coupleaposs joint monogram - their initials entwined under a coronet.They also are expected to launch a new charitable organisation named Sussex Royal The Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex later this year. It comes after a round of royal crisis talks concerning the coupleaposs future ended with the Queen giving her reluctant blessing for them to move to Canada.  However the deal included stripping the pair of their royal titles, as the palace rejected their desire outlined their initial announcement to become part-time royals.They have also offered to reimburse the taxpayer for the £. million cost of renovating their Frogmore Cottage home on the royal Windsor Estate last year, following controversy over the spending.Reports yesterday said the Queen would allow them to continue living in the cottage when they stay in the UK with son Archie.  But questions linger over how the pair will achieve their stated goal of becoming aposfinancially independentapos once they begin splitting their time between North America and Canada. The trademarking move was widely viewed as an ambition to strike commercial deals that traded on their royal status, with the coupleaposs star status said to be likely to attract commercial deals worth millions.

Laura Smith, , had been experiencing blurred vision in the run-up to Christmas and put it down to stress. However, when the mum-of-two woke up unable to see on Boxing Day, her le was turned upside down and she feared she would lose her sight forever. Laura, Burton, said: The first things that crossed my mind were aposam I going to see my children walk down the aisle  Am I going to see my grandkids apos. It is not something you think you are ever going to have to think about. It was so scary. Although Lauraaposs sight started to come back a little bit, all she could see was brown fuzziness. She continued seeing floating and flashing lights all day. On December , Laura, who is mum to seven-year-old Keira, seven, and two-year-old Jackson, rang Specsavers and got an appointment the next day. She said: They did pressure test and vision tests and the optician said both my optic nerves were swollen and my left one was bleeding. She said I needed to get to the hospital. The staff there were shocked and saidI had left it any longer I wouldn’t have any sight left at all.  After extensive tests in hospital, Laura was diagnosed her with idiopathic intracranial hypertension - pressure around the brain with no detectable cause. The Branston resident said: I thought I would get reassurance and maybe a prescription, but I never expected that. I have heard of cataracts before, but something like this never even entered my radar. I didnapost have a clue what it was and I am only learning about it now. Only one in , people have it. Itaposs not curable, but they say it is manageable. Once I was diagnosed, they put me on medication and Iaposll be on that for the foreseeable future. The medication has dangerous side effects like kidney failure, kidney stones and liver failure. I get horrendous pins and needles and it means youaposre twice as likely to have a stroke.  I had only just started taking them when my legs gave way. I couldn’t walk because of the side effects. Laura, married to Scott, , said it had been a real whirlwind of emotions since her diagnosis. She said: It has been very traumatic and really scary at times. I also have another condition called non-epileptic attack disorder, which means in stressful situations I can have seizures. While I was waiting for a lumbar puncture , I had two seizures. It has been traumatic and a lot to deal with.

The Duke of Sussex cast a solemn figure as he left his plane late on Monday night but his face lit up as he appeared to spot his we waiting for him in the back of the car. The couple had been separated for  days before the were finally reunited after the Prince finished his final engagement as a senior royal in Britain. A passenger onboard his Westjet flight told the Mirror the Duke looked “tired and agitated” before finally touching down at .pm local time on Monday. She said: “Harry was one of the first ones off the flight and was carrying his own bag. “You could tell after a long flight from London he was tired and agitated but as he saw the car his mood instantly changed. “I couldn’t be sure but it looked like Meghan was in the back waiting for him. “Whoever it was he was very pleased to see them.” Harry was whisked away in the SUV which had been waiting on the tarmac and driven the five minute drive from the airport to the £. million waterfront home the couple have lived in since November.  Histo Vancouver came just days after he and Meghan agreed a deal with the Queen to step back as senior royals. On Monday the Prince raced through an engagement with Prime Minister Boris Johnson and African leaders before boarding a British Airways flight from Heathrow to Vancouver. After BA touched down following a nine hour  minute flight, Harry connected onto Westjet   for the  minute journey from the mainland onto Vancouver Island. He had been so eager to see Meghan and Archie he ducked out of a Buckingham Palace evening reception he was supposed to be co-hosting.  Meghan had flown out to the ocean view mansion earlier this month following her and Harryaposs bombshell announcement they would be quitting as senior royals. The prince, , had remained in the UK to carry out his remaining royal duties as well as attend a crisis summit at Sandringham with the Queen and Princes Charles and William to discuss his future. Earlier on Monday Harry met Prime Minister Boris Johnson and world leaders at the summit in London, which is likely to be one of his few remaining official engagements before the Sussexes take their leap of faith and leave the monarchy in the spring. The duke gave an emotional speech on Sunday night, saying he had no other option but to give up his official royal duties and forge a new le in Canada, where his we and son are setting up home. In the speech, Harry told invited guests: What I want to make clear is weaposre not walking away, and we certainly arenapost walking away from you. Our hope was to continue serving the Queen, the Commonwealth and my military associations, but without public funding. Unfortunately, that wasnapost possible. Meghan and Archie were pictured yesterday out for a walk on a woodland trail on Vancouver Island, with her beagle and a black Labrador. Harry and Meghan had wanted to remain as working royals, although not prominent members, and drop their public funding so they could become financially independent - a dual role many commentators said was fraught with problems. Critics have accused the couple of turning their backs on the monarchy to enjoy the freedom of being able to take on commercial ventures. Harryaposs brother, the Duke of Cambridge, continues with a busy schedule of royal duties, a day after delivering a speech at a Buckingham Palace reception for summit delegates.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailPrince Harry was given no choice but to sign the deal allowing him and Meghan to walk away from The Firm. The Queen had insisted his decision must not overshadow senior royals’ high-profile engagements this week. So Harry, , had no option but to agree to the terms set out in front of him, banning him and Meghan from using their HRH titles and forcing him to give up his cherished military roles. Sources close to him say he was “devastated” at the development but felt thathe did not agree, he and we Meghan, , stood to lose even more ground in their bid to leave the royal fold. A palace source said: “It was made abundantly clear to Harry: agree to this and then you can go. By his own admission it was not under the terms he wanted but he had no other option.  “There was no halfway house, no half-in-half-out arrangement, and this was the only one on the table. “Meghan and Harry were so desperate to get out they had no choice – and, on the face of it, it looks like they have given up a considerable amount.” The deal will be reviewed in  months to see how it is working for all parties. Prince Harry was thought to have flown to Canada tonight after he was reportedly spotted at Heathrow Airport on Monday afternoon.  Earlier he attended the UK-Africa Investment summit in London, where he met leaders including Boris Johnson , Moroccan prime minister Saadeddine Othmani, Malawi president Peter Mutharika and Mozambique president Filipe Nyusi, But he did not join the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge at the plush reception for African leaders at Buckingham Palace tonight. It was the first time William had hosted such an event on behalf of the Queen, signying another major sht as he takes on more responsibilities for the Crown. Prince Charles has a major visit to Israel this week where he will take on official engagements in the country and travel to Palestinian territories for the first time.  He has been invited to speak at the World Holocaust Forum with a select band of world leaders, accepting the honour ahead of the th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will also attend the UK Holocaust Memorial Day Commemorative Ceremony in Westminster next Monday. The Prince of Wales has agreed to fund the Sussexes for a year as they set out to build their independent fortune. But it is not known whether Charles’ support will be funded from the Duchy of Cornwall or his personal wealth. In Canada, Harry will be reunited with Meghan for the first time since she left the UK following the couple’s bombshell announcement on January  that they wanted to step back.  She flew out to rejoin their eight-month-old son Archie within days of their announcement, leaving Harry to face the backlash from his family for defying the Queen’s advice to wait before going public with their decision. The Queen, Charles and William had ordered aides to work round the clock to thrash out a deal for their departure. But the Sussexes’ own plans were shot down and ripped up after the three most senior royals refused to agree to the couple’s cherry-picked propositions. The exit deal allows Harry and Meghan to quit royal le and set up home in Canada – despite huge wrangling over what big-money deals they will be allowed to sign up to, and who will fork out millions for their security.

It’s made me the woman that I am today.” I’m the most exacerbated, most misdiagnosed case out there and we need to find those other people out there with this condition who don’t even know. We need to try and find a treatment and cure to stop this from happening. In  Ashley started a communal group for people who live with amputees to get together and discuss their experiences. She said: We now have roughly  active members. I started this group because I grew up this way – amputee le is just my normal. But these people that go through it later in le need that support.

Since the unnamed coronavirus was first reported this year in Wuhan city it has claimed the lives of three people. At least a further  have been infected. A video clip believed to have been filmed on an China Airlines flight from Wuhan to Macau shows people presumed to be medics moving form passenger to passenger. They are wearing plastic guards over their faces and breathing masks over their mouths. The passenger who took the clip said it was filmed on January  on Air China flight CA. Checking all the passengers took ten minutes and none were found to be infected. All air travellers leaving Wuhan will need to have their body temperatures taken on the plane to ensure the virus does not leave the city, health officials in Macau told Beijing News. In Chinaaposs Henan province the sale of all live poultry in markets has been banned to stop the spread of the virus. The flu-like condition is similar to the SARS virus that killed  people in the early s across dozens of countries, mostly in Asia.  Experts believe at least , people may have been infected, but say UK airport checks would only detect those who have started to show symptoms. It is thought to be spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Dr Nathalie MacDermott, leading expert from King’s College London, said: “There is potential for exposure given the volume and frequency of international air travel and the potential for someone travelling from an affected region arriving in the UK prior to them developing symptoms.“This is where appropriate screening measures need to be in place for travellers from affected regions who become unwell with fever and respiratory symptoms. “Largely it would be something for a healthcare worker to considerthey had someone with respiratory symptoms who had history of contact with a confirmed case or travel to an affected region.

We see this as the way and Dundee and Angus College would be involved in taking this forward, with enhanced provision.#Both these schools are grade C in terms of quality and both need upgrading but looking at the financial elements we cannot afford it.#The priority is in the east and we cannot have Braeview Academy people sitting in portable cabins.#Mr Alexander, a former pupil of St Saviour#s High School, outlined how #vocational partnerships# between Braeview and Michelin would be continued at the new campus at Drumgeith Road.He added that a joint project between Dundee City Council and Dundee and Angus College would be launched to accommodate people with additional support needs.Mr Alexander said: #I spoke with three executives from Michelin and we are really focused on making things work.#The consultation,approved by committee on Monday, would start on February  and run until the end of March.

bar introduces drink covers to tackle spiking","story":"An Aberdeen bar is providing special coasters to customers in a bid to tackle drink-spiking.Siberia Bar and Hotel, on Belmont Street, began supplying the beer mats last week after reports of alleged drink-spiking in the city surfaced on social media.It is thought the bar is one of the first in Aberdeen to provide the coasters, which can be placed on top of drinks and features a hole for a straw.They are the brainchild of campaign group Girls Against Spiking, an organisation which was set up in September  with the aim of giving information and advice about keeping safe.Now, Stuart McPhee, general manager of Siberia, is rolling out the device to customers.Mr McPhee said: “I became aware of the covers through social media and recently there has been a lot of reports in the area of people being spiked.“I picked them up at a licensing conference last week because I thought it was better to have some measures in place.“They’re nondescript and there for everyone to use.”The move comes after a woman was taken to hospital earlier this month amid claims her drink was spiked in a bar on Belmont Street.Stuart added: “I think it’s certainly a misconception that it’s only girls who get spiked.“Boys get spiked too and some people simply do it for a misguided laugh.“I think the best deterrent is to never leave your drink unattended, but we thought we should do our bit to help.”A statement from Girls Against Spiking said: “We wanted to do something to help tackle Scotland’s mental health crisis so it features Samaritans contact details as well as others which can help with a host of issues.“We have thousands of these coasters which have been distributed to every police ision in Scotland, who will then further distribute them in their local area to licensed premises.”Elaine Hindal, CEO of Drinkaware, said: “If somebody you know starts to feel strange or more drunk than expected, or you suspect their drink has been spiked, it is important to get medical help straight away.“Drink covers are just one of a number of ways that may help reduce the likelihood of your drink being spiked – for example, not accepting a drink from someone you don’t know and never leaving your drink.“Our advice is to stay vigilant – don’t drink too much in the first place, stick with your friends and have a safe plan for getting home.“Many venues adopt alcohol awareness training schemes for their staff and these usually cover how to recognise drink-spiking.”Nicola Johnston, Aberdeen Inspired economy manager, said: “Aberdeen Inspired is supportive of any initiative that encourages safety in the night-time economy.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/2.48705280-240x180.jpg

School and its parent council.The information week will feature a number of key activities including assemblies for children, community road safety drop-in sessions and school car park patrols.The campaign comes after concerns were raised over road traffic issues around the school, with the emphasis on bringing the wider community into the discussion.A public drop-in event will be held next Monday at Westhill Library from am to pm, when both council staff and police will be on hand to discuss concerns.Ewan Wallace, Aberdeenshire Council’s head of transportation said: “I am delighted to see yet another fine example of partnership working between ourselves, local schools and Police Scotland to deliver the road safety message in our communities.“The safety of everyone in our communities is of paramount importance and by working together with our schools and the wider community we are able to ensure our children remain safe at all times.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/01/5e0f09aec455c6.55800429.jpg ","title":"keeper shares his euro vision for dons ahead of motherwell showdown","story":"Captain Joe Lewis today challenged Aberdeen to lay down a European marker by defeating rivals Motherwell tomorrow.The Steelmen hold the Premiership’s third spot, which brings automatic Europa League qualication for next season.Victory over ‘Well at Pittodrie tomorrow would push Aberdeen into third – where Lewis aims to finish the campaign.Last season the Dons faced a nervous sweat on a sixth straight Euro qualication after finishing fourth and had to wait on Celtic winning the Scottish Cup.This time Lewis wants European action secured automatically by finishing third and realises overcoming Motherwell is pivotal.Lewis said: “Motherwell is a huge game as they have been very consistent and have been winning game after game.“They are a strong side but it is a match we are certainly looking to win. The last time we played Motherwell we won - and scored three brilliant goals.“That was one of our best performances along with our - win over Kilmarnock. We will need to something close to that level to get the job done again.“It was away from home against dficult opposition and we did really well with a lot of players playing out of position.“We will be looking to replicate that, but we know Motherwell will be better than they were that day.”Aberdeen ed from the Premiership winter shutdown with a - Scottish Cup fourth round defeat of League One Dumbarton at Pittodrie.In the aftermath of that narrow victory over the part-timers, Dons boss Derek McInnes confirmed he aims to sign a player with a creative spark in the January transfer window. He has already made an attempt to sign St Johnstone winger Matty Kennedy this month to bring creativity.Kennedy had agreed a pre- contract for the summer, but the Dons want him in now.If a deal to secure Kennedy this month cannot be thrashed out McInnes will move on to other signing targets.However, Lewis reckons in signing Dylan McGeouch from Sunderland, they have already landed a player who can turn games with his skill.Lewis said: “Dylan is a fantastic signing for us. He is very good on the ball, positive and energetic and is a big addition to the squad.“Hopefully he can affect the way we are playing and can be an integral part going forward.“We have competition in the squad now and that will be important going forward.”Aberdeen had  shots against Dumbarton but it took a late penalty from Sam Cosgrove to beat the part-timers and prevent an unwanted replay.Their reward is a home clash against Premiership Kilmarnock on the weekend of February .Lewis said: “The important thing about any cup game is getting through to the next round.“It was a quiet game for me as the back four did their jobs.“The two centre-halves completely nullied everything that came into our half.“Attacking-wise against Dumbarton, on another day we could have had four or five goals.“As long as it is - you always run the risk of them popping up with something, but we dealt with everything and there were no dramas.“After having the break, for the Premiership teams it is important to get back to winning ways – which we did.“Obviously, it wasn’t the emphatic goal scoring victory we wanted but it was a win. We kept putting the ball in the box and kept trying to do the right things.“Eventually it wasn’t luck or a fluke but persistence with Sam getting in the right areas.“The lad brought him down and it was a clear penalty which Sam put away – as he usually does.”For the Scottish Cup tie the Dons transformed the Merkland Stand into an “active area” for fans who want to stand and sing in support of Aberdeen.Lewis hopes the “Red Shed” can be incorporated at every home game for next season.He said: “The initiative from the club with the Red Shed is a brilliant idea.“The club has to be commended for it and the fans for buying into it.“Everyone wants a better atmosphere here and hopefully that can be the start of things.“Certainly against Dumbarton at home when most people would have come here expecting us to win and quite often the fans are waiting for something from the pitch.“We could hear the supporters and no disrespect to Dumbarton, but in the bigger games they can make a dference.“A good atmosphere at Pittodrie can be points on the board for us.”"},{"url":null,"title":"a mid argyll rugby blast from the past","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTayvallich reader Donald Carmichael handed in this black and white photograph of a Mid Argyll Rugby Club team of many decades ago.But can our readers name the players  And what background can you give us about this photograph and Mid Argyll Rugby club at the time Contact the Argyllshire Advertiser by email: editor@argyllshireadvertiser with any information."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 27 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLooking back over the last  months, no single story has dominated the headlines in these pages, but there have been important themes.There are the negative trends, of course.

Three events all within a stones throw of Mid Argyll.Jamie Miller was the only local to enter this event, starting his Scottish Tarmac Rally Championshipcampaign for the year in the rapid  Citroen CR. Paul Hunter, swapping his pacenotes for spanners, was on hand to assist Jamie throughout the season. Conditions were said to have been tricky as Knockhill has its own micro-climate, which consists purely of rain, wind, snow, ice, wind and wind. Sadly it wasn#t to be at Knockhill for the team with mechanical failure ending their day after stage two.The first closed road event to take place in England, after the approval of closed road rallying for the UK, was the first event for the famousGTi. Unfortunately for Kirsty Mochrie her licence can only be upgraded to stage events from single venue use when she turns , so it was theof the pairing of Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter to represent Mid Argyll south of the border. The pair, finding the conditions tricky in the narrow lanes after the top seed cars had been pulling mud from verges and ditches, managed to bounce the wee metro over the first loop of four stages until the gearbox had enough on the fth test.Following the cancelling of Inverness# Snowman Rally earlier in the year, this was now first round of the Scottish Rally Championshipfor Dougie Watt and Ian Parker, and it was interesting to say the least. A glance outside in the morning to see about four inches of snow lying on the roof of the MK Escort was a surprise for a start. A very wet and muddy day saw the pair make it to the finish in one piece which is more than can be said for the clutch cable that snapped about one mile into the final stage, however clinching their first class win of the season was the best start to the championship.With Kirsty #Wee Mo# Mochrie in the co-drivers seat in the rapid Corsa of Steven Hay , a fair pace was set by the pair throughout the day sitting as high as th until they unfortunately had to take a split early to save damaging the car. Back out the next stage and still setting a blistering top  pace in the Corsa, including some hang time on both the jumps.Jamie, back out in the fit C, had bad luck once again. This time an overshoot on a square right and a struggle to get the car started again after a stall sadly earned him a stage max on stage two. Still setting top  times on the day he ended nd which was a fair effort when you include a stage maximum time.Ian was out this time with Fraser #Flat oot Fraz# Smithafter winning an entry to the rally at the STRC Awards in January. Flying out the gates and onto their second lap on the first stage then pop, driveshaft burst. Towed in and sorted, both covered in CV Grease, they made it back out for a skid around and on a mission to tear up some old tarmac tyres.The Granite Stages, now held at RAF Leuchars would see Eoghan Anderson make ato the passenger seat for a hurl in the immaculate MK Escort of Martin Murray. Smiling ear to ear all day, with Bill eagerly awaiting histo the service area for the stage report, they finished th overall.Ian was out with Greg Inglisin his fluorescent Orange Lotus Exige and it was eyes on the prize for STRC points for Greg. A clean day saw Greg really getting to grips with the car on some surprisingly fast stages including a tickle of the limiter in fth saw the pair finish third overall.Back together and with the small repairs from the Speyside done it was time for the Furnace MK toto the woods. A steady run over the opening two stages, Dougie and Ian found their feet after the #off# at the Speyside sent them into service lying th. From seeing their overall position they knew they had to get back into it on the next stage, however on the road section to start stage three there was issues selecting gear and the pair decided to call it a day # damage limitation was the right call, as the input shaft was on its last legs.Jamie was back on the pace for this one, setting a th fastest stage time on the opening test. Sitting th overall heading into stage five was impressive given the competition on the day. Bad luck unfortunately, however, was to .Eoghan was again out with Martin in the MK for a blast. Sadly it was an early bath, retired after stage two but again, as always, enjoying every minute while it lasted.The Argyll rally had been known to have rough and challenging stages the previous two years. Not this time. Ian and Dougie couldn#t believe how good the stages were in comparison to previous years, an absolute joy of an event with the Escort not missing a beat all day on its #shakedown# for the big one. Valuable class points added to the scorecard too, with them ending the event nd overall. The rally had struggled with entries this year and will now run in  as a closed road rally, run by Mull Car Club.Team Mochrie were back together for this one in the Mightyagain and Innes was cutting some questionable shapes in the garage, performing his annual Mach rain dance. Taking chunks of time from his first passes of the stages would see them ring the #s neck and clinch th.Jamie#s luck had finally turned, the C singing all weekend and netting him a topper of th overall and th fastest over the final stage too.Duncan Maclean was back in the driving seat with Ian alongside, giving himself and the car a shakedown before Mull. The freshly rebuilt #blue bullet# was looking superb and managed to finish looking just as sweet. A couple of small teething problems were sorted on the day and the new main focus was to have power steering fitted before Mull # poor Dochy lost about a stone over two days with the effort needed to swing the wee pug around the #s and chicanes.In August Dougie and Ian competed on the Vetomies Rally. A national grade event run alongside the WRC Rally Finland event. Three other crews from Scotland also headed over to sample #the fastest rally in the world#. The stages were unbelievable. Fast, cresty, wide, flowing with a brilliantly smooth surface. The whole event was just surreal. The duo finished the event th overall and more importantly the fastest Scottish crew.Once the car had ed from Finland it was quickly jacked up, checked and loaded onto the trailer the same day for the journey north. Due to two DNFson the Speyside and Scottish, Dougie and Ian had to make the trip to be in with any chance of regaining their class lead in the SRC. Ending the day first in the class meant they were heading into the final round with the lead.Jamie was back out for another counting round of the STRC. Enjoying his day and pushing the wee C on in the blistering heat netted Jamie and co-driver Ian Mccullochrd overall. He must have been relaxed in the heat as in between stages he was off with the overalls and on with the baby lotion, topping up the tan.Ian was back out with Greg in the Lotus. Another fantastic drive from Greg, finishing ninth with the championship title race firmly the primary goal.The final round for the MK and an important one # a DNF here could see Dougie and Ian losing the class lead in the championship. A battle with their rival who they had been chasing all season, Paddy Munro, would come down to the last stage, as the pair were six seconds down on Paddy heading into the final test. Probably one of the duo#s best stages all year, the final push to claim the class honours came down to the finish of the last stage on the last rally of the year. One second! They had taken the class win and the championship.The first event this year for Craig Callander and son Ross would see them prepare Craig#s gravel spec Subaru Impreza at the last minute to take on their favourite event. The #Japanese Tractor# was a fair handful, a light steering alignment issue and a boost problem gave the pair some trouble although finishing th overall made up for the hassle. A fair result given Craig#s absence from tarmac for four years.Returning from the shed with his freshly painted Sunbeam was Alister Macarthur, this time with Claire Tilleyalongside. The freshly fettled #beam was looking and sounding good # crossing the finish th overall after two years out of the seat.Dochy and Ian were back out in the #blue bullet.# All was going well until they had a spin coming over a crest into a square left, losing the bumper and damaging the gear linkage. They managed to get the car back to the end of the Saturday afternoon leg to repair the gear linkage and almost stole the yellow bumper from the recce car until some legends appeared with the duo#s bumper in the back of their Land Rover. Back out onto the  mile #long one# on Saturday night and they had an issue # after a heavy landing over a crest the rear shocker bolt broke, making the car a handful to keep in a straight line. They had to finish another two stages before they could make it back to service, so a finish was all they wanted at this point # th overall and Dochys fourth finish in a row on Mull.Without doubt the driver to watch was Innes and his newly acquired co-driver Lewis Grfiths . The Mightywas spotted airborne at any chance, with the hydro can suspension screaming for a break at each service halt. It was almost all over as the nearside cv joint sheared and the car took a wild turn to the left # both Innes and Lewis thought they would end up IN the Belachroy pub. They managed to make it over the Lochs to the end of the final stage, claiming st overall.Eoghan was back out with Martin to settle the score from the DNF at the summer stages. Sadly a stage maximum time on stage two scuppered their chances of the overall result they were hoping for, however they did set some impressive times, clocking a th fastest time on the final stage.Jamie, back out for the final round of the STRC, was looking to continue his good run from the Pendragon and set a seventh fastest time on stage three in the extremely wet and tricky conditions. Trying to get his money#s worth from his entry fee Jamie, however, decided to take an extra couple of miles on the penultimate stage. Still, the C ran well all day and the conditions suited the car perfectly.Ian was back out with Greg and this time he was aiming to become the Scottish Tarmac Rally Champion for . They set off with five cars in the same class and they had to win the class to get Greg the honours. Setting the pace early they were leading throughout the event. Finishing the event first in their class and third overall meant the job was done # Greg claimed the championship win.The last event of the year saw Kirsty back in the co-drivers seat, gaining even more experience on her path to upgrading her licence. Some typical Knockhill weather was in store as Kirsty had her first taste of RWD rallying in the Mazda MX of Paul Sheard. Kirsty guided Paul around the very wet stages to claim th overall and some valuable points on the board for Paul#s Motorsport News Championship campaign.Special thanks to Alasdair MacConnell who has travelled many miles to don an orange bib and stand in the rain, wind and heat, all to show his support and play a vital part in any event. And to Gavin #Top Tog# Brown, who has been an avid rally man for years and continued to watch us all through the lens, capturing some of our most heroic moments. was a busy year, with a few of us still tinkering away in sheds.  will hopefully see theof Ally and Del Galbraith in their #new# MK Escort and Donald Bowness in the giant killing Nova making aafter some time out.PICS:Dougie Watt and Ian Parker flying in Finland before winning in Aberdeen Photo: Jii Pihlaja. no_a_RallyFinlandFather and son duo Craig and Ross Callendar came in th overall at this year#s Mull Rally.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert club on target for 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe first competition of the new year at Tarbert Gun Club also served as the January leg of the club#s winter league.A full house of  teams turned out on Sunday January , and the early shooters had to put up eith windy conditions which made the clays dance.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 3 2020 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThis week#s photograph whas been submitted by Tom Cullen of Ardfern.The serene scene was taken overlooking the Crinan estuary at about .am on Friday January ."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead bowls into 2020","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Bowling Club launched into the new year with the first of its indoor singles competitions.Some  members played for the Argyll Arms Ardrishaig trophy on Saturday January  and after some great matches throughout the afternoon it was Alan Guy and Neil Ward that progressed to the final.In a closely fought final, Neil Ward edged the victory in the last end, winning -."},{"url":null,"title":"storm brendan the movie","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowA compilation of clips from ious points on the Mid Argyll coastline showing the impact of Storm Brendan on Monday January , .Even with less-than-Hollywood editing it#s pretty dramatic stuff."},{"url":null,"title":"tarberts senior citizens party the night away","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWet and windy weather failed to dampen the spirits of Tarbert’s seniors as they gathered in the village hall for the senior citizens# Christmas dinner.A large number of willing volunteers had organised a sumptuous meal and decked the hall with multi-coloured fairy lights and balloons to provide a warm welcome for their guests.The familiar venue quickly came alive with smiles, hugs and the happy chatter of friends gathering for this much-loved annual event which has been going for more than  years.Elma McGougan and Jean Johnston, who had served on the original organising committee, reminisced about their experiences, explaining they ran fund-raising events and that many in the village donated money and goods so the dinner could be provided free of charge.The event, held this year on Friday January , is still organised by a committee and continues to be generously supported by businesses and iniduals in the village and surrounding area.Elma said: #In the s, the women on the committee made soup and brought it along. We did not have the new kitchen then. The hotel has always cooked the turkeys for us but cooking big pots of potatoes and vegetables was quite a job with just the gas rings. Back then, we had ice-cream and jelly for dessert.#Jean added: #It was all good fun and we had loads of laughs.#Elma continued: #We used to have sales to raise money for the dinner. Santa was on the stage and Jean’s children were his elves. They were only little then.#We modelled the clothes and the older women loved the bargains. We thought they were old, but they were probably the age we are now,# Elma said laughing. #We would shout #Roll up, roll up# to get them to come and see what we had on offer.#After a warm welcome from compère Martin Jefferies and a prayer of thanks for the food, the five-course meal was expertly served by members of the organising committee and their youthful helpers.A raffle, again free of charge, saw a large number of guests receive prizes and no-one was left disappointed as the remainder of the guests received selection boxes.Tarbert’s seniors showed they know how to party as dancers left their seats and enthusiastically took to the floor as soon as the musical entertainment began.A stunned Margaret Henderson was named #Citizen of the Year#, confessing she never expected to win the award.For more than  years, Margaret has collected money to support the Tarbert Sea Food Festival and Music Festival.

Tracey Logan, it is the only way forward for Peebles High.Although it is yet to be officially endorsed by the local authority, Ms Logan says her view is that apart from the Sports Complex and Millennium Wing, the entire school will be demolished and rebuilt.And that Peebles High will jump to the head of the queue in the rebuilding programme of schools - ahead of Galashiels, Hawick and Selkirk.But the Chief Executive told the towns Community Council she thinks Peebles should now be first on the priority list for a new school.Ms Logan explained: ldquoAt the moment my view is, and this is only my view, this has not even endorsed by the Council as yet, is that given the constraints that we have around what will be available financially, the Scottish Government have been really helpful in that they are offering their full support and we will make a bid late spring for funding through the schools programme.ldquoThere will obviously be a financial settlement from the insurance.\"But we need to find the best way forward, so my expectation is that we will retain the Sports Complex because it is undamaged and pretty new, we will also retain the Millennium Wing because again itrsquos not that old and is entirely usable.ldquoI would imagine that we will probably end up taking away everything  and replace it with something new.\"What that will look like, I have no idea. But what it will be is something that is modular that we can add ontowe need to for capacity and we will want to talk to the community about what  we might want to put into that site.A consultation will take place asking for local feedback on community space and the possible provision of health and social care.She added: ldquoSome people have said to me that they want to knock all of the school down including the fairly new bits, realistically that wonrsquot happen and itrsquos not the right thing to do. I think itrsquos important that we make sure people understand the parameters within which we are working so we can have some sensible conversations and that we try and accommodate as much as we can in there.Meanwhile, a major operation is underway to get the students back to their classrooms at the beginning of February.The Chief Executive said: ldquoWe put in arrangements for  plus pupils to be accommodated at locations in Peebles, Galashiels Academy and the Langlee complex.ldquoThat has been generally very successfully and the feedback from that has been positive. I absolutely acknowledge that itrsquos not perfect but it has done the job we needed it do to.Senior students are currently sitting prelim exams in the Sports Complex and this will continue until the end of January.Temporary classroom units are being erected within the school grounds and pupils are to be accommodated in unaffected areas of the building.ldquoThere are still huge amounts of work going on and we will go right up to the wire but Irsquom confident we will achieve it, added Ms Logan.The Council has decided on a phased approach with S to S students starting on Monday, February  and S to S working from home and ing the following day.Ms Logan said that there has been ldquocompromises in the education offer over the last few weeks but is assuring parents that from the beginning of February it will be ldquobusiness as usual.Demolition work on the damaged building has been completed and restricted access has been implemented.The council boss has assured parents that children will only be able to access safe routes throughout the school building.Ms Logan added: ldquoOne of the things we did lose in the fire was the vast majority of pupil toilets so what wersquove now got on site is the long term temporary arrangements supplemented over the course of January.To ensure pupil safety, traffic will enter the site from a new access via Craigerne Road located at the back of the school.Ms Logan is meeting with insurers this week to discuss a settlement figure which will help form the direction of the future of Peebles High School.She added: ldquoAll of what we are doing is going to be sustainable for whatever we do in terms of the proper rebuild.\"What Irsquom trying to reassure you is that wersquore not doing things that are very temporary, whatever we do, we will be looking to the future.Community councillor Graham Mackie commended the local authority on doing a ldquoremarkable job and said any criticism of the Council during this trying time was unnecessary.He said: ldquoIt has been thought for several years that we needed a completely new high school but possibly therersquos a silver lining here in that we can end up with a high school that will meet the needs of the current population.\"But the council chief told members that ldquoessentially this is the replacement.She explained: ldquoWhen it comes to looking at high schools and replacement we would always look to retain what is still workable.\"In the case of the bits we are talking about in terms of Peebles High site they are really not that old. The Millennium Wing meets the standards that would be required in a new building. There would be very little point in wasting money knocking down something that works really well.

This is a fascinating and picturesque structure from the th century, which lies semi-hidden amongst the trees that cling onto the steep sides of the slope.Dunglass is such a beautul area, and the ancient Dunglass Collegiate Church, dating from the th century, is one of its architectural jewels. Itrsquos open to the elements now, but well preserved and a popular place for weddings.The castle that once stood nearby is long gone. A more modern house sits on the spot where a mansion once stood, and before that the castle. Being on the main route south, the castle inevitably saw action during the ious times of war with England, being burned and damaged on a number of occasions in the s.But in August , the castle was effectively blown up in a huge explosion, and a version of events emerged which placed the blame on a vengeful servant called Edward Paris.It was a time of war and religious rage. Thomas the nd Earl of Haddington was leading a Covenanting force charged with defending this important route from the south, as the Covenanting army had entered England a few days earlier. He had established his force at Dunglass Castle, an obvious strategic location, to defend the armyrsquos rear.On that fateful day, August , , he was said to be in conversation with some fellow nobles when a huge explosion erupted from the vaults, instantly demolishing the central part of the castle which became little more than a pile of debris.Thomas and many others were killed, their bodies pulled from the rubble. They had been crushed by the collapse of the walls in the explosion.History has repeatedly recorded the names of the nobles killed on that day, but there were many others, as the castle was busy and full of people. Fty-four unnamed lsquocommon servantsrsquo were killed, and more than  other people badly injured, some later dying of their injuries.Edward Paris was Thomasrsquos servant and he has been blamed for this tragedy. The th-century writer Andrew Stevenson claimed Edward had the keys to the vault in which huge amounts of gunpowder had been stored, and he had been ldquoseduced by the enemies of the covenant to commit this act. He was an Englishman and another account says he was incensed at derogatory remarks made by Thomas about his countrymen.Irsquove always thought this explanation never really had the ring of truth. It was initially deemed an accident, and the story of Edwardrsquos role emerged later, instigated by a writer called William Lithgow, a man who had certain axes to grind. In one account, Edward is said to have thrust a hot poker into the gunpowder or set fire to it. The detail of this is suspect in itself, for who survived as a witness to this act  I suspect that a dreadful accident, possibly caused by incompetence and carelessness, was turned into a deliberate act of vengeance as it made a more useful explanation.Of course, it is very possible that Edward was offended or annoyed at things said by his master, and perhaps he mentioned this at some stage, later to be used as evidence of his guilt. But in truth, most servants will have seen or heard things which will have offended them, it was a part of their job.Imagineservants had been able to write and publish the things they had overheard and seen, what dferent historical narratives we would have!Motives for wanting to interpret the cause of the explosion in this way can be guessed at. It was a time of atrocity and massacre, with religious, political and national hatreds. Who was responsible for the dangerous stockpiling of the gunpowder in such a manner  It seems just too easy to blame a disgruntled servant. Even later, when writing up this period, religious and political loyalties influenced interpretation.If Edward Paris really did venture down to the vaults of Dunglass Castle on that fateful day, with the intention of committing suicide in order to kill his master, along with dozens of others, then he must have been infected with a deep hatred, as well as a total disregard for the lives of his fellow servants and his own.The truth is we will never know what really happened. But Edward Paris is a servant whose name we know. Countless numbers of so-called lsquocommon servantsrsquo whose lives and fates are deemed unimportant by history remain unrecorded just as the things they witnessed remain absent from our history books.Irsquove often thought it would be fascinating to meet Edwardrsquos ghost and ask him what really happened on that day.Silly idea, of course, but you never know."},{"url":null,"title":"public-exhibition-held-plans-revive-dunbars-east-beach","story":"Dunbarrsquos East Beach, which hosts the townrsquos annual Loony Dook, was once a magnet for tourists but the disappearance of its golden sands over the years due to coastal erosion has led to fewer visitors.East Lothian Council has already been given permission for the first phase of work on the beach, which it is hoped will help sandwhile also protecting the shore.A public exhibition detailing plans for a second phase of work ndash and the project overall ndash takes place in Dunbarrsquos Bleachingfield Centre on Monday afternoon.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, explained the desire to see the beach restored to how it was previously.She said: ldquoIt has been a long-held ambition.ldquoPeople reminisce about how wonderful the beach was and there has been a lot of disappointment that it has been so rocky for so long.Dave Northcott, East Lothian Council structural engineer and project leader, visited the community council shortly before Christmas to outline the plans.Consent is already in place for the construction of a breakwater at the southern end of East Beach.Refurbishment of the existing groyne at the same end of the beach has also been approved, alongside the placement of rock armour at the toe of the seawall.

He was said to have been martyred at sea with an anchor round his neck and was therefore regarded as the patron saint of sailors. The cult of Clement spread to Scandinavia in about the th century and then to Britain.ldquoSt Clements Wells were probably named by Scandinavians living in the Tranent area.ldquoWe know they were here because of the presence of a powerful landholder of likely Scandinavian descent, Thor of Tranent, son of Swain, who is mentioned in many th-century charters. He held extensive lands in the area and granted the church of Tranent to Holyrood Abbey.Mr Hadden said: ldquoI am sure the new stone sculptures will add another piece of culture to our area when in place to the east and west sides of Wallyford alongside those we have already.ldquoThese include the mining memorial stone and coal hutches located at St Clements Housing estate just off Salters Road, the  mining stones at the Wallyford Bing, a community woodland depicting dferent mining scenes, and also the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh memorial at the west side of Wallyford.The shapes and patterns proposed relate to the themes of the wells, water, ripples, distilling, agriculture and the sense of space and open skies of the site as it is now. The overall idea is that the artwork reflects past, present and future heritages of the area.There will also be two St Clements Wells name  per entrance in stone, either hand carved or sandblasted.The idea for a stone village sign for Wallyford is also being explored in a design reflecting the ideas of crossing a river or burn by a ford.A spokesman for East Lothian Developments said: ldquoEast Lothian Developments are delighted to be working with Susheila and James to deliver ious artworks at St Clements Wells.ldquoThey have shown real enthusiasm and creativity with the ideas they have brought forward to capture something of the history of St Clements Wells and design pieces which we hope will do justice to the entrances of the development, and spark interest from all those who will pass them.ldquoWe were very grateful to the community council for their comments and input to the designs.Elaine Di Troia was appointed vice-chairman at the AGM, Sharon Jamieson secretary and Beryl Stevenson treasurer.

Christmas time had been dficult because it was the first Christmas without her granny, who had died earlier in the year. But now she was back at school and into the routine with her friends.Her parents had hoped this would help, but her sense of loss was still overwhelming for her. Perhaps at her age she didnrsquot understand exactly what was going on inside, but all she knew was that her granny shersquod loved was gone and she missed her.Then one evening during a bedtime story, Jessica started to cry and told her dad that her granny was melting like a snowman. At first he wasnrsquot sure what she meant, but then he understood.Jessicarsquos memory of her granny was fading. This was a second loss for her. The first loss was of her grannyrsquos physical presence, her actual hugs, her voice and care and love, even the smell of her perfume. Now Jessica was losing her memory of all this and she knew it. So she felt that something inside her was melting too, something that had been so much of her was vanishing.And this made Jessica fear that others in her le could disappear and then melt away as well, even her dad or mum. It was a terrying thought and it made her not just sad but scared and insecure inside.Her dad tried to reassure her that he or her mum werenrsquot going to die, but despite being only six years old, Jessica now knew that such promises couldnrsquot be kept forever.ldquoNana didnrsquot want to die either, but she did. And now shersquos melting.The next day at school was another dficult one for Jessica, and home time often didnrsquot make it better because in the past it had usually been her granny whorsquod picked her up.Her dad was waiting for her.ldquoWe are not going straight home today, he told her.ldquoWhere are we going ldquoTo Nanarsquos seat.A cloud suddenly came over Jessica. She didnrsquot say anything and just looked at the ground. This was a seat that overlooked the sea, where her gran had often taken her. They would sit together and look out to the Firth, spotting boats and looking for whales, while eating sweeties.Her dad had realised that Jessica hadnrsquot been there since the death of her grandmother.ldquoOnlyyou want to, he said.Jessica was silent and looked at the ground. Inside, her emotions were spinning. Then she looked up.ldquoI donrsquot want to, it will just make me sad, she said to her dad. So they didnrsquot go.But later that day, Jessica began to talk about Nanarsquos seat. ldquoShe always gave me sweeties and wersquod look for whales and pirates. She told me a story about how a pirate once landed here at Prestonpans, but he didnrsquot leave treasure, he just built the town.ldquoGreat story, said her dad.The next day, Jessica agreed to go to her nanarsquos seat. When they arrived, she hesitated to sit and had a wave of emotion.ldquoI miss Nana, she saidldquoSo do I. Shall we sit on her seat and miss her together.ldquoBut we have to eat sweeties.ldquoJust so happens Irsquove got some in my pocket, said the dad with a smile. His daughter smiled back and sat on the seat. Her dad joined her.ldquoNo, dad, that was Nanarsquos place, you sit this side instead.And so they sat, missing Nana together, being sad together, but also remembering her together.ldquoCan you tell me the story about the pirate  asked the dad.ldquoDonrsquot want to.ldquoOK, maybe next time.The next day, they ed to Nanarsquos seat. This time, Jessica told a bit of the pirate story. The dad remembered it from his childhood and realised that his own grief in losing his mother had closed him down to talking about her. It had felt too painful.He began to sit on lsquoNanarsquos seatrsquo by himself when Jessica was at school, even though he had never done it with his mother when she was alive he had always been lsquotoo busy to watch the sea with her.

At home, they made a special box with drawings and photos of memories, and things that reminded Jessica of her gran. Theyrsquod take them out and tell stories and share memories. Her dad even began to tell funny stories about his mum from when before Jessica was born, when he was a boy.lsquoNanarsquos boxrsquo was put in a safe place, but where Jessica could take itshe wanted to. As time passed, she opened it less, but it was always in her room. Sometimes she would put things in it, such as shells from the beach, because her granny had loved beautul shells.The loss of a loved one can never be completely moved on from, so there were always going to be times of sadness.

But Boris Johnson now has an -seat majority, so therersquos not a cat in hellrsquos chance that Westminster would agree to Scotland seceding from the Union. Which raises the question of what to do next.Alex Neil, the former Scottish minister, says Sturgeon should press ahead anyway. So whatWestminster ignores the referendum result, he says. It would stand as a measure of the Scottish peoplersquos will. ldquoThe political argument would be, he said on BBC radio, ldquowersquove won.It is going to be very dficult for the First Minister to disagree. But that is probably what shersquoll do. Her argument has anyway changed recently. She is not actually arguing for an immediate referendum any more, but for Holyrood to be given the power to call a referendum in future.That is harder for Boris Johnson to reject, but reject it he has. No referendum for now or in the foreseeable future. Do your worst. Itrsquos not going to happen.If Sturgeon takes the OrsquoNeill advice and holds a consultative referendum, the UK Government will reject it as invalid. The non-nationalist parties will advise unionists to boycott it, as unionists did in the  Catalonian referendum. This would fatally undermine its legitimacy.Nationalists might say: a result is a result. Why bother about people who wonrsquot vote  What about the force of democratic opinion  But it is naiumlve to believe that Westminster parties will respond positively to any unauthorised referendum.Earlier this week, Lisa Nandy, one of the leading Labour leadership contenders, told The Andrew Neil Show that the UK should look to Catalonia for lessons on how to beat ldquoisive nationalism.We are assured that Nandy did not mean that riot policy should be used against peaceful demonstrators or that elected Scottish politicians should be locked up. But it was still an astonishing remark.:Alistair Grant: Scotlands endless Indyref Groundhog Day is going nowhere fastPost-Brexit, metropolitan attitudes have hardened markedly against independence and ldquoisive nationalism. Nicola Sturgeon will eventually have to recognise that the Westminster route to independence is barred for the foreseeable future.The precedent of the  Edinburgh Agreement will not necessarily be recognised following Brexit. Britainrsquos departure from the EU has changed the game.In , no-one thought the UK would be leaving the EU. Scotland and England would be remaining in the European Single Market and the Customs Union even after independence. Not any more. There would now be the question of a hard border at Gretna.But more importantly, the Global Britain project would be fatally damagedthe UK were to lose one-third of its landmass, most of its hydrocarbons and all its nuclear weapons. Itrsquos just not gonna happen. We are in a dferent era.The UK state can no longer afford to endorse Scotlandrsquos departure from the Union. Even Labour is now locking the door. This means there is not going to be a legal indyref, possibly for a very long time. Not after , probably not after .Brexit Britain will not let Scotland go, unless there is overwhelming support for independence, which frankly there isnrsquot. Nicola Sturgeon may insist that the will of the people will triumph in the end. That there is no point in holding referendums that donrsquot mean anything.But she canrsquot in all honestly keep telling her troops that indyref is round the corner.

Thompson was on The Andrew Marr Show yesterday. He was deemed such a VIP the producers showed footage of him arriving at New Broadcasting House in London, an honour usually reserved for visiting Prime Ministers and the like. Not that you would confuse Mr Thompson with a politician: the Starbucks coffee cup marked him out as an easy like Sunday morning meeja type.: Unionist boycott should not invalidate voteMarr began by flattering his former boss. When Thompson arrived at the NYT it was an old fashioned news empire in pretty ropey shape, he said, ldquoa classic case of the inevitable decline of the mainstream media. But Thompson had turned things around, doubling revenue and attracting five million subscribers. How Three things, said Thompson. First, they took on  more journalists to boost content. ldquoIf you can be dferent, and this in a way is the Netflix tactic, pour money into content, make great content, then yoursquoll get customers. Next, more hiring: this time of software engineers. Third, the running of the main print paper was given over to a handful of people.With the Sunday papers full of Harry and Meghan leaving the UK to spend most of their time in North America, Thompson was askedthe couple could expect a quieter time from the media there. ldquoMuch of the American press is much more high-minded than the British press, he said, showing he has not lost the ability, common in BBC director generals, of getting right up the noses of the red tops.Thompson was visiting just as the BBC is living through another period of interesting times. There were murmurings from the Conservatives during the General Election about decriminalising non-payment of the licence fee and forcing the BBC not to scrap free TV licences for the over-s. Now the party has a large majority it is in a position to make its threats real.: Question Time row rumbles onDecriminalising would cost the BBC pound-pound million, Thompson estimated. Something  was going on, he feared. ldquoI worry that decriminalisation is a de facto beginning of the abolition of the licence fee but without the courage to say that, and put it out to the public to say whether or not they want a properly funded BBC or not.As for scrapping free licences for the over-s, Thompson recalled the same idea being put to him by the Coalition Government. ldquoThey came with a drop dead, wersquore going to do this, back in .Thompson walked out of the meeting and got on the train home to Oxford. On the way he started to mentally compose his resignation letter.The phone went: it was Jeremy Hunt, then Culture Secretary, asking him toand continue talking.Years later, when the Conservatives won a majority on their own, the Chancellor behind the first proposal, George Osborne, came calling again. This time he got his way. By then, Thompson was in New York.Back to the present day and talk of the future. The BBC, like all ldquolegacy media had to attract a younger audience, said Thompson. ldquoIf we donrsquot radically change and start thinking about the audience of the future the risk is we age out with a given generation of people and we all are beaten by companies like Netflix.Commercial media in the UK, like in most European countries, was in ldquoreal trouble, said Thompson, with local journalism in danger of disappearing. If you were waiting to hear him tackled on the BBCrsquos part in commercial mediarsquos woes, hard luck.: How local is your MPThompsonrsquos time at the head of the BBC coincided not just with introducing ratings giants such as Strictly Come Dancing and Sherlock, and presiding over successes such as the iPlayer. Under his watch the BBC used public money, the licence fee, to fund a massive expansion into digital, taking readers and advertisers from local papers. Yet there was no reference to this, which was disappointing from Marr, who started out in Scottish papers.Nor was there specic mention of Scotland. Instead, Thompson mused about how the BBC could help the government. ldquoWhen I listen to the new prime minister talking about his plans to really get serious about investing in the Midlands and the north, and to start projecting this countryrsquos talent, ideas, its potential to the entire world, I think of the BBC and Channel  as potentially great allies in that.Doubtless Channel , whose flagship news show, like the Today programme, is being frozen out by Downing Street, will have something to say about that."},{"url":null,"title":"Marianne Taylor  Megxit - the scary post-Brexit home truths","story":"Clearly, Harry and Meghan arenrsquot so much stepping back from royal le as checking out completely, with a flick of the Vs that could be taken to signy peace, victory or what those of us fluent in Parliamo Glasgow would recognise as ldquoget it up ye.:Harry and Meghan will not use HRH titles or get royal funds - palaceSafe to say I wonrsquot be spending too much time fretting over the future happiness of this super-rich celebrity couple.

In fact, itrsquos getting downright scary, especially as every week the narrative seems to sht closer to the isive and damaging - but also very deliberate - culture wars being waged in Trumprsquos America.We witnessed this first hand over the last couple of weeks with the grim spectacle of groups of well-spoken middle class white men, mostly of a certain age, being rounded up and brought into television studios to sit on sofas next to black women and explain to them not only what racism is and is not, but also why theirlived experiences of it are worthless. And, when the women speakers pointed out the irony and injustice of this set-up  Calm down dear, yoursquore getting hysterical.Question Time provided perhaps the most eye-watering example of this when actor Lawrence Fox - who had been invited to sit in the ldquovoice of the people chair - unleashed a shocking but very revealing attack on a mixed-race member of the audience who suggested Meghan Marklersquos treatment by the media and others had been racist.:The curse of the House of Windsor: how love has torn apart the royal familyMr Fox, a Harrow-educated member of an established acting dynasty known for his role in the detective series Lewis, tore into the woman - who it turns out is an academic researcher in race and ethnicity - talking over her, aggressively calling the suggestion of racism ldquoboring, adding imperiously: ldquoWersquore the mostly tolerant, lovely country in the world.\" The actor compounded matters by using the tired and predictable ldquoyoursquore the racist defence when quite reasonably questioned on how a spfing white chap like him could be so sure about what racism is and is not.:Netflix chief confirms interest in deal with Harry and MeghanI donrsquot doubt that from Mr Foxrsquos privileged perch, Britain is indeed tolerant and lovely. It is certainly still tolerant of and shockingly reverent towards posh types like him who ignorantly and arrogantly skip through le with a wealthy family to pick them upthings donrsquot go their way. Laughably, most of the similar types Irsquove met in le honestly believe they earn their opportunities on merit.The ennui of privilege, eh  They tend to be bored with uppity totty of all races, of course. Theyrsquore probably terribly fed up with feckless poor people banging on about foodbanks, and moany, chippy Jocks, too.Itrsquos the soaring confidence of such attacks and pronouncements that really concerns me, however, the increasingly loud and proud tone of them, the whf of US right-wing s like Fox News, Breitbart and One American News Network.Indeed, rather than apologising or stepping back from his embarrassingly outburst on Question Time, Mr Fox, who has been roundly criticised by his profession, saw fit to launch a defence of his actions, including a barrage of mocking, wince-inducing tweets packed with right-wing US tropes around ldquoliberals and ldquowokeness. Whatrsquos going on  We simply wouldnrsquot have tolerated such behaviour in public  years ago.But with Boris Johnson in Number , a man who defends his writings about ldquopiccaninnies with ldquowater melon smiles, ldquobum boys ldquogirly swats and how voting Tory will ldquogive your we bigger breasts, I suppose such behaviour has both permission and a champion.Make no mistake, the faction of the Tory party that has taken over Britain in the wake of Brexit will revel in and stoke culture wars of this kind. It feels threatened by attacks on pale, male stale dominance, of course. But such isiveness also works as the ultimate distraction technique, stealing our focus away from the deliberate running down of public services, the re-writing of the social contract.And so far itrsquos working a treat."},{"url":null,"title":"eu-says-brussels-might-not-ready-start-post-brexit-trade-talks-uk-march","story":"The European Commission said it would \"take some time\" for the bloc to agree its position.The prospect of trade talks not commencing until March would add even more pressure for an extension to the negotiating period as the talks period in effect runs until the end of July because of the time it will take for the  member states to raty the Brexit deal through their parliaments and assemblies.Nonetheless, Boris Johnson has repeatedly insisted that a deal must be reached by the end of December.Eric Mamer, the European Commission spokesman, said the process of agreeing the EUs position could only begin after Brexit.\"This, we know, will take some time, which is why we have said we will start negotiations as quickly as we can, but it will certainly not be before the end of February, beginning of March,\" he explained.\"This is not a slowing down or speeding up of the process.

Only one point for talking as its hardly worth mentioning now. Two points for checking the time on their brightly lit mobile phone. Three points for checking Facebook or searching a website.Four points for taking a phone call during the movie. And five points for taking a selfie with the flash on.I earned  points at a screening of Its a Wonderful Le a few days before Christmas. I believe people have, generally, become more inconsiderate as going out to the cinema has become cheaper. Cinema loyalty cards are a brilliant idea but, when youre not physically handing over cash for a ticket, it feels less important an experience. Folk behave as though theyre in their living rooms.\"Do you want some of this flask of tea \" called one of a family of six along the row behind us at Its A Wonderful Le. There was lots of chat in reply about said flask. The two youngest members of the family talked incessantly about nothing. Two older women with them were similarly having a right old chinwag. My friend asked the two younger ones to please be quiet. They ignored the request and kept going.\"Shut up!\" shouted someone from along the row. I cracked towards the end of the film and askedthey could please, please be quiet for just five minutes. \"Well try two and see how we get on,\" said the older woman, sarcastically, as the young adults sniggered. \"So rude,\" snapped the other older woman, to me. Its meant to be a nicer crowd at the Glasgow Film Theatre but standards have clearly slipped.The two women spent the last minutes of the film having a bellowing sing-a-long. It was bonkers but bog standard cinema behaviour.Back to the theatre though, and I was gutted at the ballet being utterly ruined.Ballet is not an art form thats for everyone. But even with bored children - and I do sympathise - its a good le lesson to learn to sit politely and be aware of your impact on other people. Its brilliant to get children interested and involved in the theatre but its one thing to be talking about the performance and another to just chat away like youre in your house.Its time to take a stand rather than just moaning about it after the fact. Complain, complain, complain to venues as the inconsiderate behaviour is happening.Venues: Can we have ushers, please  If people cant behave then they need babysat. And take a one strike approach. One complaint and youre out.Theatre and the cinema are secular churches, places where we gather together socially to think about about society, culture, experiences other than our own.

Water slides have been erected in other cities across the world, including in Bristol.As with other city frameworks, the Blythswood plan includes cutting down on the number of cars, creating ldquoedge of city centre parking along the M corridor and enhancing pedestrian and cycling routes.It states candidate sites formulti-storey car parking are adjacent to Anderston Station, off the M and Clydeside Expressway, to serve thecity centre, Anderston Station andSEC Hydro and over the M, north of Sauchiehall Street.The possibility of turning more rooftops into green spaces should be investigated, the report adds.Work on Blythswood Court, described as a ldquobadly integrated, unattractive s structure with lots of vacant spaces, is a priority.In the short term, the report suggests the empty spaces ldquoshould be programmed with s thatenliven the complex, such as start-up businesses, day care, non-profit organisations and artistsrsquo studios.However, longer term ldquothe proposal is to radically restructure the lower levels of the building, or possibly completely redevelop the complex.Buildings such as Alexander ldquoGreek Thomsonrsquos St Vincent Street Church and the Mitchell Library, which is ldquoblighted by the M, warrant ldquospecial care and attention.There are also plans to re-populate Blythswood by adapting and re-using upper floors, re-purposing Georgian townhouses and providing a mix of housing for students, young professionals, families and elderly people.Meanwhile, the George Square plans would involve the site becoming car-free, with two sides closed to all traffic.The proposal would see the east side of the square outside the City Chambers and the opposite end at Merchants House fully shypedestrianised, with the two longer sides used for buses, taxis, private hires and cycles only, between am and pm.The first changes,approved, which remove all parking spaces around the square, are planned to be in place by this summer.The idea is to make some changes before the European Championship football matches at Hampden Park in June and remove all the parking spaces currently around three sides of the square, creating more space for people.The council carried out a consultation exercise last year asking shypeople what they wanted the square to be used for and what changes they would like to see to improve the square.The findings from the consultation, which had more than , responses, included a reduction in traffic or an element of pedestrianisation, a more sustainable green space and a place to sit or relax.The estimated cost for the proposed George Square works is between poundmillion to poundm.

Nine times out of  its celebrity list is an archetypal poster person of the morally superior left, so when they have someone on who is not, it makes their comments all the more interesting.I chuckled at his answer on his climate footprint, albeit I am certain it will be lost on the colleagues he mocked. But it was his exchange with Rachel Boyle, a lecturer in race ethnicity, on the media treatment of the Duchess which captured the headlines and provoked mass Twitter hysteria.Foxrsquos comments deserve a calmer airing. He is saying thatsomeone shouts racism the decent amongst us are increasingly expected to accept it and stay quiet.White people donrsquot understand racism, so shut up about it. But where does that get us, in the end, other than to the point where certain people are effectively prohibited from talking about certain issues in polite society I confess that I thought twice about choosing this topic for this column for precisely that reason. It will give me nothing but trouble. Irsquoll get tweets and emails which wonrsquot be nice to read, and for which a thick skin will be required.:Queen lsquosupportiversquo of lsquonew lersquo for Harry and MeghanHowever, I canrsquot accept that here in Britain, which has spread freedom of speech all over the world, we should be fearful of practising it ourselves.In truth, I donrsquot knowBritain is a racist country. I instinctively recognise Britain as a global leader in tolerance and integration, but self-criticism is integral to ensuring that it doesnrsquot become complacent.I suppose it depends on onersquos definition. Are there racists  Of course, but that would make every country in the world racist by definition, and there is a good argument to be made that the digital loudspeaker of social media has brought into public the behaviour that was always taking place amongst a small minority in private.But those people are the lowest of our society, and Irsquom not sure we can label our country according to their behaviour. So is there, then, racist-enabling behaviour by people who should know better  Yes, and of course the oft-quoted example is Boris Johnsonrsquos ldquoletter-boxes description of Muslim women wearing the Niqab. I do not think that the Prime Minister is racist, but I do think that people in a lofty position need to understand the effect that their language could have on the way others behave.What we are insinuating in the case of the Duchess, though, is altogether dferent. We are saying that Britain is an institutionally racist country. With that I confess, I have some trouble.In deconstructing her media coverage, there are elements of no doubt and elements of doubt.It is of no doubt that her coverage has, since her wedding, been diametrically opposed to that of her sister-in-law the Duchess of Cambridge. Thatrsquos perfectly obvious, and those who hold up a mirror to the sympathetic ndash some might say sycophantic ndash coverage Kate received when she ldquolovingly cradled her baby bump, comparing it to the ldquowhy canrsquot Meghan stop touching her bump  headlines are correct. There is no shortage of other examples.That the coverage is dferent is in no doubt. But, surely, we are capable of having a deeper and calmer conversation about why the coverage is dferent. Because we have jumped a step here. We have said the headlines are dferent , ergo the British press is racist . We have not analysed why the coverage is dferent .Now, it is imperative that as part of our considerations of step two we include race. Becausethe Duchess of Sussexrsquos media coverage is dferent to that of the Duchess of Cambridge because of her race, then that is a matter of national seriousness which would require a seismic response.:From crowns to contracts...what lies ahead for Harry and Meghan Butit is not because of that ndashit is for entirely unrelated reasons ndash then it is dangerous for us to blindly accept that it is.What other reasons might there be Well, let us remember that when the relationship began her media coverage was excellent indeed it was seen universally as being a welcome development that Harry was in a relationship with a person of mixed race.But the press then began to believe that Meghan Markle is not a royalist. Right or wrong, they now see someone who doesnrsquot love or respect the traditions of the Royal Family, who doesnrsquot enjoy her role within it, who doesnrsquot relish being an understudy to the more senior members of it, and who acts out the ldquoDuchess Dficult persona in reality.For the record, I am not a Royalist either. Although Irsquom not hugely exercised by the existence of the Royals or their role in our constitution, I am a republican. Butthere is one thing around which the British press unites it is its Royalism. So perhaps it is little wonder it takes a dimmer view of the Duchess of Sussex than it does of the Duchess of Cambridge.And herersquos the critical point. If that is why the press treats her badly, then that may be unfair, but it is not racist because it has nothing to do with her race. When the Duchess of Cornwall, for instance, endured years, decades, of negative coverage, self-evidently nobody suspected the press had a race issue.I know the press Irsquove worked with them for the best part of two decades. I need to be persuaded that journalists and headline writers have Meghan Marklersquos skin colour in their minds when they are writing about her.ButI am wrong, then letrsquos hear it. Letrsquos talk about it. Calmly. Letrsquos see evidence. If I canrsquot spot discrimination because Irsquom not subject to it, I need to know how to do better.

If I get to  that will be it. “ButI still have my health, I might just carry on for another few years...”It’s clear that leaving the SSPCA would be a huge wrench for Sharon so I wouldn’t put bets on her leaving in three years!During her time with the society, Sharon and David have had two boys, Ronnieand Greg . They also have a grandson, Ronnie jnr who is now .But Sharon also brought her work home with her and the couple are now also “mum and dad” to three dogs, two of which Sharon hand-reared, and three cats.“There’s always one or two that pull at your heart-strings,” she said, by way of explanation for their very own menagerie!However, there’s one dog which she didn’t adopt which also brings a tear to her eye.“A wee puppy came in with PAVO virus whom we called Paddy,” she recalled.“He was a wee black and white lurcher type who was at death’s door.“I stayed in the kennels with him for three or four nights and, at one point, he did actually die.“We resuscitated him though and after about eight weeks we got him back on his feet and rehomed.“Seven years later, I was doing my shopping in Dundee when I heard this commotion.“This dog squeezed itself out of a passenger window, ran across the road and jumped right into my arms.“It was Paddy the police officer who rehomed him was on the opposite side of the street from me but the dog saw me, remembered me and was determined to come and say hello.“It was amazing that he remembered me after all that time – they don’t forget the kindness you show them.“A lot of the animals we care for are more than happy to come back for visits with us. They realise its a sanctuary for them so they are more than happy to come back and say hello.“I’ll always remember that day with Paddy though in . He’s now long gone but I’ll never forget him.”Sharon has witnessed many changes over the years and longs for the day when people finally stop being cruel to their animals.However, she knows that, until that day, the SSPCA will be there to help them.She added: “Behind every animal, there’s a human story too.“The biggest problem, other than cruelty cases, that we see is people with mental health issues.“They love their animals but maybe start with a pregnant cat, keep all the kittens and then end up with  or  in their home.“They can’t bear to be parted with them and end up in a dficult situation.“It’s heart-breaking to hear some of those human stories but, at the end of the day, we are here to look after the animals.“Over the years, I’ve seen thousands and thousands of animals who have been nursed back to good health and rehomed.“I’m really, really lucky. Not many people can say they’ve worked in their dream job for  years but I still wake up every day and feel blessed.”SSPCA could not operate without generosity of the publicToday, the SSPCA has nine animal rescue and rehoming centres and a world-leading wildle rescue centre at Fishcross in Clackmannanshire.The charity receives no government funding and relies on donations and grants to continue its work. The public funds the SSPCA’s £ million budget annually.That covers the cost of  employees, including  inspectors,  ambulance drivers and the -strong team at its centres across Scotland and its wildle sanctuary. The SSPCA is the only animal charity in the UK able to report animal cruelty cases to the Crown, with reports sent to the Procurator Fiscal Service.In , it found homes for  rescued animals, helped more than  wildle casualties and spoke to more than , children through its educational programmes.For every pound it receives, p is spent on animal welfare, p on fundraising and promotion and p on administration.So you can rest assured that the bulk of any donation you make will make a huge dference to the animals in the SSPCA’s care.Last year, its animal helpline received almost a quarter of a million calls, the inspectorate attended more than , incidents and more than , animals were cared for across its nine rescue and rehoming centres and at the national wildle rescue centre.To find out more or donate, visit www.scottishspca.org."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish charity worker surpasses his 50 000 running home target","story":"Even Mark Calder wasn#t surehe#d be able to pull off his mammoth  challenge. In January last year, we featured his incredible aim to run  ultramarathons along some of Scotland’s ancient pilgrim routes.The Running Home  challenge combined his two passions – running and his work with charity Embrace the Middle East, for which he is regional manager for Scotland and the north of England.He hoped to raise £, to rebuild war-torn areas of Iraq while covering the  miles, gathering support and funds along the way.While there were times when Mark didn’t think he’d see the finish line, he successfully completed the challenge.He also surpassed his fundraising tally – with £, currently banked.And he’s hopeful that even more funds will be amassed before he travels to Iraq this spring to see it put to good use.Marksaid: “There were occasions when I wanted to go home.“I knew,I was to quit, I was going home to a nice, comfortable house. The people I was running for don’t have that option.“That was a monumental reason to keep going.”Mark had extraordinary support along the way, not least from his crew – Gareth Brocklebank and Andrew Clarke – who followed him in a camper van, which also acted as shelter in areas where overnight BB stays were not an option.Mark’s we Karen and his two daughters also cheered him every step of the way as did many strangers.“People welcomed me into their churches and communities and generously donated large sums of money,” he said.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fetoday webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Zimeng with piano teacher Sister Avril and trustee Maggie Picken.\"  Fe charity marks  years helping blind people viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"FFPL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"FFPL | Article Teaser\"“I was invited to speak in venues I would never have been able to reach in my day job, Iona Abbey being one.“It was a fantastic way to spread the word about Embrace the Middle East.“I look back on it not with a sense of pride, but rather relief – and gratitude for the people and places I encountered along the way.”Divine inspiration also came from a meeting with Father Emanuel Youkhana, a Christian minister who works in Dohuk in Iraq to bring Christians, Muslims and Yazidis together.Mark said: “To see his energy and enthusiasm for what we were doing was a massive inspiration.“That was at the end of Run , the St Ninian run, when I was at my most tired.“To have that intervention made a really big dference.”That particular run had loomed large in Mark’s mind it was the equivalent of running three marathons each day for seven days.Remarkably, though, he only lost one day to ill-health throughout the year.“I’ve learned that your body can adapt to whatever is thrown at it,” said Mark.“I wasn’t sureI’d be able to make it to the end of that run but when I hobbled over the finish line, that’s when I knew I could do it.”The darkest day of the challenge was undoubtedly in June during the St Columba run from Inchcolm Abbey to Iona Abbey.“It was one of the most interesting runs in terms of scenery, with just about every landscape Scotland has to offer,” he said.“There was a long, unsupported section just north of Oban. I was feeling great but, within ten minutes, a niggle turned into barely being able to walk.“I had to find a couple of sticks from the woods to use as shin splints.”However, it was an earlier, shorter run – St Cuthbert’s in March – which cost Mark a full day and also taught him a very valuable lesson.“I wanted to run from Melrose to Lindisfarne, where I planned to stay overnight, but I had to be there for a certain time due to the tide restrictions.“I got lost early on and was chasing my tail for the rest of the day. I started pushing really hard and ended up lost in the hills for  minutes, with no water, torchlight or phone charge.“I rushed checkpoints and didn’t take the time to check my kit properly.“I was dehydrated, didn’t stay on Lindisfarne and lost a whole day because of it.“It taught me a very good lesson – that I couldn’t do it alone and that these runs were pilgrimages, not races.“I had my tail between my legs the next couple of days but the reception at Durham Cathedral reminded me of what I was doing and why.”Mark enjoyed a similar reception at the Forth Bridges, where supporters and family joined forces to cheer him on before he reached the finish line in St Andrews on November .The following day, he addressed parishioners in St Leonard’s Church.It was the perfect place to end Running Home as St Andrews was once such a centre of pilgrimage.Mark took a breather to enjoy Christmas and New Year but has a busy  planned.He added: “I’m heading to Iraq in the spring to see how the money is being spent.“I also plan to revisit some of the places and people I met this year, by car though!“I passed through a lot of villages that were torched in the Highland Clearances.“People were forced out of their homes, and in some cases country, so there’s a sense of solidarity there with today’s refugees.“I was conscious of not being able to spend much time in places where I got a great deal of support.“So I’m hoping to revisit some of those communities, combining storytelling and traditional folk music to consolidate the friendships I made this year.”Karen is not keen for Mark to pull his running shoes back on too soon, but he will be taking on the York Marathon in October.

While the Government continues to dither, local people will feel the impact as we move from being rule makers to rule takers.“Last week I spoke in the house about the risks that new tarfs and trade barriers could have for businesses in the Northern Isles. Food and drink production are a staple part of the isles economy. The impact that continued and intensied tarfs could have on rural communities is signicant and organisations such as the SWA are understandably concerned.“This could be just a taste of what is to come as we leave the EU and our economic clout is reduced. If there were any doubt about the limits of our leverage in future trade negotiations with the US, this is a reminder of the precarious position that the Government is putting us in.“I will be writing to the Secretary of State for International Trade to explain what efforts they are making on these tarfs as a matter of urgency. With the UK losing our seat at the table in these trade talks at the end of this month, the next two weeks are crucial.

It has stood the test of time since the dawn of recorded history. It was copied by the artists of the Renaissance and also by the great powers of later centuries when they wished to display grandeur. And it was created in celebration of something vitally important – the victory of democracy over tyranny.The Parthenon in Athens – the building, with its beautully fluted columns that can be seen all over the world from the US Capitol in Washington to the British Museum in London, and its utterly astonishing sculptures of the most le-like stone figures – simply has no rival.: Matthew Taylor: To keep hold of friends in Europe, we must be prepared to lose our Marbles: Tfany Jenkins: Parthenon marbles should stay However, as many will know, its sculptures are not whole. About half are in the British Museum, where they were once known, ludicrously, as the Elgin Marbles, after the Scottish aristocrat who took them from Athens more than  years ago. That’s a bit like renaming Michelangelo’s David after a wealthy business tycoon who somehow managed to acquire it. For the record, it was ordered built by the Athenian general Pericles and the actual work, which began in BC, was led by the sculptor Phidias.About half the sculptures are still in Athens, where they are beautully displayed within sight of the Parthenon in the Acropolis Museum, but there are also smaller pieces scattered around half a dozen museums in Europe.Ancient Greeks would understandPolls show a sizable majority of British people – by two-to-one or more – support helping the restoration of this most precious piece of art by ing the London sculptures to Athens but, understandably, it’s not high on the agenda of many voters and, therefore, politicians. Given they were fellow democrats, the ancient Athenians would probably understand.Andthey seem rather distant, then look at the faces of the figures on the frieze because it is possible that these are representations of actual people – the  Athenians killed at the Battle of Marathon, a victory over an invading Persian army that saved the city’s democracy.However, Brexit has created a situation in which the interests of Boris Johnson’s government are aligned with those who value the Parthenon as a symbol of democracy, as a work of art or both.The UK’s impending orce from the European Union has already created some bad blood and there is a real risk that relations could deteriorate further despite considerable goodwill of sensible people in both camps.Returning the “Elgin Marbles” would be a disarming and unexpected gesture, a parting gt of huge signicance. The British tabloids would ridicule the idea, with the predictable and unthinking joke about Johnson “losing his marbles”. So it might take the likes of Johnson’s oft-maligned aide Dominic Cummings, as a fan of the wisdom of “weirdos and misfits”, to see that it makes sense in a perhaps unconventional way.It would create signicant goodwill towards the UK and not just in Greece. Returning the sculptures to Athens would spark national celebrations in a country that has suffered far more than the UK following the  financial crash and which has struggled to cope with the exodus of refugees fleeing the war in Syria.Restoration, rather than Greece already has some British heroes, like the poet Byron, who fought for Greek independence from the Ottoman empire in the s, and Edward Codrington, the British admiral who destroyed an Ottoman and Egyptian fleet in the key Battle of Naino in . Johnson’s name could be added to the list.There is considerable bad feeling in Greece towards the EU after Brussels insisted on swingeing austerity infor vast bailout payments following the  crash. But,the EU was seen as assisting in the reunication of the Parthenon sculptures, it would help Brussels restore much of its lost reputation.None of the arguments against reunication stand scrutiny. Some claim it would set a precedent that would clear almost every museum in the world. It’s not a precedent, museums have ed items on a case-by-case basis without causing any kind of flood.And this is also not the same as ing the Stone of Destiny, a single thing, to Scotland because that’s where it was made. Instead the “Elgin Marbles” are large and important fragments of an extraordinary whole that should be put back together.This should happen for the sake of democracy and art but now also because of the vital need for Brexit Britain to preserve good relations with the ideological descendants of the ancient Athenians, the democracies of Europe.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"the evidence that shows what scotland needs to do on air pollution dr richard dixon","story":"Air quality monitoring stations have revealed the most polluted streets in Scotland, writes Dr Richard Dixon.At the weekend, Friends of the Earth released our annual round up of the most polluted streets in Scotland. We found seven sites breaking European or Scottish standards designed to protect health. The overall the picture hasn’t changed much, with some sites showing an increase and some showing a decrease.It is perhaps too early to see the impact of the Low Emission Zonein Glasgow, with no clear picture from the measurements across the city and Hope Street still the most polluted street in Scotland.Our number crunching is based on the official air pollution data produced by fixed, automatic monitoring stations. This network is rather sparse so many councils carry out more detailed monitoring from time to time, which means there are actually many more sites which fail the standards around Scotland. These results show there are still  official pollution zones across Scotland, in  of our  local council areas.: Edinburgh roads named among Scotland’s most polluted streets: York to ban ‘non-essential’ private car journeys in city centre by  to cut carbon emissionsLast year was the first year of Glasgow’s LEZ and it required only a very slight improvement in the emissions from buses in the city centre, but this year a much more signicant improvement is specied, meaning we should see a real improvement in the  pollution levels. However, evenevery bus were emissions-free this would still not be enough to meet standards everywhere, so the LEZ will be extended to taxi, lorries and cars over the next few years.Data reveals main culpritsThere will also be LEZs in Aberdeen, Dundee and Edinburgh from the end of this year. The proposals so far are a pretty mixed bag, with Dundee planning not to include its most polluted street in its zone and Edinburgh proposing a complex two-tier plan which is in danger of displacing city centre pollution into streets further out.Six of the seven sites which fail do so because levels of nitrogen dioxide are too high. The seventh fails because levels of small particles are too high. This is Salamander Street in Edinburgh. When the people who analyse the data do a review each year they often decide the final average for the year for this site is slightly lower than the provisional figures we are working from, so it is possible that Salamander Street will go from a bit over the standard to slightly under. Either way, and annoyingly for me, this is just round the corner from where I live.There have been several sources suggested for the high levels of small particle pollution at Salamander Street. It is the closest monitoring site to the sea and sea spray throws off fine particles. There has been, and will continue to be, lots of building work in the area. There are ships in the docks which run their generators and industrial operations which use stationary diesel engines, as well as large open piles of fine aggregate lying about. And of course there is plenty of traffic, including HGVs travelling between the A or the Edinburgh Bypass and Leith.A simple graph of average pollution during the week helps show the main culprits. Pollution grows from a low overnight level from about am, plateauing during the day and then tailing off again in late afternoon. Pollution is very much lower at the weekend than during the week. Although there is a clear signature of traffic pollution, there is also signicant pollution coming from Leith Docks, mostly from activities during weekday working hours. There is to be a new air quality strategy launched this year. It will need to be much tougher than what we have had so far.Dr Richard Dixon is director of Friends of the Earth Scotland©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"why a small rural us state is vital in presidential race henry mcleish","story":"As the first state to hold a caucus or primary to choose the Democrat who will take on Donald Trump, Iowa has an inflated status that one critic claimed was a #crime against democracy#, writes Henry McLeish.For a country that traditionally holds its politics, democracy and governance in such low regard, America appears to enjoy its elections and endless campaigning. This presidential race will have run for nearly two years before culminating in the election on  November, . Before then, America will hold five months of primaries or caucuses in every state of the Union, Washington DC and US territories to select presidential candidates for the November contest. The Republican nomination is a foregone conclusion. The Democratic nomination is not.Iowa, the ‘Hawkeye state’, which few people in the UK have heard of and even fewer have ever visited, lies between Nebraska, Missouri, Illinois and Wisconsin. The state’s caucus attracts a huge amount of media coverage, creates a vast amount of polling data and political debate and,precedent is anything to go by, provides a reasonable insight into who will eventually win the presidential race.: Donald Trump’s resort hosts just  weddings in seven years: Why Donald Trump should read Robert Burns’ poem To a Louse – Henry McLeishAt this time of year when the US election machine is rapidly cranking up, why does Iowa figure so prominently in the minds of pundits, pollsters and politicians  Iowa was the first state to hold a caucus in . Despite the efforts of the two main parties to persuade  states to give up caucuses and move to primaries, which are better organised, more democratic and less archaic, Iowa continues to defy this advice. MomentumThe Iowa caucus takes place on  February and will be the first time in this marathon election campaign that voters have a say: this probably explains the importance of Iowa, it is the first real votes being cast, it is the first state in the Union to offer a view on the condition of America – so it is not an opinion poll.The controversy over so much importance being given to Iowa as the first state to have a real poll has not diminished the interest or enthusiasm on the part of Democratic candidates, desperate to secure that first endorsement or a decent showing, and secure a positive impact on the rest of their campaign.But the stakes are high. The outcome may confirm or rebut early polling results. For Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg, who are leading the polls for the Democratic nomination, victory in Iowa would create momentum, a sense of legitimacy and electability, and provide a considerable psychological boost eventhere is no doubt that Iowa is not a microcosm of America.For those doing less well, Iowa could force them to rethink their campaign or quit the race.There is a body of opinion that the importance of Iowa as the first test of public opinion can be overblown and that the primary in New Hampshire on  February will provide a better picture.The more serious criticisms of Iowa are aimed at the very idea of a caucus-driven assessment of voting intentions and the cultural and political identity of the state.Iowa is a small rural state with a population of . million. The caucus comprises , precincts who meet in churches, libraries, community halls, schools and houses. Citizens vote by show of hands or breaking into groups after representatives make the case for each of the candidates. There is no secret ballot. If a candidate doesn’t get  per cent support, they are eliminated.Church-going valuesThe purpose of the exercise is to vote for candidates but also to appoint  pledged delegates who will vote at the state convention. Eight super delegates, who are not pledged to a particular candidate, will be added to the delegation. The idea of super delegates created such bitterness in the Sanders-Clinton battle in . The state’s delegates will then attend the Democratic Convention in Milwaukee in July, when the presidential candidate will be confirmed.This seems like an exhaustive grassroots process, but it is an archaic and often chaotic procedure where the caucus can take hours and can be “rowdy” and “raucous”, sounding more like an energised public meeting than a well-organised polling station. While the caucus process has obvious weaknesses, it is the nature of Iowa itself that make this an unlikely bellwether state.Dismissed by critics as a “flyover state”, Iowa is known for some of the world’s most fertile soil and is first in the country for “the production of corn, oats, soya beans and cattle”. Criticisms of how representative it is, revolve around its  per cent white population, its church-going values, limited urban population, and having an older population: more white, more Christian and more conservative. One critic said: “Iowa [the caucus] is a crime against democracy and ought to be done away with.”A humorous piece in the Washington Post asked whether cows are better represented in the Senate than people, a reference to states like Iowa which has four million sheep, but only . million people.Jimmy Carter’s victoryIn defence of Iowa, results in the state have been within a one per cent deviation from the national electorate since  and it has been a reasonably accurate bellwether for the past two decades. Iowa, in terms of state turnout, ranks among the top five with  per cent as against the US figure of  per cent. Iowa has also voted for the winning presidential candidate in all but three elections since . Donald Trump won the  presidential election in Iowa with . per cent of the vote. Hillary Clinton received . per cent. Trump carried Iowa by the largest margin of any Republican candidate since Ronald Reagan in .The jury is out on whether Iowa is representative of the US and as such there is pressure not to overstate its signicance for the y debate that lies ahead involving another ten months of expensive and enthusiastic campaigning. What is clear is that a good performance by a candidate in Iowa creates momentum and, in a campaign that will cost billions of dollars, a sound way of keeping campaign finance heading your way.Jimmy Carter certainly appreciated the Iowa experience. He stood for the presidency in . Folklore suggests he hung around Iowa for nearly a year, working the state to death in support of his candidature in the belief that a victory would help him in his struggle to get to the White House. For what had been, up to then, a disappointing campaign, barely registering any support in opinion polls, he won the Iowa caucus and then became President in November. Obama also won Iowa.So Iowa does seem to matter.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish pub featuring forgotten mural by alasdair gray goes on the market","story":"A pub featuring a forgotten mural by the late Scottish artist Alasdair Gray has gone on the market.The Falls of Clyde mural was rediscovered on the wall of the Riverside Tavern in Kirkfieldbank, Lanarkshire, as part of refurbishment works.It had been covered over by wallpaper, paint and light fittings and when uncovered in  it was badly damaged. - Scottish Airbnb castle becomes mini-Glastonbury as wild guests lob buckfast bottles and sing sectarian songs Gray, who died in December, was asked in  by the then landlord to restore the artwork he had completed  years earlier shortly after he graduated from the Glasgow School of Art.

The desperation that comes from poverty, the bad choices that often seem like the only choices available, are his stock-in-trade. ‘Sorry We Missed You’ is another compelling exemplar of what the man is all about.Marriedparents Ricky and Abbie did all the right things. They followed the rules andworked hard and were on the brink of becoming homeowners when the Northern Rockbuilding society collapsed, taking their dreams with it. Now mired in debt, theyare shunted from one shabby rental to another along with surly son Seb andsmart daughter Liza Jane.Ricky’sskills are no longer in demand. Even though he is a “grafter” who has doneevery job under the sun, proper jobs – with set hours, agreeable conditions, anda decent wage – are like hen’s teeth. So he takes a punt, persuades his we tosell her car, and buys a nearly-new van. them. He doesn’t get a wage – he chargesfees. He is a self-employed knight of the road, free to make as much money ashis speed around Newcastle will allow.Theillusion is soon shattered. His boss at the depot is a bullet-headed bruiserwith all the empathy of a shark. That’s because he himself is trapped in jungleof competition with other depots. He may be an apex predator, but he’s only asubstandard quarter away from losing his crown.Thegig economy is sold with promises of self-empowerment and personal agency thereality for Ricky is -hour days, a black box all-seeing eye that has timingsdown to the second, and financial penaltiesa sht is missed # for whateverreason, whether family emergency or personal injury. The god of just-in-timedelivery doesn’t care about any of that. Neither does Ricky’s boss, theself-appointed “patron saint of nasty bastards.”Thereisn’t even enough time to go to the toilet. On his first day with PDF, Ricky ishanded an empty plastic bottle by a co-worker. For male drivers in a hurry, itis an essential piece of equipment.Ricky’smachine-tooled existence is mirrored by his we’s. She is a care worker on azero-hours contract who has only minutes to attend to the basic needs of herelderly charges. One of them, Rosie, used to cook for striking miners in thes. When Abbie tells her that her own working day is from .am to pm,Rosie counters with: “What happened to the eight-hour day ”It is a pivotal scene. Losing what we once took for granted has been a Loach mot for decades. ‘Sorry We Missed You’ is another powerful chapter in his social history of post-war Britain."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/001WH1701NCA.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio files friday 17th","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week, Skye  Lochalsh Council for Voluntary Organisations http:www.slcvo.org.uk  produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

Established in January , the six week project has witnessed a record  participants sign up for this year’s programme. Those taking part are teamed with fellow Slimmers in a bid to be crowned overall Saints  Slimmers Champions, .With health and well-being at its heart, Saints  Slimmers provides opportunities for regular team exercise, promotion of positive mental health, development of teamwork skills, dance and many social activities. Participants have been assigned to a team and are following a six week programme of activity. Those involved will be spin cycling in the early morning before winding down with a brisk walk that evening.Circuit training, aerobic workouts and the all important team challenges will keep everyone entertained, while the finale dance-off in the splendour of the Tullyglass House Hotel will provide a fitting celebration of the participants efforts.But don’t let the “Slimmers” reference mislead you. This programme is about far more than that as Club Chairman Jim Brady elaborates: “Our annual programme places its emphasis clearly on the achievement of personal goals for all involved. “For some that might be simply getting out of the house for an activity at a time of the year when the long nights and inclement weather may put you off leaving home. “For others it may be an opportunity to meet new people, to try something new or indeed … to lose some weight.“Whatever the goal, the programme seems to have captured the imagination of local people in great numbers since it started four years ago with some  people in total taking part. “As well as providing the participants with a range of activities to undertake we offer mental wellness sessions, a range of social events to attend and many opportunities to step outside of their comfort zone. “All of our fitness tutors are locally based and that means that as well as channelling funding towards them during the programme they also get a chance to show off their product and attract spin-off business as a result throughout the remainder of the year”.In  the programme was recognised at the Irish News Club  Volunteer Awards when it was awarded the prestigious award for best Club Health  Well Being initiative. This years programme sees participants range in age from  to  years of age and activities are tailored to inidual need and fitness.Charity features as an integral part of the programme and last year the organisers at All Saints designated the McMillan Unit at Antrim Area Hospital as the beneficiaries of their efforts. A sum of over poundk was raised principally through the team “Spinathon” at the Harmony Hub in the centre of Ballymena in February. This year a similar event on Saturday, February  will raise funds to benefit the Children’s Hospice.The club would like to thank those local sponsors who have supported inidual teams and events. They include Ballymena Running  Athletic Club, McKillop’s Spar Frys Road, Connolly’s Spar Dunclug, Tullyglass House Hotel and the overall programme sponsor Galgorm Resort and Spa. The theme for the teams this year are flowers and they are appropriately named as: The Teamkit Tulips, The Do-Jo Daffodils, The Doherty Meats Marigolds, The Fitzsimons Opticians Foxgloves, The Pizza Parlour Pansies, The Knockdene Healthcare Heathers, The Flamingo Forget Me Nots, The Sitting Room Snowdrops, the Studio  Sunflowers, The Steele Physio Primroses, the Prime Fitness Ponsettias and the Rafferty Property Roses.So over the next few weeksyou happen to see a group of Roses or Pansies jogging past you on the street give them a shout of encouragement and help them to bloom!

I want to make sure the Assembly reflects the new opportunity we have and have said to members both publicly and privately that I have to try and set a standard here of respecting everybody no matter who is in that chamber, they are all equal. The people who vote for them are equal. It’s about respect at the end of the day and I have to earn that as well.”The West Belfast MLA said that his take on the dynamics of the new ing Assembly going forward is that “it’s very important that it rises to occasion”. Having met with British Prime Minister Boris Johnston, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Tánaiste Simon Coveney, Mr Maskey said that both governments need to “respect that as well”. “We’ve got to respect political dference and we have to manage those,” he said. “I had very constructive engagements with them on Monday, obviously the substance of their visits was dealt with by the Executive.”Impartiality in his role as Speaker is a core element of the post, he said.“I had been pushing very hard on securing the funding that was announcement by the Department for Education for West Belfast schools. When it was announced about St John the Baptist I couldn’t even comment on it as I was in the ‘chair’ and that is the type of thing that your constituency needs to see a result on.

whether squirrels were left- or right-handed. data-dfpadtargeting\"\" title\"\" width\"\" \"\"  \" title\"\" width\"\" \"\"  By Nilima Marshall, PA Science ReporterJanuary   : AM CommentsPaw preference makes squirrels ‘less efficient at learning new tasks’BelfastIt is not just humans who are left- or right-handed.https:www.belfasttelegraph news viral paw-preference-makes-squirrels-less-efficient-at-learning-new-tasks-.htmlhttps:www.belfasttelegraph news viral  .ece AUTOCROP h bpanews_be--ae--ecefe_EmailIt is not just humans who are left- or right-handed..pushTurns out, some squirrels are also strongly lateralised, that is, they actively favour one side of their body over the other.But unlike humans, where handedness is believed to make brains more efficient, scientists have found that squirrels who demonstrated a paw preference were less good at learning new tasks compared to their ambidextrous counterparts.Dr Lisa Leaver, programme director of University of Exeter’s animal behaviour course and study author, said: “It has been suggested that being strongly lateralised makes brains more efficient, with each hemisphere focusing on dferent tasks.“This could help animals survive, which would explain the evolution of laterality across the animal kingdom.“In fish and birds, there is evidence that being strongly lateralised is linked to better cognitive performance .“However, limited data from studies of mammals suggest a weak or even negative relationship.”To find out more, researchers from the University of Exeter observed  wild grey squirrels who were presented with a perspex tube containing peanuts.Of them,  provided enough data to be included in the research paper, published in the journal Learning and Behaviour.In order to access the nuts, the squirrels had to learn to use a paw, rather than their mouth as their faces were too big to fit through the holes of the tube.Dr Leaver said: “We were measuring how long it took them to stop using their faces and to start using their paws to reach into the tube.“And once they started doing that, we measured which paws they were using – left or right.”We found that the squirrels who had stronger tendencies to use either their left or their right paws rather than being ambidextrous were the ones who didnt perform as well on the tasksDr Lisa LeaverWhile some squirrels showed ambidexterity by using both their paws to access the nuts, others strongly favour one side.The team then measured how quickly squirrels learned the task and how strongly they favoured a particular paw, assessing both learning and laterality.Results showed that squirrels which strongly favoured a particular side did less well on a learning task.Dr Leaver said: “We found that the squirrels who had stronger tendencies to use either their left or their right paws rather than being ambidextrous were the ones who didn’t perform as well on the tasks.“So they didn’t learn as quickly, they didn’t earn as thoroughly as the ones who were more ambidextrous.”She said the findings were in line with these previous mammal studies which suggest “strong lateralisation is linked to poor cognitive performance” but added more research is need to “understand the complex relationship” between the two."},{"url":null,"title":"young people making climate

Mr Trump has pulled the US out of the Paris accord to limit climate change and has traded barbs with Greta on social media.“Without treating it as a real crisis we cannot solve it,” Greta said.The Swedish teenager came to fame by staging a regular strike at her school, sparking a global movement that eventually earned her Time Magazine’s award as the  Person of the Year.She said that people are more aware about climate issues now.

The transfer of these courses which include physiotherapy, medicines management, sport and exercise medicine, podiatry and occupational therapy, amongst others, would attract in excess of , students, and are deemed vital to Magee expansion. In January  UU confirmed that the relocation of allied health and health sciences provision from Jordanstown to Coleraine would be paused to enable further consideration of all options. It was expected that a decision would be taken before the UCAS deadline for NI students on January . However, it has now been pushed back to March with all campuses still under consideration. googletag.cmd.push An Ulster University spokesperson said: “We take seriously the role that we play in providing the skilled health professionals so urgently required to meet the needs of the healthcare workforce and patients. “Over recent months we have undertaken a wide-ranging stakeholder engagement exercise on the future location of these courses. We have appreciated the constructive and valuable input to this process from a range of stakeholders, including our health sciences staff. “Further robust analysis and business cases are required for the options under review, in order that a fully informed decision can be made on the way forward. Our Coleraine, Magee and Belfast campuses are all potential locations to be carefully assessed in this review. googletag.cmd.push “Concluding this review is a priority for the University, and a fully informed decision will be made no later than the second week in March.” ‘Decision time’ SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin, who recently replaced party leader Colum Eastwood following his election as Foyle MP, has been vocal about the need for Ulster University to demonstrate its long-term commitment to Derry by transferring other healthcare courses to the Magee Campus without delay. In her previous role as a Derry City  Strabane District Councillor she insisted that health sciences “should be aligned with this city and region.” Speaking to the Derry News at the weekend, Mrs McLaughlin said: “It is my understanding that the decision making process for the relocation of the Allied Health and Health Sciences courses is due to take place in weeks rather than months. “These courses are moving out of Jordanstown and the SDLP have been strongly advocating that these courses would be best placed in the Magee Campus. “The poundm financial package ring fenced for the Graduate Entry Medical School together with financial support for the Magee Expansion from the Irish Government, in my opinion, requires a reciprocal announcement by Ulster University to relocate all Allied Health to Magee in time for the next UCAS listing.” She continued: “This decision by UU would demonstrate their commitment to the City Region and the University would be well on its way to become an academic medical hub with an attractive offering for both students and leading academics. “If Ulster University fail to support the growth of Magee in the coming weeks, it will be decision time for all City Stakeholders on what direction we need to follow in order to achieve a full sized Higher Education provision in Northern Ireland’s second City.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

John Dallats introduction to politics came quite by chance.An invitation to join a new branch of the SDLP was sent to his brother, but John went instead and almost got selected to run for council.He declined, pleading that he was living and teaching in Donegal.Four years later, after ing to Kilrea to take up a teaching post at St Paul’s College, he was chosen to run and so began a letime of council work which culminated in John becoming the first ever nationalist mayor in Coleraine.This period also represented his involvement in rejuvenating the local Credit Union which was in danger of closingA new Conference of Saint Vincent de Paulwas also being set up in Kilrea which would do amazing things for people.Around the same time, the man who was about to become one of Ulsters most hated sectarian killers, was placed by the Probation Service in the very town John lived, and worked in.Just before committing the Castlerock and Greysteel atrocities, UFF murdererTorrens Knight was placed on a local community employment scheme in Kilrea.He left without completing the year of work he was ordered to do by the courts.“The rest is, of course history,” said John. “He and his cronies murdered my friend Gerry Dalrymple, who was in my house the night before the Castlerock murder of four workmen.“His last advice to me was to pull my curtains.“The following morning, he was dead and so too were three of his workmates.“These were dark and dangerous times with armed cops sitting outside the council chamber.“In the beginning I thought they were protecting unionists but when I complained that they could be better used other places I was told by the Divisional Commander it was me they were looking after because I had no control over my mouth!“Yes, Ulster Resistance had brought in guns which were ided among the UDA and UVF and in the future innocent people would die at Castlerock, Greysteel and where.“Among those in the security forces to die was Bertie Gilmore who lived in the same lane as me.“We played together, grew up together and Bertie joined the UDR and I the SDLP. googletag.cmd.push  John Dallat ready for the road in his beloved Morris Minor car. Photo: Mary K Burke “He had retired three years and was recovering from a severe heart attack when he and his we were riddled with gunfire beside the retirement site he was going to build.“Today his daughter is among those who have helped me in challenging times.”Johnwas born and bred in Rasharkin, Co Antrim.“On reflectionI was asked to be born into a dferent house in a dferent place I would turn it down.“I was happy growing up by a Tilley Lamp, carrying water from the well and waking up in the morning with ice on the inside of the windows.“Later on I loved the ‘put-put’ of our ‘Start-o-matic’ generator and Peeke my pet pigeon was never from my side.“She had fallen out of the nest and my mother nursed her back to le while she grew the most beautul brown and white feathers.“An amazing creature of God. I knew why we couldn’t get a council house and I know it was more than just because we were Catholics. “Poor Protestants didn’t get council houses either because they might also be unable to pay the council rent.“Anyway, we kept a goat for the milk which was good for my wee brother Gerard who was special needs both physically and mentally.“He died when he was  and part of my mother and father died too.”John said that being the “underdog” was second nature to him growing up.And it was something he carried with him into his politics career.“It just seemed right and at times didn’t go down well, especially when I sided with the travellers when they came to town but the travellers were good people and attitudes changed,” he said.“When a young girl from a dferent part of the world suffered horric le-changing injuries after losing her job and was left homeless, it seemed right to have her for Christmas in our home and it was one of our best and happiest times ever.“Today she and her family are our best friends and we love them to bits.“When an African student was going to be deported because her visa ran out and her sponsor died suddenly it seemed only right to bring her home and set about stopping her going back to a country where she had only a blind grandmother and no one .“Luck had it I met the head of the Border Agency in Stormont on the corridor and he extended her stay for two years.“In the meantime, she met an amazing husband, married and is among our best friends.“Brian Kennedy played at the wedding and we dressed up in African traditional dress!There is one battle, not yet won, which has had the most impact on John in his role as a public representative.He said: “Perhaps the one story which doesn’t have a good ending just yet is the dreadful murder of Inga-Maria Hauser whose mutilated body was found in Ballypatrick Forest  days after her neck was broken in an attempted rape.“Early next year I will meet her only sister Frederika at a special conference in Queen’s University.“That will be an amazing occasion and hopefully the prelude to her murderer being brought before the courts for one of the most brutal killings I have ever read about.”At the heart of it all has been one thing, John’s family.“Politics had its mixed blessings. I got to see places in the world that I could never have been but it also brought its problems – searching under the car for booby traps, bullet-proof windows and doors and a gun that I know I would never have used.“But politics also gave me the most incredible family.“My poor we Anne was parachuted into the north at the height of the Troubles to a small town which was bombed from one end to the other.“Our daughter, Helena, now a councillor, became the youngest detainee when we were arrested by the British army in Derry shortly after crossing the border.“She was ten days old and our mission was simply showing her off to her Donegal grandparents.“Sixteen years later as a member of the Foyle Harp School she played for President Bill Clinton when he first made that history-making appearance in Mackey’s Foundry.“Later, she would entertain other leaders including President Robinson and McAleese as well as John Major and member of the Royal Family.“I felt honoured when she was invited to play in the Russian Embassy in Washington on Saint Patrick’s Day.“Today the same harp is never out of sight but not played in public anymore.”John added: “Our two sons, Ronan and Diarmuid have been amazing and in one dficult and dangerous year we were on the Aran Islands three times for our safety.“For  years Inishmore, the largest of the three Aran Islands has been our refuge, our safety valve and our friend.“Two weeks ago when I was in hospital after breaking my arm while canvassing, Vincent Mc Carron, one of our friends, left the island during a storm, drove to Kilrea to collect Anne, go to Derry to collect me from hospital and bring me home. He stayed for several days helping with my recovery.”In , one week after his mother sadly passed away, John became Deputy Speaker, a post he held for ten years.“I found it a strange place and certainly not reflecting my background where the term ’Mister’ was hardly order of the day.“In time I persuaded the doorkeepers and others to call me by my first name and I felt comfortable about that.“I felt I was dismantling a bit of the old Stormont that was in danger of being rejuvenated!“All these people were my friends by simply showing them a bit of respect, nothing more and I have missed them dearly over the last three years when I see little of them anymore.”Reflecting on challenges and achievements in his political career, Mr Dallat spoke about stopping the closure or the Belfast-Derry railway north of Ballymena.”The twenty-year project nearly went off the rails several times,” he said.“The Civil Service had a plan to save money by closing the railway north of Ballymena and use the savings to make a start on the A roadway though Toome.“Today the Belfast-Derry railway carries many more passengers than the Belfast-Dublin Enterprise service, but still needs connected to the Irish Rail network and that is a priority for me.John added: “Stopping the closure of the Irish Coastguard Radio Station at Malin Head, announced by Leo Varadkar when he was Minister for Transport.“I gave evidence to a Dail committee with two of my councillors and told the TD’s this was one of the best examples of cross-border bodies, seamless, transcending partition and two world wars, costing very little and actually working! Varadkar had to back down.”As vice-chair of the Public Accounts Committee I exposed wanton waste of public money and brought about important changes which the civil service didn’t like.“Effort to cover up who was responsible for bad mistakes and neglect were strenuously resisted.“Later I was invited to Georgia and Armenia to share my experiences and I felt so honoured and privileged.“I just couldn’t believe that a boy that grew up in a house with no electricity, no running water could be involved in helping democracy grow in two of Russia’s former territories.”With the Assembly back up and running, John says he has great hope for the future.“I have been through the best and the worst of times and see an amazing future for this part of Ireland.“I see wonderful people all around me in both communities and I want to be part of that community for the sake of future generations that will create a new Ireland and one we can all celebrate.“I would encourage every young person to do likewise.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Business properties valued higher may now exceed the current threshold for rates relief. Addressing a recent council meeting, David Ross, Director of Valuation at Land and Property Services, said that across NI there are , non domestic properties with a total net annual value of pound,m providing poundm per annum in rates revenue.A property tax system requires regular and frequent revaluations to be fair and to minimise excessive adjustments.In Northern Ireland they have been revaluated in , , ,  and now . “Revaluations are about redistributing the rate burden,” he said.Non-domestic property in Northern Ireland is assessed on the basis of its rental value known as the Net Annual Value . The NAV of a business property will determine the amount of rates owners have to pay.Since  NI has experienced overall NAV growth from pound,m to pound,m in  which represents a .% increase. Derry City  Strabane District Council has grown by .% from pound.m to pound.m.The main sectors in this are retail, offices, industrial and warehouses with offices bringing about the largest growth in Derry.The Small Business Rate Reliefscheme was introduced in  to support small businesses at a time of economic recession. Since then , SBRR awards have been made to non-domestic ratepayers at a total cost of pound.m. Annually, some , properties receive relief under the scheme at a cost of around poundm.In the absence of an NI government, a decision was taken in  to put it out to consultation in order to identy a more effective replacement scheme. SDLP councillor Sinead McLaughlin, who has since become an MLA, asked Mr Ross about the small business rate relief scheme and the possibility of future-proofing it. In response, he said there would be no change to the existing system, just the values.Some ratepayers sitting at pound, will move up to pound, and lose out on relief, he said, while others will get small business rates relief for the first time as there is movement between bands.Cllr McLaughlin said that while there was some good news, losing rates relief would be “very signicant” for the city centre, particularly for “struggling” small sized retailers.“The rates system needs to be overhauled to reflect a new way of working,” she added.The Council was said to have submitted a comprehensive response to the consultation. In summary, the council said: “A blanket approach with regard to the SBRR scheme would be preferable whilst making changes to the percentage relief available in order to increase the threshold. “If this is not possible the scheme needs to be targeted and specic which is sympathetic to the needs of small businesses.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The project was part funded under Priority of the Northern Ireland Rural Development Programme - by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs and the European Union’.City of Derry Equestrian Centre has not only doubled sales in one year, thanks to the support for tourism marketing activities from the Rural Business Investment Scheme, but it has also been able to ersy into new lines of business such as equine therapy. Owner Pauline Lusby said she had established a successful family business focusing on weekend pony club activities for children learning to ride, but has now expanded the tourism side of the business due to the Rural Development Programme funding, creating three full-time jobs.Ms Lusby set up City of Derry Equestrian Centre at the family farm at Ardmore  years ago after noticing the lack of opportunities in the area for children learning to ride.The business focuses on fun, friendship and horsemanship for the young riders, allowing them to achieve qualications and avail of the opportunity to become junior instructors once they reach a certain level.“Its a great way of allowing young people to use the stables as a springboard for their future development,” Pauline said.However, she noticed the potential to tap into a growing tourism market, as visitors to the North West from the USA and Canada seek out trail riding opportunities, particularly in areas such as the Faughan Valley that can offer spectacular countryside and a rich historical backdrop.The funding from the Rural Business Investment Scheme has allowed the Centre to target its tourism marketing more effectively by creating high-quality marketing collateral such as leaflets and flyers, a state-of-the-art professionally designed website and effective digital marketing. “When you’re trying to target tourists, who are coming to the North West, you need that professional interface,“ Pauline said. I was aware that we hadn’t tapped into that really huge tourism potential. I had been involved in a project with the city council called Slow Adventure which focused on attracting people into the countryside and that made me realise that there was a lot of tourism potential in the Faughan Valley with its rolling hills and stunning countryside. “The money that we have been able to invest in tourism marketing has provided me with a professional  and we have been getting quite a few enquiries from visitors from the USA and Canada who are staying in Derry and want to go horse riding. “Some of our visitors want to go on a trail ride and canter or gallop, while others are keen to learn more about the local area and its history. My grandparents have been here since the early s so we are able to share that history and tell our visitors about the local characters who have lived around here.”Ms Lusby said the new marketing materials had also helped to highlight what the equestrian centre could offer and in turn that has allowed them to develop new lines of business. Equine therapy is a treatment that uses interactions between humans and horses to help patients to develop needed attributes and to address emotional and behavioural challenges. City of Derry Equestrian Centre is now working with Start  and Ascert to offer this form of therapy to young people. “We’ve found that in the cases of young people where traditional counselling hasn’t worked, they are able to engage better in an equine setting, and after this therapy they are able to open up much more.”  googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Foyle MLA said: “I am pleased to see works finally underway, at what has become a notorious hazard area at the bottom of Duncreggan Road.“The issue of flooding and the poor conditions of footpaths in this area has been on DfI Roads’ radar since March when I initially reported it. Unsurprisingly, the perennial issue of funding had been credited for the delay in addressing this problem. It is regrettable that it took a serious injury before action was taken on this matter. However, given the Department’s current budge- tary pressures, I am grateful that DfI Roads have kept their promise of responding to the issue as soon as possible following the Christmas break.”Mr Durkan con- cluded:”Hopefully, these repairs will finally resolve this persistent problem.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The announcement was made at an event held to thank the local community, business partners and stakeholders who have supported the successful delivery of the project. Representing an investment of over pound million, the “Gas to the West” project is being delivered in partnership between SGN Natural Gas and Mutual Energy and has the potential to meet the energy needs of up to , homes and businesses across Counties Derry, Fermanagh and Tyrone.The final piece of the new network was commissioned in December last year with natural gas now available to Artigarvan, Coalisland, Cooks-town, Derrylin, Dun- gannon, Enniskillen, Magherafelt, Omagh and Strabane.Approximately  jobs were created during the construction phase which was applauded for its technical innovation including traversing almost  river crossings and signicant roads including the M motorway. The recent delivery of the network to the gateways of all the target towns is a major milestone for what is widely regarded as one of the most signicant energy infra- structure projects across the province in a generation. It is anticipated that when fully completed, almost  kilometres of pipeline will be in the ground in the wider network area.Leading Northern Ireland manufacturing companies who have already converted their production lines to natural gas across the newly extended network area, include LacPatrick Dairies, Encirc, Dale Farm, Moy Park and Linergy.Economy Minister. Diane Dodds, has welcomed provision of the new gas infrastructure. She said: “I would like to congratulate Mutual Energy and SGN Natural Gas, and their contractors, on their success in delivering this signicant energy project. The project has been supported with grant funding up to pound. million administered by the Department for the Economy.”“I look forward to the continued roll-out of new gas distribution networks in each of the eight towns in the West, eventually providing some , business and domestic consumers with additional fuel choice and increasing the potential for businesses, the public sector and households to use a cleaner, more efficient fuel.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The survey to date has provided the RSPB with nearly nine million hours of monitoring garden birds - counting  million of them.People are asked to spend just one hour watching and recording the birds in their garden or local green space and then submit their results to the RSPB. The results give an astonishing amount of insight into how our wildle is faring.Last year, house sparrows were the leaders in Derry, while starlings were the most-spotted birds in Armagh and Tyrone. Some of the less common birds to be spotted across the North included great spotted wood peckers, yellowhammers, sparrow- hawks, goldcrests and fieldfares. There was one new entry in the top  in Northern Ireland last year, with coal tits replacing collared doves at no..For four decades, Big Garden Birdwatch has highlighted the winners and losers in the garden bird world. It was one of the first surveys to alert the RSPB to the decline in the number of song thrushes in gardens. This species was a firm fixture in the top  in  but  years later its numbers were less than half those recorded in . By last year, numbers of song thrushes seen in gardens have declined by %, coming in at number .Anne-Marie McDevitt, RSPB NI head of species, said: “The popularity of Big Garden Birdwatch shows just how passionate people are about their wildle. Everyone has a role to play in saving nature and protecting our wildle. it’s great to have a reason to sit back and relax and just enjoy birds and wildle for one hour, knowing that you’re contributing to the world’s largest wildle survey. It gives people a perfect opportunity to connect with nature. Often you can be amazed at the types of birds you’ll find in your garden. If you’re not sure about the birds you’re seeing, pick up binocularsyou have them and you might get a pleasant surprise and realise you have a goldcrest or redpoll or bullfinch or some other lovely bird that you might not realise visits your garden. You’ll be able to identy them using your Big Garden Birdwatch pack or the RSPB website.“The Big Garden Birdwatch allows us to monitor trends and helps us understand how birds are doing. If people can spare an hour and help us with this ‘citizen science,’ it lets us create a valuable snapshot of bird numbers across the UK.”To take part in the Big Garden Birdwatch , watch the birds in your garden or local park for one hour at some point over the three days. Only count the birds that land, not those flying over. Tell the RSPB the highest number of each bird species you see at any one time – not the total you see in the hour.The parallel event, RSPB Big Schools’ Birdwatch, takes place between now and  February. Almost , children took part in  schools across Northern Ireland last year.

Football coach, Paul Roddy, raised a number of issues with council officials and local representatives. A public meeting proposed by People Before Profit Councillor Shaun Harkin in October had to be rescheduled due to the Westminster elections. It has now been rearranged for Wednesday, January . Mr Roddy said Brooke Park user groups are growing increasingly frustrated and the current dficulties are not going away. He said: “Council is required to give those young users facilities fit for use, its not enough to build new facilities then not actually maintain them or provide young children with adequate changing facilities and playing surfaces. googletag.cmd.push “To date members of staff at Brooke park are trying their very best to maintain good standards on the G pitch and the grass pitch but we the users dont think thats particularly their responsibility. “The same staff are being as accommodating as possible regarding changing and traffic control but again to a degree their hands are tied.  “We the users need proper full-time solutions put in place by council we need grounds maintenance to play a proper role, we also need long-term solutions to changing, storage, parking, bookings and we need answers surrounding constant rumours we hear and see in local papers about the long-term reconfiguration of Brooke parks leisure centre.” googletag.cmd.push He added: “We all know during the y process that was the Brooke park regeneration program, local user groups, local community groups and some councillors held the council to account regarding providing proper facilities for particularly Rosemount and the surrounding areas. “But does it always have to be the case that we the users have to continually box with council, sometimes in the shadows, to badger them to provide the best for our young people  “During recent elections ious representatives from all local parties called at my door, I asked them about Brooke park and all the above. I got the same answer from them all, ‘you users provide a great community service’.” He concluded by saying that City of Culture money was made available to lay the grass pitch at Brooke Park but it is in “absolutely shocking condition” and a poor legacy of that year. ‘No concerns’ People Before Profit councillor for the area, Shaun Harkin, said service users are paying a lot of money for the facilities and “deserve better”. Mr Harkin believes that the concerns of user groups and the local community need to be taken into account and the council must be transparent about its long-term plans for the upper section of Brooke Park – which takes in the G and grass pitches, as well as the leisure centre. A spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council said that Council has “no concerns” around the maintenance of its pitches and reassured the public that a structured maintenance programme and high level of attention is given to all facilities across the Council. “The Council communicates regular with user groups and a further meeting with this user group is scheduled in the coming weeks. With reference to the redevelopment plans, Council has agreed to provide a new bowling pavilion and a new Health suite at the Brooke Park facility. “In addition a new traffic management plan and associated works is to be implemented with monies to be spent on this. All of these works will take place during .” Brooke Park users are invited to attend a meeting on Wednesday th January at pm in Brooke Park Bowling Club.

She was keen to help those in need and to get people involved.Making time for others, she had a listening ear and often offered advice in compassionate ways. She liked being at the heart of things, and she was the le and soul of the party.Helena, from the Crocknamohil Road close to Draperstown, went missing on November .She was last seen near the Foyle Bridge in Derry city.Her remains were discovered last Tuesday evening by search teams on the River Foyle, who had been scouring the area every day since her disappearance. Her family, including husband Declan and four children - Kayla, Ben, Kaeden andNiah-Rose - all aged from one to  years-old, had held out hope she wouldhome.On Monday morning they gathered with hundreds of others in a final farewell to the much loved daughter, sister, mum and we.Special recognition was given during the funeral mass from the McElhennon and McGlone families for the tireless, daily efforts by family, friends and strangers in looking for Helena.Passing on their thanks, Fr McGirr said: Over these past number of weeks Helena has been on the minds and in the prayers of countless people across our erse, good-hearted and generous community. Helena’s people also deeply appreciate the supportive messages from people conveyed across dferent s expressing their compassion and kindest thoughts.People were keen to help and pray for Helena. They have been opening their hearts and sharing their moments with a neighbour and people they’re feeling for. “They and the generosity of local businesses donating food for volunteers and family members also helped to draw Helena gently home.As sincere people and as a community of faith gathered here at St Patrick’s, we share our sympathy with everyone among Helena’s family and friends grieving her passing today. We also reach out to God to help and console us in our sorrow, and we pray to him for the happy repose of Helena’s soul in the le to come, because we would like her to have that peace very much.”Yesterday, messages of support continued to be posted on a Facebook page set up in the search for Helena.As well as offers of thoughts and prayers, messages lent support for her family and expressed relief that their agonising search had finally come to an end. Last week after news that Helenas body had been foud, her family thanked those who had left comforting messages. “Helena was a beautul person and earth angel. She’s now an angel in heaven reunited with our Daddy, goddaughter and other family members,” a Facebook post read. Helena is survived by her husband Declan and four children, her mother Mary and her siblings Rosaleen, Teresa, Michael and Sean.For emotional support you can call the Samaritans -hour helpline on  , email jo@samaritans.org, visit a Samaritans branch in person or go to the Samaritans website. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Whilst defender Colm Horgan is likely to become the fth new signing at the club, there are still a number of spots to be filled, particularly in attack. The City boss will have two attacking trialists in training this week, both of whom could well feature against Finn Harps this Wednesday night at the Brandywell. With two other trialists expected in before the end of the week, Devine is not limiting his options, as he searches for the right players. googletag.cmd.push “We know exactly what we want and we know exactly what we need,” he said. “They have to be the right fit, and they have to be the right personality and the right character because when you see our team at Drogheda and how hard we worked, we cant have anyone come in and think that they can just stroll through games.” Reflecting on the - victory in Drogheda on Friday night, the City boss admitted that the game provided a decent test for his players in the build up to the new season. “It was a character-building exercise as well as anything,” he said. “It wasnt like a normal game when youre refreshed heading into a game because we worked hard beforehand and got a lot of work into the legs of the players. googletag.cmd.push “It was a good test. Drogheda will be a good team this year, because they have a lot of good players in their team. In terms of our first pre-season game I thought it was a very good performance up to an hour. “Obviously when you make nine or ten changes then youre going to lose a wee bit of your edge and ball mastery and how you dominate the ball but there were a lot of very good performances.”  AT HOME AT THE BRANDYWELL... Derry City manager Declan Devine pictured at the Brandywell on Saturday during the Irish League game between Institute and Glentoran. Pic by Tom Heaney City fans who braved the weather for the trip saw a number of new faces on the night and Devine was delighted with the new signings in particular. “We had two or three trialists who did well, but more importantly the new signings that have come to the club did well,” he continued. “I think Walter Figueira was outstanding and he worked very hard. He didnt get his chance but he worked so hard for the team. “I thought Stevie Mallon had a fantastic debut, I thought Conor Clford was excellent and Conor McCormack looks ashes never been away from this club. The we had the guys who were here last year Jamie McDonagh was sensational in the game, Ally Gilchrist playing at left back was very, very good. Ciaron Harkin just keeps getting better so what were going to have this year is a lot of competition for places and rightly so because we have good players at the club and we just have to push it on a wee notch.” Malone One huge positive for Derry City from the weekend was theof midfielder Jack Malone. Malone played for  minutes on hisfrom a long-term knee injury which kept him out of action for three months. He s into an experienced and talented midfield and Devine believes that can only be a good thing for the -year old. “Jack has been brilliant in training,” Devine stated. “He is still finding his feet because he was out for three months but hes like a tiger in midfield because he gets after everything. The one thing that people like Jack Malone can do is look around the group and see serious footballers in the squad. When you have a guy like Conor McCormack sitting at the base of midfield and a guy like Conor Clford playing, these are brilliant role models to have.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Both of the goals were a bit unfortunate in a sense. For the first,Ryan Morrow doesn’t fall in the build-up I don’t think they’d score and then for the second the free kick has bounced just before the keeper and they reacted quicker,” Connor told the Derry News. “For them to be sitting top of the table and for us to be where we are, the gulf wasn’t massive. “If we can perform like that against the teams in and around us, then we’ll be fine. Sometimes when we play the teams around us we don’t perform like that, so we just need to keep our cool.”Connor also admitted that the timing of the second goal just before half-time really knocked the wind out of his side’s sails.“At - it’s a dficult game. Their game management was very good in the second half,” he said. “We huffed and puffed without really creating as much as we did in the first half when we had two or three really good chances. The dference was that when they got their chances, they were clinical.” googletag.cmd.push CHANGESGlentoran, with former Finn Harps captain Cowan amongst three debutants, made the brighter start to the game, with Marcus Kane trying his luck from  yards after three minutes, but it blazed high and wide of Rory Brown’s goal.Mick McDermott’s men were playing some slick stuff, and Kane played a crossfield pass to Hrvoje Plum that the Croatian fizzed across the face, but Aidan McCauley got a boot to it to clear.A foul on Alex Pomeroy by Kane earned the home side their first opportunity on ten minutes, but Evan Tweed’s delivery was taken off the head of a free Graham Crown by Caolan Marron.It was ‘Stute who had the first real chance on  minutes when Tweed slid a lovely ball in behind for Gareth Brown who beat Marron before squaring it for McCauley who was completely free at the back post, but on the stretch his left footed effort was blocked by Marijan Antolovic for a corner that came to nothing.It wasn’t long before they were punished for that miss as Glentoran took the lead on  minutes. An unfortunate slip from Ryan Morrow allowed Elvio Van Overbeek to latch on to Robbie McDaid’s pass, and after his floated cross was missed by Andy Mitchell, Navid Nasseri picked it up, jinked inside and finished to the bottom corner.‘Stute enjoyed a spell on top midway through the first half, and on  minutes Tweed and McCready linked up before the latter picked out McCauley in acres of space. He was allowed to run at the Glens defence before unleashing a drive from  yards, but it went wide of Antolovic’s left post.Nasseri’s free role and movement was causing the home defence problems, and on the half hour mark he drew a save out of Brown with a rasping shot into the former Wolves man’s chest.Antolovic then collected a weak header from Alex Pomeroy after Tweed’s free kick was nodded on by Dean Curry before a quick counter from the visitors ended with Christopher Gallagher slicing one over the top.Glentoran had regained control, and on  minutes debutant Marron swung a pinpoint ball deep to the back post where McDaid got his head on it, but the angle was too tight and Brown got behind it.The Belfast men made it - on  minutes when Tweed fouled Plum from behind. He tried to catch ‘Stute out by going for goal, and after Brown scrambled across to make the initial save, Keith Cowan was the man alert to finish to an empty net. googletag.cmd.push Half-timeInstitute Glentoran The visitors started the second half on the front foot, and inside two minutes Andy Mitchell whipped a ball into the box for McDaid, but he couldn’t make a proper connection as it bounced wide.The same pair linked up on  minutes, with McDaid controlling well on his chest ten yards out, but he volleyed over the top, with Nasseri also off target with a long distance attempt five minutes later.‘Stute had the ball in the net on  minutes as Aidan McCauley’s free from midfield sailed over the crowd to the net, but Alex Pomeroy was adjudged to have fouled Antolovic in his attempt to claim it.Sean Connor then made his first substitution, with Ahu Obhakhan replacing McCready, and he could have made an instant impact on the hour mark when McCauley picked out Pomeroy who held off Garrett before squaring for his strike partner at the back post, but it was just too far ahead of him to get a strong foot on it.On  minutes a long throw from Crown made it through to Tweed, but shot was blocked by Marron while moments later Morrow put in a strong tackle on Van Overbeek to win back possession and set up Brown – but his right footed strike floated over the bar.To their credit, ‘Stute kept pressing for a goal and on  minutes Cormac Burke played a long ball for Pomeroy to chase. He did well to turn on to his left but his shot sailed wide of the left upright.The Glens were pressing too, however, and Robbie McDaid tested Brown in the final minute of normal time with a well-placed header from a Kane cross, but the shot stopper held on well.

The Bangor attacker played in Kurtis Bell, who slotted the ball into the inside side-netting after Saintfield were dispossessed at the edge of their own box.Saintfield raised it a few gears and struck three times in the  minutes before half-time.The first came from Andrew Clarke after James Sofley was played down the line. After beating two defenders, James played in Andrew, who passed the ball into the bottom right-hand corner past the lsquokeeper.It took less than five minutes for left back Oliver Duff to score Saintfieldrsquos third. A long ball found Adam Childs on the left wing.He played it back to the edge of the box for Duff. He took one touch to set himself before striking a powerful left-footed shot into the bottom right corner.The Saints scored one more goal before the break with Andrew Clarke playing the ball across the face of goal for Tony Liken to finish at the back post. Saintfield went into half-time in the driving seat and - up.The second half started much like the first ended with Saintfield scoring an early goal.Ryan Sofley was the supplier of an own goal after bombing into the box and fizzing a cross into the near post which ricocheted off the Bangor defender into the net.At - up, the Saints took their foot off the gas and conceded just over five minutes after scoring.Bangor gained possession from a loose ball in midfield and played it into Matty Hall, who turned well to beat the Saintfield defender before striking the ball low and hard into the bottom corner.The Saints were again quick to respond with Andrew Clarke getting his hat-trick with half an hour still to go.Clarke started the move in midfield and finished it expertly after James Sofleyrsquos effort was parried by the lsquokeeper.Saintfield had a penalty and rebound saved less than two minutes later after James Sofley was brought down in the box.However, the Saints werenrsquot finished yet and Clarke had one more goal left in them with  minutes left to go. Possibly the best goal of the game, as he showed real determination and skill to score his fourth. Another counter-attacking goal from the Saints as they broke fast from a Bangor corner.Clarke received the ball just inside the Bangor half and stood tall after several attempts to bring him down. He beat three defenders before slotting home a cool finish into the bottom corner.This goal also signalled the end of the goalkeeperrsquos game after he strongly disagreed with the refereersquos decision to allow the goal to stand. Bangor had one more chance before the end of the game when they were also awarded a penalty, but David Harper kept the Saintsrsquo five-goal lead intact and made it a penalty saved for both teams.A great performance for Saintfield who progress to the next round of the cup and a fantastic performance from  year-old Andrew Clarke who relished his role as an attacking midfielder.Saintfield United Bangor Young Men CLARENCE CUP ND ROUND.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th January 2020 Call.jpg","title":"Call to begin work on Ballynahinch bypass  ","story":"THE re-establishment of the Stormont Executive has led to fresh calls for work to start on Ballynahinchrsquos proposed multi-million pound bypass.Newly appointed Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon is being urged to signal the start of construction work on the scheme which is estimated to cost in excess of poundm.South Down MP Chris Hazzard mdash a former roads minister in a previous Executive who signed off the eagerly-awaited bypass in December  mdash has written to Ms Mallon seeking an assurance that the Ballynahinch scheme remains a priority for her department and that construction work will start as soon as possible.In addition, Rowallane councillor Billy Walker is tabling a notice of motion at the February meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council seeking across-the-board political support to seek an urgent meeting with Ms Mallon discuss the next step in the construction of the bypass.He also confirmed that Strangford MP, Jim Shannon, has written to Ms Mallon on the issue and is seeking a meeting with her to discuss the issue.There has been major progress on work on the near two-mile scheme to link the Newcastle and Saintfield roads, with work already completed on a major archaeological investigation along parts of the route.Work was due to complete on the schemersquos economic appraisal before the end of last year, with roads engineers confirming recently that in order to advance the bypass schemersquos state of readiness, preparatory work on contract documents was ongoing to ldquominimise the time required to initiate a procurement competition, should funding become available for construction.The by-pass, which would be the single biggest road scheme ever constructed in the district, is expected to take in excess of  months to build, with roads officials insisting that it will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety.They are also confident that the schemersquos economic assessment demonstrates the by-pass would provide a good economic .The scheme is designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town.Major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road, with a new bridge constructed over the Moss Road.It is also proposed that a section of the bypass will pass under part of the Crossgar Road with a  metre long bridge constructed to take traffic over Ballynahinch River.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the bypass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.Mr Hazzard said that following his decision to formally sign off the scheme at the end of , the government department had been working through ious legal stages to ensure the scheme could commence as soon as possible.ldquoA programme of geotechnical investigation works on lands along theof the scheme was completed in  with advanced archeological investigation works completed last year, he confirmed.ldquoThis allowed the Department to move ahead with the final stage of preparing contract documentation in readiness of funding becoming available to construct the scheme.Mr Hazzard added: ldquoWith an Infrastructure Minister now in place following the restoration of Stormont this week, funding should now be signed off and construction allowed to commence as soon as possible.Cllr Walker said it was the view of many, including senior roads engineers, that the multi-million pound scheme was vital to the survival of Ballynahinch town centre and will play a signicant role in helping boost the wider South Down economy.He said given that the project is shovel ready, it is essential that the cash is earmarked to allow construction work to start this year is forthcoming.ldquoMoving forward what is now required is the finance to build this scheme, continued Cllr Walker.ldquoIt is clear to me that when you look at other parts of Northern Ireland that Down District has consistently missed out on major roads funding. That must change and the cash needed to build Ballynahinchrsquos new bypass must be made available.The Rowallane councillor said that the bypass can help kick-start the economic regeneration of Ballynahinch town centre and act as a catalyst to encourage new investment.Cllr Walker added: ldquoThe eagerly-awaited scheme can address town centre gridlock and along the main approach roads.

Lidl, which currently employs  staff, claims its proposal will create  new jobs.In late November, the local council confirmed that outline permission granted in March for the multi-million pound development was to be quashed as a result of a judicial review brought by developer Don Holdings Ltd.However, days later, the agenda for the December meeting of the Planning Committee included a plannersrsquo recommendation to approve the new store proposal. The recommendation was subsequently withdrawn, but features on the agenda for todayrsquos meeting with a recommendation to approve.The Newcastle development proposal includes plans for almost  parking spaces, eight of which are reserved for mountain rescue team members.A new pedestrian crossing at the Bryansford Road junction with Shimna Road forms part of the proposal, with planners receiving  objections. Five five letters in support of the new rescue team base proposal have also been lodged.Lidl has consistently argued that its current base at Railway Street in Newcastle is too small to allow the store to carry the companyrsquos full range of goods, highlighting issues with narrow aisles and inadequate parking provision.It says the Railway Street base was only supposed to be a temporary home until a larger unit could be found.Lidl says it has been looking for an alternative town centre site for over decade without success until the Shanslieve Drive site became available, with the planned mountain rescue team centre providing the volunteers with a permanent base.Objectors to the new store proposal claim that there are ldquoserious errors in the transport assessment submitted in conjunction with the planning application, inaccurate land ownership information, unachievable visibility spays and out-of-season traffic surveys.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokeswoman confirmed yesterday that the Lidl planning application was deferred to allow further consideration of a number of submissions received by the local authority.She added: ldquoThe Council is endeavouring to bring this application back to the Planning Committee in Februarypossible..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th January 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C January 15%2C 1980  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH mdash Police believe that a professional gang were behind the drugs raid on a Ballynahinch chemist shop at the weekend.The thieves smashed their way into Hannawinrsquos Medical Hall in Main Street through a skylight and forced open a door to get to the shop. They used a crowbar to prise the steel cabinet containing a store of dangerous drugs out of the wall. The cabinet was later found along the side of the Carrickmannon Road, near Ballygowan.The drugs taken included heroin and cocaine, both of which are dangerous even in small doses. They are types of hard drug in big demand on the black market. Additives like glucose are used by drug pushers to multiply the volume and increase profits. Other drugs, including morphine and strychnine, were also taken.The raid was the latest in a spate across the province and police fear that the addiction problem could be more serious than previously realised.Police chiefs have backed chemists pressing for an urgent review of the Home Office regulations about the keeping of prescribed drugs in steel cabinets.The present procedure is making things too easy for the thieves. It has meant that the hard drugs are all kept in the same place and the professional thief knows that.Before  regulations, chemists had better safeguards, evenit meant hiding the hard drugs on the general drugs shelves. It meant that thieves could not go straight to the security cabinet and other break it open or take it with them.The head of the RUCrsquos drugs squad, Chief Inspective George McBride, said he agreed that there was an urgent need to re-examine safety procedures for storage of dangerous drugs.DOWNPATRICK mdash Compensation for the destruction of St Patrickrsquos Hall in Downpatrick has been agreed mdash almost six years after it was destroyed by fire.The trustees of St Patrickrsquos Parish were awarded pound, at Downpatrick Crown Court last Friday after a two-hour hearing.The award was made in four parts, the bulkbeing attributable to physical damage and the remainder split between loss of profits , contentsand site value pound,.The claim had been before the court for over a year and was held up after the Northern Ireland Office disputed the amount of the parishrsquos claim for loss of profits.On Friday counsel for the Northern Ireland Office argued that the hall trustees had not made a big enough effort to reduce lost profits. But this was strongly refuted by counsel for the hall trustees.In a -minute summing up, the judge looked at the ious points of the case. He said he felt the church had not acted unreasonably and that the trustees had done everything required of them under law.STRANGFORD mdash A Strangford schoolboy will pack his bags later this year to take up a scholarship at a new college at Cambridge mdash with the long term prospects of becoming a Cambridge don.He is  year-old Andrew McDowell, who is an A Level student at Down High School, and he learned this week that he was won an open exhibition to the famed university.In academic terms he has won the equivalent of a junior scholarship and he will be among the first major intake at the new Robinson College.Andrew already has nine O Levels and he sat the examination in November along with several thousand others.In October he will pack his bags to concentrate on Mathematics at the college, with the scholarship being renewable after two years. His success is all the more remarkable because he is a year younger than most other candidates.Andrew is studying A Level Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry at Down High.

The Ballynahinch venture was unique in having a large amount of surviving documentation.Mr Reid says it is clear from these papers that the scheme organised by the First Presbyterian Church was sophisticated, comprehensive, self-funded, and cradle-to-grave in scope. It included widowsrsquo and old age pensions, end of le and burial grants, and support for orphans.Finance allocated to the project was known as lsquoThe Poorrsquos Moneyrsquo. The scheme operated late in the reign of William III and was continued into the time of Queen Anne, George I and George II.Nowadays benefit claimants unable to work through illness or injury, are paid Employment Support Allowance, .In  a similar scheme was obviously operating in Ballynahinch. The church carpenter at that time was John Gough, and that year he suffered a signicant injury, perhaps a broken arm or leg. He was unable to work or to earn a living for over a year.John had been married six years earlier in , in his home congregation by Rev James McAlpine. His we was Elizabeth, neacutee Ferguson. Their children soon followed mdash Christine, who was five in  Rebecca, who was four, and their twin boys, George and James, who were just one year and one month.With four young children and no income, John and Elizabeth were soon struggling financially. But in April the church stepped in immediately, with payments for an initial three-month period, at six shillings per instalment. In August John tried to resume work, but couldnrsquot. The church continued payments, but now at a reduced rate of d. Another attempt at work in October  failed again, and again payments resumed.John eventually recovered and ed to work permanently in August , having received a total of  support payments from First Presbyterian. He resumed his valuable role in maintenance of the fabric, receiving church contracts in ,  and .The problem of unwed mothers and absent fathers is one that troubles every age and every generation. Back in the early s, the Ballynahinch Session took a stern approach to fire-and-forget fatherhood.Their starting point was an interview with the expectant mother to ascertain the identity of her co-responsible male partner. If she proved uncompliant, exclusion from church attendance was then threatened. Faced with resultant near-total social ostracism, the mother-to-be soon cooperated.The next stage involved the errant couple appearing some Sunday morning before the entire congregation, kneeling on the Stool of Repentance and confessing their extramarital transgression. After that they were received back into the congregation. Their child was baptised and recognised as a church member.In a -year period the Ballynahinch Session dealt with  such cases. In six, they identied both parents. In six other cases only the mother was identied in seven, only the father. In one case the origins and surname of a lsquofoundlingrsquo child were known, but neither parent actually came forward.By st century standards, these church procedures sound draconian. But they had the purpose of protecting the rights of the child and of offering an opportunity to the parents for their reputations to be salvaged,possible.The alternatives were a lot worse. It was common in the s for the sexton at Magheradroll Parish Church to discover live newborns abandoned overnight on his church doorstep, ordead through neglect or infanticide, to find their bodies surreptitiously concealed in adjacent graves.In Ireland such surviving infants were sent in large numbers to the Foundling Hospital in Dublin, which who received between ,-, orphans annually. The hospitalrsquos mortality rate was some %.In Ballynahinch, under Presbyterian auspices, some such infants were spared this grisly fate. The lives of a number of potential orphans were actively protected by the church in their home town.Under the Welfare Reform Act of , Disabled Living Allowance was controversially replaced with Personal Independence Payment. DLA payments were made to claimants who often had long term medical conditions. The amount of the award ied according to the degree of disability.Interestingly, in Ballynahinch in the early s, First Presbyterian made a number of long-term DLA-type awards to some lsquosupplicantsrsquo.Ms Grissel Foreman was on such a benefit from -. Some financial records of the Poorrsquos Money still exist. But all its other documentation is lost, so we donrsquot know what Grisselrsquos ailment actually was. It was obviously slow and progressive, perhaps something like tuberculosis, or multiple sclerosis, or Parkinsonrsquos.As her condition deteriorated, the church increased its amount of financial support. In  she received seven payments totalling s d. By  this had escalated to  payments totalling pound s d.She died in  and was buried at church expense. Over  years, amounts paid to her totalled pound s d. This was an enormous sum, considering the church ministerrsquos annual stipend at the time was pound.These and many other such stories will be outlined on Monday night at Down Museum.

We must go out there and grab them by selling what the district has to offer.Cllr Curran said given that the Newry, Mourne and Down area is the third largest of the provincersquos  district councils, it should be an ldquoattractive proposition for potential investors.ldquoThe focus moving forward must be on new job creation in both the public and private sector. It is important that we sell what the area has to offer.In relation to public sector job opportunities, Cllr Curran said available space at the Downshire Civic Centre could be utilised by a number of government departments keen to decentralise their operations from the greater Belfast area.He continued: ldquoNew investment will not happen out of the blue. We all have a duty to work together to secure it. I believe we need new hotels and there is a need for such a facility in the Downpatrick area and hope see progress on this issue in the near future.Cllr Curran is particularly keen to see the proposed commercial development at the site of the former Irish Street police station in Downpatrick and a number of adjacent derelict buildings progressed this year.ldquoThis exciting proposal has the potential to restore Downpatrickrsquos economic heart, create jobs and, most importantly, provide a boost for existing businesses via increased footfall, he said.Cllr Curran also warned that while attracting new investment is crucial, cracking Downpatrickrsquos traffic congestion problem is also essential.ldquoGridlock continues to stle town centre investment and we need to act quickly. While expensive schemes have been proposed in the past, nothing has happened. We must see progress in  and ensure roads officials deliver.ldquoWork was completed recently on a major upgrade of the Collinsrsquo Corner junction and while welcome, I and others remain to be convinced that it will address congestion problems in the heart of the town.Cllr Curran said roads officials also deserve praise for the improvement scheme in Fountain Street and hopes that in  efforts will be made by the Department for Infrastructure to improve Edward Street.He added: ldquoThis is a real problem area which has not been addressed. The presence of a busy primary school should ensure that roads officials redouble their efforts to improve driver and pedestrian safety.

Rail chiefs, who had been hoping for investment after the railways had proved so crucial to the war effort a few years earlier and that the buses would be barred from competing with the trains and instead provide a feeder service to stations, were devastated at the outcome.ldquoThe recommendation, accepted by Stormont, was that the entire Belfast and County Down Railway main line from Belfast to Newcastle, including the branches to Donaghadee, Ballynahinch and Ardglass, should be closed.The only route to be saved was the Belfast to Bangor connection, which continues operating successfully to this day.Mr Gardiner continued: ldquoThe attitude of Stormont was that it would be cheaper to move everything to the roads than to invest in railways that had been run down during the Second World War. People would use the buses instead. They developed huge road building schemes mdash most were never completed mdash but closed the railways first before these were even started. It seems incredible today.ldquoThe most puzzling element of the decision was the axing of the Belfast to Newtownards line, which served the east of the city mdash Dundonald, Knock and Comber areas in which the suburbs were developing and likely to provide increased commuter traffic had they been spared.ldquoIndeed, there were more than enough new diesel trains ordered to operate both the Bangor and Newtownards lines mdash and evidence suggests that the Transport Tribunal expected Stormont to spare the Comber line as a compromise option and as late as , before the tracks were lted, they were calling on the minister responsible to reverse the decision and trial these new diesel trains on this section of track mdash a call that fell on deaf ears.The  closures were the first steps in a plan which was to see the reduction of the Northern Irelandrsquos railway network from  miles to  miles mdash a decrease of  per cent.A decade later, the Great Northern Railway was ided between the UTA and its counterpart in the Republic, CIE, and further closures to lines to Armagh, Dungannon, Omagh and Strabane occurred.Willie Watterson and James Magill, who were porters and ticket clerks at Newcastle and Tullymurry stations, recalled their memories of the last train in an interview recorded for the BBC documentary lsquoRaising Steamrsquo in ldquoThe last train was a Sunday night. It was a cold winter night, January , , said Willie. There was twelve coaches, and two engines and two guards. She was packed. Packed to the doors. So I lit all the lamps, and put detonators on the line to give her a send-off.James added: ldquoI think every station did the same thing, so when the train came in there was a salute of bangs. I felt terrible about it, terribly terribly sad. I still felt it couldnrsquot happen. Still felt theyrsquoll come back, theyrsquoll run again. I couldnrsquot believe therersquod be no more railways, after working on them so hard.Adam Hamilton, who was a fireman mdash the person who stoked the fire on the steam locomotives mdash said: ldquoIt broke my heart, because the railways were in my blood. I still hear the sound of the steam still running on a clear night puffing away.Today, the Downpatrick and County Down Railway keeps the memory alive through its reconstruction of two miles of the former main line, as well as restored carriages rescued from their fate as hen houses.As part of its commemorations of the BCDRrsquos demise, it is keen to make contact with anyone who had any connection with the network, including former employees or their families, or people in possession of railway memorabilia such as photographs, tickets, timetables or even carriages.Mr Gardiner added: ldquoOne thing we would love for the museum is a BCDR unorm or tunic. So far we have been unable to track one down. Perhaps you have something in your loft And what of the future of the line  In November  the section of the BCDRrsquos former main line from Holywood Arches to Comber was opened as the Comber Greenway, whilst other sections have been used for roads as well as the section around Downpatrick being used by the DCDR.In the early s Northern Ireland Railways prepared a feasibility study into reopening the line to Newtownards, but this was not taken further by the Direct Rule administration.In May , the Department for Regional Development published its Railway Investment Prioritisation Strategy, which promised feasibility studies into the reopening of closed railway routes to Armagh, Dungannon and Castledawson by , but not including the Comber Newtownards route.However, maybe  years after the first railway closure in Northern Ireland, the new Minister for Infrastructure in the restored Stormont Government might see the first of those historic mistakes rectied.The Downpatrick Railway Museum can be contacted via email at info@downrail or message at www.facebook downrail..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th January 2020 Mickey.jpg","title":"Mickey ‘magic’ to help Magpies lift cup  ","story":"KILCOOrsquoS tearaways may hold the key to success in Sundayrsquos All-Ireland Club SFC final at Croke Park.The ability of their six forwards to win dirty ball and turnovers could dismantle the perceived invincibility of Corofinrsquos much-vaunted defensive system.Corofin, described in many quarters as the best club team ever, have an enviable set of defenders who squeeze the le out of the opposition.However, they have never encountered a team like Kilcoo before that has  attackers and  defenders.Conor Laverty, the three Johnston brothers mdash Ryan, Jerome and Shealan mdash Paul Devlin and Ryan McEvoy fight tooth and nail for every ball.They are the clubrsquos first line of defence and are not afraid to go where angels fear to tread, but can then turn into a snatch squad with the blink of an eye.Kilcoo will have to be at their bestthey are to cause an upset as the Galway and Connacht champions are sizzling hot favourites at   to win the Andy Merrigan Cup for an unprecedented third year in a row and the fourth time in six years.Certainly, Kilcoo have it all to do, but they fear no side.Manager Mickey Moran has twice taken Slaughtneil to All-Ireland finals day and few would begrudge the Derry man a first title with Kilcoo.He has transformed the Magpies into a ruthless, disciplined machine in a quiet, unobtrusive way and has won many admirers for his style of play.He started out in management in  when he took over the reins at Derry, the first of three separate spells in charge of the county team.

While pay parity and safe services are key issues for us, the key thing is that there are enough recurrent resources in place to deliver this now and in the future.Irene said the RCN is about putting patients first, describing the scale of the hospital waiting list issue as ldquounacceptable.She added: ldquoEmploying more nurses can help bring waiting lists down. This is not a new phenomena. It is tough to work as a nurse and it is not an easy job. But we currently have a situation where some nurses are taking on extra shts to earn more money, but that is just an unacceptable way to live.Alison Megarry said patients are nursesrsquo primary concern and at the heart of what they do, highlighting the need to keep staff working in Northern Ireland to ensure they donrsquot go across the water and donrsquot come back.She revealed that she was talking to a nursing sister last week who was working on international recruitment for nurses in Mumbai to work in Northern Ireland.ldquoThe nurses in India said why would they come here when the pay is less than it is in England, Scotland and Wales. I believe thatwe can keep our nurses here, it will help to tackle the waiting list issue, she said. ldquoThe big issue we have is that the population is ageing and people are living longer which therefore impacts on waiting lists.Nurse Sonia McCoubrey said that while pay parity is one issue, additional nurses are also required. She said many newly qualied nurses are choosing to go to England, Scotland or Wales because the money is better.She also said she worries about the safety of newly qualied nurses managing dficult situations and the patients they are caring for.ldquoYou have trolley waits and people lying in corridors. There is no privacy, no dignity and the situation is appalling. You go home at night after a sht burnt out and worried about what you have seen, the nurse added.Nurse Donna Boyd also expressed concern about waiting lists and said she fears that the situation is going to get worse, forcing many people to go private.ldquoIf more money is put into the system nurses are quite happy to do even more to help reduce waiting lists. All nurses go and above what is required of them when they are working, often staying after their scheduled quitting time which is unpaid work, she said.ldquoWith more people going private because of y waiting lists, a lot of the doctors and consultants are taking on private lists which then impacts on the NHS list. I have friends who were nurses who have left the profession to work in supermarkets because they have burnt themselves out.

Across the resort,  street lights are not working.The figures are available on the NI Direct website under the reporting fault problems menu with other districthot-spots including Ballynahinch where  street lights are currently out of order.Elsewhere,  faults have been reported in Killyleagh, with  brought to the government departmentrsquos attention in Castlewellan and Crossgar. In Saintfield,  faults have been reported.In Ballygowan,  street lights are currently out of order with  and  faults reported in Ardglass and Killough respectively.Sixteen street lights are out of order in Dundrum with  faults reported in Drumaness. The figures for the Spa and Clough are  and nine respectively.Last month, the Department for Infrastructure confirmed that its current budget for street lighting repairs was approximately poundm, explaining that the figure was much lower than the pound.m needed to provide a full street lighting repair service.It also revealed that repairs are now generally limited to those that can be carried out by the departmentrsquos internal street lighting workforce which only consists of five full and three part time electricians.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran described the number of reported street light faults across large parts of East Down as ldquoalarming and hopes that the money to expedite much-needed repairs will be earmarked by the new Stormont Executive.He said broken street lights in many areas represent a health and safety issue, explaining that an examination of every town and village across the district will reveal a signicant number of faults.Cllr Curran described faulty street lights as a ldquohot topic with politicians being contacted about the issue on all almost daily basis. He said the legacy of underfunding the roads department has experienced is now clear for all to see.The politician said many will be concerned that the Department for Infrastructure does not have the money it requires to carry out much-needed repairs.ldquoWhile I understand the decision to prioritise emergency repairs, there is no doubt that the alarming figure of almost  faulty street lights across East Down is simply going to increase. Clearly the issue is going to get a lot worse before it gets better, he said.ldquoStreet lights which are not working in areas where elderly people and indeed young families live poses a major problem. A fully working street lighting system provides residents with a sense of security and helps deter would-be criminals.Cllr Curran said that while the new Stormont Executive will inevitably face calls for investment in many key areas including health and education, the Department of Infrastructure also required an injection of funding.He added: ldquoWhile the focus for some will be on major new roads schemes which is understandable, it is clear that the creaking infrastructure the government department is responsible for, including street lighting, requires major cash injection.ldquoThe street lighting issues requires immediate attention. We are still in the grip of winter and several months away from the clearer evenings. Now that we have a local minister in place, I hope to meet her on this issue and other matters of local importance.A spokeswoman for the Department for Infrastructure said that in common with many other parts of the public service, the Department continued to face budget challenges and resources were currently not available to provide for a full street lighting repair service.She added: ldquoDue to this restricted service, outages are taking longer than usual to be repaired. However, priority will be given to hazardous electrical defects and group outages..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th January 2020 Tributes.jpg","title":"Tributes to lawyer who was ‘a real gentleman’  ","story":"TRIBUTES have been paid to a lawyer who died last week.Mr Paul McAlinden, who was a barrister, died peacefully in Belfast City Hospital last Wednesday.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Sadly, these ldquowins have not been quick, yet to become a reality.Penarth commuters are still being shuttled into work each morning on overcrowded pacers, and this is simply not good enough. The new rolling stock we were promised seems many years away, when the reality is we need it now. Welsh Government need to pull their finger out and sort this out. Transport is their responsibility and they need to get a grip of the situation.The controversial Barry incinerator is a saga that seems to be rumbling on and on. I have long held deep concerns about the site, with the minister responsible for making the decision indicating almost two years ago she was ldquominded to insist an Environmental Impact Assessment be carried out.This week in the Assembly, I raised these concerns yet again, and the minister confirmed that an Environmental Statement has been submitted by the developer and is currently being reviewed. She claimed NRW are monitoring compliance throughout the testing phase, and that this is the latest position.Locally, there have been several apparently unconfirmed rumours that the site will be up and running in a matter of days, and I was disappointed the minister failed to give a categorical answer on this. I have always said the site is wholly unsuitable, and the Welsh Assembly have let local people down in their handling of this.I was very pleased last week to see a statement from Cardf and the Vale Health Board dropping controversial plans to close the Sam Davies ward at Barry Hospital. Under the proposals, the  bed ward was to close, with services transferred to the Heath and Llandough. While I welcome the announcement, they also confirmed new proposals will be brought forward this week.

Sadly, these ldquowins have not been quick, yet to become a reality.Penarth commuters are still being shuttled into work each morning on overcrowded pacers, and this is simply not good enough. The new rolling stock we were promised seems many years away, when the reality is we need it now. Welsh Government need to pull their finger out and sort this out. Transport is their responsibility and they need to get a grip of the situation.The controversial Barry incinerator is a saga that seems to be rumbling on and on. I have long held deep concerns about the site, with the minister responsible for making the decision indicating almost two years ago she was ldquominded to insist an Environmental Impact Assessment be carried out.This week in the Assembly, I raised these concerns yet again, and the minister confirmed that an Environmental Statement has been submitted by the developer and is currently being reviewed. She claimed NRW are monitoring compliance throughout the testing phase, and that this is the latest position.Locally, there have been several apparently unconfirmed rumours that the site will be up and running in a matter of days, and I was disappointed the minister failed to give a categorical answer on this. I have always said the site is wholly unsuitable, and the Welsh Assembly have let local people down in their handling of this.I was very pleased last week to see a statement from Cardf and the Vale Health Board dropping controversial plans to close the Sam Davies ward at Barry Hospital. Under the proposals, the  bed ward was to close, with services transferred to the Heath and Llandough. While I welcome the announcement, they also confirmed new proposals will be brought forward this week. Given the statement did not include explicit commitment to keep the ward open, I fear we will see a rehashed version of the same plans in the near future. It has not been a good month for the Welsh NHS, with recent figures confirming wait times were joint worst on record.

While policy decisions have yet to be made, heat pumps are the indicated preference.ldquoOver % of oil heated homes in Great Britain fall into EPC bands D to G ndash meaning they are poorly insulated and so unsuited for heat pumps without costly insulation work.ldquoFinancial support to help the poorest families switch heating systems would most likely be made available but many households will be expected to fund the work themselves.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels.

The UKrsquos withdrawal from the EU will begin later this month and we have a Conservative Government in Westminster until at least .Regardless of the numbers in the Commons, the Labour Party still has to stand up for those we represent. I am confident that my colleague, Stephen Doughty MP will continue to do that.The Labour Party will now move to elect a new Leader and Deputy Leader, a chance to reunite the Party and hold the Prime Minister to account for his actions.I am truly glad to see that several MPs from across the Party have put their names forward to stand for both positions. This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Diverging substantiallywill bring in the requirement for inspections at the border for customs. “That hasn’t been agreed formally. That is quite a lot for UK and NI operators to deal with – haulage and freight movers, to get to grips with that. There are major operational challenges.“Northern Ireland also leave the customs union with GB, but there will be a customs border will between GB and NI to continue to essentially allow freight and good to travel.”Since Boris Johnson’s deal was floated, it’s understood the shipping industry is now drawing up plans for EU border checks in Britain for trade bound for Northern Ireland.According to the BBC, freight could be erted through ports with space for inspections at areas such as Liverpool and Stranraer.Richard says checks are likely to be carried out at the ports. The issue  He says backlogs, queues and congestion. “ to queueing back on to ferries and ships, which may miss or mess up timetables,” he says. He says while “many wouldn’t welcome new formalities”, a lot of cargo – such as dry bulk, fuel, aggregates and containerised products –  will find it reasonably easy to deal with. The main concern is around ‘roll on, roll off’, where the containers or lorries are driven on board a ship.“Those modes are where it could be the most problematic, as it’s based on a fluid process,” he says.“I think there is a definite concern from ports and shipping industries that businesses may be impacted negatively, and may reassess business operations.“I wouldn’t say it’s a doomsday scenario but it’s a real challenge for the sector to overcome. Politicians will have to make sure that with any kind of arrangements, there will be a good solution. This is a new proposal, so we are unsure what the details will be.”Brexit aside, Richard says the industry as a whole is that while the largely commercial and independent ports aren’t in need of ‘hand outs’ from the public sector, areas such as connectivity, roads and planning are key to their success.“It’s about making sure the planning system works, and is swt, and responsive,” he said. “They can be agile, for example, building a new shed, terminal or quay, or new developments in the water.“Where there are environmental sensitivities it can sometimes slow down the planning regimes so we are keen to see them not slow down. We welcome environmental policies but we want a scheme that will work and doesn’t have unintended consequences.“Shipping, although not perfect, is one of the most clean and efficient methods of transport. It’s a balance between environmental protection, but enabling ports and regions to grow.“If there are schemes, ports can find there are investors willing to come in, but they do rely on government – local or national – to finance road and rail connectivity.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/year1.jpg","title":"yearbook a look back at ","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business It was another year shaped by political turmoil and the loss of some giants of industry, but it was also a period which saw great opportunity and growth.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/234234343334.jpg","title":"stormont deal business back new assembly","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith and Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Pic Kelvin Boyes Northern Ireland’s business community has given its support for a deal which has seen the Assembly up-and-running after a three year stasis. The Northern Ireland Assembly couldon Fridaypolitical parties back a deal tabled by the UK and Irish Governments. DUP leader Arlene Foster has indicated that her party will back the deal, while Sinn Fein said its leadership will meet to discuss it on Friday. The UUP has said they will consider the deal, but are willing to attend the Assemblyit sits. In a joint statement urging politicians to accept the ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal, NI Chamber president John Healy, vice president Ian Henry, and chief executive Ann McGregor, said: “After three years of paralysis, we now have a workable deal that will allow an Executive to start addressing the problems within our health service and education system. They will also be able to take action to grow our economy and support the community and voluntary sector. “We therefore encourage the five main political parties to progress it urgently. Business, health and education cannot wait any longer - failure is not an option. “Now is the time for our politicians to show mature leadership and help navigate a path to the future by accepting this deal.” Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney published the New Decade, New Approach deal on Thursday evening and urged parties to back it andto Stormont on Friday. Reacting to the news, Trade NI – the alliance of Retail NI, Manufacturing NI and Hospitality Ulster – said: “We welcome the draft deal published by the British and Irish Governments in the final round of talks to restore devolution. We strongly encourage all the main parties of Northern Ireland to sign the deal today and get the Assembly back up and running.” “As our three organisations represent the majority of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland, we are cautiously hopeful that the deal and aof the Assembly will see the development of policies and legislation at devolved level and the kick start that our economy desperately needs. The clear prioritisation of the Northern Ireland economy highlights the many challenges that businesses have faced over the past three years and our message to the parties is that we support you in your endeavours to secure this deal.” “While this is a good start, improvements are still needed to drive the economy forward and support the growth of business across Northern Ireland. As stated in our Vision  document, Northern Ireland’s potential is signicant but reform and growth is needed to create the modern economy we are capable of and deserve.” FSB NI policy chair, Tina McKenzie, said: “Businesses will welcome the agreement published last night as a step forward towards restoring devolved government, something for which FSB has been calling since the collapse of the institutions three years ago. “The draft agreement contains some positive commitments to bolster the local economy, on issues like skills, infrastructure and Brexit. However, theof devolution is by no means a panacea it just means that at long last we have elected representatives in place to tackle a very dficult task. “The next Executive must move quickly to deliver on the myriad issues which have been left unaddressed for far too long. While the health service will be high on the agenda, we must not lose sight of the need to bolster our SME economy, which is the absolute bedrock on which the first-class public services to which we all aspire are built. “Ministers must move swtly to support our economy at one of the most turbulent times for many decades, starting by lowering the rates burden on small businesses, whilst also moving forward rapidly with key infrastructure projects which have stalled and ensuring that our schools, colleges, and universities are providing students with the skills they need for the jobs of the future. “In order to begin to address these issues, the parties must put pragmatism first and get back round the Executive table.” Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster, said: “We encourage all parties to seize this opportunity and sign up to the deal published late last night to get the Assembly and Executive back as quickly as possible.” “This is the best chance to bring the devolved government back to le. Our message to the party leaders is clear, we support you in your endeavours and encourage you to get the New Decade, New Approach agreement over the line today. Redmond McFadden, president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce said: “The Londonderry Chamber as well as other representatives of business, education, health, trade unions and civic organisations, held a meeting with the five main political parties at Stormont last night. “At that meeting we pressed the urgent need for the parties to agree the draft deal which was published by the British and Irish Governments. Three years without Ministers making local decisions has had an enormous impact on our economy and wider society. A lack of effective and meaningful representation here is curtailing investment in our region, stling job creation and driving our young people away. Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, said: “Belfast Chamber welcomes progress towards the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and encourages the local political parties to reach agreement. For the last three years, our members have seen how an absence of decision making has stunted growth and stled investment. The proposed priorities for the Executive contain some issues which Belfast Chamber has been supportive of for some time. “Other policies which could boost our economy are noticeably missing but we look forward to joining with our colleagues across the business community to ensure that the new Executive pursues an agenda that grows jobs and boosts our economy.” Northern Ireland Local Government Association chief executive, Derek McCallan said: “I am very pleased that the British and Irish governments have tabled a draft deal on restoring the NI Executive. I hope that an agreement can be reached quickly to get the Stormont institutions back up and running immediately. For three years, our eleven local councils have been the only ing form of democratically elected government in Northern Ireland. Local government has been a vital democratic anchor during this period and ensured the provision of crucial public services for local citizens. “It’s time to bridge the democratic deficit and unlock the potential of local government in Northern Ireland by investing in our local councils. An Executive commitment to a devolution bill and greater financial powers and resources will drive a transformation in Northern Ireland’s democratic governance and help create a more sustainable democracy, environment and economy for Northern Ireland.” Kirsty McManus, national director, IoD NI, said: “The ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal is to be welcomed, filled with ambition that,fulfilled, can deliver real improvements for the people and businesses of Northern Ireland. “We would therefore urge all parties to get behind the deal to enable the speedy restoration of the Executive. “Commitments from the British and Irish governments for some crucial pieces of infrastructure such as the York Street Interchange, upgrades to the A and A road and Northern Ireland’s wastewater network are particularly pleasing. “The expansion of university provision at the Magee campus in Derry meanwhile will go some way to rebalancing the regional economy. “Plans for multi-year budgets and increased civic engagement will also improve overall governance. “From a business perspective however, we would have liked to have seen more around a new skills agenda, which urgently require focus alongside a renewed look at the Apprenticeship Levy which is not included in this deal. “On behalf of our members, we will also monitor closely commitments to bring forward legislation that will allow unfettered access to the Great Britain market for local business following Brexit.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_Abacus-Grand-Central-1--1-.jpg","title":"belfastforlife expo bringing together ni diaspora","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by Ulster Business A new event will bring together the Northern Ireland diaspora and business community in a bid to promote and develop the region.

The firm is marking two decades leading the way in the industry, and according to founder Terry Moore, the firm is well on its way to doubling its size and embracing the latest technology for its clients Outsource Solutions is a firm which is ahead of the curve when it comes to emerging technologies and a company which embeds itself in a client’s business to ensure total integration – ultimately helping to boost it and help it grow.“Our approach is to embed ourselves into the customer’s business, and take IT out of the boardroom,” Terry says. “What we do is try to get ahead of some of the problems, understand the business and recognise that the technology is there to benefit the company.“We are there to make sure that business is possible – enriching lives, making things easier and safer. An important part of this is the relationships that we have.”Terry formed Outsource Solutions  years ago, around the time of the so-called ‘millennium bug’ when he says some firms were using scare tactics to get businesses to spend hundreds of thousands of pounds, often unnecessarily. “For me, one of the things I felt was missing was understanding a business and factoring that refresh into it over a few years – letting them get on with what they do.”The company – which now has five locations, including Belfast – is a full service IT firm which manages every element of a business’s infrastructure, including security, enterprise wi-fi, telecoms and networking.“We now have just over  staff and are we are on a five-year plan to double in size again. There has been considerable growth in areas such as enterprise wi-fi, converged networks and telecoms,” Terry says.Client retention is also something which Terry and the business prides itself on. “Every customer that we signed up with in , we still work with,” he says. “We will give a recommendation as to how we think a network should be built. If they accept that, then we take it on as a risk.“Technology is just a toolbox for us to allow us to deliver IT – technology to allow them to really access and control their data.”Outsource is a business which has been at the forefront of emerging developments in technology, including cyber-security. Terry says, even just a few years ago, it wasn’t being taken seriously by many businesses. That has now changed signicantly.“In the last couple of years, cyber has completely exploded – but we were ahead of our time,” he says. “My experience of last  years and the last five in particular is that there has been a massive job to do in educating businesses and their users about the cyber threat.“We have reached the tipping point and the human firewall is becoming much stronger – people and users are more sensitive to what it means, making it all a far better place. But there are still businesses which are happy to cut fast and loose, and take risks.”While the company’s client base started off in professional services businesses – such as law and accounting – it’s grown into a host of sectors, including transport, logistics, manufacturing and engineering.“We have carved out a niche in hospitality as well – particularly in areas such as enterprise wi-fi, converged networks and communication, generally.”Terry says Outsource is seeing business growth among many of Northern Ireland’s medium-sized businesses, with more than  staff.“Our job is to enhance, improve and optimise the performance for as many users as we can. Our aim over the next four years is to be able to deliver those services outside Northern Ireland, across the rest of the UK and into the Republic of Ireland.“For us, the constant is that we are always there at that point of where technology is consumed. The role we play is being integrated and a trusted advisor. That’s how we will continue to be successful.”As for the next  years, with a rise in automation and articial intelligence – something Terry says has to become a little more intelligent and a little less articial – the next major leap will be the advent of quantum computing. It’s something which remains in its infancy.“While it’s still early, we are on the verge of the most aggressive technological change that any of us have ever seen,” he says.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
