It would be the first time that Hajj has been cancelled since the founding of the Saudi state in 1932. The year-round Umrah pilgrimage to Mecca was suspended in March for fears it would increase the spread of coronavirus in the Arabic kingdom. On March 5 the Grand Mosque was completely closed so it could be disinfected, before reopening a few days later with touching of the cubic Kaaba shrine banned.Since then it has been largely empty as Muslims were urged to stay away due to coronavirus.It comes after Iran suffered the Middle East\u0027s worst virus outbreak after refusing to shut down religious cities such as Qom despite evidence the virus was widespread there.Millions of Muslims around the world are now celebrating Ramadan in relative isolation amid coronavirus lockdowns that have seen large gatherings - such as those where the fast is typically broken - banned."},{"url":null,"title":"Royal Mail scraps Saturday letter deliveries notice","story":"Share this article \u0027Customers should continue to post both letters and parcels as usual on Saturday.

Tom Jenkins has been taking an enforced break from action photography and pursuing a different kind of vision in his gardenI have never appreciated my back garden so much.At this time of year, I’m usually caught up with all the to-ings and fro-ings of the sporting world: taking photos of traditional spring events like the Boat Race and Grand National, or key matches as the football season builds to a crescendo. Normally I’m away a lot, not really passing an eye over developments in my garden. But this is not a normal year.It was mid-March, and I was sitting despondently in my tiny postage stamp of a garden. The previous week I had photographed the Cheltenham festival, an event I associate with the end of winter, spring coming, the light getting better. A chance to look ahead to a summer of sport, going to events that I love. But this year, the festival had felt all wrong – more like a dangerous party on the eve of war. It seemed all around me the news was harrowing, and sport was getting hammered as event after event was cancelled. My world had suddenly been turned upside-down.I realised then that I had to reframe and refocus. With all my normal avenues for taking pictures closed off, I needed to find something else. I recalled the words of Ed Jackson, a former professional rugby player whose portrait I had taken exactly a year earlier. After suffering an awful accident that had left him partially paralysed, he had developed a mental process to cope with his new situation: focus on what’s in front of you, focus on things you can affect, and try to forget what’s out of your control.Remembering this, I looked round the edge of the tiny piece of lawn and noticed some tulip bulbs that my wife had planted in terracotta pots. Lush green leaves with buds full of promise had emerged from the soil, ready to bloom. In these plants, I saw hope. I saw normality.It occurred to me then that this process of growth and positivity deserved to be documented. Despite the global madness, nature was thriving – and these tulips seemed to be begging me to tell their story. To me, photography is more than just a career: it is my passion, and in these flowers I found the perfect opportunity to take pictures without leaving my home.To test myself, I decided not to use any of my main professional cameras. These are more used to the hurly-burly of sport, all fast focusing and speedy motor-drive. Instead, I turned to what I call my “holiday camera”, an upmarket point-and-shoot that I take away on trips with the family (the last thing I want on holiday is to be surrounded by items associated with work, many of which are heavy). Light, easy to manoeuvre around the plants, and – most crucially – able to focus close-up, this small camera actually turned out to be perfect for this project.As the sun moved round the garden during the day, backgrounds became dark and shadows on the flowers created gorgeous patterns. I would note which times were best to photograph certain plants, and would periodically drop whichever household task I was doing (much to the irritation of my family) to race to the garden and catch the flowers in the perfect light.Like all photographers, I look to light as another tool in the box, an opportunity to create something different. By varying angles, I could make petals look like paper, tightly bunched flower heads look like lips. Going in tight, I attempted to show the beauty of the flowers in a surreal way. The warm spring sunshine of the last few weeks had not only ushered the tulips into full bloom but enhanced their colour and vibrancy, so some of my photographs gained an almost unearthly quality.I’ve never felt so lucky to have my garden, this tiny oasis in densely crowded north London. In the land of quarantine, my house has never felt more like a castle, defending me from the warzone outside the front gate. In that castle, my garden is the green inner sanctum, a place of peace and tranquillity.As I sit here now, in the sunshine, I hear birdsong and the rustling of leaves, with the chirruping of children playing wafting in on the breeze. The sky above my head is free from planes and pollution and a brilliant blue. The sun, bright and sharp at this time of year, makes everything look crisp. In times like these, we remember that nature truly is life-affirming, and the simple act of flowers growing means so much. It shows that in an abnormal world, normality is king."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/084ad9a81759eca4b3e45dc73a5d18c1255b2c27/325_334_3707_2224/master/3707.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c331b86ed44abd8209e2c9386716d00f","title":"confessions art critic adrian searle notebooks","story":"From felt-tipped obscenities to sketches of his aunt stolen at a tube station, our reviewer writes about his life in the marginsOne for dreams, one for writing down things you might otherwise forget, one for composing drafts and organising your thoughts: in the end, they all get mixed up, but that’s half the fun of keeping notebooks. You could use your phone, but it isn’t the same. Unlike JMW Turner’s sketchbooks or his palette, you can’t stick an iPhone in a vitrine in some Tate archive show – should you end up there. It might ring. Nor would you pass it on as an heirloom. That would be mad, although I do still have an old answerphone cassette where I could, if I dared, listen to decades-old chivvyings from former editors and messages from the dead. This is a question less of technology and more of feeling haunted.If you are going to the bother of using a notebook, why not a real book? A book will almost always help the time pass more quickly on your travels, even if it takes you back to the 18th century or even further, say to the early northern Renaissance. There’s always a lot of catching up to be done. A book quells anxiety, even if it is one that dwells on the anxiety of others. You can’t open a book without finding something troubling, in my experience.If you don’t have a notebook, you can always write in the margins or the insides of the covers. It would teach brevity. Art catalogues often have wide margins, which gives one a bit more leeway. And isn’t every book a rewriting of someone else’s? And every picture too, come to that. Literature is, after all, meant to be improving. And some people think they can always improve on what someone else has written or painted or drawn. They’re forever looking to pick holes or find mistakes. There are even some critics who think it is their job to swan about the place correcting mistakes and eliminating errors. But the damage has already been done.Going about my researches, I have often taken out library books only to find them spoiled with invasive scribblings, often intended, it seems to me, with the next borrower in mind. Passages of the original work underlined and adumbrated with exclamation marks and double or even treble question marks phrases scored out and notes running down the margin at right angles to the printed text. We are not just talking about novels here, however elevated they might be, but also works of philosophy, psychology, history and literary criticism, art history and art criticism, including those that are filled with theories and have hardly any pictures in them. Even no pictures at all, but pages of footnotes and a copious index.Whenever I come to sell or donate the art catalogues that pile up during the course of my work, I have to check that I haven’t left any of my own notes scattered within the pages, or defaced the sumptuous coloured images with felt-tipped obscenities and curses, cigarette burns, scribbled-on moustaches or dicks or other impetuous graffiti, somewhat in the manner of Antonin Artaud, which sometimes happens when the urge is upon me.I must admit I can never entirely believe the things I write in notebooks. The handwriting makes me suspicious. What if you were to find yourself in some intellectual hangout, a cafe with a literary reputation? You’d hardly want to be seen writing in the Café de Flore in Paris, would you, no matter how high-flown your topic. Only tourists go there now, and probably get a little thrill writing things while they sip their coffee, just to get an inkling of what it must feel like to be writing in the Café de Flore. Once it would have been postcards, but now they post their little selfies on Instagram, with notes that say: “I am writing this in Café de Flore, can you believe it?”All too easily, unfortunately.Rubbing their knees together in delight under the tabletop, and squeezing their eyes shut until they feel the blood roaring in their ears, they overflow with glee, and with the urge to communicate their excitement, achieved by grinning inanely to the stranger at the next table, hoping they’ll get one back. It might be a famous writer they’re grinning at, although it seems unlikely. Artists and thinkers rarely go there now, nor to the nearby Les Deux Magots. Hans-Ulrich Obrist hasn’t swung by to interview anyone there for months. With one hand curled about the pen, pressed on to the first page of a brand-new Moleskine notebook bought specially for the occasion, our writer extends the other arm, and takes a photo of themselves with their mobile telephone, as if to say: Hard at it, Writer at Work, Café de Flore! I wrote something in a cafe, maybe several cafes, a long time ago. I drank too much coffee and it was complete gibberish.Those notebooks, popularised by Bruce Chatwin, who always got them from some shop in the Marais, as he insisted on telling us, always make me feel self-conscious, tainting anything I write in them before I’ve even started. As used by Vincent van Gogh, the advertising for the notebook also tells us. Perhaps the notebooks played a part in the reasons Van Gogh shot himself, when he could no longer bear people seeing him, sitting in a bar and composing his begging letters to his brother in his little Moleskine. Nowadays he’d have a begging-letter template set up on his laptop, and we would be spared a great deal of his misery. He could just as easily send a text message, saying: “Get me out of here, that Dr Gachet is completely unbearable, we were having a chat in his office and I had to go and calm down in a cafe, but the people in there were terrible, it was full of foreign tourists, you’ve no idea what Arles is like these days, so I went for a walk in this cornfield and now there’s no coverage, I can’t get a signal to call you, and there’s nowhere else I can go and no one I can turn to. I might as well be adrift in a boat on the open sea.” That’s when he shot himself, I believe, in that sea of corn.Someone stole my notebook once, in Leicester Square station. They picked my pocket. I was returning home from visiting my aunt, who was in a coma in hospital. I didn’t have a book with me that day and so whiled away the hours drawing her, on what turned out to be her deathbed. She just lay there, breathing heavily. What I really mean is snoring, at a volume quite out of proportion to her still and tiny body. The nurses had left the window open beside her, it was early autumn, and I think they hoped she would catch pneumonia and die. Not that she’d have noticed. They probably needed the bed. Anyhow, I had made several drawings of the unmoving figure of my aunt, and some bastard in the station stole my notebook, probably thinking it was a wallet. Much good may it have done them. As soon as they realised what a worthless object they had in their hands, they probably tossed it in the nearest bin without even glancing at the drawings, much less my notes. And I doubt they spent any time correcting whatever infelicities of my pen they found among my scribbled pages. Perhaps they looked at the drawings and thought the perspective was a bit off. Mine certainly was, that day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/574e922e39161f4927812ba6f2be602ac8fc58b2/0_111_6460_3880/master/6460.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba232e6634bd8b892bc03f3441e83425","title":"dutch researchers coax secrets from girl with a pearl earring","story":"Although offering insights into the artist’s technique, gallery has yet to solve Vermeer’s biggest mysteryA major research project into one of the world’s most popular and captivating paintings has revealed new secrets but the most tantalising question remains: just who was the girl with a pearl earring?Researchers at the Mauritshuis gallery in The Hague on Tuesday revealed the results of extensive investigations into its star painting, Johannes Vermeer’s Girl with a Pearl Earring, thought to date from about 1665. The Netherlands’ researchers were stunned to discover, for the first time, delicate eyelashes on the girl’s face and evidence of a green curtain behind her head. They have also gained fresh insights into how Vermeer painted the work, what changes he made and which pigments he used, including discovering that the white for the earring originated in England’s Peak District.But the biggest mystery endures and that is a good thing, said Abbie Vanere, the head of The Girl in the Spotlight research project.“We were able to find out so much about Vermeer’s materials and techniques but we still don’t know exactly who the girl is,” she said. “It is good that some mysteries remain and everyone can speculate about her. It allows people their own personal interpretation of the girl everyone feels their own connection with the way she meets your eyes.“The fact that she is still a mystery keeps people coming back and keeps her exciting and fresh.”Vanere said the two biggest discoveries were finding the girl’s eyelashes and evidence that Vermeer painted a green curtain, which has gradually faded, rather than an empty dark background.Scholars have previously speculated that the girl’s lack of eyelashes might be because Vermeer was painting an idealised or abstract face. A similar argument was made for the formless expanse behind her.Both discoveries “put the girl in a defined space and bring us a lot closer to her”, said Vanere. They suggest Vermeer was faithfully observing and painting a real person in a real space.Speculating on who the girl was, with her enigmatic expression, wide eyes, unusual blue turban and huge pearl earring, remains part of the fun.The novelist Tracy Chevalier, in her book Girl with a Pearl Earring, which became a successful film, imagines the character as a maid in Vermeer’s house who is persuaded to secretly pose for him. The Mauritshuis research has also brought us closer to Vermeer’s painting techniques, said Vanere, showing how he began composing the painting in various shades of brown and black before adding the colours, working systematically from the background to the foreground.The pearl itself is an illusion in that “it has no contour and also no hook to hang it from the girl’s ear”, she said.Researchers also discovered changes Vermeer made, including shifting the position of the ear, the top of the headscarf and the back of the neck.Researchers have been able to pinpoint where the raw materials for the colours came from. Vermeer would have bought them in his home town of Delft, but the lead ore in his white would have come from the Peak District the cochineal in his red was made from insects that lived on cacti in Mexico and South America and the blue in the headscarf was made from the semi-precious stone lapis lazuli, from what is now Afghanistan. It is surprising how much he used, said Vanere, because in the 17th century it would have been more precious than gold.The director of the Mauritshuis, Martine Gosselink, said: “The girl hasn’t revealed the secret of her identity yet but we got to know her a little better. This is not the end point of our research.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/731d2002f3539574969d3ea4fd53c8808ce557c9/0_134_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c49e85bb22c0bbe9341e944179862855","title":"show some solidarity artists posters to help struggling arts venues in pictures","story":"Gillian Wearing and Wolfgang Tillmans are among the 40 artists designing posters for 2020Solidarity, a Between Bridges project helping cultural groups during the coronavirus pandemic"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7bfa9746a2c50766c336b277c936779d101433d/0_15_1920_1153/master/1920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d0d0ced83dfd042bd9f906b6c626a29","title":"british airways plans to make up to 12000 staff redundant","story":"BA boss says more than one in four jobs could go as coronavirus causes global collapse in air travelBritish Airways has set out plans to make up to 12,000 of its staff redundant because of the global collapse in air travel in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.The airline’s chief executive, Alex Cruz, told BA’s 42,000 staff on Tuesday night that the company “must act decisively now to ensure that British Airways has a strong future” and that means more than one in four jobs must be cut.Cruz said the UK’s flag carrier airline, which has placed 22,600 people on the government’s furlough scheme, “cannot expect the taxpayer to offset salaries indefinitely”.“Yesterday, British Airways flew just a handful of aircraft out of Heathrow. On a normal day we would fly more than 300. What we are facing as an airline, like so many other businesses up and down the country, is that there is no ‘normal’ any longer,” Cruz said in a letter to staff .“We are a strong, well-managed business that has faced into, and overcome, many crises in our hundred-year history. We must overcome this crisis ourselves, too.”Cruz said the airline and its parent company International Airlines Group, had informed the government and its trade unions about its plans to cut jobs, and would begin a consultation period with staff and unions immediately.“This has been a difficult message to write and one I never thought I would need to send,” Cruz said.“I know how tight-knit the BA family is, and how concerned you will be, not just for yourself but for your colleagues, too. We must act decisively now to ensure that British Airways has a strong future and continues connecting Britain with the world.”IAG said it had plunged to a loss of €535m (£465m) in the first three months of this year – with all the damage being done in March. In the same period last year the airline group made a profit of €135m. IAG also revealed it had made a one-off loss of €1.3bn – the result of taking out contracts to hedge against the possibility of rising oil prices. In fact the oil price has crashed.IAG said BA had been hit hardest, with other airlines in the group – Iberia, Aer Lingus and Vueling – feeling less impact.Unions responded with anger. Brian Strutton, the general secretary of the pilots’ union Balpa, said staff were devastated by the “bolt out of the blue” news and that the union would fight for every job.“BA pilots and all staff are devastated by the announcement of up to 12,000 possible job losses in British Airways,” he said.BA, he added, had “said it was wealthy enough to weather the Covid storm and declined any government support.”The leader of the Unite union described BA’s decision as heartless, and a “stab in the back”, saying it was “entirely at odds with the course of action followed by our European competitors as they seek a way through the coronavirus crisis”.Len McCluskey said: “To reject government support but then expect their own staff to pay the cost of such a misjudgement, is irresponsible, dangerous and destructive and is utterly at odds with the mood of the country at a time of crisis.”Nadine Houghton, national officer of GMB, the union for British Airways ground staff, said: “If the 12,000 figure is accurate this will be a huge blow for our loyal members.“I know our reps will work day and night to limit the impact on our members but 12,000 employees is a staggering number. All our efforts will be out into bringing that number down.”The airline industry is facing its biggest ever challenge with the vast majority of flights grounded around the world. It is unclear when governments will allow airlines to resume a regular schedule.When planes do take to the skies again social distancing measures – which are likely to limit the density of passengers onboard – will make it hard for airlines to make the same profits as before.The global airlines trade association, Iata, has predicted that airlines could lose more than $300bn (£240bn) in the fallout from the pandemic and warned that 25m jobs are at risk.“This is an emergency. Airlines around the world are struggling to survive,” Alexandre de Juniac, Iata’s director general, said last week.“Governments will need financially viable airlines to lead the economic recovery. Many of them won’t be around to do that if they have run out of cash. “We could see more than half of passenger revenues disappear. That would be a $314bn hit. And without urgent relief, many airlines will not survive to lead the economic recovery.”Several airlines around the world are on the brink of collapse and many are urgently trying to secure government bailouts or emergency bank loans.Germany’s Lufthansa is reportedly considering filing for creditor protection, as negotiations over state bailouts collapsed on Tuesday night. The airline is said to be burning through €1m of cash every hour, and has warned it will have 10,000 too many staff when it emerges from the crisis as a much smaller operator.The budget airline Norwegian has warned that virtually all of its fleet of aircraft will remain grounded until 2021 and is seeking to persuade shareholders to accept a government-backed rescue plan that will wipe out most of their investments. Virgin Atlantic is trying to find an investor to pump in millions to keep it afloat as it negotiates with the government for a £500m emergency loan. Virgin Australia collapsed into administration last week.Easyjet has borrowed £600m from the government under its Covid Corporate Financing Facility, allowing it to survive another nine months at the present rate of cash burn.In a statement to the stock market, IAG said: “In light of the impact of Covid-19 on current operations and the expectation that the recovery of passenger demand to 2019 levels will take several years, British Airways is formally notifying its trade unions about a proposed restructuring and redundancy programme.“The proposals remain subject to consultation but it is likely that they will affect most of British Airways’ employees and may result in the redundancy of up to 12,000 of them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d8aa8f3f9509ebe5922ea86eb9f84144bd724ba/2_341_4713_2828/master/4713.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16618e44d77ee447620b6a8a72bb3f4b","title":"nandos joins burger king in reopening some branches for deliveries","story":"Wagamama also set to resume deliveries in some areas, with McDonald’s carrying out trialsNando’s has reopened six restaurants in London and Manchester for delivery orders, joining a growing band of fast-food companies seeking to ease back into business during lockdown.Burger King, which has already reopened six sites for delivery and takeaway, is opening eight more from Wednesday, including a drive-through.Restaurants and pubs were closed as part of the lockdown but are allowed to prepare food in their kitchens for collection or delivery, and many have been providing free meals to NHS staff and other key workers.After working with Deliveroo to serve more than 10,000 meals to charities and NHS workers from its kitchens, Nando’s has started offering home delivery from six outlets – four in London and two in Manchester – as part of a gradual reopening process.Burger King is reopening restaurants in Aberdeen, Dundee, Merton in south London, Reading, Southampton, and Hillington and Springfield Quay, both in Glasgow and aims to have at least one open in every city by 31 May. It is offering a limited menu and contactless delivery through Just Eat and Deliveroo.A drive-through Burger King in Hampshire is also reopening as a trial with a view to opening more such restaurants over the coming weeks.Katie Evans, the marketing director of Burger King UK, said: “We are so pleased to be able to open more restaurants across the UK this week, including our first restaurant for customer Drive Thru, which is a huge step forward.”KFC has reopened 11 restaurants with a limited menu for delivery only, in London, Hampshire, Birmingham, Glasgow, Sussex, Greater Manchester and Staffordshire.All the companies say their staff are wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) and practising physical distancing, and strict hygiene standards are being adhered to.Wagamama, the Restaurant Group-owned brand, has announced plans for a gradual return of its delivery operation. It says it has devised a schedule that will allow staff to slowly return to delivery-only work at their own discretion. The first sites to open will be Wagamama’s delivery kitchens in Peckham, Hackney, Bow and Leeds from Thursday.McDonald’s said it was carrying out operational tests behind closed doors this week in preparation for a limited reopening of some restaurants.Paul Pomroy, the chief executive of McDonald’s UK and Ireland, said reopening would happen only “when we are absolutely confident we can have the right measures in place to ensure everyone’s wellbeing”.McDonald’s shut seating areas in mid-March and closed all takeaway and drive-through services a week later. It has more than 1,270 restaurants in the UK and employs more than 120,000 people.Pomroy said: “Restarting our business is not an easy task even when reopening in a limited capacity.

Yet many of them have little faith in Phillips’ ability to discover the causesCovid-19 has left many Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities particularly vulnerable: in terms of their lives, and their livelihoods.And while some of these figures may be explained in part by the fact that among BAME communities a large number have felt a vocational calling to the caring professions, it doesn’t account for the massive disparity in fatalities. Is part of the reason medical, possibly related to higher blood pressure and diabetes rates among ethnic minorities? Just as important, is it partly due to socio-economic reasons, related to poverty and lack of access to healthcare? Whatever the causes, if we are to pay the right tribute to the thousands of people who will have lost their lives – particularly those on the frontline – then we must, in an honest and transparent way, better understand why this seems to be happening.An inquiry by Public Health England has already been set up to look into this. Though it is expected to be relatively short, it should in time be able to inform a more extensive Covid-19 public inquiry. And in addition to the fatalities and direct health impacts, researchers BMG have found that BAME groups have already suffered a greater financial hit than the broader white communities – and have been almost twice as likely to have lost income and jobs. Many fear that after this pandemic things could get even worse.The inquiry therefore should be bold enough to examine inequalities in health, employment, housing and poverty in general. There are a number of traps we should not fall into. First is the growing narrative that Covid-19 discriminates, but that our political, civic and business institutions don’t. We know, for example, that a large number of ethnic minorities work in care homes, where they are low paid and possibly on zero-hours contracts. Many are faced with an impossible decision: do I stay at home to protect myself and my family, and risk having no money to pay the rent or buy food or do I go to work, probably on public transport, where I have greater exposure to the virus and am least protected? Nor should we overplay cultural and genetic factors, and claim this explains the ethnic variance in death rates.But perhaps the biggest challenge for the review will be credibility. Public Health England has given Trevor Phillips and his company, Webber Phillips, a prominent role. Yet a growing number of BAME groups and iniduals are struggling to find the trust and confidence in him that is needed for this review to be taken seriously.Although Phillips is a former head of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, an open letter signed by 100 black British women states: “Trevor Phillips is now probably more famously known by many BAME community groups as having a recent history of discarding the very real issues and consequences of structural racism in the UK.”Another letter said to represent thousands of BAME iniduals in the medical profession has been sent to Public Health England. It states: “We express our concern that Mr Trevor Phillips has been asked to provide expert support to the review … A suitable candidate who would be trusted by healthcare professionals from a BAME background must be sought.”So Phillips and PHE will have a huge task in building the requisite trust for this review to be accepted by the people it is seeking to serve.Yet none of us should lose sight of what we could achieve with a better understanding of the devastating impact this disease is having on BAME communities. We could use this knowledge to reduce racial inequalities rather than entrench them further.Much has been made of the fact this is the greatest crisis Britain has faced since the second world war. Let’s not forget that perhaps the greatest thing that came in the conflict’s aftermath was the birth of our National Health Service. Just as Africans, Asians and Caribbeans helped Britain’s war effort, so they and their descendants played a key role in creating and expanding the health service.The fact that so many ethnic minorities have now tragically lost their lives to Covid-19, many of them while caring for others, should spur us to remodel our society – so it no longer leaves so many vulnerable people facing such intolerable situations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8278cec2ea7d6d4647c8e3a5b4d066197a8ec226/0_233_4928_2958/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc6aae0de97dfddf1582495a996fb755","title":"lockdown restrictions solidarity coronavirus social distancing","story":"We have internalised the reason for staying apart, and coronavirus will leave us wary. Habits of trust will have to be relearnedWatching old movies, it is easy to be shocked by all the gratuitous touching. By “old” I mean anything recorded before March 2020, when people were still squeezing past each other to get to the bar, exchanging grimy coins and passing drinks back with their dirty bare hands. Did we really throng like that?It is a measure of how well we have internalised the reason for staying apart that casual, pre-coronavirus intimacy looks so alien. When we cringe at an old photo of ourselves with bad hair or clothes (or both, in my case) it is because we apply the lens of new information to judge our naive former selves. And now a whole world of slack hygiene feels remote in that sepia-tinted way not just in time, but in values.The change is cultural, not political, and will not be undone by government decree. Even when some shops are allowed to trade or schools partially reopen, the duty to be distant will remain for as long as contagion is a risk. In the absence of a vaccine, that risk is open-ended. It will be a while before strangers shake hands again. Maybe the habit will be lost.This is not a superficial aspect of the Covid-19 crisis. Societies are shaped by custom and ritual as much as they are held together by legislation. There is no law against queue-barging, for example, but British people still have a keenly developed sense of justice around the issue.We must not underestimate the aggregate effect of curtailing millions upon millions of micro-niceties, even if we cannot predict what the impact will be. After the rules of lockdown are eased, the cordon sanitaire will remain in our minds. Each handshake or shared bag of chips is a little social contract – a declaration of affinity. And without physical proximity we have to work harder to negotiate those alliances.It isn’t hard to see how our species evolved this way. There is an obvious cost in admitting predators and enemies into our personal space, so we are hard-wired to associate social distance with suspicion. The same applies in the case of hygiene, where we have evolved what the psychologist Mark Schaller has called a “behavioural immune system”. At an inidual level that is the spasm of recoil from a foul smell. At a more complex level it informs antisocial human characteristics – wariness of all things unfamiliar, especially people from outside our immediate, trusted circle.Evolutionary biologists have observed a cross-cultural and historical correlation between the prevalence of infectious disease and authoritarian politics. The theory posits that “pathogen stress” leads to a more aggressive behavioural immune response, making societies less open, less tolerant and readier to sacrifice liberties for collective protection.That might sound like a wild extrapolation from two-metre gaps at the supermarket checkout. I don’t think lockdown will activate some dormant genetic predisposition to tyranny. The opposite response feels closer to the surface – our pent-up social energies one day exploding on to the streets in a licentious touchy-feely carnival.But that release might be further away than we hope. Meanwhile, it doesn’t take an evolutionary biologist to hypothesise that chronic insecurity ploughs fertile ground for toxic politics. That is a lesson from the rise of xenophobic nationalism across Europe and the Americas in the decade since the last financial crisis, amply corroborated by evidence from the first half of the 20th century.History is not destiny, so it is reasonable to presume that 21st century societies will find innovative ways to manifest the consequences of mass anxiety. For a start, we have the digital infrastructure that means a lot of life in lockdown has migrated online. That journey is keeping many of us in financial solvency and mental equilibrium, but with an insidious cost in social cohesion. Before coronavirus, people were already burrowing into digital silos, selecting the information that suited their prejudices or having that information selected for them by algorithms that interpreted prejudices from their search history.Social media is a brilliant centrifuge, separating us into discrete cultural channels, and an efficient engine for radicalisation, polarisation and paranoia within those channels. Shared attitudes are refined the grit of contradictory evidence is expelled moderates fall silent while members of the group bid each other up towards the most extreme iteration of any opinion.That is how people make a journey at astonishing speed from unfocused alienation to murderous militancy from vague mistrust of Westminster to deranged conspiracy theory. Politicians are as susceptible as everyone else, whipping each other into factional rages in their WhatsApp groups.In normal times, that process is slowed by friction from everyday brushes with analogue reality. We might not have seen fleeting conversations at football matches or on the bus as part of our social life, but each interaction with a stranger exercised muscles of empathy and diplomacy that are atrophying. We are now zooming deep into culturally reinforced comfort zones. It doesn’t have to be that way. The antidote to polarisation is solidarity and there is heaps of that around. The weekly ritual of doorstep applause for the NHS is rightly cherished as an expression of communal spirit to transcend isolation. Images of those moments will be displayed as icons of national togetherness for generations, like the photos of Londoners seeking shelter from the blitz  in tube stations, except there won’t be so many people jammed together in the frame.That is no minor difference. We know there is a vast reserve of solidarity available and that it could be a healing social balm after years of painful ision. But it is also a perishable commodity that degrades if left up on the shelf of abstract rhetoric. It needs to be applied in person and it is hard to bring people together without physically bringing people together.Economic redistribution is the traditional way to put solidarity into political practice, and there might be more public appetite for that than there has been for decades. But it isn’t guaranteed, nor is financial inequality the only gap that will need bridging. The politics of quarantine have focused on the sacrifices involved, on the requirement for discipline and the challenge of repressing our socialising urges. The presumption has been that the springs will uncoil as soon as the pressure is released, and the old ways will bounce back.But not if the virus has corroded the mechanism. Some habits of trust might have to be relearned. It might require effort on a political and inidual level to practice social un-distancing – to reach out of our digital boltholes. Repairing the damage done by this disease will be a project of cultural reconnection, not just economic redistribution. We will need new ways to feel joined for as long as we cannot take each other by the hand."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/181bcc8c224908485d98e13d806b5fd5bd5c06e4/0_0_3056_1849/master/3056.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aad3f85119aeb26a4a032b6f991284c4 700w","title":"international students are you stranded in uk due to coronavirus lockdown","story":"We’d like to hear from university students who have been unable to travel back to their home countriesWe’d like to hear from international students who are stranded in universities across the UK due to the coronavirus crisis.

It looks a bit odd, and a bit round.”Aerial photos of the ploughed field were unremarkable, but a Lidar image – a topographical scan using laser light – showed something that maybe, just maybe, appeared to be the ghostly image of a lost henge.A week or two later, having joined an online course run by the archaeology firm DigVentures – in part to help pass the time – Seddon uploaded his pictures to a discussion group, unsure if he had discovered a forgotten Neolithic monument, a former course of the river or a modern drainage ditch. The response from coursemates and professional archaeologists was as excited as he had hoped.While there is no way of knowing for sure without digging, says Lisa Westcott Wilkins, managing director of DigVentures, “we are very happy to say that this does indeed look like a ‘thing’”.Other known Neolithic sites nearby, the scale of the feature and the fact that historic field boundaries respect its course, all support the hypothesis, she says, that it could be a large henge – a significant find in this part of the country if so. “Of course, we are all just itching to get out there and investigate,” – just one more ambition put on hold by the current lockdown conditions.Seddon’s circular feature might be the most intriguing, but it is far from the only discovery shared by participants of the course. Developed several years ago to let students explore archaeology for the first time, or brush up on existing research, excavation and documentation skills, previous cohorts have seen about 80 participants at a time.But with almost all of this year’s excavations being shutdown because of the coronavirus crisis, the company decided to offer the course for free, and received an overwhelming response 4,000 people from 69 countries are currently learning how to read maps, draw up plans and record finds from their own laptops.It is far from the only online course to have seen a rush in interest since lockdown began, nor the only one focused on archaeology. The Council for British Archaeology and Lincoln University last week launched Dig School, an online programme of archaeology-themed workshops aimed at school children and families, devised by Carenza Lewis, professor for public engagement at the University of Lincoln and a former presenter of Time Team.But while remote learning can be a challenge in any subject, acquiring practical skills such as how to handle a trowel or dig a test pit might seem a particular challenge for participants who, in many cases, are confined to flats without gardens or limited to a brief daily spin of their neighbourhoods.Christine Green has had to temporarily close the craft shop she runs in Talgarth in the Brecon Beacons her daughter had upcoming surgery cancelled as the crisis began, “so this is a very worrying time for both of us”. Inspired by the DigVentures course, she has dug a trench a metre-deep in her back garden, in which she has found nothing more precious than a fork and a marble.“But a couple of days ago when sitting in my trench with my brush and my palette knife, I suddenly realised that I actually felt happy and unstressed – both feelings somewhat alien to me currently.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d465cec7da085d80eafdf6645f7c668104e81926/0_82_4288_2572/master/4288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=193011f08be87f6bbe5cc7439b55a72a","title":"shave it or save it the 11 big lockdown hair conundrums answered by experts","story":"Should you cut your own hair, cover up your roots or forgo shampoo for the coming months? And what about growing out your pubic hair? Here’s everything you need to know about home groomingGiven that we are housebound amid a global crisis, you may think that a short back and sides would be the last thing on anyone’s mind. But you would be wrong. Physical distancing has not stopped people around the world, from Phillip Schofield to Malala Yousafzai, reaching for the scissors – with varying degrees of success.Since the temptation to give yourself, or your loved ones and housemates, a quick cut appears matched only by the desire to bake banana bread, here are a few points to consider.Hairdressers advise regular appointments to keep your hair in good condition and your cuts looking fresh, so it is little wonder that so many of us are keen to keep this up. But most stylists have one word of advice: don’t.“I feel sorry for all the stylists who, after this, will be dealing with a lot of DIY disasters,” says Keri Daniel, the owner of Danique Hairdressing in Leicester. “If you really have to, then it’s worth investing in the right tools – even a professional would struggle to get a good result using the kitchen scissors. You can get cheap hairdressing scissors and cutting combs online – even razors – and they’ll give you a better finish.”With hairdressers and barbers closed, some people – Riz Ahmed and David Beckham among them – have opted to simply lop off the lot. It is quite the lockdown look, but it is not as simple as you might hope.“Think about what’s best for your household, because you have to live with these people,” warns Daniel. Like most professionals, hairdressers have a knack of making their job look easier than it is.“If you cut your own hair, you’ll need one mirror in front and one behind you,” says Stevens. “I’ve seen people using their phones, but it gets a bit tricky because you need to hold that, the comb, the scissors and the clippers. Get help if you can.”“The biggest challenge when cutting children’s hair is that they don’t like to sit still,” says Kelly V, the owner of Pixal-Rose Hair Design, a vegan salon in Swindon, who suggests keeping them occupied with a tablet or a book. For short hair, a simple cut with clippers is advised. For long hair, “brush the hair down, have the head tilted forward and cut the very, very ends off”, she says. “Don’t attempt anything too drastic.”This can be the biggest giveaway that you are overdue a trip to the salon, but there are better solutions than home-dyeing.“A zigzag parting can help disguise that regrowth line and, depending on the colour of your hair, mascara can be a great way to cover up greys,” says Stevens. “Or just have a bit of fun – we put a luminous green feather in one parting. It looked like Billie Eilish’s green roots.”Daniel suggests visiting your salon’s website to find out which products they used and investing in those. “You may be able to buy them through the salon, which can be a great way to support them while they are closed,” she adds. “Dyes that you might buy in the supermarket are not professional products, and it can make it a lot harder when it comes to colouring in the future.”“An inch of growth in afro hair doesn’t make as much difference,” says Stevens, whose salon specialises in afro hair. “It’s easier to disguise that it’s overdue a cut. Relaxed hair will have curly roots, but I would never recommend using a home relaxant – you will get snappage. You could go through it with straightening irons, but it would be very time-consuming. I would suggest just wearing your hair up.”Join the “no-poo” movement and break free from the shackles of commercial haircare! Well, it is one option – and the lockdown offers a chance to wait out the initial greasy period in relative privacy. Otherwise, shower gel can substitute for shampoo if you are desperate, according to Stevens, while mayonnaise, avocado or coconut oil can replace conditioner. “If you look at what branded products use in their ingredients, you can get an idea of the kitchen cupboard alternatives,” says Daniel. Of course, you are probably washing your hair far more than you need to anyway.“Realistically, you don’t need to wash your hair more than once a week, unless you are doing a sport or have a job in a kitchen,” says Daniel. For those of us who like to wash our hair daily, this may seem like a big ask. But she assures me it is possible. “On the third day, you could spritz it with some water and blow-dry again to give it a bit of lift. Stay away from the straighteners if you can. On the fourth day, you can start to wear your hair up. Dry shampoo and texture sprays can also give unwashed hair a little bit more life. You’re with your family and loved ones, staying home – it’s the best chance to give your hair a rest.”Removal of body hair – particularly pubic hair – is often best left to the professionals. While shaving your own legs may be straightforward, waxing your bikini line is another matter. So, is it time to go au naturel? “We’ve had lots of inquiries from clients who are midway through laser hair removal courses asking what they should do,” says Dr Chloë Butler, the founder of the Chloë Edit clinic in Worcestershire. “We advise not attempting DIY waxing, as it can be quite tricky unless you have the right equipment and patience.” While trimming or shaving pubic hair may seem straightforward, Butler believes some people would be better off leaving well alone. You may even discover you prefer your new look.“Make the right choice based on the type of skin and hair you have, not on whatever style is ‘trending’,” says Butler. “If you have a thicker hair follicle, you may be more prone to ingrown hairs or a shaving rash. If you’ve got oily skin, you may get blocked pores and irritation. Dry skin tends to be thinner and more likely to tear.” Ouch.Rather than shaving your head, Stevens suggests men try growing their hair long or cultivating a beard. If you are tempted by a complete restyle, he suggests ordering a wig online: “Walk around the house and see how you feel. What kind of reaction do you get when you’re FaceTiming friends and family?”Daniel believes that, aside from the buzzcut, other hair trends are likely to emerge after the lockdown. “It’s exciting from a hairdressing point of view. People who wanted to grow out their grey hair, or go from being very blond to a more natural colour, have an opportunity to do that.”“Ultimately, chill out,” says Stevens. “Embrace your new hair and, if you’re really that bothered, put a hat or a scarf on.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e02834a48bf272110f6e7db45a9b3eff5f582a48/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03060aa59b8db650656975f3523f09a4","title":"tell us about your ultimate holiday food recipe","story":"We want to know the recipe you use to recreate the experience of food, freedom and funWith holidays on hold for the foreseeable and cooking a rare lockdown joy, your culinary repertoire can be easily expanded by recalling dishes that bring back memories of happier times on trips away.

If you have a vegetable garden, fruit trees or an allotment, it is the age-old way of making the summer glut and autumn harvest last through the winter dearth when there is nothing to grow or pick. Even with year-round fresh produce in the shops, a gleaming row of gem-hued jars filled to the brim with crunch and spice can brighten up the most lacklustre meal.The idea of making your own kimchi or bottling a batch of chutney might scare you off. But all you need is a few key ingredients and some patience. Here are a few ideas to get you started.Knowing what is in season wherever you are in the world is key. In the UK now, you will find the last of last year’s apples and pears, but cauliflower and cabbage are going strong and a soft-fruit glut is just around the corner. Come springtime in the US, meanwhile, Serious Eats’ Preserved column suggests rhubarb-strawberry jam and tomato jam, among others.It sounds obvious, but be sure to go for something you like the taste of, and in quantities you can reasonably get through. I say this from experience: there is no point in filling a two-litre Kilner jar with pickled, skin-on kiwis if you are the only one who is going to eat them. Use small jars. Use flavours you enjoy. The point is not to waste anything.As Toni Kostian of Grön restaurant in Helsinki puts it: “Preserving is about having only the right kind of bacteria in your produce and getting rid of any harmful ones.” Pickles, jams and ferments can be safely done at home with basic cooking equipment.Be sure to clean hands, surfaces, utensils and produce thoroughly. Wash all jars, bottles and lids in warm soapy water, and rinse thoroughly. They need to be hot, dry and sterile when you fill them. So, for preserves you intend to use up quickly, place your jars in a 140C (120C fan)285Fgas mark 1 oven for 20 minutes, timing it so that they are ready when your product is. And top whatever you are storing with a circle of wax paper before sealing.For anything you intend to keep a long time in a store cupboard, use proper canning jars (which close with lids and rings) and, ideally, the boiling water-bath processing technique. This is more than any novice needs to attempt on their first go – but if you want to learn how, check out Marisa McClellan’s tutorials on foodinjars. Quick – or refrigerator – pickles are what the food writer Rachel Roddy calls entry-level pleasers. She uses a simple pickling brine: 550ml white wine vinegar, 200ml water and a heaped tablespoon each of fine salt and sugar (plus the aromatic of your choosing: chilli, garlic, bay, dill …) for 1kg of chopped-up garden fare (carrot, turnip, red cabbage, beetroot, fennel, red onion). Bring the brine to a boil, add the veg for one minute, then ide among the jars (into which you have spooned one tablespoon of olive oil), cover with the liquid and spices and seal. The pickles can be eaten within 24 hours, and will last for two months in the fridge.Rice wine vinegar makes gentler quickies, although the lower acidity means they have a shorter life. You can go very sweet (Kylee Newton’s Japanese brine adds 380g of sugar to 450ml rice wine vinegar and 450ml water, with only ¼ teaspoon of sea salt and a few peppercorns) or not sweet at all (Anna Thomson infuses her brine – 350ml rice or white wine vinegar, 800ml water, 4½ teaspoon salt – with lemongrass, garlic, fresh ginger and red chillies.)Another great thing to have in the fridge is mixed spiced pickles – half salad, half condiment – such as Malaysian penang acar. The veg here requires a bit more preparation. Huangkitchen’s Angie Liew says to mix 200g each of chopped-up cabbage, carrots, green beans and pineapple with 500g cucumber (skinned, soft centre removed, and sliced) with 1 tbsp salt, and leave it for 30 minutes. Squeeze out the liquid then blanch in boiling water and vinegar, before draining and leaving to dry out for an hour. Meanwhile, grind together a mix of 10 fresh and 5 dried chillies (soaked in water until soft), 10 shallots, 5 garlic cloves, 2cm each of turmeric and galangal root (I would substitute these last two with a 4cm piece of ginger if I couldn’t find any), 20g each of coriander seeds and shrimp paste, and a few candlenuts (or use macadamia nuts or cashews instead). Fry this spice paste in oil until fragrant, then stir in 200ml vinegar, 180g sugar and 1 tsp salt, followed by 100g ground peanuts, the vegetables and lastly 100g toasted sesame seeds, mixing well after each addition. Store for at least 24 hours before serving, and up to 2 weeks in the fridge.There are the more pungent varieties that take time to mature. Some version of cucumber pickle is found in most countries, but everything from green beans to new peas work too. For Iranian torshi bademjan, aubergine is first parboiled in equal parts vinegar and water, then squeezed, sliced down the middle and stuffed with garlic cloves, dried mint and a little salt. Pack tightly into a jar small enough that the pickling liquid (125ml fresh cider vinegar to 1 tbsp boiled and cooled water) covers the veg. Seal and store them in a cool dark place for at least a month and keep in the fridge once opened.Fruit, too, loves to be pickled. Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall bottles cherries – stones, stalks and all – in a hot syrup (200ml water, 300ml white-wine or cider vinegar, 250g caster sugar, 6 black peppercorns, 3 bay leaves, 2 juniper berries, and 2 cloves) and leaves for a month before using. Nigel Slater uses a similar syrup for stone fruit, but cautions that since no amount of vinegar will soften hard fruit, it’s best that peaches be first stoned and parboiled, then skinned with apricots, he leaves the skin on. Conversely, these pickles are ready within three days. Which is to say: follow recipes carefully. Don’t skip any steps and stick to all specified timings. For Kostian, lactic fermentation not only comes with reputed (though unproved) health benefits but flavour-wise is the most interesting place to start. He recommends gooseberries, though any other fruit will do. For quick ferments, your jars don’t need to be sterilised, but they do need to be squeaky clean. And you need to use good filtered water (no chlorine) and good sea salt (no caking agents).Mix 1kg of fresh berries with 30g of salt in a large lidded glass jar, and lay clingfilm over the top of the produce, pressing it down with a small weight. Then put the lid on, loosely. Leave at room temperature (18-22C) for 15 to 30 days. Taste after 15 days, and decide if you want to take the funky flavour further.Yeast or moulds can grow on the surface if whatever you’re fermenting comes into contact with the air, or if your kitchen is too hot. Trust your senses. If anything smells off-putting, start again. If not, remove the top layer and carry on. The food writer Regula Ysewijn recently found two jars of sourdough starter – essentially, fermented dough – in a box in her cellar, where they’d sat, forgotten, since she moved house two years ago. One smelled rank, and she binned it. The other smelled sweet, like traditional dark rye bread, so she fed it till it bubbled and is now baking with it.For something quicker, try the two-day carrot and cabbage ferment from Danish artist Olafur Eliasson’s studio kitchen in Berlin: mix 2 grated carrots and a small shredded cabbage with 1 tbsp salt and place in a large glass jar with a lid. Leave in the fridge for a couple of days, or longer, for a stronger flavour.Of course, the more time you have to make your preserves the better. For a proper sauerkraut, massage 1 tbsp salt into 1kg shredded cabbage until it releases its juices then pack tightly into a jar, pressing down until the liquid rises above the surface (add a little filtered water if needed). Seal and leave at room temperature for at least four days, until bubbles appear. The chef Tom Hunt says that at this point, you can continue fermenting at room temperature for months or even years. Putting it in the fridge will slow down the process, and temper the flavour. Online you’ll find recipes for kraut variations using celeriac, apple, and grated root veg.Kimchi is another wildly adaptable cabbage-based ferment. Koreanbapsang’s Hyosun Ro has over 20 different recipes, from easy to vegan to trad. Food52, meanwhile, has an excellent how-to for making any kind of kimchi without a recipe. It is a world unto its own, so do read up. Olia Hercules makes fizzy tomatoes by placing 500g medium-sized fruit in a large sterilised preserving jar and covering with a cooled brine (1 litre water, 7 tsp salt, 5 tsp sugar), along with some allspice berries, black peppercorns, 2 heads of dill, 1 bay leaf and 4 chopped up celery sticks. She leaves the sealed jar in a warm place in her kitchen (25C) for one week, then transfers it to the refrigerator or a cellar, where it can be kept unopened for months.Lastly, for something quite thrillingly slow, make Clare Lattin’s lime pickle. Mix the wedges of 2-3 limes (250g) with 1 tbsp salt and 1 tsp sugar. Pack into a sterilised lidded jar and leave to ferment for four weeks (put a note in your diary). When ready, heat 4 tbsp mustard oil in a pan, and fry the spices (1 tbsp turmeric, 3 tsp cayenne, 3 tsp mustard seeds and 1 tsp fenugreek seeds) until the seeds start to pop. Add the limes with all their juice, along with 1 tbsp cider vinegar, and cook for five minutes. Leave to cool, then pack back into the jar and store for another week, so the flavours can combine. No citrus has ever been this rewarding.Newton likes how you can use anything a bit overripe in a chutney (just remove brown or bruised bits). Her apple and ale medley is a good place to start. Put 900g diced onions, 600ml cider vinegar and 400g granulated sugar in a large, wide-rimmed pot and bring to the boil, then simmer for 15 minutes, until reduced by one third. Mix in 1.5kg apples (peeled, cored and diced) and the zest of 2 lemons. Fill a little muslin bag with 1 cinnamon stick, 1 star anise, 1 tsp chilli flakes, 1 tsp peppercorns and 1 bay leaf, tie with a string, and add to the pot. Bring to the boil and simmer, stirring occasionally (cover the surface with a pierced round of parchment paper) for 20 minutes. When thickened, stir through 2 tsp salt and 300ml ale and simmer for five more minutes. Fill warmed sterilised jars to 5mm from the rim, seal, label, date and store in the cupboard for up to 12 months. Once open, keep in the fridge for up to three months.Sweet preserves range from creamy curds (lemon, but also blackberry, raspberry, gooseberry, orange and blueberry) to jellies and whole fruit recipes. You name the fruit, sugar will do wonders with it. The Irish chef and founder of Ballymaloe Cookery School Darina Allen points to raspberry jam as a good starting point. To win over panicked students, she sometimes makes some scones, then gets to work on the jam. “By the time the scones are out of the oven,” she writes, “the jam is made. It’s that easy!”Mash 900g fresh or frozen berries in a wide, stainless-steel saucepan and cook for three to four minutes over a medium heat until the juice begins to run. Add 900g warmed sugar and stir over a gentle heat until dissolved. Bring to the boil and cook for about five to six minutes, stirring frequently. Test for set by putting about a teaspoonful on a cold plate and leaving it for a few minutes in the fridge. If it wrinkles when you press it, it is set. Remove from the heat immediately. Skim, pour into sterilised jam jars and cover immediately.Infusions and aromatics will embellish the basic idea, from Nigel Slater’s plum with almonds and rosewater to Lillie O’Brien’s fig and earl grey tea. And roasting your fruit – as Anna Jones does plums – will enhance its built-in sweetness. Some fruit – grapes, say – are sweet enough to need no added sugar. Of course, the sugar being the preservative, the less you use, the shorter the life of your product.Chia seeds, meanwhile, make a cheat’s instant jam, which lasts about two weeks. Simply stew some fruit, then mix in a sweetener, some lemon juice and the chia seeds, and leave for five to 10 minutes to thicken.As the  writer Phil Daoust put it, if all of this sounds like hard work, make yourself a drink. “A few handfuls of raspberries or blackberries will transform the cheapest vodka,” but the same goes for oranges and rum or sloes and gin. Place 500g fruit in a large jar, and cover with 250g sugar and a litre of alcohol. Seal, shake (continue shaking every day until the sugar is dissolved) and place in a dark cupboard for three months. Strain out the fruit, then bottle and store for at least a year. The longer the better."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fbbe28bf9979f11b19bb8139bfc392342ecef20/0_1792_5151_3089/master/5151.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=049e260c85775f6fd64e00ad28f0db13","title":"nigel slater recipe for tortellini with spinach sauce","story":"Plump stuffed pasta pieces with a herby, creamy green sauceBring 500ml of milk to the boil in a saucepan, add 2 bay leaves and 6 lightly crushed black peppercorns.

The charter prohibits a club from being controlled by an inidual who has engaged in conduct that would be “an offence” if it had occurred in the UK.Cengiz’s lawyer, Rodney Dixon QC, said: “The proposed acquisition is not just ‘business’ for the crown prince and the Saudi authorities, but an attempt to evade justice and international scrutiny for an unconscionable act. It would emasculate the Premier League’s core principles and rules, and ruin its good reputation and character, to allow the crown prince and the Saudi authorities to use this acquisition to seek to repair their international standing.”The Premier League declined a request for comment.Khashoggi, a US-based journalist for the Washington Post, was murdered inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October 2018. Khashoggi had entered the consulate to retrieve documents he needed to marry Cengiz, who has emerged as a strong voice in support of justice after his murder.An investigation by Agnès Callamard, the UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial killings, found that Saudi Arabia was responsible under human rights law for the murder of Khashoggi and that it was “inconceivable” the operation that resulted in his death could not have been implemented without the crown prince being aware a criminal mission was being launched against the journalist.In the letter to the Premier League chief executive, Richard Masters, Dixon said there were “no limits” to the exploits of Bin Salman and his government. He cited a  report that revealed UK authorities had been warned by intelligence agencies that Saudi Arabia planned to target and surveil Cengiz in London months after the murder of Khashoggi.“I trust the Premier League and British authorities value their own principles and reputation above this transparent attempt at sports-washing,” she added.The British government has indicated it would not intervene in the controversial deal and, when asked about the matter recently, emphasised the UK’s close relationship with the kingdom.Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, was questioned on the issue by the SNP MP John Nicolson during a meeting of the digital, culture, media and sport committee and said it was a “matter for the Premier League” rather than Downing Street.Amnesty International has warned the Premier League it “risks becoming a patsy” if it does not consider Saudi Arabia’s human rights record before approving the takeover.Do you have a tip on this story?

All players would be rigorously tested before and after every match, with restrictions on the number of people present.PSG’s president, Nasser al-Khelaifi, told the radio station RMC: “We respect of course the French government decision. In agreement with Uefa we intend to participate in the final rounds of this season’s Champions League at the time and place at which it will be organised. If it is not possible to play in France, we will play our matches abroad with the assurance that we will place our players and all our staff in the best possible health conditions.”Uefa is not expected to announce before the end of May its plans to complete the Champions League or Europa League. Last week it backtracked on proposals to ban clubs from European competition if they cancel their seasons and said leagues must decide how to determine final placings “based on sporting merit”.The seasons in Belgium and the Netherlands have ended, although whereas Club Brugge were crowned champions, the Ereisie leaders Ajax saw their hopes of another title dashed by their governing body’s decision to void the 2019-20 campaign aside from determining which teams proceed to next season’s European competitions.Domestic leagues in Europe have a deadline of 25 May to inform Uefa of their intentions, with an executive committee meeting two days later likely to determine the fate of the Champions League and Europa League. At the start of April the Uefa president, Aleksander Ceferin, said it would be a “better option” to conclude this season’s competitions behind closed doors than scrap them, although he admitted they could be abandoned if coronavirus restrictions remain into September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec011a1b029baa2ca1e4d9a9bca2586cfc28adef/0_808_2325_1395/master/2325.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7ce0a54d145f831585fa0c4c3e8d9d0","title":"drake 400000 mattress","story":"The Canadian rapper clearly knows the value of a good night’s sleep if his handmade Swedish mattress is anything to go byLast week, Drake made headlines when a tour of his luxury apartment revealed that the guy is sleeping on a fortune – literally. His mattress costs $400k.The mattress, made by the Swedish company Hästens, reportedly already has a waiting list in New York and Los Angeles. Only about a dozen of them were made in the first run, with each mattress being completely handmade, taking 600 hours to make.Six hundred hours is about a month’s worth of work for the mattress building team (total population: four), so let’s not pretend the mattress is reasonable. But it’s not the most ridiculously priced object in Drake’s house either: his chandelier is made of 20,000 pieces of Swarovski crystal.In fact, in the celeb universe, sitting alongside Jennifer Lopez’s $1,200 weekly placenta facial habits, Rihanna’s $25,000 weekly expense on her hair, and the $3.4mr car that Drake owns, the mattress almost seems thrifty.Most of us will never be able to spend that sum on a home. But it is nonetheless nice to read about the different culture towards sleep surrounding the mattress. According to an interview with Hästens’ Los Angeles store manager, Linus Adolfsson, in Vice, the Swedes set a lot of store by a good night’s sleep. Adolfsson describes it as a form of self-care (of course he does) while making a pretty good argument for why your mattress should cost more than the family car:“Your mattress should be the most important piece of furniture in your home. In Sweden, if your couch costs more than your mattress, people won’t understand. We have a completely different attitude to sleeping,” Adolfsson told Vice.In reality, this is probably just really good PR spiel: the Swedes also came up with the word “lagom” meaning “just the right amount”, which certainly cannot be applied to that kind of price tag (don’t worry, a “classic” Hästens mattress only costs $190,000)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a648e676bdc22b374f93acf341d3c2674fccf58/0_1_5354_3211/master/5354.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a341f46d35a33d67f3e6d306895bc80","title":"i see lockdown as a chance for more bdsm but my girlfriend doesnt","story":"We’re working from home, and I was hoping that would lead to more sex.

However, in recent months, I feel her desire has dwindled. I’m a very sexual person I fantasise about her on a regular basis and want to try new things. My worry is that she doesn’t feel as sexually driven as me. We’re working from home due to coronavirus, and for me that’s great in my head, we have all the time in the world to have sex. But she seems uninterested. We do still have sex every now and then, but I worry that we’re worlds apart when it comes to desire.Don’t judge your sex life according to how you are experiencing it during this difficult time. Many of the current realities are causing temporary sexual changes in people, such as lowered desire or even a total absence of it. The fear and the many losses everyone is dealing with – such as loss of freedom, loss of social life, loss of safety, loss of privacy, loss of jobs and even loss of loved ones – contribute to anxiety, depression and other psychological issues that in turn negatively affect your sexual response cycle. In addition, working at home has affected you and your girlfriend in different ways while you see it as offering sexual opportunities, she sees it as an unwelcome distraction from completing her work. Don’t take it personally, and don’t catastrophise. Simply recognise that this is a time to listen more acutely to each other’s evolving needs, to be patient and understanding and work as partners to adapt to the new lifestyle.

I’ve been shocked at what I’ve seen on social media,” he said.More recently, he hit back on social media at critics of the GMB’s response to the leaked Labour report, which reproduced dozens of lurid private WhatsApp messages from staff hostile to Corbyn.The GMB branch had called for Labour to protect those named in the report.

The sort of doctor who would always be willing to go that extra mile with home visits. “Don’t you worry. You’ll soon be better. Just take the medicine and you won’t feel a thing.”Gove was in the Commons to give what came billed as an “urgent statement on public services during the coronavirus”. Only he managed to deliver it without betraying the slightest sense of urgency, even when calling it the biggest crisis since the war. Apart from the 25,000 or so – he couldn’t give a precise number as the Office for National Statistics is always playing catch-up – who had died, the UK was basically in tip-top health. Yes, things were a bit challenging, but he’d basically just like to thank everyone from NHS staff to pharmacists, social workers and lorry drivers for doing their bit.“We haven’t got everything right,” he conceded as an afterthought – a bit of humility never goes amiss – but by and large he couldn’t think of a thing he would have done differently. Lockdown and social distancing had been implemented at exactly the right time, food supply chains were all fully operational, thousands of tests had been carried out and children were learning far more from the government’s online education resources than they ever had in school. He stopped short of saying greenhouse gas emissions and shoplifting were down, but then – for all his faults – he’s not as stupid as Priti Patel. But then no cabinet minister is.In her first appearance back on the Labour frontbench for the best part of five years, Rachel Reeves was both constructive and measured in her reply. She was less interested in Gove’s palliative care homilies and more concerned about what could be done to improve the situation. What was the plan – if indeed there was one – for ending lockdown? What was the government doing about domestic abuse and the protection of vulnerable children? Why were so many doctors being forced to re-use single-use personal protective equipment? And why had the government double-counted so many items in its list of PPE already distributed?The ending of lockdown is still apparently covered by the Official Secrets Act, meaning we may find out about in 30 years’ time, but Gove was at his most Uriah Heep in his other answers. Nobody cared more about vulnerable children than he did and it was desperately unfair for Reeves to have accused the government of double-counting PPE by listing each rubber glove inidually. After all, strictly speaking, each finger and thumb could have been counted separately, in which case more than five billion pieces of PPE had so far been distributed. So if anything he had underestimated his government’s achievements.Pete Wishart, the SNP’s frontbench spokesperson, was unconvinced. It was clear from the previous night’s BBC Panorama documentary that the government had failed to stockpile the right levels of PPE so why couldn’t Gove just come out and admit it? Mikey’s ears pricked up at the suggestion of any admission of wrongdoing. He’s been in politics long enough not to implicate himself in anything that might have legal liability when a public inquiry is an inevitability.The government had always stockpiled exactly the amount of PPE the scientists had recommended, Gove said, citing a hitherto unknown advisory group. It didn’t exactly tally with anything we had heard about Exercise Cygnus, the 2016 pandemic plan, but maybe this new scientific panel is the only one on which Dominic Cummings isn’t thought to have sat in the past few years. It’s not hard to see that it’s the scientists that are being lined up for the show trial when the dust finally settles.The rest of the questions were batted away with Gove’s customarily urbane bedside manner. A veneer of civility masking condescension and contempt. Even towards his fellow Tory backbenchers, who are now beginning to have their doubts over the government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic.Sitting in front of the country’s largest Union Jack, Desmond Swayne wondered why the scheme to attract more British fruit and veg pickers – last year’s every Brexiter’s wet dream – had barely managed to attract more than 100 takers. Gove wittered on about having once dug up a potato as a teenager. Far better than the real reason that no Brits are prepared to work 12-hour days for minimum wage while being put up in caravans on site. Where are the Romanians when you need them?The one question he answered directly was Tory Mark Harper’s on the discrepancy between the capacity for testing and the number of tests administered. Anything to throw Matt Hancock under a bus. Poor Tigger is everyone’s favourite fall guy now. Of course the important figure was the number of tests taken. He had no idea if the government would meet its 100,000 target a day by the end of the month Maybe it would, maybe it wouldn’t. But as this wasn’t a commitment he personally had made he wouldn’t be taking the rap for it.A few hours later, Hancock appeared in person at the 5pm Downing Street press conference where he basically said the same thing he has said for the last week. The media needed to stop concentrating on the number of deaths and start being a bit more positive about what had been done. The fact that the UK now topped the European mortality charts was just a statistical outlier. Something of which we could even be proud. We were a nation of winners.The government was doing a great job – with no thanks to the Govester – and he was determined not just to meet his testing target but to expand it. Hell, if necessary he could always ramp the figures up by testing the same people five times in as many minutes. And no, he wasn’t going to apologise for anything. Why should he? If he was going down, he would be making sure to take as many of his colleagues with him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/502c90396bcee4d31f25b3cec960b99e6705fc95/0_0_6948_4169/master/6948.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7905643344312dab4c8260ebafd7c989","title":"back to the future why are we opting for nostalgic pop culture","story":"From rewatching 1990s TV shows to replaying classic computer games, taking the safe option when it comes to entertainment can help audiences rediscover themselvesNever before has civilisation produced so much new pop culture. From the plethora of TV shows on competing streaming platforms to the seemingly infinite choice offered by online music and gaming services, the wealth of new material being released each month is staggering. Yet when it comes to cultural consumption, audiences are increasingly choosing to seek out classic, safe bets – forgoing the next big thing in favour of the last big thing.According to UK media watchdog Ofcom, the single most-watched programme in the first quarter of 2019 was the 1990s sitcom Friends. In the US, the top Netflix spot has long been held by the US version of the Office, which first aired 15 years ago. Meanwhile at the box office, sequels and reboots abound. Last year’s top five grossing films in the UK included the remake of the Lion King, Toy Story 4, Frozen 2 and Star Wars: Episode IX – the Rise of Skywalker.Even computer gaming is stepping increasingly back into the past. Two of the biggest launches in recent years have actually been mini versions of the comparatively ancient 80s and 90s games consoles, Sega’s Mega Drive and Nintendo’s SNESNES. “Without a doubt, people are going back to the classics,” says Iain Simons, director of the National Videogame Museum in Sheffield. “They pioneered so many of the things we have today.”One obvious reason why audiences are opting for classic, safe bets is the sense of comfort they can provide in a world that feels increasingly precarious. This feeling of comfort isn’t simply a function of nostalgic familiarity, however. Today’s new TV shows often reflect our current dystopian mood and the fashion for grisly narrative plot twists and traumatic backstories. Think Black Mirror compared with Frasier.There are other reasons for playing it safe when it comes to pop culture. Partly, it can be about taking joy in simplicity amid the complexity of the world we live in. Our frantic pace of life makes spare time so rare that people are wary of not enjoying the little they have of it. “I can see the appeal in a safe bet, especially if you are going to spend a lot of money on tickets,” says Anna Smith, film critic, broadcaster and host of the all-female film review podcast Girls on Film.Likewise, Simons notes that there’s a beauty in the relative simplicity of older video games: “There’s something comforting about only having three lives in a game there are only so many hours in the day.”Nostalgic cultural consumption can also remove the all-too common problem of too much choice. “The overabundance of content can make people feel overwhelmed,” says Cristel Russell, a professor of marketing at Graziadio Business School, who has conducted several studies into people’s re-reading of stories and reconsumption of media. “It’s like going to a restaurant and the menu being 20 pages long. You’re probably just going to order something you’ve had before.”One of Russell’s studies found that revisiting cultural favourites is such a deliberate act – as opposed to a habit – that she coined the term “volitional reconsumption” to describe it. She also found that nostalgic culture can offer something that new works can’t: a form of self-discovery. “The thing you’re watching hasn’t changed, but you have,” explains Russell. “You’ve accumulated all this knowledge and experience, so you’re not looking at it through the same eyes. When you revisit it, you get to see how much you have changed as a person.”Revisiting pieces of classic cultural entertainment can also give us bonding social experiences. For instance, events such as Secret Cinema, which screens old favourites in specially-created immersive worlds, thrive on the feeling of community and belonging you get when you bring fans of a movie together to celebrate it. “I think one of the keys here is the community aspect: we love to watch a cherished film with others, and laugh and cry together,” says Smith. “In a society that feels increasingly less community driven, in many ways this is an outlet for a positive shared experience.”There are other possible psychological benefits to reconsuming cultural works. Erica Hepper, a lecturer in personality and social psychology at the University of Surrey, has researched the social emotion of nostalgia, including the reconsumption of works of art. One study involved letting participants choose an old, beloved song to listen to and then comparing their emotions with those of people who hadn’t done so. “Time and again, we found that people who listened to something that was nostalgic experienced all of these psychological boosts – they feel more connected to people, they feel better about themselves, they feel more optimistic,” says Hepper. “They also feel more motivated to achieve their goals. So nostalgia isn’t about being stuck in the past, it actually looks to the future.”Indeed, one of Russell’s studies showed that reconsuming cultural works can even involve more intense cognitive processes than watching something for the first time. To test this, subjects were made to wear eye-tracking equipment while watching a black-and-white Russian film twice. The equipment monitored both the movement of their eyes and pupil dilation, which can indicate the intensity of the cognitive effort they were undergoing. “Sure enough, on the second viewing, your eye gaze goes to different parts of the screen – you are taking it in in a different way,” says Russell.She found that people were watching in a way that suggested they appreciated the film much more as a work of art on the second viewing. For instance, they were looking at all the creative details rather than just following the plot. Moreover, she found that people’s pupils were more dilated while doing so. “When you rewatch something, the cognitive effort involved changes. You are hyper-responsive – all of your senses are on. It is a much more intense process than watching something for the first time.”That intensity might seem counterintuitive, given how comforting nostalgic pop culture can feel. But as the trend itself illustrates, opting for comforting pop culture isn’t a passive act. Given the emotional and psychological upsides of the tried and tested, it’s no wonder we enjoy watching things again. And again. And again.Safety mattersYour world matters to us.

Alexi Duggins explains why playing it safe is a smarter step Has there ever been a more underrated word in the English language than “safe”? For something that is fundamentally a good thing, people can be weirdly dismissive about it. Eyes are rolled at workplace health and safety as though it’s somehow uncool to not lose a hand to poorly maintained machinery. Romcoms lazily wield it as an unflattering cliche: “Oh, I don’t know. My award-winning humanitarian of a partner is perfect in every conceivable way – but they’re just so … safe, you know?”Meanwhile, there’s no bigger cliche than being edgy just for the sake of trend-chasing. Over the past two decades, the fad for extreme sports has reached (and plummeted from) ever-crazier heights. Our fetishisation of high-risk, high-wire living has even spread to dining, with foodies flocking to increasingly ridiculous eateries simply because they look cool on social media. How many times have our friends told us they tried out a Hot New Place that wasn’t actually very good – while we pity their gullibility and coo soothing words such as: “Oh what a shame that insect-based menu wasn’t actually that delicious.”Spurred on by the peer pressure of social media and clickbait articles about patently daft new trends, people all too often act as if they’re playing a gigantic game of chicken. When they aren’t posting smiling holiday selfies from the post-nuclear wreckage of Chernobyl, they’re braving the latest Insta grooming trends that you just have to try – even if they leave you looking like you’ve had your eyebrows rubber stamped on to your face.The 21st century seems so unhinged, it feels as though it’s drastically in need of a friend to confiscate its phone and force-feed it a sensible mug of Horlicks. So as we enter a new decade, it’s time to wake up to the obvious truth that sometimes playing it safe might be the smarter option. Sure, it won’t necessarily make for great social media content or keep trend forecasters in business, but the tried and tested route at least offers proven enjoyment.But there are things out there that are just unfailingly brilliant – melted cheese, beaten-track holidays, every Bill Murray film ever made. These are just some of the reasons that “safe” should be something we embrace. Another is the obvious fact that safety keeps you, well, safe. Just consider all the revolutionary advances in car safety technology.The safe option is one that doesn’t lead to you royally screwing up. It’s a guaranteed good time. It’s not being afraid to use your critical faculties, shun desperate fads and to do something that you genuinely know to be great. It’s suiting yourself, no matter the pressure to do the same stuff that everyone else is talking about.It isn’t always easy. But increasingly, playing it safe is the boldest thing you can do.We’re under so much pressure to be edgy these days that we often overlook safer, more rewarding options. Here are some user-friendly safety tips to help you navigate modern lifeBinge-watching TVWe might be living through an extended golden age of television, but the explosion in edgy programming has also given us an awful lot of duds. So it can be all too easy to make a habit out of wasting 12 hours of your life. Protect yourself from another bad long-term relationship with a TV show by learning when to quit. Studios like to make a big splash on their opening, so if the first episode sucks, it isn’t going to get better from there on in. But what happens when you’re, say, four episodes in? One way to develop the discipline to quickly give up is to think of your time as an economic investment. Just because you’ve invested four hours, it makes no sense to invest more if there’s no likely payoff. Economists call this the “sunk cost fallacy”. Instead, focus on the future time you’ll gain rather than on the time you’ve already sunk.The beaten trackIt’s easy to have that once-in-a-lifetime holiday: go somewhere you’ll never, ever want to visit again. Plenty of people willingly do this in the name of adventure or to prove their alpha credentials. But there is much to be said for the relaxing and restorative joy of the safe, well-trodden path – such as comfortable beds, rainproof roofs and nice food. The trick to taking your first step back to the beaten track is to refrain from judging other people for choosing the tourist trail and package holidays – then hopefully you’ll stop judging yourself.Foodie warningSocial media and TV cookery shows have conspired to make food even more of a feast for our eyes than our taste buds. But trying to assess food’s deliciousness with your eyes is like trying to appreciate music with your mouth. It’s important to take food-based Instagram posts with a pinch of (figurative) salt, as some restaurants try to capitalise on these trends by creating dishes based around how they’ll look on social media. Avoid regrets by engaging in real conversation: if you see friends posting about having eaten somewhere that looks great, get in touch to check they actually rated the taste of the meal. Just because someone shares a pretty photo, it doesn’t make it a food recommendation.Before you startup, stopThe digital revolution has fuelled such a fixation with startups that it almost feels de rigueur to quit your job and start your own venture. Alternatively, you might be tempted to devote yourself full-time to your side hustle. Before you consider whether or not to take the plunge, one question you should ask yourself is whether the thing that you’re really fetishising is the idea of being a risk-taker rather than the venture itself. So be sure to scrutinise your real motivations. For instance, are you following your passion or your ego? And bear in mind that sometimes our egos are actually fuelled by feelings of insecurity.Savvy tech is safe techEach month brings a cacophony of new digital bells and whistles and it can be easy to simply dismiss them. So how do you sift useful tech from pointless tech? One tip is to ask whether or not the new app, gadget or feature will save you time, give you pleasure or make you safer. The latter question often gets overlooked. But when it comes to developments such as smart homes and in-car technology – including driver monitoring and assistance systems – making things safer is actually the main point.Safety mattersYour world matters to us.

And these devices are already proving their worthWho hasn’t found their attention straying behind the wheel? Modern life is riddled with distractions that fight tooth and nail for our attention – whether it’s noisy children, garish adverts, tiredness, traffic cameras, personal pressures, endless to-do lists or those digital devices and social media notifications that we forgot to switch to silent. We always seem to be spreading our attention too thinly or are exhausted from having to think 10 different thoughts.This is one reason why the focus of vehicle safety design has shifted in recent years. Whereas in the past it was about applying materials and design to mitigate damage to occupants in crashes, it’s now about using the latest technology to prevent accidents happening in the first place. In short, it’s about cars that can take control when you have lost it.The shift in emphasis is often referred to as a switch from passive safety systems to active safety systems. Indeed, when it comes to cars, making things safer is one of the main drivers of tech developments. Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) can aid concentration and alertness and encompass features including automated braking that relies on technologies such as radar, cameras and lasers. “ADAS has been a step change,” says Andrew Morris of Loughborough University’s Transport Safety Research Centre. “There was a consensus that human fallibility is hard to eradicate and that all passive systems can do is reduce damage. At that point, the focus shifted to prevention. New technology offers solutions in the shape of sensing and automation, which is a better philosophy because it also protects vulnerable road users like pedestrians and cyclists.”Japanese carmaker Subaru has been at the forefront in the development of ADAS since 2013, when it introduced its “second pair of eyes”, the EyeSight system. This uses two sophisticated colour cameras mounted inside the car on the upper edge of the windshield above the rearview mirror. The system is capable of processing accurate stereo images to identify vehicles travelling in front, as well as obstacles, traffic lanes and other objects such as pedestrians.Using images generated by the cameras, EyeSight can run a suite of six ADAS:As with all the company’s core safety tech, EyeSight is continually evolving. For example, the Forester e-BOXER and Levorg now feature the EyeSight assist monitor, which provides a heads-up display of EyeSight system warnings for drivers to see more clearly.EyeSight is fitted as standard to all Subaru models, save the BRZ sports car. In 2019, the Forester e-BOXER achieved the maximum five-star Euro NCAP rating for safety and was declared “Best in Class 2019 in the Small Off-roadMPV Class”.Other Subaru safety systems include its Driver Monitoring System, which can detect the driver’s eyes closing or looking away for an extended period of time and trigger audio and visual warnings. This could be a potential lifesaver given that, according to Thatcham research centre, at least one fatal sleep-related crash occurs every day in the UK. Subaru’s Driver Monitoring System won the Technology Award at the 2020 What Car? Awards. What Car? praised the system, calling it “the most advanced of its kind”. In the tests, it proved to be more accurate at identifying when concentration was lost, compared with other manufacturer systems.Reverse Automatic Braking (RAB) and Subaru Rear Vehicle Detection also use sensors to spot potential objects behind the vehicle or in blind spots and RAB can even apply the brakes to avoid a collision.While driver distraction can be lethal, education and legislation – like the law banning handling a mobile phone – can only go so far.Full autonomy is some way off but, as of 2022, new safety technologies will become mandatory in cars and vans under EU law and are likely to be adopted in the UK – specifically lane-keeping assistance and advanced emergency braking. This will contribute to the long-term goal dubbed “Vision Zero”, of moving close to zero fatalities and serious injuries.But is eradicating all accidents possible through technology?“It’s very aspirational certainly and hard to achieve in the foreseeable future,” admits Morris. “However it’s a sound concept, a safe-system approach, which says if an accident happens for whatever reason we blame the system rather than the driver. And these systems will definitely become more effective as they are refined.”Safety mattersYour world matters to us.

He stayed there with her for 10 days until she died on 3 April, ending her seven-year illness with the neurodegenerative disorder multiple system atrophy. Two days later, she was taken to a funeral home and cremated under the lockdown rules, David was unable to attend the ceremony.“The hearse simply drove down our road and the neighbours all came out to clap for her,” he says over the phone from his home in Kerry, his voice cracking with emotion. “That was how I said goodbye after 48 years of us being together.” David is now living alone, experiencing both isolation and loneliness for the first time in half a century.As the global pandemic has brought a host of new experiences, including working from home, home-schooling and online socialising, it has also, unsurprisingly, increased the loneliness of many people. Some may have felt socially isolated before physical distancing began, while others, such as David, are having to cope with life-altering experiences on their own.Pamela Qualter, a professor of psychology for education at the University of Manchester, defines loneliness as “not necessarily about being on your own, but about feeling a disconnect with other people – a sense that the relationships you have aren’t satisfying your emotional needs,” she says. “Loneliness is a subjective experience, so it’s not always obvious to us. There are some people who are currently isolated who will not get lonely and there are others who will really struggle.”In 2018, Qualter led a BBC study into loneliness among the British public that found that, out of the 55,000 respondents, a third said they often feel lonely. It is a situation she believes is being exacerbated by the lockdown. “Our isolation is going to trigger loneliness in many people, some who might never have experienced it for extended periods of time before,” she says. “You might be with your family and feel lonely, since we fall into different roles and hide parts of ourselves with family, or you might feel lonely even if you are video-calling constantly, as that can sometimes emphasise our distance from others.”He has also found a way to memorialise Maureen without having had the chance to spread her ashes. “I keep her on a table in the living room with a picture and every time I go out I touch the box and tell her what I’m up to,” he says. “Towards the end, when she couldn’t speak, she wrote on a beach stone that she loves me I have that there, too – it’s one of my most precious possessions.”David was one of more than 100 respondents to a  callout on how readers are coping with loneliness during the lockdown. They ranged from university students struggling to adapt to moving back in with their large families to people who had moved abroad for work and are now stuck isolating in a foreign country alone, from parents feeling lonely while attempting to homeschool their children to newly single people.“I have a four-month-old baby at home and, even though my partner and my parents are here, I’m struggling to cope with the lockdown,” says Nadia (not her real name). “I’ve always loved being around people and I’m so fortunate to have my beautiful baby and such family support, but it’s still so easy to slip into a sense of loneliness.”Brian Turner, a psychotherapist at the Counselling Directory, defines this situation as “emotional loneliness … This is like the scene you get in a film where someone is singled out in a crowd, held at a standstill when others are moving all around them,” he says. “It shows you that loneliness is an emotional disconnect, not merely a physical distance.”Turner recommends trying to connect with at least one other person and making space for privacy if you are living in a shared home. “You need to both try to keep up your communication, to tell people if you need space and then also have somewhere to withdraw to,” he says. “We’re built on connection as humans, so isolation can be a confusing time, but if you can build a routine into your day and prioritise your mental health, that will be very important.”Researchers at the University of Cambridge have already been calling for studies into the mental health effects of coronavirus, which they say is “clearly having a major social and psychological impact on the whole population”. For Nadia, her weekly online therapy sessions have been a much-needed outlet. “I was lucky that, when I signed up for free NHS counselling, it finally came through after the lockdown started,” she says. “I’ve been finding it really helpful talking to my counsellor about my anxieties. She recommended I use a mindfulness app each day, which has been a godsend.” She has also been listening to podcasts, which help create a sense of conversation around her, and watching lots of TV.Before the lockdown began, the artist Capella was accustomed to being alone. “I would spend the week painting or making things at home, and then when the weekend came I would be down at the market just chatting with everyone I knew,” she says. But with the lockdown and the beginning of chemotherapy treatment after a breast cancer diagnosis in December 2019, things have changed rapidly. “It’s been really difficult adapting to the lockdown, because such a big part of my life was just talking to strangers and meeting new people, but now it feels like that has all been put on hold,” she says, “I’ve been alone before, but this loneliness is new.”Capella has taken solace in an unlikely place: her chemotherapy nurses. “I have developed a friendship with the nurses at the Royal Marsden when I go once a week to have my catheter flushed,” she says. “To be remembered by a nurse who has her own busy life is such a gift. It’s so lovely to be thought of by someone else it makes me feel like more than just my diagnosis.”Another unexpected upside has come from a rekindled relationship with her 16-year-old daughter, who lives with her father in Denmark. “She didn’t take my cancer diagnosis too well and we found it hard to speak for a while,” she says. “But now that she’s in lockdown we’re texting and video-calling all the time. It’s so nice that I’m not having to make videos telling her how to live her life after I’m gone, but rather we can have video calls about online shopping and having fun.”For NHS workers such as Charlotte, 28, a physiotherapist, working in a hospital has been a saving grace, even though it might be more fraught than normal. “I live on my own and I quite like it usually, but the lockdown has let loneliness creep in,” she says. “It has been so useful being able to go to work every day. Even though it’s stressful – particularly for my colleagues who are on the frontline – we chat to each other and keep our spirits up knowing that we’re all in the same boat.”Whereas previously her colleagues might not have spoken so readily about their mental health, Charlotte believes the coronavirus pandemic has led to a need for greater help. “The chaplaincy team at the hospital has been amazing throughout this and we’ve all been talking quite openly about the support we might require. It’s made us all very empathetic to each other’s needs.”Capella says that this empathy has been a positive side-effect of the lockdown. “When I have managed to chat to people on my way into the hospital, I’ve been so pleasantly surprised to hear them talking about their anxieties – it’s something we’re all so shy about usually,” she says. Kate Shurety, the executive director for the Campaign to End Loneliness, agrees. “What we’re experiencing now is what thousands of older people experience all the time,” she says. “It’s a valuable lesson that we should all make an effort to help others when they don’t need to be in that situation and we can use this time to try and build links to our community – something that often gets neglected in big cities.”While the widespread use of video-calling and messaging has been a key feature of lockdown, it can have its pitfalls, even for the younger generation. Jake, 21, is self-isolating alone in his student house in Manchester and using video-calling to stay in touch with friends and family each day. “We play online quizzes and sometimes even eat our meals together over the screen, but it can be exhausting,” he says. “I think it’s because there’s no background atmosphere so you’re always trying to fill the silences and also not talk over each other.”Turner says video-calling sometimes has a disassociating effect – one where you can “zone out” of your interaction as your mind becomes confused by the lack of physical connection, despite the visual one. “We have the most technology at the moment, but possibly also the most loneliness,” he says. “It’s important to keep everything in moderation, otherwise you can develop an information overload with too much contact and not enough to say.”For Jake, there are also financial concerns around the related consequences of the pandemic. He experienced coronavirus symptoms as the lockdown began and decided to isolate at university rather than return to his father’s house. “I’m lucky that I worked enough last summer to build up savings to keep me here, otherwise I’d have nowhere to go,” he says. “The biggest concern among my friends is not really about getting seriously ill, but about how we’ll afford to return to uni or get a job when we graduate, as there’s just no work at the moment. Plus, we’re still spending money on data plans for video-calling and online subscriptions, so I’m not sure how long this can all last.”In fact, returning to an analogue lifestyle has been helping to keep his anxieties at bay. “Weirdly enough, I’ve been getting into quilting and am finding it very therapeutic, adding a bit every day to my wonky design,” he says. “And I’ve been making sure to exercise a little each day to stick to some kind of routine, otherwise the weeks just bleed into each other.”Ultimately, this is a difficult time for almost everyone – and acknowledging that is important. “If you are not struggling a bit at the moment, you possibly haven’t understood the severity of what is going on,” says the life coach Michael Bungay Stanier. “Our brains hate uncertainty – we associate it with risk – and now we’re being forced to live it. It’s important to be kind to yourself and not feel like we should fill this time with lists of new year resolutions. Just coping is enough.”Perhaps David, for all that he has already been through, has the answer. “Life is for living and you have to keep going,” he says. “When Maureen was unable to speak towards the end of her illness, that was real loneliness. But she would still smile and I know that she would want me to keep going now, too. So when this is all over, I’m going to buy a little caravan and do a bit of travelling. It’s important to enjoy things while you can and keep reminding yourself that this, too, shall pass.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9891fcc9e91558eea01cbf76293b207d2ce657f5/0_423_5503_3302/master/5503.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=50a9401535c106be89d96495bc6e9161","title":"french racing return boosts prospects for british tracks comeback horse racing","story":"Racing fans received some encouraging news from France on Tuesday, as it emerged that the sport is an exception to the sweeping suspension of professional sports announced by the French prime minister, Edouard Phillipe. As a result, racing is likely to be one of very few major sports taking place in France this summer, which could be interpreted as encouraging news for the sport’s prospects in Britain and elsewhere.“Racing is never considered like a sport here,” said the Chantilly trainer Corine Barande-Barbe, who brought Cirrus Des Aigles over to win Ascot’s Champion Stakes in 2011. French racing is run from that country’s agricultural ministry, rather than being overseen by the sports minister. “They said on Monday that racing behind closed doors can go on from 11 May and I don’t see anything from the prime minister to change that,” Barande-Barbe added.“Things can always change but I hope this will not. My horses are ready to race. I’m an optimistic woman and I never stopped training them.”Asked how the French public would respond to the prospect of horse racing going ahead while other sports were sidelined, Barande-Barbe said: “Everything depends on the way you present it. Gambling on horses provides a lot of money for the government. If gambling on racing is lost, people will have to pay more in tax.”French racing has offered to abide by certain measures designed to prevent the spread of infection when it resumes and is currently awaiting governmental approval of those. But the agriculture minister said on Monday that racing officials had his support.The fact that horse racing seems set to resume well ahead of other major sports in a neighbouring country does arguably strengthen the hand of racing in Britain as officials seek to persuade government and the wider public that a resumption next month would be appropriate. However, the British Horseracing Authority politely declined an invitation to comment on that point, wary of doing anything to upset politicians in the week when Dr Jerry Hill, its chief medical adviser, will take part in a series of government meetings, along with the representatives of other sports, aimed at establishing what protocols must be followed to get each sport back in action.The former champion trainer Richard Hannon Jr stressed that the sport must live up to its responsibilities. “If it’s not safe to do so, racing won’t take place, for everyone’s safety,” he said. “Our horses are ready to go but under no circumstances are we going to go, if it’s not appropriate for reasons of health and safety. We rely on the public going racing, having fun and that’s what we want to happen again in the future. We don’t want to jeopardise that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17e0659ffc2a23b83cee324dbcf8565662c12033/298_311_2599_1559/master/2599.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d4bb5618d31c555191ca6436905458d","title":"comptons cricket summer 47 succour nation needs now","story":"Denis Compton and Bill Edrich became a symbol of national renewal with ‘happy, reckless and carefree’ batting that broke the grip of grim timesOn 21 January 1947, Christopher Isherwood came back to London. He had been away in the US for eight years, and now found his old city “powerfully and continuously depressing”. It wasn’t the bomb damage, shocking as that was, but the shabbiness of the place, the peeling plaster and faded paint, the tattered wallpaper at his club, and the bare walls at the National Gallery.London “remembered the past and was ashamed of its present appearance”, he wrote. Amid all the rictus grin-and-bear-it cheeriness, “several Londoners I talked to at that time believed it would never recover. ‘This is a dying city,’ one of them told me.”In modern London, life was never bleaker than it was that winter. Isherwood’s friends promised him it was worse then than it had been during the war. “The situation couldn’t by any stretch of the imagination be viewed as a challenge to self-sacrifice or an inspiration to patriotism it was merely hell.”There were soldiers in the streets melting snow drifts with flamethrowers. Gas was running at a quarter pressure, electricity was restricted and there were jail sentences if you were caught using it. Newspapers were made to cut pages, television and radio to reduce programming and all outdoor lights were turned off. People worked by candlelight, wore greatcoats indoors, slept in balaclavas. And everything was rationed – “from eggs to minute pieces of scraggy Argentine meat”, wrote Isherwood’s friend John Lehmann, “from petrol to bed linen to ‘economy’ suits”.And sport, too. That February, the government banned midweek horse and greyhound races and football matches. It was a wildly unpopular move, even with the left-wing press: “The government must give us some light in these days of austerity,” said the Daily Herald, “football and the dogs have been some of that light.” But there was no light to give. In the spring the thaw came and floods followed, three quarters of a million acres of farmland were swamped, tens of thousands of acres of wheat and potatoes spoiled, thousands of sheep and cattle drowned. Unemployment hit two million.“Are there to be no fruits of victory?” asked Lehmann. In his history of these years, Austerity Britain, David Kynaston quotes a Mass Observation interview: “Worse than the war mate ain’t it? At least you knew wot was ’appening then.”The football season was extended into June and there was talk, too, that the cricket season could be affected. In the Commons the Tory MP Gurney Braithwaite pushed Clement Attlee for an answer on whether that summer’s Test series against South Africa would go ahead.Attlee’s own cabinet papers show the Home Office had two meetings with the MCC to talk about rearranging the fixtures. In the end it was decided they would be played as scheduled. It helped that Attlee was a devoted fan – “nothing of a bowler and an uncertain bat”, according to his biographer Michael Jago, but a dedicated reader of Wisden.The decision was right. The public asked for light and that summer they got Denis Compton.Compton had been away in Australia, playing in the Ashes. England lost 3-0. “We read the dispatches of these happenings, cabled for inclusion in newspapers still emaciated by paper rationing,” Eric Midwinter wrote. “The sombre tidings arrived during dismal winter mornings, with home and streets still dark and chill. Spluttering coal fires, barely yet alight, were the lot of most in those stone-cold houses, as cricket lovers took stock of the relentlessly bad news.”Still, Compton and his England teammate Bill Edrich had wintered well. They’d had sunshine and, since rationing was more generous in Australia, an abundance of food, too.It showed. That summer Edrich and Compton broke every batting record, they made run after run after run against all-comers, Edrich made 3,539, Compton 3,816, with 18 centuries. There never was, never would be, another season like it. And the floods gave way to drought, “the summer settled into one of scorching intensity”, wrote Midwinter, “day after day of cloudless sky”.The crowds came in tens and then, by the end, hundreds of thousands. Everyone, everywhere watching Compton and Edrich, listening to Compton and Edrich, talking of Compton and Edrich. Attlee followed their progress on the new ticker-tape machine his press secretary had installed outside the Cabinet Office.It wasn’t just the weight of scoring, it was the way they scored – happy, reckless, and carefree. “The exuberance of Compton’s batting and personality became a symbol of national renewal,” wrote Wisden years later. A knot was pulled tight between the game and the public that summer, and it’s never quite slipped loose. There’s still, always will be, a latent love for it, it’s a minority pastime that’s also a national sport.“Never have I been so deeply touched on a cricket ground as I was in this heavenly summer,” Neville Cardus recalled, “when I went to Lord’s to see a pale-faced crowd, existing on rations, the rocket bombs still in the ears of most folk – to see this worn, dowdy, crowd watching Compton. The strain of long years of anxiety and affliction passed from all hearts and shoulders at the sight of Compton in full sail, sending the ball here, there, and everywhere, each stroke a flick of delight, a propulsion of happy, sane, healthy life. There were no rations in an innings by Compton.”Cricket has never mattered quite so much again as it did in those few months but still, now, the game the English turn to for succour and comfort. Soon, we will again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/299754d2adf7734ee3fe990b5577de4d33816f40/0_321_5457_3275/master/5457.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a5e30de07c4bcf802044b20bc47b39d","title":"brazil v france world cup 1986 quarter final live","story":"Zico came off the bench to miss a crucial penalty in normal time, before France eventually triumphed on penalties in a mind-blowingly brilliant, beautiful gameThanks for all your company and comments – should you want more, here’s a little essay from the future on what we’ve just seen, for Joy of Six: misses. Au revoir mes amis!That was, quite simply, the greatest game of football I’ve ever seen and surely one of the greatest games of football ever played, an unstoppable buzz of beauty, joy and love from start to finish. Cherish it, enjoy it, teach it to your children, teach them to teach it to their children its lovingkindness will endure forever. Hallelujah. So the favourites are out! France will play Germany or Mexico next.That was a great penalty, swept into the side-netting. The French squad go wild and they’ve every right to go wild! I suppose we could say that justice was done, given Carlos’ intervention, but players are allowed to commit fouls, the laws are the to punish them, and Brazil ought to have had the game won by then.Carlos takes his time walking to his line, nudges the ball, and Fernandez promptly sends him the wrong way before haring off like he’s been touched by the hand of God! He has been touched by the hand of God and so have we! What a moment! What a game! What a sport! What a life! He absolutely lamps this, but against the face of the left upright! He’s had a fine game, but really, where was Careca? Where was Silas? It doesn’t matter! If Fernandez scores now, France are into the semis!This is one of the worst, most hilarious penalties you’ll ever see! Platini runs at it straight, looking for the top left, but gets nowhere near! The three greatest players playing in this game have made the greatest rickets! We’re back on serve! Edinho knows the laws, because he’s in the ref’s face setting him straight, then Branco does likewise before whacking centre-left as Bats goes to the right. But Platini scores this next one, France will be nearly there.Bellone runs up fast and whips a left-footer across his body, which hits the post ... then hits the ing Carlos on the curls, and bounces in! The ref gives the goal, but according to the laws, the ball was dead after that post situation! “It’s like hitting the post in a sense, and going in,” says Motty. Zico runs harder at it this time, and Bats reckons he’ll go the opposite way so es right, and the ball goes just left of centre. And yes, Motty does say he’s “making up for his earlier miss” of course he does, and of course he isn’t. Amoros, who scored in Seville, sprints, slows, speeds up, and places it just out of Carlos’ reach, to the keeper’s left. Two and half steps, body open, punched into the bottom right,That’s how you do it. Stopyra charges at the ball, cracking a riser more or less down the middle and into the roof, as Carlos es left. He does exactly what he did against Poland, taking one step like in a five aside game, but Bats either reads his ego or gambles on his ego, hurling himself right and palming the ball away. It wasn’t a terrible penalty – fair power, not far enough into the corner or high enough when it needed to be one or the other – but the keeper knew where it was going, so got to it. Well ... this is it. Brazil are going to take first Socrates is en route to the spot.That was everything we hoped it would be and infinite other things besides. All I can really do is express everlasting gratitude to the players, who did a moving, affirming job, and to the manager, who sent their teams out to attack the game like we should always attacking everything. Obrigardos, merci and bravo. 119 min Amoros chips to the back post, looking for Bossis, but he mistimes his leap. Stopyra retrieves and finds Platini, but the return ball can’t find him, and Julio Cesar brings it away. Except Platini comes back at him, knocks square to Fernandez – it bounces up nicely – but he lashes miles high. 119 min France win a free-kick down the right, a few yards away from the box. Everyone piles forward. 118 min Jimmy notes that the ref has had a really good game, which is true. And the reality is that, if Carlos wouldn’t have been sent off, not deeming his foul a foul probably didn’t affect the outcome. But my guess is that after this game, he’ll be on the plane back to ... I’m not sure, does anyone know where he’s from? 117 min You’ve probably and understandably forgotten, but about 40 seconds ago, Carlos brought down Bellone when he was through on an empty goal. And now the France players voice broiges to the ref, but if he didn’t do anything about it then, he certainly won’t do anything about it now. As it goes, Bellone’s touch wasn’t a great one – he forced himself wide, and wouldn’t necessarily have scored – bur the laws of the game aren’t right. If you deny a goalscoring opportunity anywhere on the pitch, that should be a penalty if you commit an offence in the box without denying a goalscoring opportunity, that should be a direct free-kick. Anyway, apologies I’m lowering the tone.116 min “That’s extraordinary!” says Motty of the ref’s ability to adjudge assault, but there’s no more time for moralising because Brazil are breaking! Cesar legs it down the right and finds Silas, infield he plays into Careca, whose first-time touch-off doesn’t complete the one-two, but instead he chases after the ball, which he wants more than Battiston. Now out on the right, he slows Battiston down, sticks one in behind and barges onto it, riding the desperate recovery tackle before drilling a straight, yet wondrous cross across the face of goal ... and Socrates is right there, unmarked! This for the match! But he misses his kick, nutmegging himself in the process! He had nothing left, falling away even before he tried the shot!I don’t know what to say – I’ve never, in all my life, seen a football match anything like this and in a way I hope I don’t ever see another football match like this. It should be on the wall in a gallery, on the school curriculum, have its own television channel – it should have everything, because it is everything. 116 min Here we are. Here - we - are! Bats comes a long way to flap the corner clear, and with Alemao down, France break! Amoros, on the right touchline and midway inside his own half, tucks inside Branco, who expected a pass, then does pass – infield to Platini. Who, of course, sees him coming, and lazily pets a first-timer in behind the Brazil defence! Bellone is through! This is going to be the longest two seconds of his life! Brace, brace! Carlosfunkel races outside his box, Bellone knocks the ball past him ... and Carlosfunkel schumachers him! He trips, regains his footing ... but can’t catch up with the ball, and Julio Cesar tidies up!On the plus side, Bellone still has his teeth, but even Battiston will agree that is scant consolation when he had the chance to put France into the semi-finals of the World Cup! You’ve got to say, that’s fantastic keeping from Carlosfunkel, making sure he got outside the box to do what had to be done. YOU WHAT! The referee waves play on! I’m not certain he could’ve sent Carlos off, though that was what he deserved - and remember, Brazil have no remaining subs, so he’s also deprived us of an outfield player in net for penalties – but seeing that and failing to disturb the sound of silence? That is an astonishing piece of behaviour!116 min Zico pokes wide to Alemao, who has no one front of him so tees himself up for a shot, catapulting everything he’s got into a zooter that Bats tips around the near post. “It would just be typical for West Germany or the hosts Mexico to knock out one of these dazzling teams in the next round,” says Paul Kellington. 114 min It’s a fair while since we saw Platini. 113 min The corner comes to nothing, but only because, when the ball is half-cleared, Stopyra strays fractionally offside when it comes back in. 111 min Amoros is down clutching his shin. I think he wore one from Alemao after hitting the pass – I’m sure he’ll be fine. In the meantime, Edinho bitches to the ref about stopping the game for him to be treated, because his boys have a winner to locate. 111 min We’re back! Careca to Silas to Branco down the left, then Amoros makes another fine challenge before striding away purposefully, launching a fine long pass to Stopyra. But Julio Cesar sticks with him so he goes back to Ferreri, collects a return by the by-line, and digs out a decent cross that Edinho feels obliged to nod behind. 111 min “So much has happened since, that seems like yesterday,” says Motty of Careca’s goal. That’s a lovely line. 110 min Talking of which, I’m absolutely loving this at the moment. 110 min These lads are bushed now, but Bossis still go-go Gadget legs it forward, only for someone to stray offside. L’ouch. 108 min A quiet minute or two, then Tusseau goes down with cramp. Pathetic. 106 min Right then. Fifteen minutes more, and if there’s no winner, it’s penalties – which, as we know, are an absolute lottery of a test of skill under pressure. We are in the presence of true, lasting greatness. Bow down. 105 min My shift + 1 is getting a right hammering here! Bats chucks Ferreri into trouble and Branco steams him! He’s got men in the box! But his cross is too close to Bats, who collects easily enough in the end. 105 min The gigantic Alemao battles through a couple of challenges wide on the right then opts to go infield to Josimar rather than cross Josimar quickly shoves the ball a few yards to Silas, who unfurls a delectable cross for Socrates, in between Amoros and Battiston! But he can only head straight at Bats ... but in fairness he was about 13 yards out ... but either side of Bats and it’s in!104 min I want a pair of Brazil shorts.104 min Alemao lays back to Silas, who fights through a challenge on the slide, just outside the box, then Zico takes over and rolls a ball between defenders for Silas. Bats comes rushing out and for a second there’s a penalty chance, or a chance to take the keeper out of the equation, but he plays back to Alemao, who chips over the top. 103 min Brazil come again, Careca pulling wide for Silas, who chucks all of himself into a shot from the left corner of the box – and it’s a decent one too, sending Bats flying across goal. But it screeches over the bar. 102 min Often, extra-time is tedious, both sides feart of getting beat. Here, absolutely nothing has changed.

Here’s how the makers of six shows dealt with a surprisingly tricky issueThe vulture culture of endless TV reboots relies on the lure of familiarity, enticing viewers with the promise of something they remember fondly from the past. A big part of that nostalgia can be a memorable theme tune, which presents producers with a sonic dilemma: bring back the beloved track wholesale as a respectful hat-tip to history? Risk giving it a modern spin that may alienate hardcore fans? Or is it time to abandon the creaky old version and try something new?ITV’s recently rebooted Van Der Valk with Marc Warren went the remix route, which makes it the first of these valuable case studies.If you set aside Barry Foster’s wondrous golden curls, the one thing everyone remembers about Van Der Valk is the theme tune. Eye Level was an appealing nursery-rhyme melody with an oompah strut, lavishly rendered by the Simon Park Orchestra. Originally written by Jack Trombey (a pen name for the Dutch composer and trombonist Jan Stoeckart), it started life as a piece of library music, but in 1973 was abruptly elevated to the status of platinum-certified No 1 smash thanks to Van Der Valk’s success. Wisely, it was revived intact for the 1990s continuation. But the 2020 version – with episode one now available on ITV Hub – takes a much more tentative approach, favouring a soundscape of moody strings while piping in the merest whisper of Trombey’s melody, as if a child is picking out Eye Level on piano in the next room. If this new incarnation is killed off after one season, the wishy-washy theme will be the prime suspect.If you go back and watch any of the glitzy turbo-soaps of the 1980s – such as Dallas, Dynasty or the winetastic Falcon Crest – it feels as if their title sequences are as luxurious as the affluent families portrayed, stretching to a minute or even longer. How best to honour these lush, full orchestra mini-suites in the time-poor 2010s? A Dallas revival in 2012 attempted a subtly nipped and tucked version of the classic theme, but was cancelled after three seasons. The current Dynasty reboot takes a more aggressive approach, filleting the memorable middle eight from Bill Conti’s rousing original and remixing it into a savagely brief but club-ready banger. It’s an inspired workaround.When Russell T Davies rematerialised Doctor Who in 2005, it was 16 years after the last Sylvester McCoy-led season and almost a decade since Paul McGann’s ill-fated TV movie. Rebooting is built into the sci-fi show’s DNA, but there was probably some nervousness among fans that the relaunch might ditch the classic Who theme, composed by Ron Grainer and brought to otherworldly life by Delia Derbyshire and her BBC Radiophonic Workshop synth sorcery. In the end, the new composer Murray Gold stayed pretty faithful to the original, ramping up the percussion and adding a restless violin counter-melody. Like the Doctor themselves, it’s a timeless theme that keeps coming back in subtly altered forms.With its magisterial brass fanfares, stately pace and strident melody, the original theme for Battlestar Galactica – credited to composer Stu Phillips and show creator Glen A Larson – would have been the perfect overture for an epic, galaxy-ning space opera. Unfortunately, the short-lived 1978 series about a devastating star war between ruthless robots and space-refugee humans was laden with hammy acting and a confusing mythology. Ronald D Moore and David Eick revived the brand in 2003 for an apocalyptic miniseries and by the time it morphed into a TV drama, it had a thrilling new theme by Bear McCreary. Characterised by keening singing and Stomp-style drum freak-outs, it was a useful signpost that this gritty reboot would be a million light years from the garish old BSG.First broadcast in 1983, the hexagon-heavy student favourite has proved to be a surprisingly durable format, with a whooshing, futuristic theme to match. After an initial decade-long run with suave Bob Holness at the helm and an audience hand-jive on Fridays, it has been variously revived by the BBC, Challenge TV and Sky (twice). Perhaps the short-lived BBC Two version hosted by Michael Aspel in 1997 would have lingered in more people’s minds if it hadn’t swapped out the original banging theme tune for a tinny Casio parp-a-long. Much better is the current Comedy Central series hosted by Dara Ó Briain, wisely revisiting the original with some added Stranger Things synthwave vibes. You can run the whole gauntlet here.The sun-kissed 1970s procedural Hawaii Five-O had an impressive innings first time round, racking up 279 episodes over 12 seasons. The slick but bland 2010 reboot couldn’t quite match that record – it wrapped-up a decade-long, 240-episode, run earlier this month – but can still hold its head up high. Would it be reductive to suggest the modern version would have run aground far earlier if it had messed with the rollicking original theme by Morton Stevens, a track that instantly inspires anyone in the surrounding area to mime a canoeing motion? Perhaps, but embracing those exuberant retro vibes helped give Hawaii Five-O V2.0 some much-needed personality."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db3803bcce9323f9078cafbed6817258d3e780f4/0_45_1300_779/master/1300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6624eef3e39d515ef4bd54ffe1dfbe4b","title":"dr lorna breen new york er coronavirus","story":"Dr Lorna Breen worked at New York-Presbyterian Allen hospital and was ‘truly in the trenches’, her father saidA top emergency room doctor in New York who was working on the frontline trying to save coronavirus victims at the height of the pandemic and also suffered the disease herself has died.Dr Lorna Breen’s family revealed that she took her own life on Sunday, her father, Dr Philip Breen, told the New York Times, overwhelmed by the pressure of her work.She worked at New York-Presbyterian Allen hospital, a location hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak.New York City accounts for more than 17,500 out of the US’s 56,000 coronavirus deaths as of Tuesday.“She was truly in the trenches of the frontline,” her father said. “She tried to do her job, and it killed her.”As head of the hospital’s emergency room department, Breen “brought the highest ideals of medicine to the challenging frontlines”, the hospital said in a statement.Her father told the New York Times that she had been talking about how crushing the experiences were for her and other doctors on the medical frontlines, especially noting how hard it was not to be able to save Covid-19 patients.The physician’s family also confirmed that Breen had previously contracted the coronavirus herself. She later went back to work after recuperating for about a week and a half.While Breen was not known to have a history of mental illness, her father said she seemed “detached” when he last spoke with her. After the hospital sent her home again, her family intervened, bringing her to Charlottesville, Virginia, where her mother and sister live.Outside of her work, Breen was described as a devout Christian who was incredibly close to her family. She was a salsa dancer, an avid skier and volunteered weekly at an assisted living home for the elderly.Doctors are often responding to some of the most catastrophic events, but the coronavirus presents unusual mental health challenges for emergency physicians and their teams, especially in the country’s hardest-hit areas.According to the National Institutes of Health, nearly 300 physicians die by suicide each year.Breen’s father pleaded for the public to “make sure she’s praised as a hero”.“Because she was,” he said. “She’s a casualty just as much as anyone else who has died.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7026fa3bd7f9970ddd59a7d0ab7bc57cf2ae5ab4/0_85_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f80dd4a1d19daa0cb4d6105e435fcef6","title":"mike pence face mask mayo clinic visit coronavirus","story":"Vice-president and coronavirus taskforce leader skipped mask as facility advises ‘patients, visitors and staff to wear a face covering’Mike Pence triggered a storm of controversy on Tuesday by failing to wear a face mask on a visit to the Mayo Clinic’s facilities in Minnesota.Pence leads the US government’s coronavirus taskforce though he is typically overshadowed by Donald Trump, or medical experts, at the group’s regular press briefings.Video from a journalist pool camera at the Mayo Clinic showed Pence visiting the facility and 10 people in the area around Pence, including a patient, wearing masks. Pence was not wearing one.On its website the Mayo Clinic advises: “Mayo Clinic is requiring all patients, visitors and staff to wear a face covering or mask to slow the spread of Covid-19.”In response to widespread online condemnation of Pence’s decision not to wear a mask, the Mayo Clinic tweeted that it had informed Pence of its mask policy before his arrival. The tweet was later deleted.The Democratic senator Brian Schatz from Hawaii criticized Pence for not wearing a mask, saying the vice-president was “setting a dangerous example” by not covering his face.It is not the first time Pence has triggered controversy by not wearing a mask. Earlier this month a photo circulated of a mask-less Pence greeting Colorado’s governor, Jared Polis, who was wearing a mask in the picture. Pence’s staff later insisted he did not need to wear the protective covering because he is regularly tested for the coronavirus.“When the face-covering guidelines were developed, it was with the intention to not only protect yourself, but primarily to protect others from asymptomatic spread,” Pence’s spokesperson said in response to questions about him not covering his face. “Vice-President Pence is negative for Covid-19 and is therefore not asymptomatic.”However, coronavirus tests are not foolproof, and the vice-president could potentially contract the virus in between tests, so the mask guidance should still apply to him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21e2f065a7f234e4767c52967aba40c7bad42565/0_130_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=875226eda71f2b5036380a874b5d81f5","title":"us election 2020 fair accurate survey democrats republicans","story":"Findings underscore partisan ide over voting as Democrats push to ease restrictions while Republicans defend themAs America hurtles towards the critical 2020 presidential election during the Covid-19 pandemic, less than half of Democrats are confident it will be fair and accurate, according to a new national survey from the Pew Research Center.The findings underscore the partisan ide over the right to vote.

Earlier this month, the rate was at 0.7.Vladimir Putin extends a non-working period in Russia until 11 May, as he warns the rate of infection in the country has not yet peaked. The Russian president made the announcement during a televised meeting with senior government officials and regional heads.The French prime minister, Édouard Philippe, begins outlining the schedule for the end of the lockdown. Addressing the national assembly, Philippe says the situation is unique. “Who could have envisaged a France where schools, universities, cafes, restaurants, the majority of businesses, libraries … beaches, stadiums … would be closed?”Philippe announces an ambition to increase testing to 700,000 a week, including everyone who has been in contact with someone with the virus, whether they are symptomatic or not.“Isolation is not a punishment or sanction, it is a measure of collective protection,” he says, appealing to the “civic behaviour” of everyone to isolate for 14 days if they test positive for the virus.The number of confirmed cases in the kingdom passes the 20,000 mark as its health authorities report 1,266 new infections. Saudi Arabia also reports eight deaths, bringing its total death toll to 152.The health secretary, Matt Hancock, says the UK government will begin including deaths in care homes in its daily reports as official figures show they account for almost a quarter of the total death toll in England and Wales, with yet more occurring in private homes, hospices or elsewhere.Hancock wrongly claimed at a briefing that care home deaths represent just a sixth of the total. Deaths that occur in the community will also be included from now on.Hancock says asymptomatic NHS and care staff, over-65s and those who travel to work will now qualify for testing. He says the government can potentially carry out 73,400 coronavirus tests per day. He has previously promised the UK would be undertaking 100,000 tests per day by the end of April.According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, 3,063,814 people are known to have been infected, while 212,345 are confirmed to have died. These figures are likely to represent significant underestimates due to suspected underreporting around the world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fe61c49f0423809aedfeffe4f273352e31a7ef0/592_522_3856_2315/master/3856.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8aaa95677ffe47ca1ceb107e6d75d3f","title":"face masks coveted commodity coronavirus pandemic","story":"The global scramble for this vital item has exposed the harsh realities of international politics and the limits of the free market. By  Samanth SubramanianDuring their conversations, North Safety Products executives warned Olea to be careful. There were “interested parties” lurking outside its factory gates, ready to bribe truck drivers for their cargoes. Olea hired a security detail to ride alongside his truck of masks as it drove to the airport in Johannesburg. (He sent me a photo of the team: six grim men packing pistols and rifles, clad in camo and bulletproof vests. “They asked if I wanted machine guns as well. I thought not. We’re not invading Lesotho. Let’s keep it reasonable.”) In mid-February, two weeks after he placed his order, his shipment touched down in Hong Kong. Within six hours, the buyers he had signed up had collected nearly all of the masks. “Even if I’d had 5m masks,” Olea said, “I’d have sold out.”Olea, who has a keen nose for business opportunities, quickly became possessed by this new line of work. Since February, as the pandemic has streaked around the planet, he has bought and sold on another million N95 masks from North Safety Products. In March, Olea became a middleman for Chinese-made three-ply masks, too, the simple kind that just about everyone everywhere is now opting to wear. He sold masks to the Hong Kong government, to European countries, via their diplomats in Hong Kong and China, and to European companies, which wanted them for their employees. All told, Olea reckons he’s sold about 48m of them.By April, Olea decided he might as well take the next step. He bought a mask-making machine from a Chinese manufacturer: an eight-metre-long assembly line, which shapes and cuts sheets of plastic into masks. When I spoke to him, in mid-April, I was reading about mask prices close to £6 a pop, and Olea was waiting with giddy excitement for his machine to reach him. He was still running his payments firm, and masks were a departure from that work. “But these are weird times,” he insisted. “We all must do something to survive.”No object better symbolises the pandemic than the mask, and no object better explains the world into which the pandemic arrived. Social distancing, at first, felt like a strange notion: the inaction of it, the vagueness of it. But the mask sang out to our deepest consumeristic impulses. In the absence of a drug or a vaccine, the mask is the only material protection we can buy it’s a product, and we’ve been trained like seals to respond to products. As a result, in every corner of every country, the humble face mask – this assembly of inexpensive plastic – has been elevated into a fetishised commodity. One mask broker described it as “a madhouse”, another as “the craziest market I’ve ever seen”.Countries have hoarded masks, and used them as chips in geopolitical games. Thieves have made off with them. Prada, Gucci and Balenciaga have started to manufacture them. We already have MaskClub which, like a “jam of the month” club, offers $9.99-a-month mask subscriptions: the best-beloved business model of hipster e-commerce. Last year, an industry insider told me, Burberry had toyed with the notion of putting face masks on some of its models during a catwalk show – a wink, perhaps, at our apocalyptic future. By March, things had become real, and the fashion house was pledging to make masks and gowns for the UK’s NHS. From a healthcare perspective, the mask was a matter of life and death. But it also took on the function of a talisman – as an object to hang comfortingly between the body and a diseased society.All this when no one even seemed to know precisely how useful masks were, or who should wear them. The advice we got was a mess. The World Health Organization maintained, at first, that healthy people had no need for masks. But people bought masks anyway. Shelves were emptied. People improvised. A friend of mine in Tel Aviv ended up fashioning one for herself out of her husband’s boxer shorts – washed and dried, she assured me, and slid over her head like a balaclava. Then, in early April, the WHO reversed its counsel, and a host of governments followed suit, which sparked a fresh run on mask stocks.In this pandemic, the mask reveals far more than it hides. It exposes the world’s political and economic relations for what they are: vectors of self-interest that ordinarily lie obscured under glib talk of globalisation and openness. For the demagogues who govern so much of the world, the pandemic has provided an unimpeachable excuse to fulfil their dearest wishes: to nail national borders shut, to tar every outsider as suspicious, and to act as if their own countries must be preserved above all others.When these tendencies combine with a fawning loyalty to the free market, the results can be ruinous. In mere weeks, the mask went from being an urgent human need to a cynically exploited asset in a global resource grab – the fastest such journey, perhaps, of any product in history. Sometimes, it felt as if the mask itself was beside the point – that it was just a trigger to rehearse old routines of acquisitiveness and discord, with no further, greater end in sight.Such deep familiarity with masks is hard-won. The pandemic has brought on a global shortage of masks, which is really a global shortage of one particular plastic inside the masks – a type of non-woven polypropylene that acts as a filter. In casual conversation, people in the mask business call the plastic “meltblown”, referring to how its plastic filaments are made. Meltblown goes into many things: jackets, nappies, filters in water purifiers and air conditioners. Masks are in short supply not because they’re difficult to produce, but because the meltblown industry is used to stable, long-term demand. It churns out just enough for its customers and no more. To install an assembly line of meltblown takes many months, even at the calmest of times with demand now soaring, some companies supplying meltblown equipment are quoting timelines of up to two years to even deliver a new machine.Until now, countries didn’t consider meltblown a strategic commodity, so during the past three decades, much of its production has migrated from the west to low-cost factories in Asia. The executive’s company is one of just five or 10 remaining manufacturers in the US, he said, and China produces close to half of all the meltblown in the world. As a result, the rush for masks provided a compressed, vivid reminder of something we’d been aware of for a couple of decades now: that in all manufacturing and trade, the lines of commerce inevitably bend towards China.Early in February, the Chinese government began preventing exports of meltblown, so that the material could first be used to assemble masks for China’s own population. The prospect of being cut off from half the world’s meltblown supply “put the fear of God” into everyone who manufactured anything that contained it, the executive said. The market price of meltblown went up fourfold. He began to get 200 or 300 phone calls a day from mask companies all over the world, demanding meltblown. Even Chinese mask manufacturers rang him, worried that their country might run out. They’d offer cash up front and try to outbid each other. “They’d say: ‘Name your price, any price you want to, anything,’ and I’d explain that we don’t do it that way,” said the executive. Then they dangled bribes before him: all-expenses-paid holidays. Just tell us where you want to go.Christopher Dobbing, who founded the Cambridge Mask Company in 2015, said his own factory in China was small enough to escape the government’s notice, so his inventory wasn’t snapped up by the authorities. But he did see, first-hand, the wave of Chinese panic-buying. “Chinese communities everywhere snapped up our masks wherever we had a footprint, so that they could send them home,” Dobbing said. Chinese companies overseas were also asked to purchase and ship back masks. On 26 January, Dobbing got 1,200 emails and 400 phone calls. “Maybe they thought we were a huge company, but we were just a couple of guys in an office, panicking as the orders flowed in.” By 28 January, he was taking pre-orders for March.Roughly 2bn masks were imported into China in February. To those with a kneejerk mistrust of China’s rulers, it appeared as if, having first failed to contain the disease, they were now ransacking the mask market just when the coronavirus was starting to race through other nations. After a Chinese real-estate company in Sydney was discovered to have bought millions of masks, the Australian Medical Association urged its government to keep protective gear safe from foreign buyers. A lawyer attached to Donald Trump’s re-election campaign compared China’s actions to “first-degree murder” and wondered aloud if the US could sue Beijing. The US state of Missouri then went on to do just that, arguing in its lawsuit that China had “hoarded personal protective equipment – thus causing a global pandemic that was unnecessary and preventable”.But for the US and the rest of the west to complain about China aggressively pursuing its own interests is, in one way, to engage in a fundamental duplicity. China’s wealth and power are the result of a longstanding international consensus championed by the US: that the quest for the lowest possible cost of production and the highest possible profit is paramount. According to this philosophy, if that means offshoring nearly everything to China, nothing must be allowed to stand in the way: not the hollowing-out of industry at home, or the loss of livelihoods, or human-rights concerns. And it isn’t just China that has prospered from this arrangement. It has also been good to the richest people in the richest countries. Many of those same people now seem affronted by the world they helped create.As events transpired, few large nations behaved very differently from China once the disease blazed up within their own borders. “A dog-eat-dog world is back,” one former Polish diplomat lamented, as if such a world had ever gone anywhere in the first place.By mid-March, China had relaxed its rules, allowing both masks and meltblown to be sold overseas again, to nations that were now in dire need of pandemic gear. But the market kept failing: supplies of masks often didn’t make it to doctors, nurses, the elderly and others who required them most.During the great global scrum that followed, governments used every conceivable means to get hold of masks for their citizens before they went elsewhere. Foreign embassies in China turned their diplomatic staff into scouts for medical supplies Canada hired a multinational consulting firm to help figure out which manufacturers could be trusted. Freight agents in China, who book space on ships and planes for goods leaving the country, found themselves handling medical equipment and little else. One agent in Shanghai, Fredrik Barner, had been shipping auto parts until this spring, when he was flooded with orders to move masks instead. “I’ve been in the industry for 10 years and I’ve never seen such high air-freight rates,” Barner told me. “Normally, the rate is around $3 or $4 a kilogram. That went up to $17 or $18.”Nations that couldn’t make enough masks for themselves had to find unconventional ways to bring them in from China. In Ireland, the government asked Aer Lingus to run supplies out of Beijing. The airline had never flown to China before, and the planning and approvals for a new route would usually have taken six months. Aer Lingus did it in a week. Brian O’Sullivan, Aer Lingus’s chief flying instructor, captained the first plane to Beijing on 27 March, taking with him four other pilots, two engineers and a specialist in balancing loads in an airplane. Ten hours out, six hours on the ground, then 13 hours back: the kind of flight schedule that is, for a single crew, inconceivable in regular aviation.They landed in Beijing very early on a Sunday morning. Through the plane’s open door, O’Sullivan noticed that the airport, which usually buzzes like a beehive with flights landing and taking off, was practically in hibernation in six hours, he saw just half a dozen or so departures. His crew never left the aircraft, O’Sullivan told me, because that would have required them to go into quarantine. Instead, they stayed in business class, behind thick plastic drapes, while ground handlers loaded first the cargo hold and then economy class: huge green bags filled with masks, gowns and gloves were strapped into the seats, as if the cabin had been booked out by gigantic pods of peas. “We didn’t shake hands with anyone,” O’Sullivan said, “but there were plenty of smiles and thankyous and nodding heads.” When I spoke to him in mid-April, Aer Lingus had completed 30 Beijing flights, and expected to run another 200 or so by the end of May.To meet the rush for masks, a strange alternate ecosystem of suppliers sprang up, often supplying products of dubious quality. In Europe, several buyers of Chinese masks found their products to be sub-standard. The Dutch government had to recall 600,000 masks. Finland discovered that an order of 2m surgical masks, which are discarded after use with a single patient, weren’t good enough for hospital wear. Even if they had been up to scratch, those 2m masks would have only met the country’s needs for four days.It wasn’t always clear who was producing these masks. Being in the trade, Christopher Dobbing got a number of emails throughout March and April from Chinese mask vendors he’d never heard of before. He sent me a few of them, and I rang one of the listed numbers, in the city of Zhangjiagang, 100 miles or so from Shanghai. A woman picked up and introduced herself as Rita. She told me that the company she worked for had been selling K95 masks since the first week of March, for $2.50 a pop. I asked if they manufactured the masks as well.She laughed. “No, we make tin plate. But our clients in America and Europe asked if we could source masks, so we do that now,” she told me. “We get them from a big factory nearby, which makes masks.”I asked how long it would take to send 10,000 masks to London. She couldn’t say. There weren’t many flights out of the country, and after some batches of exported masks had been found to be defective, Chinese customs authorities were inspecting mask cargoes more rigorously. A friend of hers, another mask vendor, had been waiting two weeks already for one of her shipments to clear customs, she told me.The factory that actually made the masks belonged to another company, Rita said. Chinese manufacturers that produce masks for medical use in the west must be certified by government health agencies such as the US Food and Drug Administration. Rita assured me that the manufacturer had an FDA certificate, and she emailed me a scan to prove it. It had been issued on 1 April. In the space where the manufacturer’s name should have been displayed, there was just a short  of white space followed by the generic words Technology Co., Ltd. It looked like any company might print its name into the blank space and make the certificate its own. On the FDA’s database, I looked up the certificate’s number. The FDA had awarded it to Jiangsu Newborn Medical Technology Co, Ltd – a different company altogether.Among those tempted to reinvent themselves as mask merchants were drug dealers, who used the crisis to ersify their portfolio. Logan Pauley, a researcher at the Center for Advanced Defense Studies in Washington DC, tracks the sales of illicit drugs on the internet, focusing on trafficking from east Asia to the rest of the world. Towards the end of February, he noticed that some of the dealers he monitors were advertising masks and gloves. He sent me screenshots. “Mask, 3ply, 50pcs per box, 20 box min. $33.50 per box, exclude shipping charges,” ran one Facebook post by a user named Vicky, in a group where people otherwise offer fentanyl for sale.It was difficult to know how to feel about these transactions, Pauley said. On the one hand, Vicky’s masks might well be of terrible quality, and there was a danger that the masks would be deliberately mislabelled, whisked through US customs, and then sold on to US hospitals short of gear. “Customs is swamped right now,” said Pauley. “They’re not going to be opening and checking every box.” On the other hand, he said, the FDA and other international authorities that license medical supplies “have made it difficult, in this time of need, to get new suppliers approved in a timely fashion. If the masks are good, the hospital may be paying three times the price for them, but it’s still better than waiting for FDA approvals.”He was right. If I’d been a hospital administrator in critical need of masks, perhaps I’d have placed an order with one of these shadowy brokers. In the absence of government supplies or a well-ordered mask market, the seediest corners of the internet seemed to offer one of the few ways to find any masks at all.Alongside the new mask middlemen and the criminal elements finding a fresh vocation, there were the groups who had never fabricated a mask before, but who had a sure sense of money to be made. From February onwards, legions of new mask-makers emerged, of every size and shape: from big companies such as BMW to the amateurs the meltblown executive characterised as “four neighbours in a cul-de-sac in Los Angeles, who’ve gone on to the internet to learn about sewing masks”. A face mask-making machine costs about $100,000, he told me, and it makes about 70,000-100,000 masks a day. He has received at least 200 enquiries from Americans who are importing machines from China – “people who just have 100K to spend and a bit of space, and want to make some money.”You’d like to think they have some experience doing this, he said, but many of them don’t know a thing. They ring him when they’re expecting a new machine in three weeks, to ask vaguely for mask textile.“Do you want meltblown?” he asks them.What about noseclips? What about spun-bound polypropylene, the plastic that encases the melt-blown?“Oh, we need to get some of that, too, do we?”And then, the executive said to me with a sigh: “I have to spend half an hour teaching them about mask manufacturing.”All these breakdowns in the market – the hospitals without masks, the bogus gear, the exorbitant prices, the hoarding, the fly-by-night profiteers – seem to expose the limits of orthodox economics. The most ardent devotees of the free market believe that supply and demand solve every basic problem if they’re permitted to work unconstrained. When demand is high, the price climbs, and the prospect of profit brings in a host of new suppliers. With time, the market rewards those who sell good products and punishes those who sell poor ones with time, the price settles so that it allocates products most efficiently to those who value them most.But this pandemic has provided a huge weight of evidence to the contrary: tales of hoarders, of doctors and nurses so short of protective gear that some wore bin bags and snorkels, and of deals so desperate that a security training company, bankrupt for months and with no employees, somehow won a $55m contract to supply masks. These failures happen, in part, because ordinarily the market’s idea of efficiency involves getting products to those willing to pay the most for them. In a crisis, or even outside of one, that isn’t the same as getting products to the maximum possible number of people who need them.“I have always thought that economists were obsessed with efficiency, no matter what happened to distribution,” Angus Deaton, the Nobel-winning economist, told me. But distribution is what matters, particularly in an emergency. During this pandemic, the best scenario for everyone would be to get masks to doctors and nurses first – “we want to keep them well, so that they can save our lives and the lives of others,” said Nicholas Bloom, a Stanford economist who studies periods of panic and uncertainty. But high prices in unregulated markets keeps masks out of reach for the hospitals that need them. By the time the market culls bad suppliers, stabilises the price and compels hoarders to sell, the disease has spread and people have died.Solving this, Bloom said, requires a hand on the tiller: steering the market in ways that classical economists tend to dislike. One strategy is to cap prices so that they don’t become exorbitant but still offer the kind of profits that draw new manufacturers in. Bloom also thinks governments should requisition masks for their health services first, before allowing the rest into the market. “It’s no different from how food was rationed during the world wars. Or how Britain bought tanks from Vickers during the second world war. It didn’t have to take over the firm. It just offered a fair price. This is the same,” he said. “This is like an economy in wartime.”For anyone who views the prevailing international order as a brutish contest for resources, disguised occasionally by noble words and fine treaties, the scramble for masks offers a perfect little parable. It has taken on the appearance of a zero-sum struggle straight out of a game-theory seminar: with limited supply and endless demand, one mask for you is one mask less for me. To this austere truth, nations have reacted in familiar ways amid the novel chaos created by Covid-19, old enmities and hardened habits reassert themselves.So when, in early April, news anchors in Pakistan complained that China had sent their country masks made out of underwear, Indian nationalists on Twitter launched a mocking hashtag. A couple of weeks before that, when British tabloids reported on French border guards impounding two trucks of masks earmarked for the NHS, it confirmed the worst suspicions of every Eurosceptic. “This shows you all you need to know about European cooperation,” Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader and ardent Brexiter, told the Sun. When the EU did invite Britain to take part in a bulk purchase of protective apparel and ventilators, though, the government passed. The reason appears to be either the stubbornness of its Brexit spirit or its ineptitude in checking its email both seem equally possible under Boris Johnson’s government.The US, for its part, treated the procurement of masks as a smash-and-grab operation. In April, an incredible account emerged of Americans brandishing cash on the runway of a Shanghai airport, buying up a cargo of masks that was already on a plane, ready to fly out to France. No one quite clarified who these Americans were, or how they barged onto the runway, but the episode enraged French officials. In its wake, Renaud Muselier, the president of the regional council of Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur, chose to bring his masks home by sea. “At least that way, I can be sure nobody will steal my masks from the tarmac,” he told a French TV station. The US was also accused of waylaying masks in Bangkok before they flew on to Germany, and of blocking the delivery of 3m American-made masks to Canada. Last month, Ovidiu Olea, the Hong Kong entrepreneur, purchased 50,000 sets of masks, gloves and coveralls, which he planned to donate to the health service in his native Romania. “Everything else was ready, and then my coveralls supplier called to say that some Americans showed up, paid three times the price, and bought my order out from under my nose,” he said.In the EU, relations between member nations have prickled with tension over the lack of masks and other gear. By the end of February, there were more than 1,000 coronavirus cases across Italy, and it needed more protective gear – masks in particular. Around that time, a legislator in Italy’s coalition government told me, France and Germany implemented national laws that declared masks as strategic assets, which meant that if masks were transiting through these countries, bound for elsewhere, they could be appropriated. For a while, she said, France and Germany kept hold of some masks that Italy had ordered from India, Turkey and Vietnam.“In those darkest moments, China stepped in and offered 200,000 masks as a present,” the legislator said. A plane landed in Rome, carrying masks and gear but also traditional Chinese herbs: an exercise in what has come to be known as “mask diplomacy”. Not long afterwards, France and Germany lifted their mask seizure laws and sent free masks to Italy. But by that point, the legislator said, “the damage had been done”.“It’s alarming,” she said, “how the public isn’t seeing that European institutions are actually doing a lot for Italy.” Germany reserved dozens of intensive-care beds for Italians, flew them in for treatment and delivered ventilators to Italian hospitals France sent hundreds of thousands of protective suits. But China’s mask diplomacy has fanned a mistrust of the EU kindled years ago by Italy’s populists. The legislator sounded despondent. “I wish I could say this mask diplomacy isn’t working very well. But it is, unfortunately.”Whatever the new normal is after this pandemic, everyone I spoke with agreed on one thing: there will be masks. Lots and lots of masks. They’ll be handed out on airlines and at hotels they’ll be stacked next to the till at Boots they’ll be stashed in sock drawers and linen closets in practically every home. Every country will produce and stockpile its own supply, unwilling to rely any more on the vagaries of the international market Germany, forever ahead of the curve, has already begun.We already guessed, before the pandemic, that one version of our future would entail masks for billions of us. It’s the version in which we keep burning carbon, polluting our air and aggravating global warming so much that our land keeps going up in flames. But that still felt distant enough to be somewhat avoidable. We could hope that, however slowly or inexpertly, countries would pool their energies to stop this. Now, though, the age of masks has arrived sooner than we anticipated, brought on by an entirely different threat altogether. And the manner of its arrival carries a warning: that with the world as it is, the solidarity needed to battle climate change may be impossible to secure, and that the future of smoky skies and rising seas is the only one that lies ahead of us.Ovidiu Olea’s mask machine arrived from China on the third Monday of April. It can cut and hem 50 masks a minute it has no casing of any kind, so a bystander can observe its innards as sheets of polypropylene pass through the machine’s automated rollers and slicers. “It needs just two people – one to load the material, and one to press the emergency stop button if necessary,” Olea said. He has rented some space in a former bottling plant, but he hasn’t begun manufacturing yet. He wants to make medical-grade gear, and for that he needs to set up a clean room and sterilisation facilities. If all goes to plan, his first masks will roll off the line in mid-summer.He wasn’t worried about the delay. However outlandish the circumstances that cast Olea as mask manufacturer, he was still preparing to settle into the role for the foreseeable future. He didn’t think Covid-19 was going to disappear any time soon. “I think it’ll end up being some sort of seasonal disease – like the flu, but with harsher consequences,” he said. “And this disease has changed attitudes towards mask-wearing. Earlier, people in Italy would giggle at the sight of Chinese tourists walking around wearing masks.

But on this new occasion, its misrepresentation has reached new levels,” a foreign ministry spokesman, Anurag Srivastava, said.“We regard it as an organization of particular concern and will treat it accordingly,” he said in a statement.The state department designates nine “countries of particular concern” on religious freedom – China, Eritrea, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.Pakistan, India’s historic rival, was added by the state department in 2018 after years of appeals by the commission, which was appalled by attacks on minorities and abuse of blasphemy laws.In its latest report, the commission asked that all nine countries remain on the list. In addition to India, it sought the inclusion of four more – Nigeria, Russia, Syria and Vietnam."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05009d61b31de4718779674479b53b7c6237df32/0_66_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=6d8d072db2f12d79c0a8be8072d542e6","title":"quiz how much do you know about the coronavirus","story":"You’ve been bombarded with information about the coronavirus for weeks - how much have you taken in?It has dominated global headlines for weeks, and you could be forgiven for feeling overwhelmed by the amount of information you’ve seen, heard and read about the coronavirus outbreak.

The government imposed lockdown measures in mid-March, and this week the measures were loosened to allow children under the age of 14 daily outings of up to an hour.The decision to disinfect the beach has incensed environmentalists. “It’s totally absurd,” said María Dolores Iglesias Benítez. “The beach is a living ecosystem. And when you spray it down with bleach, you’re killing everything you come across.”Iglesias Benítez heads a local association that has been active in protecting the area, which serves as a nesting ground for the Kentish plover as well as several species of migratory birds.With humans barred from the beach for the past six weeks, she had hoped the number of nests in the area would double this year. “Now I’m worried that the tractors crushed the eggs,” she said.Her group has lodged complaints with local authorities, attracting the attention of groups such as Greenpeace Spain.An official with the regional government in Andalucía said it was looking into the attempted disinfection amid claims that the local officials and business association that carried it out did not have the necessary permissions.One municipal official, Agustín Conejo, said his actions had been motivated solely by a desire to protect children. “I recognise it was an error,” he told the broadcaster Canal Sur. “But it was done with the best of intentions.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff188a4a59ce8a2605e2ebd6c5a9b697d5c11a5c/0_71_3090_1855/master/3090.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d17f1cecb5bf9f60880081267ab18e53","title":"the questions no 10 needs to answer over covid 19 response","story":"From lockdown to PPE, the government is under pressure to provide more clarityNo 10 has promised “maximum transparency” on its coronavirus response in the coming days. Here are just some of the areas where the government is under pressure to provide detailed answers – or risk being accused of a whitewash.There are huge questions about the secrecy surrounding the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), the crucial body advising Boris Johnson on the UK’s coronavirus response. MPs, academics and medical professionals want a detailed list of who sits on it, their disciplines, minutes of its twice weekly meetings and, most importantly, more documents showing the basis on which they are making decisions about the lockdown.Five weeks ago, the government published a tranche of scientific papers showing the possible effects of the virus and social distancing measures. But nothing more has been forthcoming on the impact of the lockdown. ’s publication last week of a list of many attendees, including the prime minister’s senior adviser Dominic Cummings, fuelled calls for transparency. Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, has now promised that a membership list of participants would be published with their permission and the government also says it is planning to release more scientific papers in the coming days.Politicians from Tory grandees to opposition leaders are growing impatient with the government’s refusal to set out an exit strategy. In particular, they have been pressing for information on the economic impact of the measures so far, what this means for wider public health, rising domestic abuse, child abuse, children’s educational outcomes and other potential negative consequences.There was hope that the prime minister’s return to Downing Street might mean a roadmap out of the lockdown is published this week, but No 10 suggests this is unlikely to happen until just before the review date of 7 May. Many ideas have been floated in the press on opening the economy – from friends and family bubbles and socially distanced schools to which sectors may be allowed to return to work first.However, No 10 is remaining officially tight-lipped about the options, insisting that the public supports a lockdown until the spread is suppressed and the risk of a second peak is reduced. Boris Johnson may, however, release some information about the current status of the spread of the virus and how much further the UK has to go before easing restrictions after a cabinet meeting on Thursday.It is still unclear how many people are dying of coronavirus, the exact age profile and the locations of hotspots. The main criticism is that the daily death toll from coronavirus published by the Department of Health and Social Care only includes hospital deaths and wide age brackets, after a 29-hour time lag.The Office for National Statistics is now regularly releasing details for overall excess mortality with a few days’ time lag, which gives a wider picture of deaths in the community, both directly and indirectly related to the coronavirus crisis. However, there are still no real-time figures for deaths in specific settings from confirmed or likely coronavirus, such as care homes and households. This is set to change, after Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said daily deaths in care homes and the community would be published each day from Wednesday.There is also an incomplete picture of infection numbers because of the patchy situation with testing, with no widespread community monitoring. Some reports suggest there are still 350,000 infected people in the community but that is not an officially published figure.Ministers have been repeating huge figures for distribution of PPE, saying a billion pieces have been sent out since the crisis began across tens of thousands of sites. But the BBC’s Panorama accused the government of fiddling the numbers by counting each glove as an item, rather than pairs of gloves, and including paper towels and cleaning equipment, which are not protective clothing.Furthermore, No 10 has not come up with “burn rate” figures –how much PPE is needed and being used each day – so the huge numbers for items distributed have no context. Labour has repeatedly pointed to the “mismatch” between ministers claiming there are no shortages and the situation on the ground, where medics complain of having to manufacture makeshift protection, reuse items or go without.Ministers have been providing daily figures for testing capacity, actual tests, and people on whom tests have been performed. But they have failed to breakdown the types of people tested, including how many patients, care residents, hospital workers, care workers and other key workers are being tested and where in the country. Critics have asked for more information on why the number of tests being carried out do not match the capacity for testing, with many people unable or unwilling to travel for miles when unwell to drive-through testing centres.There is also ambiguity around the millions of antibody tests bought by the government, with a lack of clarity about how many different types are being tested, how much they cost, where they come from and how accurate they have proved so far. Ministers have been considering ordering a large batch from British developers of a test but there have been conflicting reports about whether they are reliable enough for home use.On Tuesday, Hancock announced a huge expansion of the eligibility criteria for coronavirus testing, with over-65s and those who work outside the home now able to get tested for coronavirus as long as they have symptoms. Moreover, tests will be available even without symptoms for all NHS staff, hospital patients, care home workers and their elderly residents. The now-notorious Exercise Cygnus was a pandemic preparation project carried out four years ago, which showed the the UK was woefully underprepared for a global outbreak of a new virus. Whistleblowers revealed a huge number of shortcomings were identified including low stockpiles of PPE, not enough ventilators, and inadequate hospital capacity. However, ministers are refusing to declassify and publish the report, with Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, claiming on Sunday that he could not remember whether he had seen it or not. Hancock insisted on Tuesday that he had received assurances from officials that “everything appropriate to do was done” following the report’s recommendations but there is still no commitment to see it published.The cabinet received advice last week from its scientists on Sage about whether it is effective for people to wear face masks to stop the spread of coronavirus but it is refusing to share the information or make recommendations as a result of the advice. The Scottish government advised on Tuesday that people should wear face masks in shops and on public transport. Questions are being asked about why No 10 is refusing to come to a decision when every day could be crucial in terms of stopping the further spread of the virus."},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

PA Photo. Photograph: House of CommonsPA WireThe British minister leading negotiations on the post-Brexit Northern Ireland protocol has rejected a European Union request for what he described as “a mini-embassy” in Belfast.The EU wants to open an office in Northern Ireland to monitor checks and controls on goods crossing the Irish Sea after the end of the current transition period.But Michael Gove told a committee of MPs that Britain saw no reason for any permanent presence for the EU apart from its delegation’s headquarters in London.“Of course it is the case that the EU has the right to monitor the operation of what UK officials are doing but there’s no need for there to be a mini-embassy in Belfast in order for that to happen,” he told the House of Commons committee on the future relationship with the EU.In a letter to the European Commission, paymaster general Penny Mordaunt said any necessary monitoring could be carried out by means of ad hoc visits by EU officials to the North.Under the protocol, goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will be subject to EU customs controls unless they are explicitly exempt.Delicate balanceThe two sides agreed that checks should be carried out by the British authorities but that EU officials could monitor how they are implemented.“The proposition of a permanent EU office, with permanent staff whose primary purpose (as you acknowledge) would be to engage in a form of supervision of UK implementation of the protocol, is not consistent with the delicate balance of rights and responsibilities, on both parties, set out in the protocol,” Ms Mordaunt said.“Second, one of the primary purposes of the protocol is the protection of the BelfastGood Friday Agreement in all its dimensions. We must therefore aim to implement it in a way that is acceptable to both communities in Northern Ireland and mitigates its effects on them. Both the EU and the UK face obligations in this regard and both sides must make special efforts to develop reasonable proposals in implementing the protocol. A special EU office, uniquely in the regions and nations of the UK, in order to implement a protocol that has attracted controversy, would in our view be isive in political and community terms.”Mr Gove was pressed on what steps his government was taking to prepare ports on either side of the Irish Sea for the customs checks that will be required under the protocol. But he insisted that “the\u0026nbspprecise nature of how the protocol will be implemented” will be determined in a specialised British-EU committee which holds its next meeting on Thursday.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

We don\u0027t want the health system to be overwhelmed. We don\u0027t want more people to die from Covid 19,” said Prof Lothar Wieler of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany’s infectious disease centre. “We must stick to the contact restrictions, keep at least 1.5 m apart and cover our mouths and noses on public transport and in shops,” he appealed to the public.Angela Merkel identified the reproduction factor, also known as R0, as a crucial factor in deciding to lift Germany’s lockdown, and government scientists have declared keeping it below 1 as a key target.But Prof Wieler downplayed the brief rise, which he said was within normal fluctuation rates. The total number of infections in Germany has fallen over recent days, he stressed.  “It is important not to take the number out of context, because the reproduction factor does not tell you the actual number of infections,” he said.In what was seen as a major success in the fight against coronavirus, the German reproduction factor fell to 0.7 last week. Since then it has generally been steady at around 0.9.Germany began to lift its lockdown last week as shops were allowed to reopen. Mrs Merkel has publicly criticised Germany’s regional governments for lifting lockdown measures too quickly, but government scientists said it is too early for this to have caused the brief rise in the reproduction factor.The figure is based on forecast estimates of infection rates because there is a lag of 10-14 days in new infections being detected.There is speculation in Germany the rise may have been caused by people socialising over Easter weekend.But Prof Wieler stressed the actual rise was very small. The R0 only reached 0.96 on Monday but the figure was rounded up to the nearest decimal place.Separately, Germany could introduce tickets for access to shopping areas to prevent overcrowding under proposals reportedly put forward by business leaders.The German Chamber of Commerce and Industry has reportedly submitted proposals for an app-based system that would issue timed tickets for people to enter pedestrianised shopping streets, shopping centres and hotels.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"inexperienced fruit pickers mean shoppers should get used wonky","story":"Inexperienced fruit pickers will mean shoppers need to embrace wonky produce, farmers have said.Growers are facing a labour shortfall of tens of thousands of people as many seasonal workers from eastern Europe will be unable to travel to the UK because of the pandemic.The shortage has led to a huge recruitment drive to get British people, including those who have been furloughed, to help feed the nation. Martin Lines, of the Nature Friendly Farming Network, said that the time it will take to train an inexperienced workforce means that shoppers could see more seasonal or oddly-shaped fresh produce on supermarket shelves. “Fresh produce may not be as evenly cut as it usually is given people are learning on the job,” he said. “People will have to think more about where their food comes from and enjoy the seasonality of food.”He added: “All of it is good veg, it doesn’t matter if it looks slightly different. We should understand as consumers the variation that nature gives us.”Jack Ward, of the British Growers Association, said another issue will be that furloughed workers are likely to return to their usual jobs midway through the season. The furlough scheme is currently due to expire in June.“June only marks the start of the peak season,” said Mr Ward. “At the moment there has been a terrific response from the British people. The real concern is that if the lockdown is relaxed those people will return to work and growers could have to train a new batch of workers.”Last week Tesco said it would be selling packs of potatoes which had been earmarked for takeaway chains including McDonald’s before they were forced to temporarily close. The packs came with a message reading: “I’m not looking my normal gorgeous self but I still taste great, buy me and support British farmers.”Andrew Opie, of the British Retail Consortium, the trade body for supermarkets, said: “Retailers have shown their flexibility throughout the crisis to get the British food consumers need on their shelves. “They know the pressure growers are under and will do everything they can to support them and maximise British crops.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"italians revolt slow pace lock down easing government takes","story":"Italians are in revolt over the government\u0027s cautious lockdown exit strategy, with the mayor of Venice saying the World Heritage city is a social bomb ready to explode with anger and frustration.Italy has been under draconian restrictions since March 9 in Europe\u0027s longest coronavirus lockdown, and the strain is beginning to tell for millions of people as the nation\u0027s death tolls climbs above 27,000.The collapse of tourism has brought the lagoon city to its knees, said Luigi Brugnaro, a businessman who has been Venice\u0027s mayor for the last five years.We\u0027re unfortunately facing a social bomb which is already primed. People are tired and angry and we are struggling to hold it together, he said.He called for more financial help for Venetians who have been laid off as a result of the disappearance of tourists from a city that normally receives more than 20 million visitors a year.The collapse in spending by domestic and international tourists in Italy will cost the country €66 billion this year, according to the National Tourism Agency. The tourism sector will not recover fully until 2023, the agency said.Tourism will return, that is a safe bet, but in the meantime we need to safeguard the businesses that work in this vital sector, Mr Brugnaro told Corriere della Sera newspaper.Under measures announced by the government on Sunday, Italy\u0027s economy is to gradually open back up as the rate of contagions and number of deaths from Covid-19 begin to fall.But for many Italians, the pace is far too slow. Shops will only be allowed to reopen on May 18, while hairdressers, restaurants and bars will have to wait until June 1.Having already been closed for nearly two months since the lockdown was imposed, hundreds of thousands of businesses say they are at risk of going bust.I\u0027m furious. We were ready to reopen. We had rearranged the salon with space between all the different chairs, said Silvana Traini, the owner of a hairdresser\u0027s in San Benedetto del Tronto, in the central Marche region.Northern Italy has been by the far the worst affected by the pandemic and people in central and southern regions say their quarantine measures should be relaxed sooner.The gradual loosening of the lockdown is a disaster for the hospitality industry, said Francesco Massaro, who owns a bar in Palermo, Sicily.I don\u0027t want to be all territorial, but Sicily has been affected much less by the virus and Palermo hardly at all. Why should we have to endure the same limitations as Lombardy and Milan? he said.Giuseppe Conte, the prime minister, defended the gradual relaxation of lockdown rules, saying Italy still has around 100,000 coronavirus cases and must avoid a new spike in infections and deaths at all costs.We all hoped to return to normality soon, but the necessary conditions to return to normality are not there, he said during a visit to Lombardy.Pope Francis came out in support of the government\u0027s cautious exit strategy, urging Italians to be patient and respect the rules.Speaking during his daily private Mass in the Vatican, he said: In these days in which we are starting to have regulations to come out of quarantine, let us pray to the Lord that he gives his people, all of us, the grace of prudence and obedience to the regulations so that the pandemic does not return.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"michael moore climate change film accused inaccuracies outdated","story":"A new film produced by documentary filmmaker Michael Moore criticising the environmental movement has been accused of a series of inaccuracies and outdated claims.Planet of the Humans is described by the Bowling for Columbine director as a “wake-up call” and contains claims that renewable energy is as bad as burning fossil fuels.The film, directed by Mr Moore’s long-time collaborator Jeff Gibbs, has had 3 million views since it was released on YouTube last week to mark the 50th Earth Day.But it was briefly pulled from the website of online film distributor Films for Action, which said the film was “full of misinformation”, following an open letter signed by dozens of climate scientists and experts.The central argument of the film is that renewable technologies such as solar, wind and biomass, and technologies like electric vehicles rely on fossil fuels for their construction and operation and therefore cannot be considered environmentally friendly.Mr Moore says the film exposes the “reality” that limiting population and consumption growth are the only way to keep climate change in check and says the green movement has been sold out to “corporate America”.But the film overlooks many of the technological developments that have improved the efficiency and environmental credentials of renewables in recent years.Leah Stokes, a professor specialising in energy and environmental policy at the University of California, said the film was “riddled with errors about clean energy”.Ms Stokes said that, for instance, claims in the film that solar panels are only 8 per cent efficient were a decade old, and Mr Gibbs’ suggestion that electric vehicles are not green because they rely on coal-powered electricity were also outdated.A study from the University of Exeter last month concluded that electric cars have lower lifetime emissions than petrol cars in 95 per cent of the world, and are on track to become less polluting as more electricity is sourced from renewable energy.The film also attacks figureheads from the environmental movement, including Al Gore and Michael Bloomberg. One of its targets, activist Bill McKibben, said his attempts to correct claims about him before the film’s release were ignored. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/pensions-retirement/2020/04/20/TELEMMGLPICT000119848634_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwRMWbYwzrg_3PLcMwCu9G8U.j","title":"ve day perfect occasion reopen churches","story":"Could not the churches use the occasion to look forward to victory over Covid-19?Most organisations which are currently locked down by Covid-19 are lobbying vigorously for the restrictions to be lifted as soon as possible. It is rather melancholy that Church leaders do not seem to be among their number. The zeal of bishops to go further than the government regulations in keeping churches shut contrasts sadly with the wishes of parishioners.There is much excellent local pastoral work going on, and plenty of services are livestreamed. But talk of “community” is somewhat empty without buildings where a community can gather. Last year, before the virus, the Church of England was strongly preaching the need for being physically together, rather than just online, for worship and fellowship but now this doctrine has been laid aside. Of course public health matters, but why are church leaders so reluctant to find imaginative ways to open their doors? An unworthy thought crosses the mind: would they be keener on re-opening if, like so many workers, they had been furloughed for the duration?Anyway, a chance for a rethink now offers itself. Friday week is the 75th anniversary of VE Day. Virtually every parish church in the land has a memorial, inside or out (and sometimes both) to those who fell in both world wars. Why not deck them out and invite people to come and pay their respects to them, with little displays, where possible, of short biographies of the dead? It would not be impossible, for just one day, to find volunteers to watch the monuments and ensure social distancing.Whereas November 11 is solemn and commemorative, May 8 is joyful: it celebrates the victory of good over evil I say “deck them out” because VE Day, as its name suggests, is quite unlike Armistice Day. Whereas November 11 is solemn and commemorative, May 8 is joyful: it celebrates the victory of good over evil (let us “park”, for a moment, the debate about whether the victorious Stalin was any better than the defeated Hitler). No poppies then, but traditional symbols of triumph, such as laurel or bay, are what is needed – and something that celebrates May, the month of growth.One wouldn’t want to push too hard, but could not the churches use the occasion to look forward to victory over Covid-19? After all, on the original VE Day, we were still fighting Japan and so, Winston Churchill reminded the country, it was “a victory only half won”.The relevant government ministry is nowadays called the Department of Health and Social Care, but coronavirus has brought out once again that public policy is focused much more on the health bit than on the care bit.In a sense, that is right: medical treatment is the most urgent thing of all. But there are at least three counterpoints – the first professional, the second psychological, the third grimly practical.The professional one is that the crisis has proved that the National Health Service does not regard care workers as quite the real thing. The confused chains of “commissioning” authority in local areas leave care homes at the mercy of administrative foul-up. In some places, some hospitals said at first that they could not admit anyone from care homes. Others have sometimes sent back patients to the homes although they did not have the right tracheotic equipment to look after them. It has been known for a care home to have to lock its doors in order to force a hospital not to release a patient prematurely.The psychological point: as its name suggests, a care home is a place that looks after people, rather than making them well and getting them out. Far more than in a hospital, nurses and carers come to know their residents, sometimes for years. Care homes are also small institutions, much more personal than most hospitals. They contain, say, 60 occupants rather than several hundred. It is not that they do not know how to deal with death, which is, after all, a central feature of their trade. It is rather that they are acutely affected by a big change in death rates.The head of a leading care-home chain brings this home to me by pointing out that, in a normal April, his homes would expect a little over 400 people to die in their care. This April’s figure will be about 1,100. This is a tremendous shock to all involved, and a tremendous feeling of failure, even though it is scarcely their fault.The practical point concerns financial viability. Right now, the normal care-home pattern of death and replacement is broken. Many more than usual are dying. Many fewer than usual are coming in. Who, after all, would want to enter a care home at this point if it could be avoided? The bigger providers expect to start losing money by June unless the situation improves (which, to be fair, it most likely will). The single-home providers will be in trouble before that.So much talk about “protecting the NHS”, perhaps, that we have exposed social care to unnecessary risk.In his statement in Downing Street yesterday, Boris Johnson’s first words were highly typical: “I’m sorry I’ve been away from my desk.” Within his apology was a sort of bravado. It reminded me of the tardy schoolboy whose late arrival in the classroom steals the show. Like all Boris tactics, it had that element of jesting on a serious subject which repels the Roundhead in the British character and delights the Cavalier. Our Civil War never really ended.Should churches be reopened to celebrate VE day?

As well as being critically panned, the film made a total loss of $111.1m (£89.2m)It won’t come as a surprise that Cats, another film with an all-star cast that failed to resonate with audiences, made a significant loss, of $113.6m (£91.2m). Despite its cast including critics’ favourites such as Dame Judi Dench and Sir Ian McKellen, the film was a critical and commercial disaster, and received some of the most brutal reviews of any movie in recent years.The second episode of SNL at Home was awkward in the best wayHuge list of secret Netflix codes unlock hidden films and TV showsIn second place was Terminator: Dark Fate, with a reported total loss of $122.6m (£98.4m), but the clear “winner” was X-Men: Dark Phoenix, which cost 20th Century Studios and Disney a total loss of $133m (£106.8m).A review for The Independent gave Dark Phoenix, starring Sophie Turner and James McAvoy, two stars.“The latest X-Men film risks short-circuiting thanks to its own overabundance of special effects,” the review said.“The many scenes of characters being consumed by fireballs or crumbling to dust or being hurled backwards by the lightning-like force in the X-Men’s fingertips become increasingly dreary. This is a young adult drama as much as it is a sci-fi film but doesn’t have anything very fresh to say about the trauma of adolescence as experienced by mutant superheroes.”Read the detailed breakdown by Deadline here.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The loans will be 100 per cent backed by the government, unlike under the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS) which is 80 per cent state-backed.This means that the process for applying will be significantly quicker and less bureaucratic than CBILS which has been heavily criticised for not getting money to businesses quickly enough.The scheme is aimed at small businesses but the Treasury has not set a size limit on companies that can apply. Therefore, companies that want a small loan quickly may choose to apply for a bounceback loan rather than a CBILS.Applications are around two pages long and are submitted through an online form from Monday. Only basic details are required to verify the company exists and is eligible. Company directors self-certify that the information they provide is correct and their lender then decides whether or not to approve the loan. Companies may be required to provide a tax return may in a small number of cases.Only businesses that existed on 1 March 2020 can apply. Money should be in a business’ account around 24 hours after an application has been approved.Because banks are not on the hook for losses under the scheme, they will not have to carry out their normal full credit checks and procedures which can time be consuming. Some firms had complained of being rejected arbitrarily for a CBILS loan. The new scheme should avoid that outcome.How small businesses can apply to the government\u0027s bounceback £50,000 loan schemeNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailBanks will not have to absorb losses on loans taken out by companies that later cannot repay all of the debt. If a business cannot repay, and the funds cannot be recouped through normal means, the state will take a loss.The Treasury says it is taking action to ensure that the primary homes and vehicles of sole traders (who, unlike companies, are not legally incorporated entities) are protected from any debt collection proceedings.The government will cover interest and fees for the first twelve months, and businesses will not be required to repay any of the loan balance during that time. After that, interest rates will be “very low”, according to the Treasury, with a loan typically paid back over five years.No, each firm can only take out one or other form of loan. The CBILS scheme allows for larger sums to be borrowed – up to £5m per business – but requires a lengthier application process with more stringent checks.However, companies that have already obtained a CBILS loan for £50,000 or less may be able to switch it over to a bounceback loan which will be 100 per cent government-guaranteed, rather than 80 per cent.The Independent understands that a company which obtains a bounceback loan will later be able to convert it to a CBILS loan (and therefore take out a larger amount) if the application to do so is approved by their lender.Businesses who take out a bounceback loan will still be eligible for other direct government support including grants of £10,000 for small businesses and £25,000 for hospitality businesses, as well as the furlough scheme.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastThe primary existing loan scheme, CBILS, has been criticised because many of the companies most in need of funds were being rejected or simply told not to apply as they were not eligible. One of the key issues is that a business must be deemed “viable” by a bank. Given the extraordinary economic circumstances caused by the virus and lockdown measures in place to halt its spread, a large number of businesses were simply unable to demonstrate viability.For example, how could a catering company, reliant largely on summer events which have now been cancelled, demonstrate that it was “viable” going forward?Mr Sunak reiterated on Monday that he wanted to preserve the productive capacity of the economy after the virus is contained. That means delivering emergency funding to hundreds of thousands of businesses so that they are in a position to start back up again as soon as possible. It is hoped that the new loan scheme will do that.The government has adapted its approach on an almost daily basis since the crisis began but it has been accused of being slow to realise the needs of small firms.It had used the banks as the “delivery mechanism” for CBILS because they already have the infrastructure to deal with processing applications for loans. This was meant to get the money out as quickly as possible but banks have approved less than £4bn of loans so far with the need for funding thought to be many multiples of that. Some other countries have been able to get cash to firms more quickly.under current plans, the existing scheme will not be changed.Part of the problem is that UK lenders must cover 20 per cent of losses – and sometimes more - for funding. That finance is needed primarily because of a government-mandated shutdown of the economy so the argument is that the government should cover potential losses. Applying their normal lending criteria, banks are nervous that they will lend out billions, much of which they will never see again. Of course, these are not normal times so businesses argue more flexible criteria should be applied.Another big problem has been reams of paperwork, with lenders asking for, among other things, forward financial projections. Firms say they have no way of being able to provide these given the uncertainty of the situation.With increasingly dire warnings about the impact on small businesses the government has been pressured to take further action. It may well have to add to these measures in due course.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We will be looking into this further, but want any practice of this nature to cease immediately.“We are concerned that tying clients to take additional services, or demanding fees for services not provided is not in the best interests of those clients, distorts competition, undermines market confidence and calls into question firms’ and iniduals’ integrity.“This conduct is also likely to increase overall transaction costs for corporates trying to raise money.”Officials also reminded banks that each worker registered with the FCA has personal responsibilities and rules to uphold.Banks that offer both lending and services for fundraising from investors, must now conduct a review of their practices, the FCA added.It said: “If we find further evidence to support these concerns, we will not hesitate to take action, as this conduct has no place in well-functioning markets.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

No matter how friendly, it is an exchange of potentially infectious microorganisms.“Hands are like a busy intersection, constantly connecting our microbiome to the microbiomes of other people, places, and things,” a group of scientists wrote in the Journal of Dermatological Science. Hands, they said, are the “critical vector” for transmitting microorganisms including viruses.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut if it is no longer automatically acceptable, what will replace the handshake as a fixture of post-coronavirus social etiquette? A fist or elbow bump? Maybe a traditional Japanese bow or hat doff? How about Spock\u0027s Vulcan salute from Star Trek?We are social beings. When we meet one another, we press flesh. We take our largest organ, skin, and mash it together with someone else\u0027s - naked.

We have hundreds of species of bacteria and viruses on our palms.“Think about it,” says Charles Gerba, a microbiologist and public health researcher at the University of Arizona, who also answers to Dr Germ. “Every time you touch a surface, you may be picking up up to 50 per cent of the organisms on that surface.”Our hands can carry Salmonella, E\u0026nbspcoli, norovirus and respiratory infections like adenovirus and hand-foot-and-mouth disease. And, given how frequently scientists find faeces on our fingers and palms, our hygiene habits are far less fastidious than we think.We cannot\u0026nbspsee any of this with the naked eye.How to care for dry hands during the coronavirus outbreakAnd so we rely on scientists with agar plates to make visible the arching, spiralling, exploding patterns of bacterial effervescence that show just what our intermingling of fingers risks, something so simple as a handshake rendered in terrifying technicolour.Scientists can also show us viruses. Those must be studied in animal cells, in a mosaic of tiny semi-circles that scientists often stain purple or red.The cells are lovely, says Dr Gerba, “and then when they die, they become colourless”.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some handshakes, like the bouncing clasp of Chinese president Xi Jinping and Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe, take months to negotiate.Awkward or smooth, handshakes are a hard habit to break, even if we want to.Minutes after announcing a ban on shaking hands to combat Covid-19, Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte enthusiastically pumped the hand of Jaap Van Dissel, the head of the Dutch Centre for Infectious Disease Control.“Sorry, sorry! No, that\u0027s not allowed! Let\u0027s do that again,” Mr Rutte said, breaking into a laugh.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Mulaney revealed he had a feeling he wasn’t able to leave, as though he was in quarantine.Reiner then gave him the same kind of pill Mulaney gives to his dog for acid reflux, and told him to “wake up”, at which point the dream ended and Mulaney did indeed wake up.The 31 most underrated TV shows to watch while self-isolating“The first thing about the dream that it gets right is that Rob Reiner is very demanding,” Colbert said.“He\u0027ll ask you to do all kinds of things, and you do it for him, and he\u0027s like \u0027Eh.\u0027”He suggested the dream was likely brought about from concern that he had angered someone he has respect for.“I\u0027m sure it\u0027s about my parents, but I\u0027ll give Rob Reiner a call,” Mulaney said.Many people have reported experiencing a sudden increase in\u0026nbspvivid dreams during lockdown.When you go to sleep, your brain carries out actions including processing the day’s information, consolidating memory and regulating your emotions, Professor Colin Espie, professor of Sleep Medicine at the University of Oxford, explains to The Independent.Your dreams are a “window into the fact that the brain is busy processing emotion”, he states, which is why it is likely dreams will appear more vivid when you are in a heightened emotional state.“What you’ll probably notice in your dreams just now is they’re a little bit more vivid and probably more emotional in tone.

On a normal day we would fly more than 300. What we are facing as an airline, like so many other businesses up and down the country, is that there is no ‘normal’ any longer.“Our very limited flying schedule means that revenues are not coming into our business.\u0026nbsp“In the last few weeks, the outlook for the aviation industry has worsened further and we must take action now. We are a strong, well-managed business that has faced into, and overcome, many crises in our 100 year history. We must overcome this crisis ourselves, too.“We do not know when countries will reopen their borders or when the lockdowns will lift, and so we have to reimagine and reshape our airline and create a new future for our people, our customers and the destinations we serve.“We have informed the government and the trade unions of our proposals to consult over a number of changes, including possible reductions in headcount.”British Airways has furloughed nearly 23,000 staff under the government’s Job Retention Scheme.IAG, which includes\u0026nbspAer\u0026nbspLingus, Iberia of Spain and the low-cost carrier,\u0026nbspVueling,\u0026nbspsaid: “Recovery to the level of passenger demand in 2019 is expected to take several years, necessitating group-wide restructuring measures.”Mr Cruz said: “There  is no government bailout standing by for BA and we cannot expect the taxpayer to offset salaries indefinitely.“Any money we borrow now will only be short\u0026nbspterm and will not address the longer\u0026nbspterm challenges we will face.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In addition, the airline will be keen to retain its slot portfolio at Heathrow, where it currently operates just over half the total take\u0026nbspoffs and landings.BA’s fleet will also shrink significantly. The carrier has already flown some of its ageing Boeing 747s to be scrapped, and the future of its 12 Airbus A380 “SuperJumbo” aircraft is uncertain.The British Airline Pilots’ Association (Balpa) called BA’s announcement “a bolt out of the blue”.The pilots’ union’s general secretary, Brian Strutton said: “BA pilots and all staff are devastated by the announcement of up to 12,000 possible job losses in British Airways.“This has come as a bolt out of the blue from an airline that said it was wealthy enough to weather the Covid storm and declined any government support.“Balpa does not accept that a case has been made for these job losses and we will be fighting to save every single one.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Indeed, they have become four times as frequent\u0026nbspin the past half-century.Since the 1970s, it is\u0026nbspestimated at least three dozen infectious diseases have emerged from human interference with animals, including Sars, Mers, Ebola, bird flu, swine flu and the Zika virus. As far back as 2007 the World Health Organisation warned that infectious diseases were emerging at a rate that had not been seen before.The spread of the viruses is put down to a deadly combination of wildlife trafficking and consumption, increasing human encroachment into wildlife habitats as more people live in densely populated areas – and air travel, which enables pathogens to take hold globally.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThree years ago, an article\u0026nbsppublished by the US National Centre for Biotechnology Information stated, presciently: “The Aids and influenza pandemics have claimed and will continue to claim millions of lives. The recent Sars and Ebola epidemics have threatened populations across borders. The emergence of Mers may well be warning signals of a nascent pandemic threat.”Zoonotic diseases are complex, and it’s sometimes impossible to say a virus has disappeared, because it might have many different strains, and might mutate and lie dormant. This is a timeline of the main zoonotic diseases to have hit us since the start of the 20th century:Wildlife trade continues in Asia amid calls for restrictions China tries to shut down wildlife trade but markets remain openBlack-market trade ‘may undermine Vietnam ban on disease-rife markets’Stray dogs eating bat meat ‘could have sparked coronavirus pandemic’The 1918 flu pandemic: This was the most severe pandemic in modern times, killing at least 50 million people in two years. It is widely believed that the virus originated in birds because it shared genetic mutations with the bird flu virus later found in Asia, and could have transferred to horses in the trenches of the first world war before spreading to humans. This is disputed, with one study suggesting it came from mammals.Asian flu, 1957:\u0026nbspIn February 1957, a new influenza virus, known as H2N2 emerged in east Asia, which spread into a pandemic. It originated from an avian influenza virus, causing an estimated 1.1 million deaths worldwide.HIV: First identified in 1981, the disease is thought to have been acquired by people in central Africa hunting chimpanzees and coming into contact with their infected blood. However, studies show that HIV may have jumped from apes to humans as far back as the late 1800s, and it has existed in the West since at least the mid to late 1970s. HIV has killed about 35 million people to date, according to the World Health Organisation.Sars:\u0026nbspSevere acute respiratory syndrome is another type of coronavirus, which killed at least 770 people globally in an epidemic in 2002-3. Most victims were in southern China, Vietnam and Singapore. Scientists are not certain of its origins but like Covid-19 it’s thought it could have come from bats and spread to other animals such as civet cats, which are commonly sold in squalid conditions in street markets. The epidemic resulted in more than 8,000 cases, in 26 countries. Of those, 774 died.Swine flu: In 2009-2010 a new strain of flu emerged in pigs in Mexico. The H1N1 virus killed nearly tens of thousands of people in a global pandemic that spread to 214 countries in less than a year. However, overall the outbreak was not as serious as originally predicted, largely because many older people were already immune to it. And the NHS says it now circulates each year and is considered a normal seasonal flu strain, which is covered by the annual seasonal flu vaccine. A study in 2013 suggested between 123,000 and 200,000 people globally may have died as a result of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.Mers:\u0026nbspFirst identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome is also a coronavirus whose symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. With an estimated death rate of 35 per cent, the disease has killed 858 people, according to the WHO. Again, scientists think it spread to humans from bats, this time via camels.Ebola: A 2014–2016 outbreak in West Africa was the largest and most complex Ebola outbreak since the virus was first discovered in 1976, killing 11,300 people. Scientists say it began with a child in Guinea who came into contact with infected bats, but it has since been widely linked to the killing and butchering of bush meat, including monkeys, chimps, antelopes, fruit bats, porcupines and rats.Zika: First identified in Uganda in 1947 in monkeys, the mosquito-borne virus caused alarm in 2015, when it was thought to be the cause of thousands of cases of microcephaly – a shorter-than-normal head – in babies in Brazil. Outbreaks soon appeared throughout the Americas, Africa and other regions. It was thought to have killed 29 babies.Bird flu: Avian influenza, also called avian flu or bird flu, has many different strains but one of those, H7N9, has caused 1,568 cases in humans and 616 deaths worldwide since 2013, according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations.Another strain of the virus, H5N1, first identified in 1997, spread across east and southeast Asia, killing six people in Hong Kong and leading to vast swathes of chickens and turkeys – from Hong Kong to Britain – having to be culled early after contracting the disease. To date 861 cases of human H5N1 infection and 455 deaths have been reported.\u0026nbspThe highest number of infections and deaths were in Indonesia, Vietnam and Thailand. The H5N1 virus, which has a 60 per cent mortality rate among infected humans, according to WHO, has not gone away, but is thought to have mutated.Bird flu has been linked to rapid intensification of the poultry industry, with thousands of birds crowded together indoors and with compromised immune systems.The Independent is campaigning against the wildlife trade at the core of the Covid-19 pandemic.\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The terms of eligibility are\u0026nbspstill not clear.The London mayor said he was “extremely concerned” to hear that there had\u0026nbspalready been confirmed cases of Covid-19 in immigration removal centres, and called on Ms Patel to consider that those held in detention\u0026nbspwho aren’t any danger to the public should be released “without delay”.Mr Khan also urged the department\u0026nbspto suspend both the habitual residence test and the no recourse to public funds (NRPF) condition — which prevents people on certain visas from accessing state benefits — to enable people to get the support they need and to help stop the spread of the virus by those who feel they have no choice but to go out to work.He adds in the letter: “I recognise and welcome some of the changes your department has already made to meet the needs of migrants, refugees and asylum seekers in the UK, however, I remain deeply concerned that some policies are risking Londoners’ public health and I am writing today to ask you to go further.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is a charity that has adapted with incredible speed to the crisis to help the most vulnerable in our community. In just five weeks, they have responded to the increased demand for food by quadrupling their output. We hope that our donation, coupled with the campaigning power of The Independent, will help the project grow and reach as many as possible of the one in five Londoners at risk of food poverty.”Another substantial contribution came in yesterday from the Julia and Hans Rausing Trust, which has assigned £16.5m\u0026nbspto charities at the forefront of the coronavirus pandemic and has donated £50,000 to our appeal.How to support our campaignJulia and Hans Rausing,\u0026nbspheirs of food packing giant Tetra Pak, said: “We have been impressed not only by the speed of The Felix Project’s response to the crisis, but the way in which they have managed to get a number of organisations working together to help people across the capital. Efforts like this support communities across London at this time of need, and we are glad to support their inspiring work.”We launched our appeal, in association with the Evening Standard, on Friday 27 March\u0026nbspand have reached £3m\u0026nbspthanks to the generous backing of dozens of London foundations, philanthropists and corporations, including Garfield Weston Foundation, Lansdowne Partners, the Westminster Foundation, Sir Peter Blake, Burberry, Eranda Rothschild Foundation, Citibank and investment holding company Temasek.More than 1,170 members of the public have contributed, donating £103,837 on our Virgin Money Giving page.But there is a sense that we are still in the foothills of the economic crisis, with experts warning the government that food poverty is about to get far worse. The Food Foundation has reported that eight million people in Britain face food insecurity and that three million have been missing meals since lockdown. The Institute for Social and Economic Research at University of Essex estimates that 6.5 million jobs could be lost in the coming months, causing a huge rise in demand for free food.As the biggest supplier of free food in London, The Felix Project has been operating 12 hours a day, six days a week, distributing surplus food to giant community hubs, including Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in Haringey, as well as to 80 charities and schools across the capital.The Independent\u0026nbspis encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry across the country – find out how you can help\u0026nbsphere.

A nurse said meals cooked with fresh Felix produce made her feel “that little bit stronger”.All told of their relief\u0026nbspat being able to access healthy food, thanks to The Felix Project, one of the biggest food redistributors in the country, which has quadrupled daily deliveries to 40 tons since the outbreak of the virus.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesYesterday, in a sign of further upward spiralling demand, The Felix Project broke its own record, ferrying an extraordinary 44 tons to 73 schools and charities, with the heftiest deliveries going to 11 community super-hubs set up by councils as part of a pan-London effort to tackle food poverty in the wake of Covid-19.Felix, on its own, is now supplying more than 100,000 meals a day, up from 20,000 at the start of the outbreak. This is what some of the beneficiaries, volunteers and charities had to say.How to support our campaignFamily at high riskKaren Barnes suffers from type 1 diabetes, an underactive thyroid and chronic back pain, and is a carer for her son, Aidan, six, who has health issues that affect his immune system“We receive two boxes of Felix-supplied food a week, from Enfield Children and Young Persons Services, as my son and I are both categorised as high risk. We felt a bit hopeless about being in isolation. I don’t have much family and you don’t want to be a burden on other people. So these boxes are a lifeline. It’s exciting when they come as we’re on our own. The person who delivers them leaves them on my doorstep and we chat. It’s a nice interaction.Kim Pallas is a nurse working 12-hour shifts at Barnet Hospital. She picks up dozens of cooked meals to give to her colleagues, made each day by BreadnButter, a charity supplied by The Felix Project.“All the patients in our hospital ward are coronavirus patients so it’s been difficult – very emotional and overwhelming at times. You’re just so grateful when fresh, healthy food is put in front of you and you don’t have to think about doing all the cooking.“The support of the food charities is making a massive difference to people like us. To know people care enough about you to do this makes you feel that little bit stronger to cope with all that’s going on during the crisis. It makes you feel valued.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She struggles to make ends meet and has claimed universal credit since her husband died suddenly from lung cancer five months ago.“I collect food parcels from my children’s school in Enfield once a week. We are in a very hard situation. When my husband died, my life was turned upside down. I was alone but had to look after my 11-year-old son David and six-year-old daughter Ola. I work so I’m lucky, but life is expensive. Felix is a huge help and – now that we are in isolation – so important. We leave the house once a week to collect our parcel so it’s the best part of our week.”Justine, 38, is a mother-of-four who escaped an abusive relationship and lives in temporary housing, claiming universal credit.“I first heard about The Felix Project through my six-year-old son’s school and have been picking up weekly packages since the end of last year.“At the moment, we are in isolation and things are tough, but Felix is a lifeline. I have used food banks in the past but they do not provide fresh food. There are luxury items in my Felix boxes that I could never afford, like Innocent Smoothies and mozzarella cheese. Picking up our box from the school is a weekly highlight. I don’t know what we would do without it.”James Quayle is manager of North Paddington Food Bank: “Before coronavirus we were feeding 100 households per week but now we are supporting more than 600 families. We used to be open one day a week with The Felix Project delivering a single truckload of fresh produce, but since Covid we are open six days a week.We have increased our volunteers from a couple of dozen to almost 300 and I am working 14-hour days. The only other comparable thing was the start of the Syrian refugee crisis when I was on Lesbos and witnessed people coming off boats. Similarly, this feels like a tidal wave.”James Smart, 36, is a volunteer at Made up Kitchen. The Hackney-based project had been bringing various groups together for regular “community feasts”. It stepped up to the crisis by delivering around 500 nutritious meals each week to people in the area who are struggling financially, thanks to 12 crates of surplus food given by The Felix Project each week.Mr Smart – a chef and market trader who had been working at a cheese stall before it had to close – is now giving two days a week as one of half a dozen volunteers cooking and coordinating deliveries with Made up Kitchen.“Like a lot of people my own situation feels uncertain,” he said. “This crisis has hit almost everyone in one way or another, which is quite scary. But it’s great that so many people have been getting out and doing something that matters for their community. We’re doing as much as we can right now, but there’s a lot of people who will need help.”He added: “The Felix Project has been such a massive help. It’s so important they can operate on such a big scale across London because it makes so much of the work of smaller groups possible.”The Independent\u0026nbspis encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry across the country – find out how you can help\u0026nbsphere.

Building on successful pilots, we will be rolling out testing of asymptomatic residents and staff in care homes in England and to patients and staff in the NHS.This will mean anyone who is working and living in a care home will be able to have access to a test, whether they have symptoms or not.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

the\u0026nbspcommunity, rather than just hospitals.Professor John Newton, co-ordinator of the national testing effort, said studies had shown that the\u0026nbsppresence of symptoms was not really a

As we remember those who died, now is the time to commit to fight for the living.“When those whose workplaces have been closed begin to return to work, they deserve to know that they are doing so safely. There is an urgent need for the government to provide proper resources to save the lives of workers during the crisis and restore long-term funding so that all workplaces can be made safe.”The party also highlighted that there had been a fall in the number of prosecutions, pointing to reports the Health and Safety Executive helped secure 361 convictions in 2018-19 – a drop of 46 per cent from 2015-16.Sarah Albon, the chief executive of the Health and Safety Executive, added in a blogpost published on International Workers’ Day: “It’s significance for us, as the national workplace health and safety regulator, really can’t be overstated.“The opportunity to take a minute (even virtually), to reflect and to remember those who’ve died at or because of work is so valuable and a clear reminder of why the Health and Safety Executive exists.”A spokesperson for the Department for Work and Pensions – responsible for funding the body – said: “We spend around £130 million a year supporting the Health and Safety Executive to safeguard workplaces with integrity, professionalism and rigour – making Great Britain one of the safest places to work in the world.“HSE is playing a crucial role in the government’s response to Covid-19 and we will continue to work closely to ensure it has the resources it needs moving forward.”Health and Safety Executive\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

While that hardware received criticism and questions over its privacy and security when it was first released, it has seen something of a re-evaluation as lockdowns have come into effect, with many praising its built-in video calling.WhatsApp said that there are 15 billion minutes of WhatsApp video calls each day, which it said is well above a typical day before the pandemic.Any user can get the new expanded calls by downloading the latest version of the app on iPhone or Android.

Is raising taxes the wrong approach or the Governments only option One surprise of this crisis has been how easily Britons have accepted the lockdown . Some people seem to positively enjoy it.To some it brings back the spirit of the Blitz a feeling of solidarity. To others fewer cars and planes are an indication of the more green lestyle we ought to be living.Its good that people have managed to cope with these restrictions. But when polls indicate that many people would be prepared to put up with a y extension of the lockdown I begin to worry.An economic interruption of this kind carries massive costs and can only be borne for a limited period. Any extension will become extremely dficult for the economy to bear.The OBR, the Governments independent forecaster, floated the possibility of a fall in output of the economy of  per cent for the period April to June.That is beyond anything that has previously been imagined. It wasn’t a definite forecast butit happened the effects on jobs and living standards would be more than devastating.Some describe this economic crisis as the worst in modern times. It may be the worst ever. That doesn’t mean we cant recover. We can and we certainly will.But its important to be patient. Commentators talk about the economy bouncing back, a so called V shaped recovery.This seems unlikely The economy may bounce back but only up to a certain point not necessarily the same point as before. Some firms will have gone out of business, others will have run up debts, some have missed orders that aren’t repeated.How long all these problems last depends on the lockdown. The longer the lockdown, the deeper the downturn. So it is vitally urgent that the Government relax the lockdown as soon as the scientists feel that the peak of the epidemic has been flattened and that it is appropriate.This isn’t about choosing the economy or lives. A flattened economy costs lives too. Even when we relax the lockdown many will still be nervous and may not want to go out to spend money.The continuing need for social distancing will pose problems for hospitality and other businesses and hold back a full recovery. Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor has been bold, promising to do “whatever it takes” to steer the economy through these perilous waters.His scheme for furloughing jobs with the Government paying up to £ a month of peoples wages has helped to prevent firms getting rid of people that they could not afford But it is eye wateringly expensive with costs estimated at up to £billion.Clearly it cannot continue indefinitely. Ironically the generosity of the scheme may have anaesthetised the public to the scale of the crisis we are facing.Butthe Government lts some of the restrictions soon and the economy starts to recover , what should the Chancellor do in his Budget in November  Of course we don’t know exactly what the figures will look like and we must wait to see before final judgements.Almost certainly he will be confronting a massively reduced economy, groaning under skyscraping debt, higher unemployment and only a gradual recovery.Horric as the borrowing figures will be it would be a mistake to move quickly to reduce the debt before the recovery is firmly established.He should let borrowing take the strain in the short term. Any measures to rein in the deficit should be for later. In order to boost jobs he might cut National Insurance or make a temporary cut in VAT designed to bring forward spending.Keir Starmer gave a menacing hint of his approach when he said there would have to be “a day of reckoning” and hinted at tax increases on the better off as though they were to blame.That would be precisely the wrong approach. As the economy gets back to maybe  per cent of where it was before the Chancellor needs to do all he can to support business.He has recently given some generous help to new high tech start ups. Well and good, but it will be important to continue to support existing businesses.It should never be forgotten that firms that have failed in this crisis have not failed though any fault of their own. This down turn is not a normal recession caused by market forces, a rise in interest rates or overheating.No this recession and the bankruptcies have been caused by the Government’s measures rightly introduced to contain the virus. So the Government should not feel embarrassed about continuing some of their schemes to support inidual businesses and indeed they have a duty to do so.The Chancellor sets the framework but ultimately growth does not come from Governments, it comes from iniduals and firms. The way to growth and recovery is to give them the freedom and the incentives and the rest will follow.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers. The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM. No matter how little you can spare, please donate today here: www.thesun whocareswinsappeal.Raising taxes in the current climate is not something the Government is likely to want to do.But the scale of the economic crisis now gripping the UK means they may end up feeling they have little option.So far the Chancellor has done what he had to do to protect businesses and workers from enforced shutdowns. The cost will have to come from somewhere.It is estimated the furloughing scheme alone will cost at least £billion. At the same time, tax receipts have noseed as earnings have decreased and fewer people are spending in the shops.As a result, the Office for Budget Responsibility estimates that public- sector borrowing will increase by an eye-watering £billion above the earlier forecast.The black hole in the country’s finances left by Covid- means that at some point, the Chancellor is going to have to face the uncomfortable issue of whether taxes will go up.Any rises must be set against the need to ensure nothing chokes the ­economic recovery, which will be vital.We must also guard against hitting the most hard-up in society. And ­crucially, we need to ensure we don’t make it unprofitable for dynamic small companies to operate.One option for the Chancellor is to target the big multi-nationals and billionaires who use tax havens to avoid paying their fair share.Yet we will also need to have big business on our side as we try to recover, so it is a delicate balancing act.Our priority right now still has to be protecting the vulnerable and health workers from another Covid- outbreak.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.But it is time too for the Government to think seriously about how to restart the economy as quickly as possible.Two days ago came news that Jaguar and Aston Martin will restart production in May. The Chancellor needs to help other companies follow suit.The more successful he is, the likelier he will be able to limit the number of extra taxes he has to raise in the months ahead.We are backing a proposal by Lord Ashcroft to honour our health heroes with the gallantry gong given for acts of bravery that did not take place in battle.A No spokesman said: “The NHS is doing a fantastic job and the nation will want to find a way to say thank you when we have defeated this virus.” SAS hero Andy McNab added: “The award of a George Cross would show an emotional appreciation.”We are asking our readers to please sign the petition below.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Yet on the other side of the world, South Korea has witnessed nothing like the same devastation.To date, there have been just  deaths in the Asian nation, and only , cases - barely a tenth of the British total.While Britain remains in the grip of the storm, South Korea is already emerging from the darkness.What makes this phenomenal gap all the more remarkable is the country’s closeness to China, the initial global centre of the pandemic - which should have left South Korea - a country of  million people - far more vulnerable than Britain to the ravages of the disease.But the South Korean authorities took this seriously, through their prompt action and ruthless efficiency, they quickly managed to get the virus under control.On  February, there had been  new cases, but this daily figure fell dramatically in the subsequent two months, dropping to single digits last week.Amid all the gloom across the earth, South Korea’s astonishing success is a beacon the world.And its achievement is particularly impressive because the nation has not resorted to Chinese or European-style lockdowns.Most of the population has not been placed under effective house arrest, nor has the economy been put into a medically-induced coma.Under strict rules about social distancing, bars, cafes, shops and hotels have remained open.One British journalist based in Seoul, South Korea’s capital, told me that he even had to queue last week for a table at a restaurant in a fashionable district, something that would be unthinkable in Britain.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.

No matter how little you can spare, please donate today here: www.thesun whocareswinsappeal.Only a fortnight ago, elections were held for the country’s National Assembly, won overwhelmingly by the ruling Democratic Party.This week, restrictions on churches and gyms will be relaxed.From early May the South Korean football and baseball leagues will resume, though at first in empty venues.So how has South Korea avoided the kind of crisis that has gripped so many western countries, including our own What is the secret of its success  The answer can be found in a national strategy that combines social responsibility with organisational efficiency, governmental foresight, and sophisticated technology.At heart, South Korea has been better prepared than most.That is largely because the nation was badly shaken by the outbreaks of the respiratory syndromes SARS and MERS earlier in the century.Criticism of the Government’s mismanagement was especially strong after MERS in , which left  people dead.In the wake of this condemnation, testing capacity for a pandemic was drastically expanded, supplies of personal protective equipmentwere strengthened, hospitals were equipped with infection control units, and plans for nationwide information campaigns were put in place.So when the first Covid- deaths occurred in China in January, the South Korea state was ready to swing into action, guided by the principles of “test, trace and contain.”Immediately, a Coronavirus taskforce ordered the swt development of a practical diagnostic test that could identy people who had been infected.The job was completed with amazing efficiency.Within just a week, a reliable testing kit had been approved and put into production.There followed a huge programme of testing, often at the rate of , a day, carried out through a vast network  centres and  drive-through facilities.By March , while Britain was still struggling, South Korea had tested over , people.From the start, screening was also applied to all arrivals at Korean airports, including national citizens, something our own Government has never attempted until now.This testing regime was backed up by a huge effort both to trace all the contacts of those who test positive for Covid  and to alert the public to the presence of disease carriers.In this drive, South Korea has the advantage that its population has embraced online and mobile technology so eagerly.This is, after all, the land of mobile telecoms giant Samsung and computer colossus LG.Thanks to such sophistication, the movements of the infected can therefore be uncovered through phone records, GPS tracking, financial statements and CCTV images.This data enables the Korean Centre for Disease Control and Prevention to send text messages, in real time, to mobile users, telling them of any cases in their vicinity.The information also means that the contacts of carriers can be advised to take extra precautions or go into self-isolation.It is an ultra-modern approach that reflects South Korea’s culture.“Koreans are super-good at making things convenient for people. We don’t have any patience. South Korea is one of the most wired countries in the world, where everybody uses cell-phones for just about everything and the Government is able to use all our phones not only to track but to send warnings,” said Kee Park, a lecturer in public health at Hard in the USA.Some might argue all this hi-tech testing and tracing represents a worrying descent into the authoritarian world of Big Brother.But the level of intrusion should not be exaggerated.These text alerts do not reveal any inidual’s name and address, only their gender and age category.Moreover, “track and trace” technology is far less draconian that the European lockdowns.Nor is it correct to pretend that South Koreans are more submissive than westerners.In reality, the country has been a stable, pluralist democracy since .The public’s willingness to challenge the Government was graphically highlighted by huge mass protests held from October  to March  against President Park Geun-Hye over allegations of corruption.More than .million people took to the streets, eventually bringing about her impeachment and downfall.Far from being some downtrodden state, South Korea is more advanced than many parts of the west and this has further helped in the fight against the virus.Its health service is so well managed that it was ranked the best in the world in a  global study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development .There was never any danger of it being overwhelmed, as our own Government feared might happen to the NHS.Again, in contrast to the centralised bureaucracy of the NHS, the South Korean model is privately run, with  per cent of the population covered by compulsory national health insurance.The same spirit of efficiency can be seen right across the Korean infrastructure.Trains, buses and urban metro systems are renowned for their punctuality.Incheon airport, the country’s largest, was ranked the best in the world for  consecutive years from .A dynamic economy, with high levels of exports, ensures that the South Korean population is affluent and well-educated, with more than  per cent of young people going to university.But this prosperity is accompanied by widespread social responsibility, reflected in the strong work ethic and a lower crime rate than most industrialised nations.Respect for others is also shown in the universal willingness to wear face masks, not so much as a barrier against infection but as a means of preventing the spread of disease.A refusal to don one is seen as a social offence, just as Koreans use hand sanitisers everywhere and do not object to the heat sensors that exist in many office buildings to read their temperatures.It is not unusual for citizens to have their temperatures checked a dozen times a day.The climate of solidarity has helped South Korea come through the worst.Its experience provides a lesson to the rest of the world.As Jerome Kim, the Director of the International Vaccine Institute in Seoul puts, it, South Korean contained the virus “through decisive, transparent leadership based on data, not emotion.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

For every Peter Kay, who you want to see, there are three members of The Mash Report team, who you really don’t. There are also corporate sponsors to satisfy and a surprise appearance from Prince William, in a Blackadder spin-off sketch, with Stephen Fry, asking: “Have you seen anything good on TV ” .On the face of it then, it looked impossible to separate the wheat from all that celebrity chaff.In reality, though, it was surprisingly easy, because lockdown TV has already taught us song and dance can still work, even on Skype,the artists are as good as Dave Grohl and the others, who collaborated on Times Like These, or as talented and attractive as the Strictly professionals.Just as obviously, we’ve learned to rely on the internet for laughs this past month, because television comedy isn’t anywhere near funny enough to see us through a crisis. Thursday night wasn’t ever going to change that opinion, but it did highlight a ide.Eventhey were phoning in the performances, there were a group of comedians some viewers will have been excited to see, like Coogan, Brydon, Dawn French, Little Britain etc, who all had careers before . And there were a group of comedians who’ve been forced on us, since then, who aren’t comedians at all. At best, they’re pub-funny show-offs — at worst they’re political propagandists trying to bend us to their will.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.The contrast could not have been better illustrated by the segment where modern Mash Report types and old-school stand-ups were given about ten seconds to make us laugh and the only one who could nail it was Tim Vine, who appeared with a placard reading “Bad” and a punchline: “That’s not a good sign is it.”An actual punchline! On the BBC! It’s one of the many things that’s been missing from the network, for years, though I was glad long-suffering viewers didn’t punish TBNI for past failures. Thursday was hardly the time for mass recriminations.At some point in the future, though, someone has to try to explain to the BBC that we prefer comedians who make us laugh rather than tell us off, andthere was a reason why The Big Night In seemed less wearying and slightly more uplting than the usual Comic Relief slog then, beyond the extraordinary circumstances, it was a very obvious one.It only lasted three hours.

He’s not the only one on that show, either. There’s strong competition to be the biggest one from Bluto-ish oaf Tony Bellew, the former world cruiserweight boxing champion, who’s got an even shorter fuse than Fashanu.Both have already been called in for fairly urgent “questioning” by the SAS instructors who always hold the whip hand during these interrogations as, at the first hint of vanity, derangement, pretension or self-delusion, Ant Middleton can shout “GUARD!” and Billy bundles them off with a hood over their head.If it was just a hardman staring contest, of course, the show wouldn’t work. But it’s not. Sometimes the Special Forces team are staring at contestants like “YouTuber” Jack Maynard, trying to get their heads around what the hell it is he actually does for a living.“I will come up with some video idea and I direct, film, edit and present the thing myself.”Billy : “So you’re actually a smart f***er.”There are also emerging friendships, hidden tensions, a lot of honest endeavour and a simmering feud between Paralympian Lauren Steadman and Joey Essex, which erupts on next week’s show .SAS: Who Dares Wins will have to proceed, though, without Katie Price, who quit after a feeble two-day effort, and Anthea Turner, who tried getting all philosophical just before she threw in her armband. “I feel I am in what the Japanese call my second spring.”Fetch the hood, Billy.MEANWHILE, over on episode two of I’ll Get This, Jermaine Jenas says to Sara Pascoe: “I’ll be waiting for the comedian in you to come out.”So we’ll check up on him again in November .C’s SAS: Who Dares Wins.

Safeguarding Minister Victoria Atkins for seemingly not knowing about the pandemic preparedness test.He quizzed the minister on the project after The Suns revelation that a disaster plan report warned Britain was “critically” under-prepared for any deadly pandemic.NHS hospitals, local authorities and major Government departments were included in the operation that took place in October .Ministers were briefed on the results of Cygnus, which revealed that there were signicant gaps in the NHS “surge capacity” and included a shortage of personal protective equipment  and intensive care unit  beds.Asking Ms Atkins about it today, Piers said: You as a Government minister in charge of safeguarding appear to know nothing about it, is that right Are you familiar with Exercise Cygnus Ms Atkins tried to explain her focus was Home Office matters, only to be cut off.Mr Morgan pushed on: I know what your focus has been, you are a member of her Majesty’s Government, I’m simply askingyou’ve heard of Exercise Cygnus, yes or no The Tory MP again insisted it was not her area, saying: I am a Home Office Minister, I focus on my portfolio, these questions are about the science.Piers interrupted: It’s not about the science, you’re smiling again asthis all some big joke.With the greatest respect, the Government keeps sending out ministers like yourself who havent got a clue.Do you see how this looks to the viewers The Minister was unable to explain what the operation involved, despite the host repeatedly asking her to name just one part of it.A No spokesman said: “The NHS is doing a fantastic job and the nation will want to find a way to say thank you when we have defeated this virus.” SAS hero Andy McNab added: “The award of a George Cross would show an emotional appreciation.”We are asking our readers to please sign the petition below. Piers also challenged the minister on why Covid-’s threat level was downgraded on March , and accused Ms Atkins of laughing.The furious host responded: “You are a Government minister in charge of safeguarding, you can laugh, I don’t know why you all keep laughing at this, it’s not funny.”Ms Atkins dismissed the accusation, saying: “I did not, and I know you’ve accused another colleague of laughing.”An angry Piers insisted: “You literally just laughed, we’ve seen you laugh.“You downgraded this so you didn’t have a legal obligation to give our health workers the right amount of PPE kit, that is a demonstrable fact.”The GMB host has become notorious for his aggressive questioning of senior ministers throughout the crisis on the morning show.He has had furious rows so far with Helen Whately, Oliver Dowden, Matt Hancock and now Ms Atkins.But Government insiders say that private focus groups carried out by No aides on broadcast appearances reveal viewers take ministers’ side during them.Piers’s interrogations are seen by them as “unreasonable” and so sympathy for their argument soars.A Cabinet source said: “He doesn’t know it, but Piers is doing us a big favour.“Every time he gets shouty at ministers, the public generally takes their side.“That’s why we keep sending ministers on in front of

anxiety","story":"Research found the average adult got six hours and  minutes of sleep on a typical weekday night before the coronavirus pandemic.But a lack of school runs and commuting has seen the average adult getting around an hour of extra sleep each week – just under seven hours on each weeknight.And  per cent are regularly exceeding their recommended eight hours rest – up from just seven per cent before the lockdown.Despite this, nearly one in four admitted their quality of sleep is worse than ever as they are kept up by worries and the change in their routine.The study of , UK adults, commissioned by eve sleep, also revealed that snacking closer to bedtime and working later into the evenings are leading to a more disturbed night’s sleep.A fth are reading the news before bed, meaning they are unable to sleep as soundly as usual, while half are struggling to adapt to their new schedule.With routines currently suffering due to this new normal, eve sleep has partnered with sleep expert Dave Gibson to create a ‘Routine Calculator’ which provides expert-approved routines aiding better sleep, based on your wake-up time and age group.Cheryl Calverley, CMO at eve sleep said: “Routine is hugely influential on how we sleep – not just for how long but the quality of sleep itself.“Simply going to bed and waking up the same time every day can have a huge impact on how we feel the following morning, leaving us better able to deal with the anxiety and uncertainty we’re all facing.”The study also found  per cent are looking at screens closer to bedtime more now, which is causing them to have a worse night’s sleep.And nearly one in  are exercising later than before social distancing measures were introduced, while as many as  per cent are kept up worrying about coronavirus.As a result,  per cent have noticed their dream habits changing, with  per cent tossing and turning more in their sleep from their nocturnal adventures.More than one in  are even seeing their daytime worries continue into their dreams.The research, conducted via OnePoll, also revealed how this change in people’s sleeping patterns is impacting their daily lives for better and for worse.Nearly a fth are cooking more often and one in  are eating better, while  per cent are more willing to keep fit.In fact, one in four said they are exercising more than before, and it allows them to sleep for longer and go into a deeper sleep.Although  per cent are snacking more as a result of their current sleeping patterns, and  per cent are watching more TV.But there are certainly benefits to staying at home, as a fth said it allows them to take more time for themselves and ‘slow down’, and  per cent said they’re able to spend more time with family.The study also revealed the spots people are doing their work from, with nearly a fth working from their sofa and more than one in  working from their bed.It also emerged  per cent of parents said their children are going to bed later and  per cent said their kids are waking up later as well.Consequently,  per cent are worried about getting themselves and their family back into their old sleeping routines when le goes back to normal.Dave Gibson, founder of thesleepsite and sleep expert for eve sleep said: “Repetition, regularity, rituals and habits are all mechanisms which help to generate mental security and allow us to feel psychologically ‘safe’.“As stress levels remain high and we’re being pushed out of our ‘normal’ daily le, instilling a home routine is more important than ever for our sleep.”To receive The Suns

Next she would cut the fabric, which required signicant pressure and accuracy holding with her left hand and cutting with her right.“This task took up to three hours depending on the garment.“Normally she worked am to pm, but twice a year for two weeks she attended New York Fashion Week.“For a month beforehand her workload increased to up to  hours a day, seven days a week, without regular breaks or rest.“During these times her hands and wrists were so sore she needed painkillers to work.“Victoria Beckham Limited failed to put measures in place to look after Kristina and prevent this from happening.Natasha added: “Last year Kristina had an operation to relieve her carpal tunnel syndrome.CARPAL tunnel syndrome is a condition which affects the hands and fingers.There are several options for treatment but it can occasionally resolve itself.It stems from pressure on the median nerve in your wrist.This then causes numbness, tingling and sometimes pain in the hands and fingers.CTS affects women more than men but people of any age can develop it, although it is more common in middle-aged and elderly people.The NHS outlines the symptoms as:- An ache or pain in your fingers, hand or arm- Numb hands- Tingling or pins and needles- A weak thumb or dficulty grippingThese symptoms – which also include pain - can come and go, and are usually worse at night.People with CTS usually report symptoms being more pronounced in the thumb, index and middle finger, although the whole hand can be affected.An ache can sometimes extend up the arm and into the shoulder.Sometimes pregnancy can lead to the onset of CTS, and often the symptoms will clear up by themselves in a few months.CTS can be brought on by a repetitive movement or action, which could be caused by work, depending on what you do for a living.“She couldn’t work after the surgery she left her role as she was unable toto work.“She is still unable to work and has such a weak grip she needs help around the home to do basic tasks.“It is not known when,ever, she will be able toto a similar role, or any kind of employment.Mrs Beckham, we of football icon David, came under fire for furloughing  of her  staff despite her family’s £million fortune.This means the taxpayer is forking out for the multi-millionaire’s staff’s salaries.The -year-old has also said she will not take her salary during the coronavirus pandemic.Mrs Beckham founded her fashion label in  and she now has offices New York, Hong Kong and London – along with her flagship store in upmarket Mayfair.Her brand is now carried in more than  stores in  countries worldwide.

So can you please just do that for me today Mr Hancock ignored Intisars pleas for an apology, telling him: I think that it is very important that we are constantly learning how to do these things better, listening to the voices on the frontline is a very very important part of how we improve. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--APRIL--v.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--APRIL--v.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--APRIL--v.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--APRIL--v.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--APRIL--v.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--APRIL--v.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--APRIL--v.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--APRIL--v.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--APRIL--v.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--APRIL--v.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--APRIL--v.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--APRIL--v.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--APRIL--v.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--APRIL--.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--APRIL--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--APRIL--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--APRIL--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--APRIL--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--APRIL--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--APRIL--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--APRIL--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--APRIL--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--APRIL--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--APRIL--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--APRIL--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--APRIL--.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.   Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Her motto was: “Go hard and go early.”Ardern added: “We have the opportunity to do something no other country has achieved: elimination of the virus.“But it will continue to need a team of five million behind it.”Her tough stance echoed measures outlined in a groundbreaking Imperial College report, which gave results of epidemiologicial modelling in the absence of a Covid- vaccine.The college looked into the likely outcome of ious public health measures and found that without strict intervention, the bug could infect  per cent of the population.These included mitigation - slowing but not stopping the spread - and suppression, which aims to reverse the viruss growth.And today, New Zealand slackened its grip on its Covid- rules, allowing about , people toto work.Restaurants, including McDonalds, were able to offer diners takeaway meals, while construction, manufacturing and forestry businesses are allowed to operate under less stringent measures.New Zealand on Tuesday recorded just three new cases of the coronavirus, bringing its total to ,. There have been  deaths.Imperial College said that suppression, while successful in China and South Korea, carries with it enormous social and economic costs which may have signicant impact on health and wellbeing in the short and longer-term. Mitigation will never be able to completely protect those at risk from severe disease or death and the resulting mortality may therefore still be high. Instead we focus on feasibility.The college concluded that suppression is the only viable strategy at the current time, but the social and economic effects of the measures which are needed to achieve this policy goal will be profound.Our results suggest that population-wide social distancing applied to the population as a whole would have the largest impact.[This] in combination with other interventions – home isolation of cases and school and university closure – has the potential to suppress transmission below the threshold of R required to rapidly reduce case incidence.This R rating means the disease spreads at a stable rate, as one infected person is assumed to pass the bug on to just one other person.The college warned that doing anything less would result in hospitals being over-burdened with Covid- cases.So, rather than trying to flatten the curve by focusing on one major peak of infections, New Zealand has combated the disease by managing smaller outbreaks.Newsroom in New Zealand explains that the country no longer plans to manage the pandemic as a single wave, but to instead repeatedly snap stringent measures into place and reduce Covid- to a series of smaller waves.This change in attack was put down to Imperials groundbreaking scientic paper.Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield said: Our approach - and this is what successful countries have been doing - is you want to have a series of small peaks over a longer period of time.“And you amply up quite stringent controls to ensure that you dont exceed your health system capacity.Then as it goes down again, you can ease those and be prepared to ramp them up again.Aside from the science, Arderns leadership has won praise across the globe, for her empathetic and transparent approach.She, her ministers and public sector leaders have taken a  per cent pay cut for the next six months.Hours after New Zealand imposed a nationwide lockdown at the end of March, she took to Facebook, livestreaming in a sweater from bed, to “check in” on citizens and tell them of the day’s events.She said: “I thought I would jump online quickly and check in with everyone... as we all prepare to hunker down for a few weeks.A viewer posted in response: “This feels like the comfort of being tucked into bed at night by my mum. “Thanks for checking in with us.”And indeed the PM is a mum - she has also talked about spending time with family, and struggling with toilet training her daughter, who turns two in June.Dr Suze Wilson, leadership researcher at Massey Business School, in Palmerston North, said: Ardern is offering us a masterclass in crisis leadership.The PM has made clear the dangers we face, challenged us to make change and allowed space for concerns to be voiced so that they can addressed.She has regulated distress by providing a transparent framework for decision-making – the alert level framework – that allows people to make sense of what is happening and why.New Zealand has downgraded its alert level from four - complete lockdown - to three, which allows more freedom.Its expected to eventually wind its way down to level one, prepare, which means there will be no restrictions on gatherings.Minister of Civil Defence Peeni Henare said: “Since we went into lockdown most New Zealanders have done the right thing by following the rules and staying home. Getting this far has required a collective effort and we should be enormously proud of what we have achieved.New Zealands government also helped Kiwis to financially cope with the pandemic, during weeks of lockdown.Nearly  billion was allocated through the wage subsidy to protect the jobs of over a million working New Zealanders and keep them connected to their employers during the lockdown.Changes to the business tax system worth . billion helped boost cashflow, encouraged investment, and supported working from home.The Government also announced a suite of initiatives valued at  million, developed with the hard-hit media industry to help it get through the Covid- pandemic - and the severe drop in advertising revenue.And of course they tackled the issue of personal protective equipment early on - after its first case was reported on February .Minister for Health, Dr David Clark said on March : “Our frontline health care workers are doing incredibly important work on behalf of all New Zealanders. It’s vital they have access to the gear they need to stay safe.“Over the next month, the Ministry of Health will be supplying four million masks to the health sector and a further four million masks to non-health sector essential workers.“Face masks and other PPE are vital tools for our doctors, nurses and midwives, and other essential workers at this time.“We currently have more than  million masks in the national reserve held by the Ministry of Health and another . million held... with more on order from local and overseas manufacturers.Geography has also helped New Zealand, and with just five million people spread across an area the size of Britain, the cities aren’t overly crowded.Helen Petousis-Harris, a vaccine expert at the University of Auckland, said the country had managed to avoid the confusion and half-measures that have hampered the response in many other places.She said: “New Zealand got everything right.“Decisive action, with strong leadership and very clear communications to everybody.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This could lead to delays which can cause serious health problems, especially for conditions like chlamydia.Tracey Forsyth, lead contraceptive nurse at British Pregnancy Advisory Service, also revealed that women are routinely telling her they are struggling to access sexual health services.She told The Independent: It is very dficult to access contraception, sexual health and have smears at the moment. There were lots of cuts to services before this.We have rolled the clock back with sexual health by decades due to coronavirus and cuts.Ms Forsyth added: Places are worrying we will have a massive STI problem at the end of Covid-.Most people dont experience any symptoms, and dont realise they are infected.Symptoms can include pain or a burning sensation during sex, and an unusual discharge.Women might also experience pain in the lower abdomen during or after sex, and bleeding after sex.In men, chlamydia can also cause a pain or tenderness in the testicles.. HPVHuman papilloma virus , which causes genital warts, is the second most common STI here in Britain.The warts are usually painful, but may be itchy or red. Occasionally, they cause bleeding.HPV is spread by skin-to-skin contact, so you can catch it evenyou havent had penetrative sex - and condoms DONT provide complete protection.. GonorrhoeaGonorrhoea is a bacterial STI - which often has no symptoms.Symptoms include pain or a burning sensation during sex, and an unusual discharge.Less common symptoms in women include pain in the lower gut and bleeding between periods or after sex.In men, gonorrhoea can cause swelling in the foreskin and, in rare cases, pain in the testicles.. HerpesGenital herpes in a common infection caused by HSV virus, which also causes cold sores.The symptoms can develop a few days after contact and include small, painful blisters which itch or tingle - and can make it dficult to urinate.. SyphillisSyphilis is bacterial infection which causes painless - but highly infectious - sores on the genitals and around the mouth.Symptoms for the second stage of syphilis include a rash, flu-like illness and patchy hair loss - which will last for a few weeks.In the third stage, which occurs after several years, people with syphilis may experience heart problems, paralysis and blindness.Ms Forsyth, whose contraceptive team speaks to around  women a week via the phone, said disruption to STI treatment is a problem for both men and women and was a “timely public health issue”.People who have chlamydia and gonorrhoea, and the people they have had sex with, need to be treated, she added.And Ms Forsyth warned that the cuts to sexual health services could have an even more detrimental effect on womens health - with chlamydia having a longer-term risk of pelvic inflammatory disease, which can cause infertility.On top of this, women are concerned about not being able to get smear tests, which help to pick up early signs of cell changes in the cervix that can turn into cancer.Kate Sanger, the spokesperson for charity Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust, said the guidance from NHS England is to try to continue providing cervical screenings.But we know in some parts of the country, they have stopped sending out invitations for screenings or postponed them for the foreseeable future, she added.Provision is patchy. While there are some women who will want to go, some won’t be able to go because they are self-isolating.Sexual health charities urged the Government to tackle the rising number of STIs in the UK ahead of the coronavirus outbreak.A report by the Terrence Higgins Trust and British Association for Sexual Health  HIVreleased in February drew attention to the “unacceptably high” STI rates with a diagnosis every  seconds on average.In , there were , new diagnoses of STIs, which is an increase of five per cent from the year before.Despite this, Dr John McSorley, BASHH President, says they have seen a reduction in sexually transmitted infections diagnosed in clinics in the past month during lockdown.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.

Cases of syphilis are at levels not seen since World War Two. It is important that the Government fully supports ongoing open access to excellent sexual health services for everyone in the UK as we inch our way back towards normality.A happy healthy and fulfilling sex le is a really important cheap and cheerful way of putting a smile back on everyone’s face as summer approaches.If you think you may have an STI, the most important thing is to get tested and get medical advice quickly so you can start treatment.Doctors say you should call your GP or sexual health clinic - or the NHS says self-test kits for STIs are available online.If youre buying a self-test kit online, its important to be wary of the claims they make, as they may be misleading.Before using one, make sure the kit is sealed, without any damage to the packaging, and is within its expiry date.Check that the instructions for use are clear and easy to follow.You should also make sure it has a CE quality assurance mark - this means that, provided you use it correctly, the kit will work properly and is safe.If you think you need to see a doctor in an emergency, AE departments are still open, and doctors are urging people not to avoid seeking help in an emergency due to coronavirus fears.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The UK Government position hasnt changed.Not least because the most important thing people can do is the social distancing, as opposed to the weak science on face masks.And Angela McClean, the Chief Scientic Adviser for the Ministry of Defence, added: The recommendation from SAGE is completely clear, there is weak evidence of a small effect that a face masks can prevent a source of infection from somebody who is infected to the people around them.It comes after The Sun revealed last week that SAGEwas set to recommend Brits wear face masks in public places where people cant stay m apart.Ministers are still studying the findings and deciding whether to change advice across the whole of the UK.Downing Street insist that the UK-wide decision on masks had yet to be made, but hasnt said when it will be.A spokesperson said: SAGE’s review has been sent to ministers who are considering the advice that they have been given.Once a decision has been reached we will announce it publicly.Its believed that the decision may come alongside other tweaks to lockdown guidance.Former Chief Scientic Adviser, Sir David King told Sky News earlier: If I were moving to control the spread of the epidemic, I would wish to see everyone outdoors, in particular going shopping, wearing a face mask.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.

Do not buy more than you need.Despite this, Public Health England say that there is currently no evidence that he p-a-pill “sunshine vitamin” reduces the risk of coronavirus.Commenting on the advice, Dr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at PHE said: With the nation staying in to save lives and protect the NHS, many people are spending more time indoors and may not get all the vitamin D they need from sunlight.To protect their bone and muscle health, they should consider taking a daily supplement containing  micrograms of vitamin D - there is no sufficient evidence to support recommending vitamin D for reducing the risk of Covid-.PHE has previously recommended everyone should take a ten microgram supplement of vitamin D during the autumn and winter months, thereports.Although they are very safe, taking more than the recommended amount every day can be dangerous in the long run.Below are the recommended daily doses depending on age:More sunshine in spring and summer meant this was no longer necessary for most people but this has been updated to recommend everyone should continue taking it.Scientists will soon be investigating whether vitamin D can help coronavirus patients fight coronavirus.A research team from the University of Granada in Spain is to run a ten-week trial involving  Covid- patients to establishtaking the sunshine vitamin can help fight the illness.The scientists say a lack of vitamin D in calves is thought to have been the main cause of bovine coronavirus infections in the past.The study aims to investigate whether the “use of vitamin D induces signicant improvements of health... as well as preventing health deterioration”.Dr Jenna Macciochi, of the University of Sussex, said: “If you are deficient in vitamin D, you are three to four times more likely to catch a cold.“It therefore makes sense a viral respiratory infection like Covid- would be worseyou were vitamin D-deficient.”Vitamin D is vital to help your body absorb calcium as well as strengthening the immune system.It is found in:Studies show around one in five adults are thought to be lacking in the “sunshine vitamin”, but  per cent ignore Government prompts to take a supplement.The body makes vitamin D when exposed to sunlight – so those in cooler and less sunny climates, like the UK, have a higher risk of being vitamin D deficient.People with darker skin need more sunlight than those with pale skin to generate enough vitamin D.The most obvious places to buy vitamin D tablets and supplements is at pharmacies and supermarkets.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Speaking just hours after he did not apologise to the the relative of a frontline NHS worker who campaigned for more PPE, the Health Secretary branded a call for an apology to those who had lost loved ones in care homes as unreasonable. A total , people have died from coronavirus in care homes since the start of the pandemic. Askedtesting was inadequate andhe intended to apologise Mr Hancock said the Government had not left people unprotected. Askedhe would apologise to the families of care home residents who had died because the Government hadnapost properly protected them, Mr Hancock said: I think thataposs unreasonable as a question actually He insisted: Care homes have been a top priority right from the start. But yesterday he announced that testing will finally be made available to all care home residents and staff in England, including those with no symptoms. He also announced that the Government would include the number of deaths in care homes and the community in its daily figures, in an effort to bring as much transparency as possible to the data, after this demand was made by industry watchdog Care England. It came just hours after Mr Hancock was confronted live on air today by the son of a doctor who died after pleading for PPE.Dr Abdul Mabud Chowdhury warned the government about the lack of personal protective equipmentfor NHS staff days before his death on April . The -year-old consultant urologist is one of more than  NHS and social care workers who died after contracting coronavirus.Today his son Intisar called for the Health Secretary to make a public apology during a phone-in on LBC Radio. In a damning confrontation, Intisar said: When [my father] was unwell he wrote an open letter to the Prime Minister appealing for more PPE for NHS frontline workers. It was a request that was ignored. Two weeks later he passed away. And since then over  NHS and social care workers have passed away from contracting the virus. Do you regret not taking my dadaposs concerns, my -year-old sister dadaposs concerns and my weaposs husbandaposs concerns seriously enough for my dad that weaposve all lost  The Health Secretary appeared briefly lost for words before he replied: Intisar, Iaposm really sorry about your dadaposs death. I have seen the comments youaposve made and what youaposve said in public and I think itaposs very brave of you to be speaking out in public.  We took very very seriously what your father said and weaposve been working around the clock to ensure that thereaposs enough protective equipment and in the case of anybody who works in the NHS or in social care and has died from coronavirus we look into it in each case to find out the reasons where they might have caught it and what lessons we can learn. He added the government was constantly looking and learning and it was a very complicated logistical effort. But Intisar said he simply wanted the Health Secretary to acknowledge mistakes were made. He told the Health Secretary: Mr Hancock, the public is not expecting the government t handle this perfectly. None of us are expecting perfection - weaposre expecting progression.We just want you to openly acknowledge that there have been mistakes in handling the virus. Itaposs actually for me and so many families whoaposve lost so many loved ones as a result of this virus, and probably as a result of the government not handling it seriously. Openly acknowledging a mistake is not an admission of guilt. Itaposs genuinely just making you more human.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock set out his plans for easier, faster and simpler testing so more people can access a Covid- test to tellthey currently have the virus. At the daily Downing Street briefing, Mr Hancock said the capacity for carrying out tests was now ahead of our plans, with the ability to carry out more than , tests a day. But he still faces a huge hurdle to climb to reach his , target - almost double current levels - in a weekaposs time. Because capacity has now increased so substantially, we are now able to expand who can get the tests, he said.Our ultimate goal is that everyone who could benefit from a test gets a test. Mr Hancock said: Itaposs all part of getting Britain back on her feet. But you may have to drive for a -minute round trip to get a test and there could be heavy demand on new kits to be posted to your home. Hereaposs who is eligible and how the system will work. Who is eligible for a test  As the UK extends its testing capacity a growing list of people are eligible to be tested. So in addition to any worker who the government deems as essential, and any members of their family, the any worker who has to leave their home is now also eligible to be tested. This includes thousands of construction workers, delivery drivers and others. In the UK there are around million people classed as essential workers but their households will also be eligible under the scheme. NHS staff and care home workers are already being referred for testing by their workplaces. And they will now be able be tested eventhey are not showing symptoms. But who is essential  It it the same list of occupations used by the government to determine whether or not you can continue to send your children to school during lockdown. Key workers on the list are the same as those for access to schools, and include NHS and social care workers, police officers, teachers, social workers, those in the justice system, undertakers, some in local government, supermarket and food production workers, journalists, transport workers and some people in utilities and IT. A full list is below or on this web page. How sick do you have to be   You need to show symptoms in order to be tested, unless you work in a care home of for the NHS. The main two are a new and persistent dry cough and a temperature. But other people who have tested positive for covid- include losing taste and a sense of smell.    It will showyou currently have Covid-. This is useful to proveyour symptoms are actually the virus. It does not showyouaposve had Covid- in the past. It will help people work out when they and their household members canto work safely. Where do I log on to book a test  Visit the governmentaposs web page. Where do I go to get tested     The first port of call is a drive-through testing centre -  of which are currently open, with  promised by the end of April. The government expects you to be able to drive for up to  minutes from your home to get to a drive-through site, leaving some with potentially a -minute round trip. WhatI canapost drive     For those who donapost live near enough to a testing site or canapost drive there are other options. The government has pledged that Royal Mail and Amazon will deliver home testing kits for the first time from Friday. The availability of these will be limited at first, at just , per day. Officials hope for this to scale up to , a day by the end of April. What about other ways of getting tested  Meanwhile apossatelliteapos test kits are also being sent directly to care homes to enable residents with symptoms to be tested. And the Army is helping set up mobile testing units which will travel the country to places like care homes, police stations and prisons. Itaposs not clear how these will help workers without a mobile unit or satellite kit at their place of work. How long will I wait for results     Test results from the drive-through sites will be sent out by text within  hours, the government says. For home delivery tests, the waiting time is  hours. Itaposs not clear how quickly a test will be booked in once youaposve asked for it - presumably it depends on demand. Why are essential workers getting tested  The aim is simple - to ensure they can get back to work. Because the test showsyou currently have Covid-, it also can given an indication that your cough is just a  alarm. So people whoaposve been self-isolating to protect others due to a mild cough can get back on the front line. Whataposs it like getting the test   The test involves taking a swab  of the nose and throat - and it goes back pretty far, so be prepared. A single swab is used to collect a liquid sample from the back of your throat and your nose. This swab is then placed into a sample tube and securely packaged, where it is sent to the lab for testing. Depending on where you get tested, you will either have a clinician take your swab or be asked to do it yourself.

The UK government has relied for the most part on people taking flights with commercial airlines to get home, commissioning a smaller number of its own flights to help people get home than many other European countries. Ms Nandy has called on the government to rapidly scale up the number of flight it is chartering to get people home - and to publish statistics on the number of Britons who arenapost yet home on a daily basis. She warned that the current system had left families at the mercy of cancelled flights, airline strikes, extortionate prices, domestic lockdowns and chaotic booking systems. She added: It is now five weeks since lockdown began in the UK, and over three months since the World Health Organisation declared this a global health emergency. While I note your department does not have an estimate of the number of British citizens still stranded overseas, my office is currently in contact with , British citizens stranded in  dferent countries and it is estimated there are hundreds of thousands of British citizens who remain stranded overseas. The Shadow Foreign Secretary said that around the world, many governments have been far more successful than we have. For example, it has been almost two weeks since Germany repatriated the last of its , citizens from New Zealand using twenty-six charter flights arranged by their government. By contrast only  Britons have ed from the country and the first UK charter flight from New Zealand only departed this week, she added. Some estimates put the number of Brits struggling to get home as high  as ,. Countries like France and Germany relied much more heavily on chartered flights - meaning citizens got home quicker but at a much higher cost. The Government has defended its policies focus on using commercial flights to get Brits home. At the end of March, Dominic Raab said that he had struck as £ million deal with British airlines to help those still stranded around the world.  But last week, the top civil servant at the Foreign Office told MPs that while many Brits were now home it would take several weeks for the government to help those looking toto the UK. Sir Simon McDonald, who is Head of the Diplomatic Service, told MPs that an estimated . million UK citizens were abroad at the time of the crisis and that . million were now home thanks to mostly commercial flights. He said the strategy of relying on airlines where they could was the best use of taxpayers cash and helped the government direct support.

But with other European countries beginning to relax their rules, calls are growing for the government to spell out how it will eventually be relaxed. Tory MPs have piled on pressure to save the economy - while Scotland and Wales have tightened the screws by pushing ahead and saying what will happen next. For all the argument and debate, we still donapost have a date when lockdown will be relaxed. And we know it wonapost actually end - it will just be eased bit by bit. But we have ious clues and leaked details which point to how that might happen. Weaposll relax lockdown once the infection rate is low enough, and then use a test, trace, track strategy with an NHS app to keep it low. Hereaposs everything we know about how lockdown will be relaxed, but why we must also get used to a aposnew normalapos that looks dferent to the UK we knew before.How long is the UKaposs coronavirus lockdown  The lockdown expires on May  - six weeks after it began. But thataposs just the legal date it has to be reviewed by. Emergency lockdown powers in the Health Protection Regulations  must be formally reviewed every three weeks. In reality the government will renew the lockdown for longer, at least partly. The question is how much of it will be extended, and for how long.  When will the UK lockdown end - and how  The UK lockdown will start to be relaxed once five tests are met:The NHS is able to cope A sustained fall in deaths New infections dropping enough Adequate testing and PPE No risk of a second peakBut once it is eased it wonapost all happen in one go. Instead the lockdown is set to be relaxed in phases while some social distancing measures stay in place. So while the strictest restrictions should start to ease this summer, some measures look set to be in place until next year. Stand-in PM Dominic Raab adds we might see restrictions tighten in some ways and loosen in others. How will the government decide itaposs time to relax the lockdown  The UK government will have to fulfil all five testson ending the lockdown. Downing Street adds the key test will be how far and fast the infection rate drops. aposRapos - the number of people each carrier infects - is already below , which stops Covid- spreading exponentially. But Health Secretary Matt Hancock has warned it wouldn’t take much to lose that grip. Any change to the restrictions must not risk the aposRapos number going above .So how will we know when thataposs happened  The key piece of evidence will be a study by the Office for National Statistics on the infection rate - expected to be published in early May. That could be crucial in deciding what the government does next. Despite pleas from Tory MPs, Downing Street insists the decision will be based on science before the economy. Boris Johnsonaposs spokesman said: We will have to take decisions based on the best available scientic and health advice. it’s not going to be a case of choosing between the economy and public health.”Will lockdown be relaxed before May   Government sources said there would likely be more details spelt out before May . But officials later insisted that wouldnapost actually mean a clear exit plan - it more means an update on the infection rate. The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman told a Westminster briefing: Weaposve set out that we will review social distancing measures by May . The Government is focused upon that date. Once lockdown is relaxed, what happens then  If the virus spikes again, lockdown could have tomultiple times with little notice. So the plan is to stop that happening with a three pronged strategy - test, trace and track. The government is hiring , human contact tracers and will encourage people to download an NHS app. Put together, the system should noty people when theyaposve been in contact with a Covid- carrier - so they can immediately isolate and stop it spreading further. But there are concerns about how well it will work. The NHS says the app will be launched in the coming weeks. It will use Bluetooth to log each time your phone moves near another personaposs phone with the app. If one of those people is later diagnosed with Covid-, you would get an alert warning you to get tested and self-isolated.  What will reopen first and what will stay shut  The UK government has refused to say officially - and thereaposs not yet a firm decision. But plenty of speculation has been leaked. And we can also pick up clues from Scotland and Wales, which have been more open about their plans. Schools and some non-essential shops seem very likely to reopen first, with modied layouts to ensure people can stay two metres apart. But hairdressers and nail bars could remain shut for six months, sources told The Sun. Working from home could become the new normal until thereaposs a vaccine, government advisors have said. And UK and Scottish ministers have warned pubs and mass gatherings could be among the last to reopen. PM Boris Johnsonaposs spokesman said: There will be judgments based on scientic and health advice of what is possible without increasing the risk of a second peak.” That could have to mean extending the aposfurloughapos scheme for staff to get up to % of their pay while out of work. The scheme currently expires in June but No will continue to keep it under review. It’s our intention to stand by both workers and businesses, a spokesman said.  Will some people be let out earlier than others  Itaposs possible. The government has looked at an idea of loosening restrictions on younger, healthier people first in order to get the economy moving again. And people could meet small bubbles of wider friends and family under one idea being looked at in Scotland. If that idea does happen, youaposd have to pick the same small aposbubbleapos of people to meet day-to-day, week-to-week - and carry on staying away from everyone . None of you would be able to go outside your aposbubbleapos.  Will people have to wear face masks  Itaposs not clear yet. Ministers are considering how to act on advice from the governmentaposs scientic advisors SAGE. The group decided there is weak evidence of a small effect in which a face mask can prevent someone whoaposs already infected, infecting those around them. Scotland has advised its residents to wear face coverings, either a mask or improvised facial shield such as a scarf, in limited circumstances in public when they have to be in close quarters with others. This is not mandatory. Why have Scotland and Wales got dferent plans - and what does it mean  Deep splits have opened up in the strategy across the UK. Wales and Scotland are both pushing ahead with telling the public what post-lockdown might look like, but the UK government refuses to say. So far, the actual plans remain pretty similar in each country - in fact, Matt Hancock has said Scotlandaposs plan is pretty similar to what heaposs been looking at. Itaposs just the communication with the public that has been split. But that risks changing as Wales and Scotlandaposs chiefs - who sit on crucial COBRA meetings about the lockdown - pile pressure on Boris Johnson and have powers over places like schools and care homes. The split forced the Health Secretary to plead for unity, saying: So far we have moved as one United Kingdom and I think that has been a very good thing. My preference is that we work together as one country. A Downing Street spokesman warned the nations: I’m sure they like us will be guided by the science - and won’t want to do anything that could risk a second peak”. Whataposs happening in Scotland  Scotlandaposs First Minister set out a -page blueprint for easing the lockdown. Nicola Sturgeon said businesses might be able to reopenthey can keep customers and staff  metres apart. The same would have to be in place in schools with modications needed in some classrooms. But pubs and mass gatherings would likely have to remain closed for longer. Despite spelling out an exit strategy, Ms Sturgeon warned normal as we knew it is not on the cards in the near future. Nicola Sturgeon said lting the lockdown is not a flick of the switch moment but more of a gradual change to the current conditions. No insisted Scotlandaposs plan was actually pretty similar to its own in terms of what needs to happen before lockdown ends.  Whataposs happening in Wales  Walesapos First Minister Mark Drakeford said lockdown could be left in three phases, like a traffic light in reverse. The red phase would see only the most careful and controlled lting of restrictions, amber would see more restrictions lted andthe virus does not re-emerge, Wales could move to the green zone. But he believed that UK ministers were nervous about entering into a similar conversation with the public for fear it would undermine the message to stay at home. The Welsh Government will also need seven questions to be answered before easing the lockdown. They are:Would easing a restriction have a negative effect on containing the virus  Does a particular measure pose a low risk of further infection  How can it be monitored and enforced  Can it be reversed quicklyit creates unintended consequences  Does it have a positive economic benefit  Does it have a positive impact on people’s wellbeing  Does it have a positive impact on equality "},{"url":null,"title":"5 physical symptoms anxiety can","story":"NewsThese  physical symptoms of anxiety can easily be mistaken for coronavirusWith the coronavirus UK death toll now exceeding ,, its understood anxiety is also on the rise but doctors are trying to help people copeShareCommentsByBradley JollyDigital journalist:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video coronavirus-facemask-help-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news -physical-symptoms-anxiety-can-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

With the death toll of those with Covid- on the sharp rise again in the UK today, doctors say it is unsurprisingwe feel particularly anxious at the moment.But some symptoms of anxiety are physical ones, unlike psychological symptoms which largely affect our mind. Tightness in the chest and shortness of breath are telltale signs of anxiety - but can also be symptoms of coronavirus. Dr Sarah Jarvis, clinical director of Patientaccess, said: Some of the symptoms of anxiety and panic attacks – feeling short of breath, palpitations, dizziness etc – are sometimes also seen in coronavirus. The doctor, though, suggested ways to tell that itaposs definitely anxiety and not coronavirus. . Shortness of breath Dr Jarvis said people take a few minutes to check in with themselves and try to steady their breathing. The symptoms of panic attacks tend to settleyou concentrate on your breathing and take very slow breaths, she added. Try tummy breathing - put one hand on your chest and the other on your tummy. You should aim to breathe quietly by moving your tummy with your chest moving very little. If you were able to calm yourself down and find a steady breathing pattern within those few minutes, you may not be dealing with coronavirus. But the World Health Organisationsaysyou have coronavirus your chest may begin to feel tight or you begin to feel as though you cannot breathe deeply enough to get a good breath. Shortness of breath associated with the Covid- infection is progressive in nature and can become le-threatening over a period of hours to days without medical care. - - - - - - - - ,- - ,+ - ,  . Problems with digestion Stomach pains, constipation and diarrhoea are signs of anxiety, doctors say. This is largely because the communication system between your brain and the enteric nervous system, which governs your digestion, is affected by stress. Of course, eating foods that don’t agree with you or not exercising can affect your digestion too. However, researchers recently studied data from  patients with Covid- in China’s Hubei province and discovered that . per cent of these patients arrived at the hospital with digestive symptoms such as diarrhoea, vomiting or abdominal pain. These symptoms, though, were usually accompanied by more typical signs such as a dry cough and high temperature. Therefore,you are only experiencing digestive issues it is unlikely to be coronavirus.  . Increased heart rate An increased heart rate is a classic sign of anxiety, according to the National Institute of Mental Health . Adrenal glands churn out hormones when you are faced when something stressful. So, receptors in your heart react by speeding up your heartbeat as a result. This lets you to pump more blood to your big muscles so you could theoretically flee or combat a threat. However, a racing heart rate can also signal coronavirus, doctors suggest. Dr As Munaf, an NHS consultant, said an elevated heart and breathing rates could indicate “you’ve potentially got signs of an infection, which in this climate could be Covid-”. If itaposs an anxiety attack, your heart rate should settleyou concentrate on your breathing and take very slow breaths. However,itaposs coronavirus your heart rate is likely to remain fast - especially during any form of exercise or movement.  . Muscle pain Your muscles tense up as part of your stress responseyou are suffering from anxiety. Many people with anxiety report feeling tight in their neck, back, or shoulders. But, likewise, some coronavirus patients report muscle soreness across their body. According to WHO, about  per cent of all Covid- patients experienced body aches or joint pain. These aches are triggered by chemicals called cytokines - which the body releases while responding to the infection. Muscle pains in coronavirus patients, though, are usually accompanied by other more well-known symptoms. If you are worried about your symptoms, you can ring  for the NHSapos dedicated service. To protect others, do not go to places like a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital.

Martin Addy, emeritus professor of dentistry at the University of Bristol, said toothpaste can reduce the chances of catching or spreading the disease through the mouth. However, he warned that the antimicrobial effect of toothpaste only lasts from three to five hours. He therefore suggested Brits brush their teeth before going outside to ensure the effect is active should they come into contact with other people. In a letter in yesterdayaposs Times, Mr Addy, wrote: Scientists, in support of mouth and nasal coverings, have emphasised the role of saliva droplets in the spread of Covid-. Follow our live blog for the latest updates about coronavirus It is perhaps surprising, therefore, that toothbrushing with toothpaste has not been emphasised as an effective procedure.Toothpaste contains the same detergents as those found in handwash gels recommended against coronavirus.Indeed, the antimicrobial action of toothpaste in the mouth persists for three to five hours and, thereby, would reduce the viral load in saliva or infection by viruses entering the mouth. Mr Addy said people wanting to maximise the preventative effects could brush their teeth just before leaving the house. He added: As a large proportion of our population is in lockdown, one of the brushings could be immediately before leaving home for exercise, shopping etc. For those workers in the NHS, brushing should be before putting on protective equipment.

Seven-year-old Leo and Havana, five, were the most important things he and we Maureen had in the world. Eric had been fit and healthy before falling ill with bowel cancer aged just . Three months later he tragically passed away. But in his final days, he shared a last wish he hoped would bring happiness to his grieving family when he was gone - and now his widow has made that a reality. Speaking bravely to The Mirror today on the first anniversary of Eric’s death, Maureen recalled: “When we knew that his diagnosis was terminal we talked about the children and things that we could do to make things a little better for them and help them with their grieving...which included getting a pet.”  Following her husband’s passing, Maureen, , went online and found two perfect cats called Betty and Ethel who were looking for a loving home. Maureen, who recently moved from Chester to live in London, recalled: “The owners were happy for me to come to collect the cats with the children on what would have been my husband’s th birthday.  “So I picked them up from school and told them that papa had a special present for them, the biggest present theyaposve ever had because he loves them so much and wants them to be happy. I also wanted to make his birthday a happy occasion for the children.  “When I introduced them to the cats they were very surprised, shocked. They couldn’t believe it. “Now Betty and Ethel are part of our family and of our new chapter. The children adore them. They love it when the cats come to sleep in their beds. They love stroking them, giving them treats and playing with them. Also it’s nice to have a full house again.  “My husband worked from home so it felt very empty when he passed away. It was also nice in the evenings to chill with the cats when the kids go to bed.”  Maureen has bravely shared her story as part of IAMSapos latest campaign celebrating the magic of pets and the iniduality of each animal.   IAMS champion the joy of your pet’s healthy vitality. The joy of healthy vitality is not simply visible health or your cat or dog’s happiness it is a powerful combination of the two together. And that’s why IAMS want to help the nation’s pets live healthy, active and happy lives through the expert nutrition they truly enjoy. No compromise. An incredible % of cat owners recommend IAMS for Vitality*, which provides a complete and balanced diet for your pet. IAMS promises high quality nutrition with a great taste for healthy vitality.  Maureen said Betty and Ethel have had an incredible impact on her family - and agreed each and every pet has its own unique personality. She added: “their personalities are very dferent. Ethel is more socialable. She loves to be in the mix and doesnapost mindthe kids pick her up. She tends to follow us around more and is always at the door when we come home. Betty is quieter and more timid. She also loves to chill out with us but is more adventurous when she goes out.  “They both love dry and wet food - gravy-based specically. We also give them cat treats.

She wears the historical stunning sapphire and diamond piece, which used to belong to Princess Diana, whenever sheaposs out in public alongside her wedding and eternity bands. But there is another ring which Kate occasionaly wears which is also extremely special to her - and it was a very romantic gt from William when they were dating. She wore it to their graduation, a nod to the next stage of her le as she stepped up her role as a future member of the Royal Family. Eddie LeVian, CEO of LeVian jewellers, spoke of the huge signicance of the simple silver ring, which the prince gave to Kate while they were students at St Andrewaposs University.  He told the Express : This beautul, delicate ring is understated in style, but the very personal message hidden within it from a future King makes it an enormously romantic royal jewel.The ring is a rose gold band with pearls and garnets - Kate and Williamaposs birthstones.  She famously wore it to their graduation ceremony, which was attended by Prince Charles as well as the Middleton family. Mr LeVian said: It’s no surprise Kate was seen wearing it at her graduation. This was a milestone marking her own achievements but also a day which put her on the threshold of a new chapter in her le together with William beyond university. The ring is adorned with both Kate and William’s birthstones, in a celebration of their bond and the beginning of their intertwined destiny. Kate and Wills went through two painful breakups during their seven-year courtship, earning Kate the unflattering nickname aposWaity Katieapos. But on October ,  - almost a decade after they first met - Wills finally got down on one knee and asked Kate to be his we. And the proposal was just as romantic as you would expect from a prince, and he whisked her off to Kenya to pop the question.

And minutes later, Sian found her daughter wandering around their home in Hawarden, north Wales, with clumps of long, blonde locks falling from her head. My daughter is absolutely doggy obsessed and she loves to help me but the dogs didn’t enjoy her brushing them so I gave her a bowl of treats to feed to the dogs to distract them while I brushed, Mrs Coombs said today. She was doing a great job and by feeding the treats to the puppies, she kept them distracted and it kept her entertained too - so all was going well. I just assumed she’d gone to join her other siblings watching TV or something. But she ed moments later holding the dog clippers in her hand, and as soon as I spotted her holding them, I leapt to get them off her but then noticed what she had done. Mrs Coombs , who is also mum to Thomas , Amara , Henry seven, and five-year-old Percy, panicked as she realised Sariah managed to shave a whole patch down the middle of her head.  She said: The hair was still sort of stuck to her head, but as I began touching it, clumps came away in my hand and I could see what had happened. Sariah’s first reaction was to say mummy did it as Sian was left standing with clumps of her daughter’s hair in her hands. Despite her initial reaction being gobsmacked, Sian said in hindsight she is relieved her toddler didnapost take the clippers to one of the dogs as they have a litter of seven-week-old puppies in the house.  She said: My first instinct was of course one of horror, but I saw the big smile on her face change into an anxious expression when she saw my face so I quickly realised I needed to hide my own feelings to protect her. She’s still breastfed so immediately upon realising there was a problem she asked for ‘bobos’ so I just fed her to calm her down, and give me time to gather my thoughts a little. I didn’t show her the result of her hair until a little while later but she just laughed when she saw herself in the mirror which I was relieved about.  Describing her little one as absolutely full of le, Sian said her cheeky little girl is into everything at the moment. She said: She copies me with every task I do and she’s very bright. I don’t think there’s much in my house that she doesn’t know where it belongs or how it works. She notices everything and just loves to join in and help out. Just days earlier, Mrs Coombs said she had spotted Sariah checking all of the puppies with a stethoscope - so she is glad she didn’t decide to give them all a haircut. The mother said it was also heartwarming to see how none of the other children seemed to mind about their youngest sibling’s new hair-do.  Mrs Coombs added: My children didn’t say much to be honest. They don’t really care what her hair is like, they just love her for who she is regardless of anything . They all immediately went out onto the trampoline and played together like nothing had happened. My eldest was probably the most shocked, my teenage daughter just thought it was funny and the younger boys have barely mentioned it. However, Mrs Coombs admitted that her husband, Paul, did questionshe was joking when she messaged him to tell him the news. She said: He feels the same as me. We just love her to bits and want her to be happy, nothing  matters. These things happen in le sometimes.  Sian said she considered shaving off the rest of Sariah’s hair, but has decided to leave it after reaching out for some advice. She added: I messaged my hairdresser and a few hairdresser friends who all told me to leave it be. I also asked Sariah and she got upset at the thought of having the rest shaved. My only concern now is to protect her feelings. She doesn’t want it cutting so I won’t. I just want her to feel happy and not worry about it so we’re not making an issue of it.

The global coronavirus pandemic is not just affecting people’s physical health. The anxiety, stress and uncertainty of it – and the sweeping changes we’re having to make to our lestyles – are also having an impact on people’s mental health too. If it’s making you feel that way, then you’re not alone. It’s quite normal to feel this way in such a dficult and unpredictable situation. Here are some tips and strategies recommended by our BACP members to help you cope with the mental health impacts of the current global situation. Keep a routine Many people are working from home for the first time in their lives, and some will now be juggling a full-time job and home-schooling their children. Plus, there are people whose usual activities have been curtailed by self-isolation. Our member Vasia Toxavidi says keeping a routine can be really important. “Without a routine, negative thinking and anxiety can escalate. I would suggest that people create a day to day plan of things they will need to do e.g. create a morning exercise programme, work from homepossible, cook something dferent, get into an online course.” Think about restricting access to news media and social media Many of our members recommend having a think about how and when you access the news or social media. This may involve choosing news sources you trust – and avoiding social media channels filled with speculation. Stick to the official government guidance and NHS advice websites. Or limit your access to the news to a certain time of the day. “Some people can be quite paralysed by this anxiety and may want to completely stop interacting with the news,” says Elizabeth Turp.  Keep connected with friends and family In our new world of self-isolation and social distancing, we can’t meet up with family and friends like we used to. But keeping connected to them is vital. Melani Halacre recommends “connecting online with friends and talking about other stuff, inventing new fun ways to connect. An online pub quiz among friends...learn a dance routine at home then share it  Play games online  Cook the same recipe in your own home whilst online ” Be present Emma Brand recommends ‘being present.’ “Take a breath and really experience where you are and how you are feeling. To take in your surroundings and thank the space environment and people in your space - to actively be grateful is very powerful,” she says. Practise gratitude Hansa Pankhania also recommends being grateful for what you have, instead of what you do not. And Natasha Page recommends keeping a gratitude diary, where you write down three things you are grateful for every day. She adds: These can be small things such as the sun shining, hearing your child laugh, a home-cooked meal, a cosy bed. Think about what are the things you do have and are grateful for. Try some breathing and relaxation techniques Take a five-second breath in through the nose, hold that breath for five seconds and then breathe out for five seconds. Do this five times, says Catherine Gallacher. Melani Halacre recommends the STAR technique. “Smile, take aand relax...breathing out longer than in to override fight and flight mechanism,” she says. Cate Campbell also recommends trying mindfulness or relaxation apps, and practising deep breathing. Write down your anxieties, and let them go It can help to express this anxiety in a way that you can control. That could be writing down what you feel, or keeping a journal. “Acknowledge that you feel this way. Don’t ignore these feelings,” says Elizabeth Turp. “Allow yourself to worry, put it down in writing in a notebook, and then put that away. Let it go.” Get access to natural light Lockdown may have limited your trips to parks and for countryside walks, but itaposs still important to get access to natural light, says Rakhi Chand. Our exposure to natural light is limited at the moment, and this affects our serotonin and melatonin levels - both vital for our mental health. Rakhi recommends sitting near windows and making home environments as light and airy as possible. If youaposre lucky enough to have a a balcony or garden, use it regularly.  She also says that certain foods - such as walnuts, almonds or bananas - can help boost melatonin, and salmon, eggs and spinach are among the foods that can help boost serotonin. She also says itaposs worth looking into Vitamin D supplements, a light therapy lamp and limiting blue light from phones or screens as it disrupts circadian rhythm. Look after your wellbeing Make sure you are looking after yourself, doing what you can to help get a good night’s sleep, eating well and doing exercise, adds Catherine Gallacher. “I always talk to my clients about a wellbeing check. Sleeping, eating, exercising. If we manage our health like this, it can help make us more robust against anxiety.” Running either on the spot, or outside, releases endorphins and fools the brain and body that they’ve run away from the danger, says Cate Campbell. Use all your senses One of the self-care tips recommended by Eve Menezes Cunningham is to use all your senses to notice where you are. You might want to notice five things you can see right now, five things you can hear right now, says Eve, or any smells or tastes. “These can help us resist the well-worn neural pathways around catastrophising and feeling helpless.” There are more of Eve’s self-care tips available to read here. No expectations, no pressure Sarah Wheatley, who specialises in helping new parents, says that she often discusses with her clients, how “when we live in extraordinary times, all bets are off.” “Since expectations can be one of the things that are dficult to manage as a new parent, when there are no expectations it can be really freeing and allow people time to find their way without any pressure. “The pressure to get back into shape, the pressure to socialise, the pressure to feed certain ways, the pressure to feel calm and relaxed, the pressure to look as though you have it ‘all together’. These pressures are reduced by physical isolation, and can be helpful to some mothers.” Positive thinking At times, this may feel very dficult to do depending on your personal situation. But re-framing a negative situation into a positive one can be very helpful. Indira Chima says: “I believe there are a lot of positives to be gained, which might not be apparent right now. It forces people to slow down and breathe and take stock and that is always a good thing.   “We live at such a fast, frenetic pace and sometimes donapost stop to think about what itaposs all about and where we are heading.  This is forcing us to do that.  And we will grow as a result of this.” Ask for support “It’s not a sign of weakness, but strength to reach out and ask for support,” says Hansa Pankhania “Make a list of everyone you know, friends, family, colleagues, neighbours etc. Now tick  people from this list, who can provide practical, psychological and moral support.  Connect with them and sustain this support circle.” If you would like support from a qualied professional, many counsellors offer online or telephone counselling. They can help you explore and understand what youaposre feeling. To find a counsellor or psychotherapist who can help you visit our Therapist Directory. I rang my mum and started crying.

The strict rules would include social distancing and could change the face of British pubs in the coming months with landlords turning enforcers and fining those who flout the rules. The terms are outlined in a plan by economist and government advisor Professor Eyal Winter to get the country back on its feet. He said social distancing was the key to coming out of lockdown with a clear timetable from the Government with what would happen by certain dates. And he admitted while Brits were gasping for a pint at their local, for boozers to reopen, drinkers would have to keep two meters apart and be limited to three bevvies before heading home to free up space for others to enjoy a tipple.Prof Winter of Lancaster University said: “People are starving for pubs. They are an important part of British culture.” He has been advising ministers on coronavirus lockdown and said cinemas and theatres could also re-open but with half empty auditoriums. Prof Winter toldevery other seat would have to be unoccupied but venues could recoup some money by raising ticket prices. But businesses fear social distancing could be a killer blow with the hospitality industry the hardest hit.  Katie Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality said reopening without a plan of action would be “catastrophic” for the sector, especiallysocial distancing was to become the norm for the foreseeable future. She said: “An extended period of social distancing will mean that many hospitality businesses will not be able to operate fully and many will not be able to open at all.” Restaurant owners added their concerns over how social distancing will impact on their livelihoods and Michel Roux Jr, boss of two Michelin star Le Gavroche in London called for a nine month rent amnesty. He said: “Le Gavroche has been open for  years and been through recessions, depression, winter of discontent, IRA bombings and anything  you can think of. “Nothing comes close to this crisis.”  Chef Yotam Ottolenghi who owns six restaurants and takeaways specialising in Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cuisine agreed and said: “Nobody in their right minds would say we can carry on paying rent as before.” He has had to furlough  staff amid closures and said of social distancing: “Assume we operate at % capacity - that doesn’t allow us to pay the same salaries or rents. “If we operate at -% capacity, that’s still not a sustainable business because restaurants operate at profit margins of %.” Celebrity chef Tom Kerridge has furloughed  staff at three pubs, two restaurants and an events catering business. The boss of the Hand and Flowers pub in Marlow, Bucks which was the UK’s first boozer to get two Michelin stars said: “Restaurants and pubs are not just there for the purpose of serving something to eat and drink.There is something more deeply ingrained culturally and from a social point of view.

Initially the Centre for Disease Controllisted just three symptoms for Covid- which were: shortness of breath, a cough and a fever. But as doctors have learned more about the deadly bug, which has claimed the lives of more than , people in the UK, they have updated their list of symptoms. The CDC in America now reports the symptoms which could appear between two to  days of exposure to the virus as:Chills Repeated shaking with chills Muscle pain Headache Sore throat New loss of taste or smellIn an  Iranian study, % of Covid- patients who reported a loss of smell said it had a sudden onset. In many of the cases, anosmia, as it’s called, appeared before other symptoms. Vallery Lomas, a -year-old champion baker, told the Washington Post: “It scared the hell out of me. “I could smell nothing for probably five days.” Professor Claire Hopkins, president of the British Rhinological Society and a leading ear, nose and throat consultant surgeon, is leading the charge to get loss of sense of smell recognised by the World Health Organization and Public Health England as a coronavirus symptom.  Prof. Hopkins said: One in six patients will lose their sense of smell as an isolated symptom, really without getting any other associated symptoms. One in four will get it along with other symptoms, but right at the beginning of infection. It is a good early marker of infection. She added: When you look at all the dferent symptoms, loss of sense of smell is actually one of the best predictors of Covid- infection. Much better than fever, and more prevalent and a stronger predictor than cough. In France, researchers are preparing to launch a human trial to test their hypothesis that nicotine can help the body combat the Covid- infection.  The trial will involve groups of healthcare workers and patients wearing nicotine patches and other groups wearing placebo patches. Then they will be tested to seethere is a dference in how their bodies respond to the virus. The trial is a follow-up to a French study, published this month, of public health data which appeared to show that people who smoke are % less likely to catch Covid- than non-smokers of the same age and sex. The most common symptoms of the coronavirus are: a dry, persistent cougha feverIf you experience these symptoms, you should immediately self-isolate yourself for seven days. It is not necessary to call NHS  unless your symptoms get more severe. Some patients have reported fatigue, headaches, shortness of breath and aches and pains. Sneezing is not a symptom of the coronavirus."},{"url":null,"title":"fan exposes kinder egg secret","story":"NewsFan exposes Kinder Egg secret - and it has blown peoples mindsKinder Egg fan Sullivan Poulter discovered that the sweet treat resembles a real eggShareCommentsByPaige HollandShowbiz Audience Writer:,  APR NewsTheyre delicious\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The number of new cases across the country has fallen to single digits, with just one confirmed case on Monday. In total, New Zealand has reported  deaths and , Covid- confirmed and probable cases, as le slowly starts toto normal. The government imposed strict level four lockdown measures which were in place for almost five weeks, which New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern described as the strictest constraints placed on New Zealanders in modern history. But the alert level has now shted to level three, which has allowed takeaways and some non-essential shops to reopen. This saw huge queues form at McDonaldaposs and coffee shops as locals took advantage of the easing of lockdown measures. More than , people ed to work on Tuesday, with  per cent of the countryaposs economy now operating. But the country is not yet celebrating, with social distancing measures still in place and residents still encouraged to work from home where possible. Schools have reopened, but pupils can only attendthey want to, while mass gatherings have still been banned.  Ashley Bloomfield, New Zealandaposs Director General of Health, said: hat does give us confidence that weaposve achieved our goal of elimination, which never meant zero but it does mean we know where our cases are coming from. But how did New Zealand contain the virus  Closed bordersThe first confirmed coronavirus case in the country was announced on February .Then, on March , it was announced that anyone entering the country would have to self-isolate for two weeks - New Zealand had six confirmed cases at this point. Five days later, Prime Minsiter Ardern banned foreigners from entering the country in what was among the toughest border restrictions in the world. Harsh lockdown measures New Zealand was put into lockdown on March  when the country had  confirmed coronavirus cases and  deaths.  The lockdown was implemented in four stages - one being the lowest and four being the strictest. Level four was lted only this week. Level four saw offices, schools and restaurants all close - even for delivery and takeaway. Decisive action, going hard and going early, helped to stamp out the worst of virus, Ardern said in a statement on Tuesday. Rapid testing So far, , tests have been carried out in New Zealand, compared to just over , in the UK, which has approximately  times a bigger population. Officials say around , people are being tested a day. The social bubble New Zealand allowed locals to pick a small group of friends or family that they could all see to make people less likely to break lockdown rules.  The governmentaposs website describes the social bubble as a personaposs household but, under alert level-, the bubble can be expanded to close relatives and local friends. The guidelines state: People must stay within their household bubble but can expand this to reconnect with close family, or bring in caregivers, or support isolated people. It’s important to protect your bubbleyou extend it. Keep your bubble exclusive and only include people where it will keep you and them safe and well.

John-Paul Drike, the director of Drakes Supermarkets in Adelaide, Australia, says he responded simply by giving the alleged hoarder the middle finger. In a stunning YouTube video, the supermarket boss has vented his anger at those who have taken advantage of the desperate rush for basic household supplies amid the coronavirus pandemic. He claimed that one unidentied customer had been audacious enough to purchase  -roll packets of loo roll and  units of one-litre sanitiser from his shop - and then later ask for a refund. Follow the latest coronavirus updates here “I had my first customer yesterday who said he wanted to get a refund on  packets of -pack toilet paper and  units of one-litre sanitiser, Mr Drake says in his video on April . Flipping his middle finger at the screen, he added: “I told him that.  Branding those who have been panic-buying supplies such as toilet paper absolutely ridiculous, he continued: That is the sort of person that is causing the problem in the whole country. Speaking to News, he said the man wanted to get rid of the items because he was no longer able to sell them on eBay after his site was shut down. He claimed that he had as many as  people working with him to buy up the highly-sought after commodities. Australiaaposs Home Affairs Minister, Peter Dutton, has said that the government will come down like a ton of bricks on supermarket hoarders who have been clearing shelves of basic supplies. Speaking last month, he said that that anyone caught profiteering from buying up essential groceries such as food and toilet paper will be prosecuted. In the UK, police officers have taken to standing guard at supermarkets to halt coronavirus panic-buying and enforce the Governmentaposs social distancing orders.

The Trust has so far helped , people with food deliveries and , with welfare phonecalls.AFCCT chief executive Liz Bowie said: “Many of our initiatives and avenues for raising funds were effectively cut‐off immediately following the suspension of football and the lock‐down. However, the generosity of AFC fans and others in the community has given us a vital leline and, in turn, allowed us to support the most vulnerable in our communities through our outreach programme and our food package deliveries.“This money from the Arthur M. Blank Family Foundation is being ring‐fenced for our work in helping to educate and support young people deal with their mental health. By collaborating with Grassroots Soccer, we have developed the MINDSET programme which has already been trialled in two schools in the city and shire.#The impact of this programme has been signicant.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

into it.I found a little information about it.It was located in Dam Brae and was said to contain water with special qualities that helped make a perfect pot of tea.There is little explanation as to what exactly these qualities were, but it seems to have been widely believed and accepted in the past.Tea, of course, became popular in Scotland, and by the th century it had become an important accompaniment to the often mundane diet of working class people, providing a refreshing non-alcoholic alternative to beer.For the poor, tea drinking wasnrsquot linked to formal social rituals as it was with the upper classes.Tea was the drink of the working class as they worked.So, a well in the heart of the town which was believed to supply good tea making water will have been a busy and popular place.Many people, likely mostly women, would have congregated around the well.In the OS name book from the s, it was clearly recorded that the well was listed as the ldquoVickerrsquos Well, but then goes on to state that ldquono person in the locality knows it by that name.Everyone called it ldquothe bickers well.Perhaps this was a result of local dialect changing the name over time.But Paul Bennet, in his interesting website ldquoThe Northern Antiquarian says ldquothere is the obvious possibility that the ldquobickers ndash as in chit-chat and gossip ndash related to it being where local folk simply met and chatted.Perhaps the reputation of the wellrsquos water for making quality tea also meant people from further afield considered it worthwhile to detour here, in order to make that extra special ldquoBickerrsquos Brew.One account says it was once surrounded by old trees.All of this conjures an image of an important social meeting place, with people meeting under the shade of old trees, exchanging views and information and having a good blether while they wait their turn to draw water from the celebrated well.Was the belief in the goodness of the water rooted in some older tradition Perhaps it was a revered holy well, as some have suggested It seems to have been associated with the vicarage of St Michaels nearby, which roots the well in Musselburghrsquos ancient past, and gives a reason for the name Vicarrsquos Well.The well was replaced by a pump sometime in the nineteenth century, and then was blocked up, and became forgotten.When Irsquod discovered all this I set out to find the location of the well to seethere was still any evidence of it.Dam Brae is now named Kilwinning Place and I studied a nineteenth century map which marked the exact location of the well, then compared it to a modern one and set out on my quest.I found the location. Irsquom sure of it, and took a photo.But there wasnrsquot really anything of much interest to see other than a slab on the ground where I believe the well once stood.It seemed so forgotten, and put me in a melancholy mood for a moment.I reflected on the way something that had been a tradition for so long, and such a part of many peoplersquos lives can just vanish, and be utterly forgotten.I know it was just a well and so might not seem important.But it was a meeting place for ordinary people for generations.The simple shared routines and places in our lives are often the ones we remember with nostalgia.We donrsquot think of them as history or worthy of recording until all memory has gone, and itrsquos too late.I thought about this as we were going on our local family walk this week.I suppose we all know we are living through a time that will be recorded by history.But when all this is over, and things are back to ldquonormal what simple things will you, and your family, remember from this time and what will you want remembered For me, this includes seeing the Greenhills carpeted with wildflowers for the first time that I can remember, watching children cycle on empty streets and deserted car parks, and queuing in shops, keeping our physical distance while also trying to stay social.For sure the toilet roll panic will be part of history.But all of us will have special moments and places that connect to the emotions of this time.There will be stories of peoplersquos wonderful community spirit, what it felt like to be confined in the house for weeks, and how we entertained ourselves.We are all historians of our own time, and we should find ways to record and remember the simple, but important, things we have felt and encountered during this time of crisis.Because memory fades, and as the fate of the Bickers Well shows,memories are not recorded or stories of them not told, they will be forgotten.And so this was why I decided to re-visit the story of the Bickers Well for my column this week.It may have originally seemed there was not much to tell about it.Yet once there was.But the memories and the stories connected to it seemed so simple and obvious at the time that nobody really thought them important enough to record or keep treasured.Now all that remains of those stories is a slab on the pavement.The technology we have makes it easier now to share and record our lives.So letrsquos use it to consciously be historians and storytellers of this dficult time to capture images and feelings, the happenings that may today seem too simple and commonplace to record, but in future will be a fascinating insight to our lives in this historic event.For me, that is the lesson of the Bickers Well."},{"url":null,"title":"winton-brewery-takes-countys-micropub","story":"Steve Holligan and David Mackinnon, from Winton Brewery, stepped behind the bar at Dunbarrsquos Station Yard Micropub at the beginning of the month.Currently, the duo are only allowed to sell off-sales, due to the coronavirus lockdown preventing customers from entering the pub, but they were looking forward to once again welcoming people inside as soon as possible.Steve said: ldquoWersquove been looking for a while to find something like this.ldquoThe Station Yard is unbelievable.ldquoWe looked in Haddington, we looked in Gullane and we wanted to stay in East Lothian, where we are from and where the brewery is based.ldquoIt was one of those things where you were scrolling through Facebook and this popped up.ldquoIt was too good an opportunity and we got in touch with Gerard McPhillips [who had created the pub alongside his late business partner David McGee] and had a really good meeting with him.

Donrsquot be afraid to substitute any ingredients. Its important to cut the creaminess of the cheese with acidity form the orange. Salmoriglio is an easy dressing that is great for using up herbs past their best. It is also excellent on steamed greens or to marinade fish.

Season to taste. Add two-thirds of dressing. Arrange on a plate. Partially tear the burrata and place on top. Scatter over pistachios and remainder of dressing. Serve.Salt Baked FishThis is a simple, stress free way to cook fish which is a showstopper. The crust acts like an oven, sealing in the moisture, allowing the fish to cook in its on juices.

Overlap lemon slices and pack with herbs. Experiment with herbs, its just important to fill it with something to maintain its shape and perfume the fish flesh.Use one third of the mixture for the base. Pat out into an even half inch layer. Place the fish on the bed of salt. Cover it with the remaining salt. Pat gently down until it covers the fish, like an envelope. Make sure there are no cracks.Bake for approx mins. If you have a thermometer insert it into the thickest part, it should be C, or a kne inserted into the thickest part should come away easily.

You should be able to lt it off. Discard. Brush away any excess salt.To serve run your kne down the spine of the fish between the two fillets and gently lt off.

They go at it like bargain hunters rummaging in a sale. The hills are hidden by mist and as we have breakfast, the village green is empty, apart from two scampering young squirrels, getting their hourrsquos daily exercise. A glossy male pheasant hurries down the lane ashersquos late for church. Yesterday he was making a racket in the next-door garden, ashe owned the place. Once hersquos gone, nothing stirs in Hoolet until mid-morning, when a cyclist goes past, bent over her narrow wheels like a racer in a Sempeacute cartoon. Shortly afterwards, a police car drives by. The sun has burned off the mist, and by eleven it almost feels like summer. Sundays are always leisurely here, but since lockdown, they stretch to infinity.A week after arriving in Hoolet, I started a diary. It is not the sort that the writer secretly hopes will be found posthumously and published as a literary masterpiece, more a haphazard reminder of how we have adjusted to a dferent mode of living, and a record of the people and wildle around us.Real diarists have a natural ability to condense the essence of a day into a few lines, but they put as much thought into their prose as any novelist or poet. In some ways theirs is an even harder task, because it requires a special kind of imagination and flair to turn the everyday ndash each and every day ndash into something noteworthy.The proleration of citizen diarists airing their thoughts on the coronavirus crisis has turned my mind to diaries. My own random jottings occasionally refer to the crisis, but there is something paralysing about its scale that makes it hard to capture in the passing, seemingly casual way diarising requires. Instead, I am absorbed by the outdoors: the new hole Irsquove found among the roots of the beech hedge ndash foraging thrush or resident rodent  the absence of the toad that moved into our rockery two years ago and the arrival of fat, low-flying bumblebees, which zig-zag across the garden, loud as drones.The great diarists, from Pepys and Dorothy Wordsworth to Alan Bennett, donrsquot need a crisis to fill their pages, but when one comes along, their perspective is invaluable. History ndash as this awful situation one day will be ndash is at its most immediate when captured in small personal details demonstrating one inidual getting by. Thatrsquos why I enjoy diaries so much, and there are none I like better than those that are country-based.This wasnrsquot always the case. I remember as a girl a book whose flowery cover filled me with the same dread as the thought of being obliged to wear a flouncy frock. The Diary of an Edwardian Lady was a bestseller in the late s. A beautully illustrated journal it was by Edith Holden, an artist from Birmingham. Reading it now, I realise what I was missing. The drawings of birds and plants are charming, and the entries show a woman after my own heart. The one for  April, , reads: ldquoSaw two live vipers which had been brought in from the moor one of them was more than two feet long. The gentleman who had captured them handled them quite fearlessly, held up one by the back of the neck and forcing its mouth open with a stick, he showed me the two little pink fangs in the upper jaw. When on the ground they reared themselves up and hissed, and struck repeatedly at a walking stick placed in front of them.Irsquove yet to see a snake in Hoolet, so have added that to the wish list. I did once almost step on an adder barefoot as a young child, in Tarland, Aberdeenshire, where it slithered out of the tree stump I was perched on. I got a closer look some years later, on a Borders forest track, where one was sunning itself. Like a fool, I got within touching distance, thinking it was dead, before it unfurled itself like a Catherine Wheel and disappeared into the undergrowth.Living as I do with a diary anthologist, the house is filled with them. Among my favourites is the th-century clergyman, the Reverend James Woodforde, who lived in Norfolk. Better than any documentary, he brings his shire alive with accounts of chimneys going on fire, deaths on horseback, moonlit evenings when hersquod go out for bibulous dinners he later regretted. Most pertinently for Alan this past  days when, with all dentistsrsquo practices and dental hospitals indefinitely closed, desperate measures have been contemplated, Woodforde gives an account of having a tooth pulled in . It was not a success: ldquohe broke away a great Piece of my Gum and broke one of the Fangs of the Tooth it gave me exquisite Pain all the Day after and my Face swelled prodigiously. He realised too late that the chap was no longer in his prime: ldquoHe is too old I think to draw Teeth, canrsquot see very well.Country diarists record fox hunts and deer stalking, tree-felling storms, village feuds, cake competitions and frog-spawnings, but there is relatively little about the great affairs of state. During World War One, for instance, Alice Dudney, from Lewes, reports her own war against slugs with far greater assiduity than what was taking place on the western front. I donrsquot think this was because country dwellers in previous centuries were less interested in the news, evenit sometimes arrived days or weeks after events. But back then, country living was hard. What was happening on your doorstep was of more pressing concern unless loved ones were in the firing line.Itrsquos quite the opposite in Hoolet. The few conversations now held ndash through a hedge, across a garden wall, or in passing up in the woods ndash are all about the pandemic, and the best stratagems for getting by. A diary on this subject alone risks deepening the gloom.

There is no other artist who documented Glasgow so extraordinarily during that period. Itrsquos not enough for Scottish art and big institutions like Kelvingrove to be limited to the most popular names like the Glasgow Boys, Jack Vettriano or Charles Rennie Mackintosh.ldquoPeople are very familiar with the work of the Glasgow Boys. But Glasgow has other painters. Therersquos a Glasgow Girl. Shersquos not even Scottish but came here and fell in love with the city to such an extent that she painted it throughout her short le. Eardley is a hugely important British artist and she should have a major exhibition in a British institution of note, like the Tate.Eardley was born on May , , on a dairy farm in Warnham, Sussex. Her family later moved to London and then, in , amid the growing threat of war, to Bearsden.The following year, she began her studies at Glasgow School of Art and proved fearless in her pursuit of subjects to paint. Her wanderings brought her to impoverished Townhead in the northeast of the city, where she established a studio. The paintings Eardley did there ndash particularly her famous portraits of the Samson children ndash are considered landmarks of th-century art.For her niece Anne Morrison, a Bearsden-based ceramicist, Eardleyrsquos relationship with an urban district which was facing the demolition ball is an example of just how daring and exceptional she was.ldquoTownhead was just not the area that you would go to ndash I was kept well away from it, she said. ldquoEven my brother, who was a couple of years older, said he had never been up there either. It was not the place to be. It was just the poverty and seeing what that part of Glasgow looked like. Middle-class kids just did not get taken there.ldquoShe actually caught something that was disappearing at the time, as the buildings were getting knocked down and people were getting moved where. It captured something of the city and the children there. Itrsquos not glorying it but itrsquos capturing it in a very human way.Morrison suggested that the lack of a major event to mark the centenary of Eardleyrsquos birth could have something to do with the Scottishness of her work.ldquoIt does seem right to have a celebration of her work but it does not seem to be happening, she added. ldquoHer name gets forgotten. She has not had the recognition at a UK level that she should. Thatrsquos the trouble. Shersquos a Scottish artist and she gets put aside because her subjects were Scottish as well.Laura Cumming, art critic for The Observer, described Eardley as ldquoone of the deepest landscape artists who ever lived, and among the most humanitarian painters of men, women and especially children.She added: ldquoEvery opportunity to see her work is precious ndash anywhere at all.ldquoThere have been shows in Scotland, the last that I remember was in . She deserves many more, and so the ideal would be a touring show that took in London, presenting her work throughout the United Kingdom to a new generation. Next year must not be allowed to slip by without a full-scale retrospective of her powerfully stirring and beautul work.Arts journalist Jan Patience said: ldquoThe National Galleries of Scotland in Edinburgh has done a power of work to cement her reputation with two major shows in the last  years, but there has been no major Eardley show for years in Glasgow, the city she called home. I believe the last one was in what was then called The Third Eye Centre in the s.ldquoAn Eardley show in Glasgow would attract visitors in their thousands and a no-show in her centenary year shows a real lack of vision.Local authorities in Scotlandrsquos largest cities said events were being organised or considered to mark the anniversary.A spokeswoman for Glasgow Le said: ldquoAs one of Scotlandrsquos most popular th-century artists we anticipate a small programme of events to mark Joan Eardleyrsquos centenary.ldquoWe are pleased to have a small number of her drawings and paintings in our collection, which includes the much-loved oil Glasgow Kids, a Saturday Matineacutee Picture Queue, on show in Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum. However, we do not hold the breadth of works required to stage a standalone exhibition.An Aberdeen City Council spokeswoman said: ldquoEardleyrsquos work is showcased as one of the Our Collection highlights in Gallery  ndash Collecting Art and her work can be seen throughout the collections galleries. A number of the oils we own are on display, including a powerful seascape painted at Catterline.ldquoThe  centenary of Joan Eardleyrsquos birth presents a welcome opportunity for us to celebrate the artistrsquos strong connection with the northeast of Scotland in a number of ways.A spokesman for Leisure and Culture Dundee, which runs the McManus Gallery and Museum, said: ldquoWe have no current plans to mark the Joan Eardley centenary next year.A spokesman for the National Galleries of Scotland said: ldquoThe National Galleries celebrated the le and work of Joan Eardley in a comprehensive exhibition just three years ago, and the exhibitionrsquos curator Patrick Elliott, a leading expert on Eardley, is writing a book on Eardley and Catterline as part of the centenary celebrations. All future plans, including publication of this book and our exhibition schedule, are subject to review due to the ongoing health crisis. However, we do intend on marking Eardleyrsquos centenary next summer, in one form or another.The Tate galleries declined to comment."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-time-scotland-go-way-lockdown","story":"This independent group, whose membership remains a closely guarded secret, finds itself centre stage at present due to the ongoing critical issues linked to the Coronavirus. The fact that Mr Cummings and his fellow Vote Leave strategist, Ben Warner, appear to have taken part in SAGE deliberations must be of serious concern to anyone who believes in an open-minded and independent group ldquofollowing the science and arriving at decisions concerning the virus for the common good and not tainted with political overtones.From all accounts it would seem that Mr Cummings has been an active participant in discussions and decision-making rather than simply an interested observer. This becomes more sinister and of grave concern when you consider his well-publicised contempt for the NHS, record of electoral fraud and more than a passing interest in the field of eugenics. Mr Cummings was allegedly an advocate of a herd immunity strategy for the UK in early March, which was mirrored by the Prime Ministerrsquos ldquo take it on the chin ramblings as the Government tried to figure out how to cope with the virus without losing support or damaging the economy. In short, Mr Cummingsrsquos presence on SAGE whilst denying a place for the chief medical officers of Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales is firm evidence that the Conservative Government is placing unfair political pressure on the group to ensure the science matches their political message both for the pre and post- lockdown periods.The First Minister has opened discussions about what a gradual ending to the lockdown may look like in the weeks and months ahead whilst at the same time, influential Conservative groups like the  Committee has stressed that businesses must be allowed to restart the economy as soon as possible, eventhere remains a signicant tangible risk to le. Government pressure on our experts must not sacrice lives for party ideology and wealth creation. Economies bounce back but, sadly, people do not.Whilst Nicola Sturgeon has talked of using Angela Merkelrsquos Germany as a model in future planning, the Prime Ministers first post-inidual virus communication was with President Trump, a public advocate of disinfectant injections to cure the virus.It may well be time for Scotland to erge from the UK Government in easing the lockdown in the immediate future. I trust that the Scottish Government will take dficult decisions based on the science available and for the welfare of the people. I have no such confidence in Mr Johnson or his amoral colleagues and advisers.Owen Kelly, Stirling.THE SNPs Commons leader, Ian Blackford, was arguably correct to criticise Boris Johnson for missing five Cobra meetings earlier in the year. What therefore will be his response to Nicola Sturgeon missing six such meetings in January and February She seemingly felt it more important to be playing netball or popping into a primary school ndash all self-publicised on social media. Ms Sturgeons spokesperson complains she sometimes doesnt have much notice of the crucial meetings. Ms Sturgeon: more than , people have died from Covid- so far across the world ndashworth some last minute diary rearrangement Martin Redfern, Edinburgh EH.NICOLA Sturgeon made it clear in the days leading up to last Thursdays press briefing that she would not be able to publish definite times and details about Scotlands journey out of lockdown, and I am sure that none of the grown-ups Ms Sturgeon was addressing expected her to suddenly pull up the shutters on our shops and and open all the pubs.I must disagree with Allan Thompsonwhen he accuses Ms Sturgeon of talking a lot but saying nothing. She made it clear that any steps which would be taken would be small and tentative, and that she was not going to take chances with the lives and health of Scotlands people. She did say that possible initiatives might allow some pupils toto school, in a safe and phased way, and that some businesses might be allowed to re-openthey could guarantee the two-metres-apart rule. The First Minister also urged people to read Coronavirus : Framework for Decision Making which is on the Scottish Government Website, and sets out the approach which will guide Ms Sturgeon and her governments decisions on transitioning out of lockdown.In opening this conversation with the public, Ms Sturgeon offered us all some hope, and the prospect of a light at the end of a very dark tunnel.Ruth Marr, Stirling.DIED \"with\" Covid-, or died \"of from due to\" it  I am getting confused.Until recently I thought the dference was made clear by the adage that more men die with prostate cancer than of it, and that sloppy reporting in the media was to blame for the blurring of the line.But now it appears the health authorities themselves, and not only in the UK, have questions to answer their political masters too.For example, the White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator has admitted to counting deaths as Covid- that really had other causes: ldquoIf someone dies with Covid-, we are counting that as a Covid- death. Which means the number of those really dying of it is much lower.So why the trashing of our economy through this excessive lockdown  Sweden has  per cent fewer deaths per million than the UK, despite its light-touch measures. Is our Government perhaps on a power high, enjoying curtailing civil liberties such as being out without \"reasonable excuse\", while some of their class have been rumbled ignoring the instruction In the winter of  , England alone lost , people to the flu, yet neither the Government nor the media batted an eyelid. All businesses and shops remained open, as did schools, restaurants, charities, churches, parks, and everywhere .If Westminster and Holyrood persist with their stubborn, inflexible diktats, the long-term effect on public health will be far worse than the virus. Only a healthy economy can finance a sound NHS.George Morton, Rosyth.WHILST accepting the requirement to adhere to the guidelines in order to keep us safe from this horric virus, I must point out the serious and obvious inconsistencies emanating from Government with regard to those guidelines.For instance, prior to the lockdown, it was possible to play golf in wide open spaces in the fresh air and it was easy to adhere to the social distancing and yet, at the time of writing, golf courses are closed I have just visited our local BQ store, which is open to the public with adherence to social distancing measures and this obviously involved shopping in an enclosed area which, with due care, presented absolutely no problem at all.There are many other examples of such inconsistency which the Governmentsfail to recognise and this is not conducive to good mental health with such unnecessary and illogical confinement being forced upon us.Unless and until good common-sense prevails, I fear that we could be heading towards civil unrest and disobedience on a major scale. Are you listening, Nicola Sturgeon James F McGilvray, Edinburgh EH.I FULLY understand, and completely accept, the need for the ongoing lockdown, and I follow all the rules as set out by the Scottish Government.But there is no advice coming out of the Government other than \"stay home\" or lsquoself-isolatersquo, to protect our Health Service.After four weeks, even minor illnesses or irritations are becoming a major issue and there is no advice on how to deal with any of these. How can anyone deal with foot issues, dental problems, eye irritations or back painwe have no access to chiropodists, dental practitioners, opticians or chiropractors because they are not allowed to go about their normal businesses  With very little access to our GPs, and the pharmacist no longer in a position to offer helpful advice or remedies, how are we expected to cope with worsening \"minor\" health problems These are issues that need to be addressed in the very near term, and with a high degree of urgency, or the lock down is going to lead to an epidemic of illnesses that need not have developedproperly treated.We need targeted advice and help.Francis Deigman, Erskine.TO all those whinging about the economic damage being caused by the Covid- shutdown: maybe, just maybe,we hadnt made the economy take first and foremost priority over everything  in our lives, we wouldnt be in the current mess were in right now Previous generations can plead ignorance, but ndash especially after recent \"near misses\" with HN and SARS ndash in an age of mass literacy and the internet, for these events to happen on our generations watch is unforgivable.When all this is over,once more we place \"the economy\" ndash the omnipotent god of the godless ndash on the highest pedestal exalted and above all other considerations, cutting corners and turning blind eyes to risks for the sake of \"the \", well deserve a worse pandemic than this with bells on.Mark Boyle, Johnstone.NEW Zealanders shared the UKs relief when Prime Minister Johnson came out of intensive care, and we were proud when he singled out a Kiwi nurse, Jenny, and her Portuguese colleague, Luiacutes, for their skill and dedication. The New Zealand health system has many fine nurses who would like the experience of working with the NHS in Scotland, where, like my daughter, they have family links.The irony of Mr Johnsonrsquos heartfelt praise is that the UKs nurse registration requirements are so tough as to put off many qualied and experienced Kiwi nurses from even trying.The application fee of NZ is a monthrsquos salary the language test is notorious for failing even those who communicate very well in their native English and the practical competency test must be taken in the UK. As a result, the NHS has missed out on many fine Jennys. Other countries, including the Republic of Ireland, are more welcoming.

Council bosses in Edinburgh have rolled out a similar scheme as a loop of the Old Town.Last week, Mr Matheson said he has discussed the issue of transforming road space with Edinburghs transport convener Lesley Macinnes and that he is \"working with Sustrans Scotland on developing plans with a number of local authorities\".Legal changes are likely to be needed in order to allow councils to transform streets.Mr Finnie said: ldquoThe response to the coronavirus emergency has changed how we go about our daily lives. Streets that were once choking with cars are now largely empty, and more and more families are taking their daily exercise or trip to the shop by bike or on foot.:Coronavirus in Scotland: Huge rise in cycling to escape lockdown bluesldquoI urge the Scottish Government to work with councils to take action now to widen pavements and ensure that people feel they can walk safely ensuring necessary social distancing measures can be maintained.Mr Finnie wants the Scottish Government to harness the opportunity to overhaul how road space is used amid the Covid- crisis.ldquoThis change in how we travel has obviously come about as a result of a national crisis, but the benefits of lower levels of air pollution are clear for all to see and we should not let that go as we begin to ease the lockdown measures in the weeks and months to come.There have also been concerns that more people are breaking speed limits more frequently during the lockdown - with the RAC warning that % of people have witnessed an increase in drivers speeding.The Liberal Democrats have also called for new walking and cycling measures to be introduced in a bid to allow people to use social distancing while outside.Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said: ldquoTo save lives, social distancing and the two-metre rule are likely to be in place for a long time to come. The risk is thatwe donrsquot reconfigure our streets then people will increasingly be at risk of stepping into traffic during the phases after full lockdown.ldquoPublic transport can only facilitate social distancing for a limited number of people - perhaps only a quarter of its capacity. That means people are going to need other ways to get to work, and that canrsquot just involve everyone piling into their cars because that could lead to gridlock.:Opinion: Lockdown proves le - and our cities - are better without carsldquoAuthorities are doing this around the world, from New Zealand to Milan and Mexico City. This is about keeping the network moving and keeping people safe.ldquoIt has been great to see people embrace their daily exercise as we all cherish our time outdoors. The transport system should be reset in a way that allows this activity to continue during the next phases. Without this we risk a resurgence of car travel, more accidents and more air pollution than before.Stuart Hay, director of walking charity, Living Streets Scotland, said: ldquoMany of our footways are too narrow. This has long been a problem for people with wheelchairs, buggies and other mobility aids but now itrsquos affecting everyonersquos ability to practise social distancing.ldquoCities worldwide are starting to reallocate road space to allow people to move more freely. Now we need to follow their lead.ldquoFiltered neighbourhoods, banning cars from certain roads, tackling pavement parking and lower speed limits can also all help to thin out overcrowded pavements and make our daily exercise easier and safer.Sustrans Scotland, which campaigns for better access to walking and cycling, wants to help councils make improvements to infrastructure.A spokesperson for Sustrans Scotland said: ldquoSustrans has been consistent in highlighting the need for reallocation of road space to enable people to exercise and do essential trips on foot and by bike, while providing adequate space for social distancing during the Covid- pandemic.

But we knew that already there has been speculation for several days now about the timetable for relaxation and clear statements of intentfrom the devolved governments.In any case, it was to be expected for three reasons: first, it seems to have worked, or at least to have coincided with an evening out of the spread of the disease.The second point, to which Mr Johnson alluded, is that indefinite lockdown was always going to be economically unsustainable the NHS, and all the other measures being brought forward, need to be paid for, which wonrsquot happen unless and until we can get more firms back to normal. And the third is the blunt reality that, no matter how compliant they are in the short term, people wonrsquot observe these kinds of restrictions forever.There is, in any case, a cross-party consensus ndash indeed, almost unanimity ndash on ldquofollowing the science. Naturally, that means choosing which scientists to listen to, and revising policy in line with what seems to be working, and as more information emerges. It doesnrsquot mean there are no political decisions or mistakes being made. The point is that, rightly or wrongly, thatrsquos been the approach taken by the British Government, followed by the Scottish Government and backed by the Labour Party.:Westminster failed to stockpile enough coronavirus PPE, BBC Panorama claimsSo it shouldnrsquot matter which politician presents it but it does, and that is because Boris Johnson is a politician who brings out the worst in his opponents.Everything is unimaginably dferent from two months ago, which makes it hard to remember that Mr Johnson has been Tory leader only for nine months, and had a General Election mandate as Prime Minister only since December. Even without coronavirus, few people would have predicted last July that Mr Johnson would have unied the Tory Party, ensured that Brexit happened , that the Conservatives would win with a landslide majority of , and that the Prime Minister would enjoy a colossal personal approval rating.Quite a few people still seem to find it impossible to believe, even now that itrsquos happened. Perhaps it is because Mr Johnson is such an exceptional ndash indeed, improbable ndash politician that he produces such vitriol in some of his opponents. But the bad news for those who think of him as an obvious charlatan, or buffoon, or power-crazed authoritarian is that they are in a minorityndash at least for now.The Prime Ministerrsquos current position is the more remarkable when you consider the enormous swings of fortune that have brought him to this point: hersquos had major setbacks as often as hersquos been lucky ndash which may be an indication that he knows how to handle them. A global pandemic that will almost certainly be followed by a global recession, in the middle of the UK disengaging itself from the EU, presents extraordinary challenges that no one anticipated but, paradoxically, it may also allow the Prime Minister a wider range of options.The UK Governmentrsquos strategy, in medical terms, is not very dferent from that of any other country, evenyou think it has made mistakes or is managing some thingsworse. In the grand scheme of things, until there is a vaccine or some natural development of immunity, the only thing anyone can do is take measures to prevent their health system from being overwhelmed.What is much more within the Governmentrsquos power, and will be the real test for Mr Johnson, is the economic response. The Chancellor has announced unprecedented levels of spending , but while that will be necessary, itrsquos got to come from somewhere in the end.Those circumstances give Mr Johnson the leeway to spend in a way that Tories would normally characterise as reckless, but they also make it likely that a more flexible, deregulated and low-tax atmosphere for business will need to be a priority. The new economic conditions also give him an excuse to alter some of the Governmentrsquos previous spending plans ndash this is a perfect opportunity, for example, to ditch HS.:Neil Mackay: Scotlandrsquos handling of schools in lockdown is a national disgraceThe Prime Ministerrsquos own brush with the coronavirus may have given him a more sombre appreciation of the realities of the disease, and of the efforts of those who are attempting to deal with it. It is also undeniably politically helpful, in that the publichas the sense that he has personal experience of its frightening and distressing effects.But, as his statement yesterday made clear, Mr Johnsonrsquos natural disposition is an optimistic belief that,you wrestle problems to the ground and refuse to give up, eventually you will prevail.No matter your view of him, it has to be conceded that his own track record tends to give him some reason for confidence. And whatever deficiencies he is accused of ndash lack of gravitas, a cavalier disregard for fine details, impetuosity ndash it may be that a hopeful determination to pull together in the face of adversity is just what the public currently expects. Whether Mr Johnson can maintain that will be the test of his premiership.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Children engage throughout the day with their teachers ndash messaging, video chatting. They submit work, the work is marked, feedback is given. Lockdown lessons, to all intents and purposes, are like being at school hellip thatrsquoschildren attend, of course.It seems, however, that the Scottish Government, councils and some parents are failing when it comes to the duty of care society must take to ensure our children get a decent education during this time of pandemic.The one set of people who canrsquot be blamed for the truancy crisis in our virtual classrooms is teachers. They want to teach. They set up their online classrooms, they prepare lessons, and then they wait to see how many, or rather, how few children turn up. Itrsquos the authorities and parents who have the responsibility to get children to teachersrsquo virtual classrooms so our educators can do their job.We knew things would be tough when it came to making education work during lockdown, but the devastation being wrought on the learning of our young is nothing short of scandalous. If I was still the parent of school-age children Irsquod be furious at the failure, and frightened for their future.A survey by the Scottish Secondary Teachersrsquo Association, before Easter, found that less than half of children are engaging with teachers. Just one per cent of teachers reported  per cent engagement. Fourteen per cent said there was  per cent engagement, and  per cent reported  per cent engagement. Five per cent said children were not engaging at all.:Andrew McKie: The PM has judged the public mood better than his criticslsquoEngagementrsquo means a pupil logs in to their virtual classroom and takes part in online lessons with their teacher.Primary schools may be fairing even worse. One teacher I spoke to told me they usually had half a dozen pupils who fully engage. They teach at an inner city Scottish primary. Many children are poor and vulnerable. Before lockdown the class was at maximum capacity:  children.Apart from the six who fully engage with lessons every day, there are six to eight other pupils who ldquopop in and out. They come online, look at resources, maybe try something and then go.Then there are around - pupils who are ldquovisible to the teacher ndash in other words, they can see these children have read messages left for them or looked at resources ndash but they donrsquot engage at all.And finally, therersquos the biggest worry ndash at least six children are completely ldquooff radar. They havenrsquot logged on, they havenrsquot been seen to read messages. In effect, the school doesnrsquot know where they are or what is happening to them. Senior management are, of course, trying to get in touch ndash theyrsquore calling and emailing parents. But teachers need help keeping our children safe. As in ordinary times, during lockdown teachers need social workers and truancy officers and family support teams to assist them day to day.The teacher said that what was true of their class was ldquopretty much the same for the rest of the school. They also said it was ldquopretty much the same when it came to the cluster of schools in their local area. And across the rest of Scotland  ldquoAnecdotally, itrsquos also pretty much the same, they said.:Scottish Governments education reputation in tatters after exam analysis sagaTeachers are happy to be flexible. They donrsquot mind teaching some kids at eight in the morning and others at tea-timethatrsquos what works for families. But they need parents and central and local government to back them and get children to virtual school.What makes all this worse is the response from the Scottish Government. Last week, I contacted the Government askingofficials knew how many children were attending lockdown lessons in Scotland.This was the comment I got from a Scottish Government spokesperson: ldquoWe do not collect a figure on how many children across Scotland are taking part in online virtual classes with schools. We believe that it would be a signicant burden to ask teachers to report this centrally at a time when they are, rightly, focussing their efforts on teaching their pupils.ldquoHowever, we are aware that considerable positive work has already been undertaken by teachers and education professionals across Scotland to support continuity in learning while most schools remain shut. This includes ious arrangements using dferent services such as those available through the Glow .Itrsquos the sort of typical jargon-speak which means nothing. However, teachers Irsquove spoken to say it would be no burden at all to ask them to report how many children are attending lessons. Theyrsquore taking a virtual register every morning anyway, so passing it on to the authorities wouldnrsquot be an imposition.Teachers told me that what needs to be done is this: during lockdown the class register should be used by local and central government for monitoring attendance just as in normal times. If a child is absent from virtual lessons without reason, or repeatedly, then call in the virtual truancy officer. Children cannot be left to stagnate educationally during lockdown.Teachers are often a convenient whipping boy for governments and society at large. Today, amid this pandemic, theyrsquore doing their best to prepare our children for adulthood but they are the ones being failed.Of course, itrsquos hard for parents to cope during lockdown but nobody said being a parent was easy. The lockdown is stressful, frightening, but children need to get up in the morning, brush their teeth, eat their breakfast, and go to their virtual school.Equally, some parents may be too poor to afford the technology needed for their child to participate in online lessons. In that case, the Government should set up an emergency fund, distributed by councils, which provides families in need with computers to educate their children.Coronavirus is killing a lot of things. It cannot be allowed to claim the future of our children ndash particularly our most vulnerable children.

To put it more expansively, the community became an attractive place for independent coffee shops to open up, for new restaurants, bars and an organic supermarket.Although, to be fair to the organic supermarket, it was an extension of a social enterprise that had been operating on the south side for a long time before it was trendy to do so.From an area that people went out of their way to avoid, we ended up with regular queues outside our Vietnamese place, pizza place, taco place, new pub, Italian restaurant, new bakery, several new cafes and vegan cake shop.This was on top of an already well-stocked array of Lebanese, Kurdish, Pakistani, Indian, Polish, African and Slovakian food places. Good luck with your BMI, is all I can say.Just before lockdown, I was planning a feature on the change in the area, whether it was food-generated gentrication and what it meant for the community.Now, of course, those queues are no longer.There no easy popping out for a coffee or a cake or a freshly baked loaf of bread. Locavore, the supermarket, is still open with careful social distancing in place and has set up an online ordering and delivery system using its electric vehicle.Others are operating on a takeaway only basis and others have closed entirely.At the weekend, one of the local coffee places staged a tentative reopening, getting in just before Greggs, which is just along the street and has also announced a trial reopening of some branches. No offence to Greggs, but I want our small, local businesses to succeed.Reopening in lockdown and beyond will require great care and a good deal of expense on PPE - something far less easy for independent shops to afford.The tentative reopening, from the queue that formed outside the shop on Saturday, seems to have gone well. Roast and brew it and they will come.In the past five weeks, other than friends and family, the only thing I have missed is cappuccinos. This is one of my favourite coffee shops. But I wasnt in the queue on Saturday to get myself a drink.Im not much of a shopper so Im content to do without, rather than shop online.My main stumbling block, though, is that I would feel guilt at knowing people were putting themselves at risk of illness to provide me with things I want but dont really need, whether thats a warehouse worker, delivery driver or barista. Of course, thats an absolute Catch-, because what local businesses both want and need is custom.I wonder, as an aside, whether people will be less consumerist at the end of lockdown, as they see they can survive without buying a load of extraneous stuff. Or whether they will feel deprivation and run out to purchase what they can.Of course, there needs to be a balance there for the sake of economic recovery. The Centre for Retail Researchestimates there will be , store closures this year with a loss of nearly , jobs. Weve already seen Cath Kidston and Laura Ashley go under, taking nearly  jobs with them.On the local high street, where you feel a connection to places like coffee shops and where you likely know the staff by name, it feels more personal.But locally theres another issue. To safely buy your flat white, you need to queue up outside and the queue means theres less space on the pavement for social distancing. In the event that more local cafes decide to open, there simply wouldnt be enough room to allow safe queueing and safe passage past.Hot beverages arent really the best for home delivery, so collection is preferable but, to open all the cafes on the street there would need to be some kind of system put in place to ensure safe distancing of customers that sees dferent retailers working together.Otherwise social distancing will become too dficult to do safely.Ultimately, my desire for a cappuccino should not outweigh the desire that our local coffee shop staff and their customers, not to mention passers-by, stay healthy.Its such a balancing act and, with restaurants and cafes perfectly allowed to open for takeaway, it comes down to consumer choice as much as responsibility on the part of the business owners.There is so much talk now about easing lockdown. If merely buying a cup of coffee has become a moral conundrum, Im not really sure Im ready for it yet.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

She states computers will assume the role of mother and father and parenting as we know it will be ldquoentirely optional, with technology caring for children from birth to adulthood.Lelike droids will feed, exercise and teach youngsters, while ldquonanny machines will change nappies, sing lullabies and tell bedtime stories.Mothers-to-be will not even need to carry their baby during pregnancy thanks to articial uteruses that will develop foetuses outside of the womb.AI will have become so capable and trusted that a third of parents could choose to outsource duties to inidualised ldquoUpbringing Centres until the age of .There, the children will interact almost exclusively with digital avatars and automatons that combine the role of ldquonurse, nanny, teacher and therapist.In effect, mums and dads will have the option of becoming ldquoholiday parents who need only spend time with their children on day trips and family vacations, Dr Tempest believes.Parents will see only their childrenrsquos ldquobest bits and avoid sleepless nights, dirty nappies, the terrible twos, teenage tantrums, hormonal angst and relationship dramas.Dr Tempest, a former NHS doctor at the internationally-renowned Addenbrookersquos Hospital said the prospect of robotic parenting is ldquoalarming but, for many, irresistible based on the rapid rate of AI innovation and on the publicrsquos heavy reliance on and propensity for outsourcing.The troubling vision is laid out her new book, Big Brain Revolution: Articial Intelligence ndash Spy or Saviour , which is out now.Dr Tempest said: ldquoThe field of articial intelligence is developing at an unprecedented rate, making things possible that we couldnrsquot even dream about just a decade before.ldquoIf progress continues at the same rate then AI could replace parenting as we currently understand the term.ldquoWithin  years, those wishing to have children could, effectively, outsource the entire parenting experience to AI should they wish to.ldquoIn other words, human parents would no longer be necessary to raise a child once it has been conceived. They will become as obsolete as floppy discs are today.ldquoMums and dads would pay for this service just like they do now for many simple tasks like cleaning, babysitting and gardening.ldquoIn so doing, parents will have the tempting option to only be present for their childrsquos best bits and to avoid anything .AI systems can use machine learning to spot and recognise patterns in large sets of information, which could include body metrics, speech, text data, or visual images.In the process, AI may learn things about human development that no biological parent could piece together.Dr Tempest says that technology companies will have their AI systems ldquolearn from the best parents, nursery nurses, teachers and child therapists to provide a bespoke childcare that any mortal human would struggle to provide.With constant monitoring of the child, the AI would be able to detect and respond to their full range of needs mdash from hunger and soiled nappies to emotional and educational development issues mdash far quicker and effectively.Software would then be able to adjust a childrsquos learning programme accordingly, direct mobile robots to attend to its requirements, or call for medical assistance.Dr Tempest added: ldquoUpbringing Centres, as I have called them, will feature state-of-the-art technology to monitor the children in their care around the clock.

When asked about whether certain regions of Scotland might undergo a more localised approach, the First Minister said she wasn#t ruling out anything that might help us deal with the virus.#Today I am seeking to start a grown up conversation with the public about the complex decisions that lie ahead of us as we look beyond lockdown,# she said.“As we have done all along, we will seek to inform the public with the best scientic advice possible, but the science will never be exact and we are in uncharted territory so we also need to make careful judgements and be prepared to adapt and change course as we go.“We want to ease restrictions, but we cannot rule out having to reapply them should the virus run out of control.#Nicola Sturgeon said she and her colleagues would be relying on the latest data to inform them of what the best approach for Scotland will be and explained that work to expand the nations testing capacity was ongoing.“Every day we see evidence that this virus causes real harm, but so too do the lockdown measures we are taking to contain it,# she continued.#This is causing harm to the economy and living standards, to children’s education and to mental health and wellbeing.“That is why we need to try to find a better balance than the one we have now, but as we do so we cannot take our eye off the need to suppress the virus and minimise the damage it does.“It is only when we are sure the virus is under control that we can even start to ease any of the restrictions because the virus will not have gone away.#Nicola Sturgeon has advised everyone to take part in the conversation about how we might leave lockdown.

Until late last year, a suitable vessel proved dficult to source, said the council.It then became known that the Nordic Sea, which operated on a number of passenger routes in the far north of Norway, had become available.Following visits and sea trials involving Orkney Marine Services and Orkney Ferries staff, the vessel was considered as a suitable replacement for the Golden Mariana.As the Nordic Sea was operating under a Norwegian Passenger Certicate, it was known that a number of requirements would have to be met before she was considered ready for a UK passenger certicate.With surveys now completed and a works list developed, the decision to complete the purchase was made and the vessel departed Bergen for Orkney yesterday morning, Thursday.On arrival, the vessel was handed over to Orkney Islands Council, but due to Covid- restrictions and the need for some works to be carried out to bring her up to the full UK Classication and Certication, it will be a while yet before the residents of Papa Westray are able to benefit from their new passenger ferry.The purchase of the new vessel was part funded by the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland.More details in The Orcadian Marine Scene section next week.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

For urban wildle, which includes mammals and birds living alongside people in towns, this will affect levels of disturbance from humans and food availability.In recent weeks there have already been reports of animals adapting to the reduced human activity including Kashmiri goats roaming around Llandudno, North Wales, troops of monkeys in Singapore, wild boars in cities across Europe and Coyotes wandering streets during daylight hours in the US.Lead researcher Professor Dawn Scott, an expert in Mammal Ecology and Conservation, will use this unprecedented time to try to collect information and answer the study’s overarching question # How have urban animals responded to changes in human activity during the COVID- lockdown The research will collect records on any observations of unusual animal behaviour during the lockdown, determine the effects of reduction in human activity in city and town centres on urban wildle, and the effects increased human activity in gardens and outdoors space is having. The data from the survey will then be combined with other data from media searches to produce a report on the response of urban animals to lockdown across the globe.Professor Scott, head of the School of Le Sciences at Keele University, said: “Urban animals have been able to adapt to our landscape and live alongside towns, cities and suburbs so we know they are already highly adaptable. This flexibility in behaviour means they can usually quickly respond to changing conditions, including the absence of humans, which is happening during the lockdown.“Across the world we have seen reports of animals roaming cities and in locations that they wouldn’t normally be seen during the day. Social isolation is an opportunity for many to learn more about nature and how we can support it. We’re asking people to take part in our study and help us discover how urban animals are responding due to our change in behaviour.”To find out more and take part in the study visit: www.keele.ac.uk wildlestudycopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Considering his past record as a caring inidual, including his efforts to help the homeless, that was not really surprising.But apart from manager Daniel Stendl, who waived his salary, others at the Edinburgh club appeared reluctant to follow Naismith’s example. Reports later suggested that no other Hearts player would be asked to take more than a  per cent reduction.Also last week it was claimed that Scotland manager Steve Clarke had accepted a  per cent cut, simply meaning his salary would go down from £, to £,.In England the men’s and women’s international bosses Gareth Southgate and Phil Neville apparently agreed to take  per cent less. In the former’s case he would still be pocketing £. million while Neville would get £,.At club level south of the border the situation is very inconsistent. Some managers, such as David Moyes, Eddie Howe and Graham Potter have volunteered to take a cut while Pep Guardiola donated a million euros to help fight the outbreak in Spain. There was a terrible poignancy to Guardiola’s generosity a few days later when it was reported that his -year-old mother had died as a result of the virus in Barcelona.But while most Premiership clubs have placed most non-playing staff on some kind of temporary leave, some receiving  per cent of their salary through the government’s job retention scheme, the situation with the majority of players is still unclear.This is a dficult situation and UK health minister Matt Hancock ruffled some feathers when he suggested that well-off footballers should consider doing more to help.Some journalists have even criticised Hancock, saying he was completely out of touch with what was actually happening. That was unfair. The minister was not speaking about the game in general, where players at lower-level clubs are paid a pittance compared with those at the top. He was merely highlighting the fact that many could easily survive with no pay at all for the foreseeable future.To put this in perspective, most players at Premiership level are earning several million a year, an increase of roughly two and a half times what they took home six years ago. A high proportion are on more than £, a week.At the top of the tree are Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea and Man City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, who are on over £ million and £ million respectively.Even a player I confess to never having heard of, Tanguy Ndombele of Tottenham Hotspur, is reportedly bagging £. million a year.In the Championship the average annual pay is considerably less, around £, a year or £, a week. And in the lower League Two it drops to £ or £ weekly, not all that much above the national average.During the current situation all these figures need to be taken into consideration. We should have no issue with lower-paid players still getting  per cent of their wages for doing nothing. They, like everyone , still have bills to pay.But for the multi-millionaires to grumble about being hit is about as hard to take as the coronavirus pandemic itself.: : : : : : : :No decision has yet been made about whether the football leagues in the UK will be completed, whenever the action begins again.In Scotland it has been proposed in some quarters that the title should just be handed to Celtic, as the Glasgow side had an almost unassailable lead when play stopped.Now a director of the other half of the Old Firm has suggested thatthat happened, their rivals would only be able to claim “eight and a half” in a rowthey were crowned champions.Personally I feel that this season’s scheduled fixtures should be played out, however long it takes. Only then should the - action start, evenit means a shortened campaign.: : : : : : : :There are currently eight premier ision football clubs in Shetland, all of which have been in existence for dferent s of time.Scalloway are the oldest, dating back to , with Lerwick sides Celtic and Thistle being able to trace their beginnings back to the early part of the th century.Spurs and Ness United both emerged during the s, with Whitedale, Whalsay and Delting joining the senior league more recently.Someone suggested to me that a best XI from each could be selected, to give players and supporters something to ponder over during the current period of uncertainty.There will no doubt be controversy over this, but that’s what opinion is all about.

This technology exists. If we simply used the electricity to generate hydrogen, and store it just like the old city gas, we can run all our power needs through hydrogen fuel cells. Simple, cheap and clean. Or we could let global heating destroy our children#s future because nobody wants to see a big windmill near their property. I#m old enough not to care.To give a hand to each.#To leave the oyster-bed.#The sun#s shining here and like the old oyster, I can#t be bothered, either, John. Have a nice evening, do.Love it, thanks JT 🙂No real need for fuel cells. Hydrogen was % of coal gas, can be stored in gasometers and burnt in gas fires and used to power piston engines, gas turbines and most conventional heating systems. A hell of a lot cleaner than burning wood chip. Now forget the windfarms, obsolete technology, use tidal generation and mini modular nuclear.That way we will have a living planet worth saving, not a mass of concrete, steel and fibreglass.I#m not sure windfarms are quite obsolete yet# with the technology that is available at scale onshore wind is the cheapest source of new electricity. Perhaps not on peat bogs though. That#s not to say we can#t do better with other renewables.PS circa Dads Army, I am not that old!!!At  dollars a barrel so called renewables will need to reduce costs by a huge margin to compete with oil. At the current oil price of less that  dollars a barrel wind, tidal and solar no hope.Renewable energy is not produced in barrels. Where did you hear that We continue to burn oil and gas because the infrastructure is there and the investment has been made. But when it comes to investing in new electricity generation, onshore wind is the cheapest. Also # I am not sure how such a low price is beneficial to the oil industry what with their high fixed costs As a patriotic Brit I am all for us standing on our own two feet and generating cheap and reliable energy. Shetland aside, as a nation we are net importers of oil and gas. Why rely on the likes of Russia or our Middle Eastern friends when we can spend that money at home and have jobs for Brits producing clean and plentul energy  Let#s stop living in the s. Let#s have clean, reliable British energy instead.I tend to lean in the direction indicated by John Thomas.For reasons of cheapness , safety and reliability I can’t see why wind and tidal forces should not be the primary options for energy generation. Winds are unlikely to stop blowing and sea tides are unlikely to dry up , so how can they not be major considerations Nuclear power is also in the running provided that the associated risks can be accepted. No matter what the no doubt wellintended may suggest, there ARE risks which do not raise their ugly heads with wind and water. Reliable , sustainable , and non polluting.

However, this is a constantly-changing situation and there may be a need to reapply restrictions after they are lted.#It is only when we are sure the virus is under control that we can even start to ease any of the restrictions because the virus will not have gone away.“The virus is progressing at dferent rates around dferent parts of the country.

I tried keeping them in all day but I ended up with an ear infection.I tried noise-reduction headphones – very expensive – but anything to keep out that incessant -decibel shrieking.I even tried wearing them whilst gardening and playing an early Queen album at full volume: “Sheer Heart Attack” – that should drown it out,it doesn’t give me one …What next I was so sensitive, or to give it its psychological name – “sensitised” – that I could even pick out the faintest suggestion of a chaffinch on a TV programme.It might be while watching the golf or some Jane Austen adaptation with a scene near some trees – and that blooming chaffinch was there in the background. Why doesn’t anybody  notice it What next  What next to do  Chop all the trees down around the house, down to ground level – that’s what next to do.And so I take an axe and like a deranged lumberjack, I fell every Sitka spruce within earshot.I cut down the white fuchsia to within feet of the ground, and the sessile oak and the sycamores and the rowan and the Swedish whitebeam – the lot, all down to within a few feet of the ground.That should do it. Just tell everyone it’s to give the deciduous trees more space, and the coppicing of what’s left will make them grow all the stronger.And then, next spring – all potential perching sites cleared from near the house….but the traffic!You open the door and there is a car stopped, looking at us and we look out of the window and there is a car stopped looking back at us….What a state to be in!Quick – replant some mature trees to provide an instant screen. The Christmas trees from past years with root balls still intact – they should do it and that escallonia and the New Zealand holly – evergreens to block the view of the road.This is madness. One month I am cutting down all the trees the next month I’m desperate to put them back!There is humour here.Someone calls when the trees have disappeared only to find that when next they visit, just months later, the trees are back again – some fully grown.Complete amazement: “Things don’t half grow fast here!”Thankfully, it’s an episode from the distant past.Time is a great healer I gradually managed to rewire my brain circuits and become habituated to the noise of the chaffinch.I can laugh at it now, but it shows how fragile and vulnerable the human mind can be.And so to the news that’s on everyone’s mind – coronavirus.As someone over , I am trying to minimise the risk of catching it and passing it on. Self-isolating is a daunting prospect and who knows how long this lockdown will last and what the future will bring I am reminded of that classic story from : “The Monkey’s Paw” by WW Jacobs. “Without, the night was cold and wet … ‘Hark at the wind … Path’s a bog and the road’s a torrent.”Gosh! This is far too close to home.The tale has been adapted many times for radio, television, film and theatre, and the full short-story text is available on the Internet.In the present circumstances it would be in poor taste to dwell on the details.Suffice it to say, the message is a salutary one, beginning with the anonymous quote: “Be careful what you wish for, you may receive it.”As I sit here in this eerie quietness – no more tourist traffic rumbling by and stopping outside our gateway – I cannot escape the jarring irony.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ben-ak-wind-farm.jpg","title":"renewables firm launches support fund for north west skye","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineHouseholds in North West Skye will be able to access grants of up to £ to help them through the coronavirus crisis thanks to a new major pledge from a renewable energy firm.has announced a fund for the communities around its windfarms to help alleviate the impact of the Covid- outbreak.The company is donating £, to be shared between the community benefit trusts which administer funds from its  wind farms in Scotland, England and Wales.Jason Bold, Chair of Dunvegan Community Trust who administer the funding from Ben Aketil Wind Farm, said: “Whilst we navigate these challenging circumstances in our rural community, Falck Renewables Covid- grant has offered us much needed funds to collaborate with local groups.#Dunvegan Community Council has been very responsive and progressive to set up a Community Fund, which we are proud to back with Falck’s kind support.”The Trust has joined forces with Dunvegan and District Community Council to establish a community fund offering financial support to anyone in the community council area experiencing financial hardship due to the Covid  virus.Grants will be generally given to support immediate needs and be limited to £ per household.The community fund will be facilitated and regulated by Skye and Lochalsh Citizens Advice Bureau.John Laing, chair of Dunvegan and District Community Council, said: “The Dunvegan Community Council are aware of the dficulties many iniduals and families are experiencing during these exceptional times.#We have launched the Dunvegan Community Fund to assist those in our community who are in need of assistance as a result of the Covid  virus and are delighted to have generous support of The Dunvegan Trust and Falck Renewables whose generous support have made our fund possible”Managing Director of Falck Renewables UK, Richard Dibley, said: “We have a close relationship with the communities around our wind farms and their response to the current challenging situation has been as proactive and heartwarming as we would have expected.#They are already involved in helping the people and organisations in their area who need it most and we were keen to support them.”Dunvegan Community Trust has also made a £, donation to the Skye and Lochalsh Community Food Bank.Food bank chair Davina McCluskie said: “We are very grateful for the grant from the Dunvegan Community Trust which will go a long way in helping those in need.  We have seen an increase in users at the foodbank and I fear we will see many more in the coming weeks.#We have no paid members on the food bank committee #

Leo Mansell will graduate from Queen#s University Belfast today in an online #ceremony# brought forward to enable hundreds of students to bolster staff numbers as the health service faces its greatest ever challenge.Dr Mansell , originally from Manchester and who hopes to pursue a career as a surgeon, came to Northern Ireland five years ago to study medicine and will take up a post on a hospital ward in the coming weeks - two months ahead of schedule.He said: In normal times, medical students finish their final days on placement in the first or second week in May and then they have six weeks between graduating to start working as a foundation one doctor in August, but obviously give the current climate and need for staff to help support the frontline, that has all had to be moved forward.We were askedwe wanted to begin working earlier, so there has been a voluntary aspect to it and I can safely say that the majority of students were up for the challenge.It#s not that it was necessarily a no-brainer for me given the personal risk and the risk to family and people you might be living with, but I think that is overridden by getting the opportunity to support your future colleagues in the NHS.I think we are as prepared as we can be.In one way we are more prepared because it hasn#t been as long since we have been on the wards as it would have been normally, although in saying that it will be a challenge and I#m sure there will be people working outside of their comfort zone.There#s no getting away from how dficult this will get at certain points, it#s going to be very dficult, and there will be dficult decisions probably about our own personal health, but I feel that the trusts have done everything they can to maintain staff safety.I#m sure everyone has had an internal conversation with themselves about what they might see or what might happen in the coming weeks, it#s only natural, but I know we#ll be working as a team and the trusts and university will be there to give us support.While medical students graduating today are missing out on the opportunity to celebrate the end of their degree together, Dr Mansell said he is looking forward to meeting up with his fellow doctors once the pandemic is over.I think that under the circumstances, everyone is happy enough and understanding of the fact that we can#t have a proper graduation ceremony but the university has said they will do something at a later stage, so it will be an opportunity for us all to get back together and have a bit of a debrief almost, he explained.I#m happy that I#m able to graduate early and I#m sure that when we look back, once we#re on the other side of this pandemic, there will be a pride that we were able to do it and contribute, it#s why we became doctors in the first place.Healthcare students across Northern Ireland are graduating early to help tackle the coronavirus crisis.Final-year students from social work, nursing and medicine degrees are joining the NHS, with some nurses already working in hospital wards across the region.Students from Queen#s University Belfast and Ulster University approaching the end of their final clinical placements have been asked to join the profession early.Under the programme, newly qualied doctors will take up posts in the hospitals where they completed their most recent placement.This is because they have gone through the induction process and are familiar with the hospital environment, fellow staff and procedures.However, they will not necessarilyto wards where they have worked previously as many services have been reconfigured in preparation for the coronavirus pandemic.Newly qualied doctors will work alongside other clinicians, assisting them in a iety of roles.Meanwhile, legislation has been developed to enable final-year student nurses within six months of registration to go into the NHS in a paid capacity.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

However, the Department of Health said it was committed to developing a fair and effective scheme for providing le assurance.But Dr Tom Black said the scheme announced by Health Secretary Matt Hancock means certain groups of doctors will not receive their full pension entitlement in a move he described as penny-pinching by the Westminster government.He also said he was no longer willing to put forward doctors to work in Covid centres or wards because their family would not receive the usual entitlementsthey died.We will instead, and this is what we have been doing for the last month, we will put forward older doctors like me who are more at risk because governments won#t pay a pension to the widows of the younger doctors, that#s not acceptable, he said, speaking to the BBC#s Talkback programme.Dr Black said that when the Covid pandemic emerged all healthcare workers stepped into the breach.Nobody hesitated, there were problems with PPE, we took it on the chin and kept working, he said.He claimed doctors will now be disadvantagedthey die in those circumstances after normally expecting to receive double their annual pay and approximately half their pension. Certain groups of doctors such as GP locums or people who are out of the pension scheme, retired members who came back or very young doctors who are in the first two years of their career, those groups will not get that.We#re basically saying to their widow, widower or their children, do you know what, there#s  grand but you won#t get the pension rights that you would normally get in these circumstances.Now that#s not a kick in the teeth, that#s a terrible insult to the profession who stepped up in this circumstance. That#s really not acceptable, it#s penny-pinching from the Treasury in London, he said.In a further comment to the Belfast telegraph, Dr Black said: Scotland is offering standard death in service payments to those in that situation, but what is being proposed by Matt Hancock is a single one-off payment that would leave families without an ongoing pension. In the best case no-one would ever need to access this fund, but some doctors’ families might. In particular younger doctors who have not joined the pension scheme, those who have answer the call tofrom retirement to assist with the pandemic, locum doctors who do not have a fixed employer and those who may have opted out of the pension scheme. We know that our Minister is still weighing up how best to use this funding in Northern Ireland and we would strongly urge that it is a full death in service benefit not a single payment. Our frontline doctors and their families deserve nothing less.Speaking on Monday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: Nothing can make up for the tragic loss of a loved one during this pandemic. We owe a huge debt to those who die in service to our nation and are doing everything we can to protect them.“Financial worries should be the last thing on the minds of their families so in recognition of these unprecedented circumstances we are expanding financial protection to NHS and social care workers delivering publicly funded care on the frontline.“We will continue to strive night and day to provide them with the support and protection they need and deserve to keep them safe as they work tirelessly to save lives.”A Northern Ireland department of Health statement said the health minister was considering which model represents the best fit for Northern Ireland and which most equitably reflects the important contributions being made for our health service.Dferent approaches are being taken in dferent UK regions and the Minister will reach decision shortly, having examined the dferent options.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk bde .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dbaadd--e-d-dbcc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk bde .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dbaadd--e-d-dbcc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk bde .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dbaadd--e-d-dbcc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk bde .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dbaadd--e-d-dbcc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk bde .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dbaadd--e-d-dbcc_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"UKWhen will I be able to hug my close family, gran asks ministersA grandmother has askedhugging close family will be one of the first steps out of lockdown, in the first question from the public at the Downing Street coronavirus press conference. \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk f .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ecedcb-bbe--a-daa_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk f .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ecedcb-bbe--a-daa_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk f .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ecedcb-bbe--a-daa_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk f .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ecedcb-bbe--a-daa_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk f .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ecedcb-bbe--a-daa_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"CoronavirusNHS to restart vital services including cancer careThe NHS will restart some vital services, including cancer care, from today, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said, as he admitted the government has a lot of work to do to hit its , a day testing target. ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

First Minister Arlene Foster said the collective effort is ‘far from over’. Northern Ireland is still in a ‘critical moment’ during the first wave of the pandemic, she explained, and with one misstep the country faces the prospect of the virus reproduction rate going back above one – increasing the spread. She added: “Now is not the time for government and businesses to gamble with peoples’ lives, we need to proceed cautiously and ensure that we’re doing everything we can to prevent another spike from occurring.” googletag.cmd.push Governments around the world are ‘wrestling’ with the dilemma of ‘when is the right time to lt restrictions’, she said. The press conference heard that the decision to open cemeteries was criteria led and based on scientic advice. “The Executive will continue that on every decision we reach relating to COVID- but you also, the greater Northern Ireland community, have a role to play,” the DUP leader said. She acknowledged efforts made by the public through social distancing and isolation and recognised that people want to leave the confines of their homes. But added: “Now is not the time for impatience to get the better of us. No-one should act ascoronavirus has been beaten, it hasn’t, and we still have some way to go. googletag.cmd.push “If people go back to gathering in large numbers in public spaces andthey do not listen to the guidance on social distancing then they run the risk of another spike. “Having come so far in containing this disease it would be more than just a crying shame to undo that collective effort, it would be catastrophic for families, for communities and for a society as small as Northern Ireland’s.” The DUP leader referred to the speech made by Boris Johnson this morning when he said that thought must be given to ‘relaxation’, the path plotted carefully andthe government moves too fast it may be forced to ‘slam on the brakes’ again. Arlene Foster said: “That’s not what we want to do and we can’t afford to get too far ahead of ourselves.” She reiterated the point that the government would be led by scientic and medical advice and urged people to stay at home when possible. Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said it is ‘disappointing’ to hear reports that some people have decided to relax restrictions themselves. “That kind of attitude is wrong, it is reckless and it is endangering live. Until a vaccine is found it means that we must co-exist with this virus. “And that means a radical change to how we live our daily lives for some time. For the most part people have been making personal sacrices for that greater good. And thank you for that. “But we must keep going, we must save lives. There is light at the end of the tunnel, there certainly is light, but we need to keep doing what we’re doing now in order to save lives and help our healthcare staff cope in our healthcare system.” She praised the public and health workers and welcomed news of pound.m of additional support for care homes which will help with additional staff to care for those in isolation and enhanced cleaning. LOCKDOWN Restrictions will be reviewed up until May  but Arlene Foster again asked people to be patient. In terms of contact tracing, a pilot is starting here this week and an App is being developed. Meanwhile, Michelle O’Neill welcomed the British government stance, ‘albeit late’, of test, trace isolate - a policy endorsed by the World Health Organisation . “The countries which have been most effective are those that have moved on this very quickly. “Contact tracing needs to be rolled out right across the community because that is part of our success in being able to counter the position that we could find ourselves in later where,you’re facing a second wave of this, that our ability to stop that will come down to how effective we are in contact tracing,” Sinn Feacutein’s Vice President added. She encouraged people to ‘keep doing what we’re doing’ as it has ‘proven effective’. DEATH TOLL Michelle O’Neill gave a figure of  deaths -  announced in total by the Public Health Agencybased on figures provided by health trusts – but said NISRA statistics would bring it up to . When questioned about Sinn Feacutein leader Mary Lou McDonald’s comments that the pandemic is an ‘accelerant’ for a united Ireland, Ms O’Neill said an all-island approach to health ‘makes sense’ and is not a political point. “We live on an island and it’s a natural advantage so it’s important we use that.” While Ms Foster said her priority is saving lives and it’s ‘regrettable’ that other leaders are ‘naval gazing’ at this time. The southern government is planning to publish a report outlining a strategy for the easing of restrictions. When probed about Northern Ireland’s own lockdown exit strategy the First Minister did not indicatethat would happen in the North or indeed provide any timeframe. Michelle O’Neill added that talk of relaxation feeds into public discourse before reinforcing the government’s key message for people to stay at home.

In an ideal world, they would have received detailed scrutiny at the Assembly before becoming law. However, we are not living in an ideal world at present. The overriding priority at this time is protection of le. Regulations to enforce and encourage social distancing have a vital role to play in that regard. These regulations were introduced by the Department of Health, with support from all Executive Ministers. Responsibility for enforcing them rests with the Police. Regulations are never going to cover all potential aspects of human interaction and behaviour in a modern society. There will inevitably be some shades of grey. That’s the reality of le. The Police have rightly made clear that officers will apply a “reasonableness” test on occasions when decidingsome behaviours may breach the regulations. googletag.cmd.push The overriding principle in applying any reasonableness test is not what may be reasonable for people to want to do, but what is reasonable in achieving the aim of preventing the spread of the Covid- virus, balanced with other risks and considerations. Officers applying discretion are a regular feature of modern day policing. Discretion is by its nature case specic. Ultimately, any decisions can be challenged through the courts to determinethe “reasonableness” test has been correctly applied in all the circumstances. It should also be noted that people will routinely be given the option of complying with any requirement tohome without the need for any penalty to be imposed. Thankfully, the vast majority of people across our community are supportive and co-operative with these emergency measures. googletag.cmd.push Whilst understanding people’s desire for clarity in what constitutes an offence under the regulations, it is not always possible to give inidual answers for the countless hypothetical scenarios which may arise. Notwithstanding this, the public health guidance is clear: stay home and only leave home when it is essential. For our part, we are deeply concerned that the current discourse may serve to undermine public confidence in the overall regulations, and encourage some people to ignore the strong guidance from the NI Executive with potentially devastating consequences.

The current coronavirus pandemic means that all schools across the city are currently closed but last year the Education Authorityproposed discontinuing Groarty Controlled Integrated Primary School.  The school has been a part of the local community for over  years. It attained Integrated status in  and is the only Integrated school on the West Bank of the city. A final decision regarding its closure was expected to be made by the department and new Education Minister Peter Weir at the beginning of this year. googletag.cmd.push Now, in a statement to the Derry News a spokesperson for the Department of Education said: “As a result of the COVID- emergency situation Area Planning activity has largely been paused, with available resources deployed in support of the Department’s emergency response to COVID-. “The school will be advised as soon as any decision has been made, however an exact timeframe for a decision cannot be given at this time.” The number of pupils at the school has fluctuated over time but has not risen above  in the past ten years. Ahead of the   school year - before proposals were announced to close -  pupils enrolled. googletag.cmd.push Following that decision numerous parents took the decision to transfer their children to other schools which was reflected in enrolment figures of just  for the   school year. One parent, Diana McLaughlin, previously told the Derry News that uncertainty surrounding the school’s future and looming transfer tests meant she had to take the ‘dficult decision’ to move her son and daughter where. The EA proposed closing Groarty Integrated Primary School, situated on the Coshquin Road, at the end of August . Parents were ‘devastated’ when first informed of the plans on April , . Schoolchildren from the school then hand delivered letters to then education chief, Derek Baker, when he visited Derry’s Guildhall imploring him to reconsider. The school has a capacity for  pupils and it was anticipated that by transforming from a controlled primary school to a controlled integrated primary school in  that numbers were going to swell. ‘DISAGREE’ A consultation received  objections from amongst others the Board of Governors, staff, parents, a local resident and the Northern Ireland Council for Integrated Education. Points include the fact it is the only integrated primary school in the cityside and considerable distance to the other one, Oakgrove IPS, in the waterside. It caters for children with special needs and has a strong shared educational programme with Gaelscoil na Daroacuteige. The case was also made that housing developments are planned for the area which could improve numbers. However, the EA says that other schools close to Groarty, such as Irish Medium School Gaelscoil na Daroacuteige and Catholic Maintained Schools St Eithne’s and Holy Family have many unfilled places. The EA argues that the school ‘does not operate within its in-year budget’, the school’s enrolment falls ‘well short’ of the Sustainable Schools Policy criteria for primary schools, set at  pupils for a rural school and  pupils for an urban school. And says in addition there are more than two year groups within a classroom as the school operates as a three teacher school. EA therefore recommends that Groarty Controlled Integrated Primary School discontinues with effect from  August .

There was no substitute for the excitement. It lit a flame that still burns to this day. He squeezed every drop from a playing career that also saw him play three seasons in England and bank a letime of memories. His knees eventually told him enough was enough and when Crusaders changed their mind on an operation, it was time to take stock.“It was too much money and I was over . They were not going to take a chance and you couldnt really blame them,” Jim recalls.His football career was far from finished. Like when Stoke chose not to renew his contract, Jim McGroarty was at a footballing crossroads. But he was far from finished.He would later manage Limavady United. Before that, the Lettershandoney native steered Dungiven Celtic to nine trophies during the clubs golden era.When Patsy McGowan signed McGroarty, for Sligo Rovers on hisfrom Stoke, he would play in the League of Ireland on a Sunday, after managing Dungiven - where he now lived - on a Saturday.It was a hectic time. They trained on Tuesday and Thursday nights, opposite Sligos Wednesday and Friday schedule.He managed the Ballyguddin side for best part of  years. The only blip came during his time playing in the Irish League, when mixing both, under the same governing body, wasnt permitted and the Dungiven reins were passed on to Brian Ward.Ward was one of three Briansto score in the clubs - win over Derry City to land the NW Intermediate Cup in  – their first trophy in intermediate football. “The boys must have drank for a week,” McGroarty remembers. The club had made the ambitious move to elevate themselves to intermediate football in . McGroarty is very grateful to them for putting him through his coaching badges. He holds an A licence, achieved over a year with visits to assess his progress.During the s, Dungiven lost three Intermediate Cup finals, but enjoyed two runs in the Irish Cup that included a - defeat at Crusaders.As a player, McGroarty lost an Irish Cup final with Glenavon, to a late Glentoran penalty in  and was on the Sligo Rovers team that fell - to Dundalk in the  FAI Cup Final in front of , fans.He tapped into this experience during Dungivens cup runs.“If we had a home tie. I would get boys in at nine oclock on a Saturday morning and go through all the set pieces,” he outlines.The players would then have breakfast together, all paid from their own pocket, before relaxing and ing to Ballyguddin for the game later in the day, with everything fresh in their mind.“It worked,” McGroarty feels. “You were playing the top teams from the amateur league in Belfast or the intermediate leagues in Ballymena.“A lot of the games were tight, the score was - and one of the set pieces you worked on that morning...you could get it in the last five minutes and somebody stuck the ball in the back of the net. You are trying to add a bit of professionalism.”On away days, the Dungiven players were asked to wear a collar and tie. It was about turning up at senior clubs, well-dressed. It was a statement of intent. googletag.cmd.push *** When you quiz Jim McGroarty on the secret to Dungiven Celtics success at the start of the millennium, the word modesty perfectly describes the unspoken narrative coming down the line. He plays down his role in the success that was to follow. In addition, he is not one for name-checking. Hed have to mention about  men. There is a genuine respect he has for the collective force the players delivered. They are not just words. The tone in his voice reinforces pride this era brought him. He is a football man through and through,After knocking on the door, silverware was a regular visitor to Dungiven during the s. Four intermediate leagues and cups were won under his watch.The breakthrough came with the   league title. The following season, they secured the double in a year to remember that saw the reserves and thirds win their respective leagues. McGroarty also remembers the generation before.“There were a hell of a lot of players over the years, who were really good footballers. They never won a league and some of them didnt even win a trophy,” he said.It was followed by a core of young players, who fused into a winning formula as the attitude began to change.“First of all, they wanted to play football. Second of all, they wanted to do well and thirdly, they wanted to play for Dungiven Celtic. When you put that together, you dont have a lot to do as a manager or a coach.” googletag.cmd.push  Jim managed Dungiven to their first Intermediate League title in   Even snow wasnt an obstacle in preparations. On one occasion, two balls were sent to a shop up the town to get sprayed and ed Massey Ferguson red, McGroarty recalls.“It allowed us to train away in the snow, thats the sort of commitment we had. We had a good bunch of lads, it took a few years and we built the team up and, apart from a couple, the rest of the players were from around the town.”Another important ingredient in Jims cocktail for success was having players battling for places. With  to  players jockeying for  jerseys, the manager had the players in the palm of his hand.“If you have a boy who plays for you on a Saturday, without caring how he plays because he knows he will be on the following weekend – thats never going to work.”“Even Seamus Harkin - who is now Chairman - and the younger boys at the time. They didnt want to go and play for the reserves. They wanted to be on the bench for the seniors and get a few minutes. Thats the type of young boys you had at the time.”Getting into the first team was all that mattered. And McGroarty was beginning to get a kick out of management, as the trophies began to roll in.“You train hard on a Tuesday night, you set your stall out on a Thursday night how you are going to play on a Saturday andyou see it all coming together in front of you, thats what being a coach and manager is all about.”With nine trophies to his name, he jokes about ato the club. “Maybe, Ill take it into double figures,” he laughs.Jim McGroartys enthusiasm, even now, is infectious. *** Jim is the oldest of a family of four. Growing up, as a avid Manchester United supporter, he was infatuated with George Best. He donned the same boots and jersey, as he played around the fields of Slaughtmanus. “It couldve ended up -a-side,” McGroarty jokes. “If you werent quick or strong, you maybe touched the ball once. Parents were out at dark to get you into bed, for school the next morning.”He mixed soccer and Gaelic football for much of his career. One of the earliest memories was of winning a league, championship and nine carnival cups - all in one year - with the now defunct St Marys Mullaghbuoy.The newly formed St Marys Slaughtmanus won the  intermediate championship. Jim was on the team and managed them to the  final, a one-point defeat by Castledawson.He remembers coming on as a sub for Derry minors at Omagh in a - to - defeat to Armagh. McGroarty bagged - in a tempestuous encounter that saw him end up in hospital with a suspected broke nose. He wasnt on his own.“Harry Joe McWilliams was buried up against a post and Frankie Trainer had a broken nose, he was hit from behind.” Jim adds.When Derry won their second Ulster U title in , Jim was on the squad that included Joe Irwin, Gerry McElhinney, Colm McGuigan and Alfie Dallas.By then, his soccer career was beginning to develop.He first played competitively with Tamnaherin Youth Club in the Saturday morning league. At that time, he also played for Foyle Harps in the Summer Cups, which was growing in popularity with prizes up to pound, for the winning team.After impressing a - win over Buncrana in the final, at Maginn Park, he was spotted by Finn Harps and signed for the first of three times by Patsy McGowan.At the age of , Jims talents also attracted Glasgow Celtics scouts, but his -day trial was cut short by injury after a week.“I caught a boys studs and with a swollen foot, that was end of that trial. It was a great experience too...I played at Parkhead and at Ibrox.”At that time, the squad wouldve trained behind the goals at Parkhead.“There used to be a five-a-side,” McGroarty remembers. “Kenny Dalglish, Danny McGrain and Paul McStay were there. I got to play five-a-side with them, which was good.”By the time Stoke came calling, he was in a better place. The experience and lessons from Celtic were invaluable. He knew the level that was required. *** When McGroarty signed for Finn Harps, it was at the end of the  season. He got a handful of games, but he was stronger the following year and became a regular. At the end of the season, he played in an exhibition game for the Harps against an invitational select.”“I couldnt believe it...I was on the same pitch as Frank Stapleton, Liam Brady and Johnny Giles. I was nearly a full international team, but I didnt know that Stoke City were at the game and they asked me over for the trial.” This time he impressed and signed a one-year deal in October . Going over to unknown territory didnt come into the decision-making process. Jims decision was easy.“I wouldve swam over and I wouldve played for nothing. I always wanted to be a footballer.” McGroarty said, with an enthusiasm that hasnt dwindled over the years.“George Eastham was the Stoke manager and he scored the winner in the  League Cup final - over Cha...a lovely man.”McGroarty made his first team debut away to Oldham. At the team meeting in the hotel before the game, Eastham gave their new signing the responsibility to marshal the defence on any Oldham free kicks outside the box.“Can you line the wall ” the manager asked.“I can boss, I used to be a bricklayer,” was Jims instinctive answer, and he remembers the rest of the team killing themselves in laughter.When McGroarty later went to apologise, Eastham was having none of it.“You dont need to apologise. I like boys with a bit of character,” he said.Playing professional football was a dream, but a step up in class.“When you go to training every day, you cant be taking your foot off the pedal or looking over your shoulder,” Jim explains.“You have to knuckle down, the boy beside you is looking for your jersey and up the line, you are looking for somebodys jersey.”During McGroartys time at Stoke, there was a change of manager, as Eastham was replaced by Alan Durban. He brought Howard Kendall in as player coach.“Kendall was the best player I played alongside,” states McGroarty, of the man who would lead Everton to First Division , FA Cup and European Cup Winners Cup honoursJims contract was renewed every season for three years, before he was given the bad news that his time at the club was over.“When the last contract was up, they didnt resign me. There was not a lot of security in it. It is a rat race, you have to accept it and not rest on your laurels - you have to get on with it,” he said.“I wasnt back in Ireland two days until Patsywas on the phone and signed me at Sligo Rovers and I would then move back to Ballybofey when he later joined Finn Harps.”By the mid-s, Derry City moved from the Irish League to join the League of Ireland. The Candystripes expressed an interest in snapping up McGroarty, be he declined.“I didnt go back to the League of Ireland. I was scundered with the travelling. Youd have to go Derry for training and even when I was with Finn Harps, it was like an away game.“If you went to Waterford or Cork, it was an overnight stay in those days, but you had  players packed into a -seater minibus. If you were lucky, you got a seat andnot, you are lying on top of the kit-bags.”It was time for a change. His three years at Glenavon saw him come close to winning a cup, but they lostto Glentoran. Defender Andy Russell clawed a ball off the line with his hand and Jim Cleary dispatched his spot-kick to the top corner of the net.“I missed a sitter in that game,” McGroarty recalls. After Glenavon, he moved to Crusaders for the final leg of his career. Eventually, the knocks caught up with him and injury forced his hand.It was time to plough all his energy into Dungiven Celtic. Once a competitor, always a competitor. And the players bought into his philosophy of management. His experience, coupled with his desire for success, was the catalyst for what was to follow. With nine titles to his name in his time as manager with Dungiven Celtic, would heto make it the perfect  “Never say never,” he concluded.

Thats the type of young boys you had at the time.”Getting into the first team was all that mattered. And McGroarty was beginning to get a kick out of management, as the trophies began to roll in.“You train hard on a Tuesday night, you set your stall out on a Thursday night how you are going to play on a Saturday andyou see it all coming together in front of you, thats what being a coach and manager is all about.”With nine trophies to his name, he jokes about ato the club. “Maybe, Ill take it into double figures,” he laughs.Jim McGroartys enthusiasm, even now, is infectious. *** Jim is the oldest of a family of four. Growing up, as a avid Manchester United supporter, he was infatuated with George Best. He donned the same boots and jersey, as he played around the fields of Slaughtmanus. “It couldve ended up -a-side,” McGroarty jokes. “If you werent quick or strong, you maybe touched the ball once. Parents were out at dark to get you into bed, for school the next morning.”He mixed soccer and Gaelic football for much of his career. One of the earliest memories was of winning a league, championship and nine carnival cups - all in one year - with the now defunct St Marys Mullaghbuoy.The newly formed St Marys Slaughtmanus won the  intermediate championship. Jim was on the team and managed them to the  final, a one-point defeat by Castledawson.He remembers coming on as a sub for Derry minors at Omagh in a - to - defeat to Armagh. McGroarty bagged - in a tempestuous encounter that saw him end up in hospital with a suspected broke nose. He wasnt on his own.“Harry Joe McWilliams was buried up against a post and Frankie Trainer had a broken nose, he was hit from behind.” Jim adds.When Derry won their second Ulster U title in , Jim was on the squad that included Joe Irwin, Gerry McElhinney, Colm McGuigan and Alfie Dallas.By then, his soccer career was beginning to develop.He first played competitively with Tamnaherin Youth Club in the Saturday morning league. At that time, he also played for Foyle Harps in the Summer Cups, which was growing in popularity with prizes up to pound, for the winning team.After impressing a - win over Buncrana in the final, at Maginn Park, he was spotted by Finn Harps and signed for the first of three times by Patsy McGowan.At the age of , Jims talents also attracted Glasgow Celtics scouts, but his -day trial was cut short by injury after a week.“I caught a boys studs and with a swollen foot, that was end of that trial. It was a great experience too...I played at Parkhead and at Ibrox.”At that time, the squad wouldve trained behind the goals at Parkhead.“There used to be a five-a-side,” McGroarty remembers. “Kenny Dalglish, Danny McGrain and Paul McStay were there. I got to play five-a-side with them, which was good.”By the time Stoke came calling, he was in a better place. The experience and lessons from Celtic were invaluable. He knew the level that was required. *** When McGroarty signed for Finn Harps, it was at the end of the  season. He got a handful of games, but he was stronger the following year and became a regular. At the end of the season, he played in an exhibition game for the Harps against an invitational select.”“I couldnt believe it...I was on the same pitch as Frank Stapleton, Liam Brady and Johnny Giles. I was nearly a full international team, but I didnt know that Stoke City were at the game and they asked me over for the trial.” This time he impressed and signed a one-year deal in October . Going over to unknown territory didnt come into the decision-making process. Jims decision was easy.“I wouldve swam over and I wouldve played for nothing. I always wanted to be a footballer.” McGroarty said, with an enthusiasm that hasnt dwindled over the years.“George Eastham was the Stoke manager and he scored the winner in the  League Cup final - over Cha...a lovely man.”McGroarty made his first team debut away to Oldham. At the team meeting in the hotel before the game, Eastham gave their new signing the responsibility to marshal the defence on any Oldham free kicks outside the box.“Can you line the wall ” the manager asked.“I can boss, I used to be a bricklayer,” was Jims instinctive answer, and he remembers the rest of the team killing themselves in laughter.When McGroarty later went to apologise, Eastham was having none of it.“You dont need to apologise. I like boys with a bit of character,” he said.Playing professional football was a dream, but a step up in class.“When you go to training every day, you cant be taking your foot off the pedal or looking over your shoulder,” Jim explains.“You have to knuckle down, the boy beside you is looking for your jersey and up the line, you are looking for somebodys jersey.”During McGroartys time at Stoke, there was a change of manager, as Eastham was replaced by Alan Durban. He brought Howard Kendall in as player coach.“Kendall was the best player I played alongside,” states McGroarty, of the man who would lead Everton to First Division , FA Cup and European Cup Winners Cup honoursJims contract was renewed every season for three years, before he was given the bad news that his time at the club was over.“When the last contract was up, they didnt resign me. There was not a lot of security in it. It is a rat race, you have to accept it and not rest on your laurels - you have to get on with it,” he said.“I wasnt back in Ireland two days until Patsywas on the phone and signed me at Sligo Rovers and I would then move back to Ballybofey when he later joined Finn Harps.”By the mid-s, Derry City moved from the Irish League to join the League of Ireland. The Candystripes expressed an interest in snapping up McGroarty, be he declined.“I didnt go back to the League of Ireland. I was scundered with the travelling. Youd have to go Derry for training and even when I was with Finn Harps, it was like an away game.“If you went to Waterford or Cork, it was an overnight stay in those days, but you had  players packed into a -seater minibus. If you were lucky, you got a seat andnot, you are lying on top of the kit-bags.”It was time for a change. His three years at Glenavon saw him come close to winning a cup, but they lostto Glentoran. Defender Andy Russell clawed a ball off the line with his hand and Jim Cleary dispatched his spot-kick to the top corner of the net.“I missed a sitter in that game,” McGroarty recalls. After Glenavon, he moved to Crusaders for the final leg of his career. Eventually, the knocks caught up with him and injury forced his hand.It was time to plough all his energy into Dungiven Celtic. Once a competitor, always a competitor. And the players bought into his philosophy of management. His experience, coupled with his desire for success, was the catalyst for what was to follow. With nine titles to his name in his time as manager with Dungiven Celtic, would heto make it the perfect  “Never say never,” he concluded.

He was impressionable. In September, he was listening intently to the wireless, as Derry launched their first bid for Sam Maguire. He wasnt just reliant on the radio waves to savour the magic. Twice a week, the Derry team would train in nearby Newbridge and he got to meet his heroes. Where the towns Credit Union now resides, John Joe Diamonds cafe was located on Bellaghys Castle Street. Tommy, now  years of age, vividly remembers the scene as his mother Cathy made plates of sandwiches for the players before they ed home, to the four corners of the county. googletag.cmd.push “When you get the county stars in your kitchen twice a week, I got to know them all well and I was friendly with them through the years,” Diamond begins. Sean OConnell would later train the Derry teams that Diamond would captain to All-Ireland glory. “I played with him too, hiscareer lasted a brave while...he mustve been  when he was still playing with Derry,” Diamond adds. When Bellaghy All-Ireland winning manager Harry Cassidy took charge at county level, he called Diamond into the senior  in the early s. He was part of the team that toured New York and Connecticut. googletag.cmd.push “We went out to play exhibition matches out there. It was an experience to get out there. We also won the Wembley Tournament two years in a row.” The semi-finals were played in the iconic stadium, with the final played out in New Eltham. “I was taking a look the other day and I think I have played in every county in Ireland,” Diamond added, of a county career that ended in . But it was the s, when he left his greatest imprint. *** In , Tommy was on Bellaghys first county U championship winning team and was a minor champion three years later. At county level, Derry minors had yet to reach an Ulster final. The first of Diamonds three years in the county minor team began in the closing stages of a game in Dungiven, with Antrim in the lead. “I remember being threw on as a late sub and two balls were kicked right over the full-back,” he recalls. “They landed in my hands and all I had to do was to kick them into the net and I think we won by a point.” After another season of consolidation, a place in the final again eluded them, but there was a crux of a team still eligible for . “We knew from , we had a good  and we didnt lose many,” said Diamond, who was made captain. When Derry defeated Tyrone, Donegal and Fermanagh on their way to the  minor league final, they did so without the St Columbs Derry players who focussed on winning the MacRory and Hogan Cups, under the management of former Fermanagh player Fr Ignatius McQuillan, just four years after tiptoeing onto the Ulster Colleges scene. “Then seven or eight of them came onto the Derryteam – which was some help,” Diamond added. “FrShields was the man who put the backbone into us and Sean , he put all the final touches to us, he was a great trainer.  Sean OConnell, Tommy Diamond and Fr Seamus Shields with the Tom Markham Cup “We trained twice a week up in Ballinascreen and after training we went into Timoneys for sandwiches and milk every night.” Aside from the medals and success, Diamond is grateful for the memories and friendships built up, that stood the test of time. “If any of us ever meet each other, it is a half day session. Thats the great thing about it.” They hammered Donegal in the  first round, in Dungiven, but the win came at a cost with a knee injury to Chris Brown. In the semi-final it was a dferent story and it was a narrow - to - win over Down, a game that saw Phil Friel sustain three fractured ribs. “We beat Cavan in the final in Clones,” Diamond remembers. “It was a hard, dour match and a typical Cavan match with hard hitting and not a lot of finesse about it.” Derry were Ulster champions and with the Hogan Cup now in the county, there was an air of quiet confidence as the squad headed to Croke Park. Diamonds first memory of their epic semi-final with Roscommon was giving the referee his name. “I was marking Dermot Early that day and we got booked after  seconds,” he laughs. “It was some start to a semi-final. I caught the ball and as soon as I caught the ball, he hit me. He was about two seconds late, I hit him with an upper cut and put him on the broad of his back and both of us were booked.” Derry were - to - winners and with the game in the melting pot in the second half, Early pulled a penalty wide of the posts when the Rossies were four points in arrears. “The great Miacutecheaacutel Oacute Muircheartaigh was commenting and he called it the game of the golden goals. Every one of them was hit in from  yards, absolute screamers.” It was time for one last push. Derry had one hand on the Tom Markham Cup. So too had Kerry. *** The Kingdom had the breeze and thanks to some wastefulness in Derrys attack, Kerry were a point ahead at the break. Sean OConnells pep talk worked wonders and the cogs began to turn. Tommy Diamond and Seamus Lagans performance at midfield helped them to a - to - win. “I dont remember an awful about it.” Diamond says. Earlier in the day, GAA President Alf Murray asked himhad his speech prepared with the customary lines of Irish, should Derry win. “I had no Irish, so he penned out the speech with the phonetics and I tucked it into the pocket of my shorts”. The speech mustve slipped out during the game and as he stood on the presentation podium, Diamonds pocket was empty. “I am the first man to just speak in English, I dont think it went down to well but I just had to go ahead with it,” he continued. The team stayed out in Portmarnock on the Saturday and Sunday night. Just recently Donal Mullan, son of county official at the time Paddy, handed Diamond a ticket from the post-final banquet. “The entrance admission was just  shillings,” he added. The homecoming on the Monday took nearly six hours, with crowds coming out along the route to salute the new champions. There were bonfires as the team crossed the county border. On the final leg of the journey, the victory cavalcade of cars coming to Maghera streamed all the way back to Tobermore. The Brackaghreilly Pipe band led John Mulhollands decorated lorry up Maghera street. “I remember being up on the top of the cab. They had a seat and I was tied into it and held the cup,” Diamond proudly beams. “It was some occasion for the firstchampionship to come into Derry.” Two years later, with Diamond still as captain, Derry won the Ulster U title before getting trounced by Mayo in the All-Ireland semi-final in Charlestown. “We were favourites for Ulster but we just werent ready for it ,” Diamond admits. “We were a year young and the next year we were all U and Sean OConnell was still in charge of us.” In , Derry swept all before them in Ulster, with only Down putting up any sort of resistance and Seamus McCloskeys - tally was enough to see off Monaghan in the final. Kerry came to Ballinascreen for the semi-final and trailed - to - at half-time, but had pegged the team back to a point midway through the second half. Diamond was switched to mark Brendan Lynch and a Kevin Teague goal helped swing the game in the home sides favour. Holders Mayo were shocked by Offaly in the other semi-final, setting up a Croke Park meeting with Derry. The Oaks led by nine points at the interval with the Faithful County down to -men after the dismissal of Eugene Mulligan, before easing to victory. He was the first player to captain his county to minor and U All-Ireland titles. But for Diamond,  was far from over. Despite playing three years for Derry minors, it took Diamond time to break into the Bellaghy senior team who would win seven titles during the s. He was dismissed, along with his brother Laurence, in the  semi-final win over Kilrea and missed the final. “Bellaghy had a strong  of players,” Diamond points out. “I only got my place on the senior team when Anthony Madden went to Australia and I got his place at right corner back.” There was nothing  only football and it is still the case. Karls son James is the first of his grandsons to play senior championship for the blues. The recent underage production line represents the hope in the new batch in the club. “They have the greatest facilities and have everything you would want and we have no team,” Diamond adds, referring to the -year gap since the John McLaughlin Cup rested in Bellaghy. “At that timewe had no facilities but we had teams....its a change of circumstances.” He picked up the third of eight senior medals in , but the Bellaghy adventure was only beginning. Once again, Diamond was involved in a first as the club were crowned Ulster champions in the first year of the competition. Frankie OLoane scored - in a  point win over Pearses of Belfast in the first round and it was followed up by a victory over a Newry Mitchells side that hammered Bryansford in the Down decider, thanks to goals from Sean Lee and Tom Scullion. Bellaghy beat St Josephs in the final, a combination of Ballyshannon and Bundoran, played on December  in the falling snow. “They had Brian McEnf and about  county men in total. They had a strong side and they actually, by right, shouldve beat us, but we were that dogged that day,” Diamond states. “It was a really cold day and we got a bit of a lead up against them. It was a rearguard action against the breeze in the second half but we held out.” There was no All-Ireland series until  when East Kerry won the title. Bellaghy retained their Derry title with a win over Slaughtneil in  before losing the final the following year to Newbridge. When they bounced back, it took them to their finest hour. A - to - win over Lavey saw them win Derry title number . In Ulster, they defeated Ballybofey, Ardboe and Teemore before taking on Armaghs Clann na nGael in the Ulster final. A - to - interval lead put them on their way to a facile win. In the All-Ireland series, it was a dferent story and Frankie OLoane was twice their savour. Tommy Diamond, Hugh McGoldrick and Chris Brown led from the half-back line against Portlaoise, but it was OLoane who tied the game late on, before Hugh Donnelly scored the winner in a - to - win. In the final, they took on the might of UCC and once again it took OLoane, with his seventh point of the game, to level matters late on. When Hugh McGoldrick broke up a Cork attack, Brendan Cassidy went on to score and the Tones were crowned All-Ireland champions. “Theyhad  county players, they were from all around. Moss Keane was full-back, he was a big tower of a man but Tom Quinn was too much for him.”   All-Ireland club - Tommy is on the extreme left of the front row Later that night, Cassidys lorry ferried the team up and down Bellaghy street to a heros welcome. Absent was the cup, as East Kerry didntit. “It is the sort of thing they cant take away from you,” Diamond said, of achieving the pinnacle of club football. He would later turn to management and managed Derry for  months at the end of the s, but stepped down after he felt the County Board were not allowing him full control of the team. Before that, at the start of the  season, Bellaghy were unable to get a senior manager, so Diamond put his name forward. The Tones went seven seasons without a title and werent tipped for glory. “Nobody wanted to take it. A lot of these managers, unless theyare good they are not interested at all,” he said. After winning the Derry title, Diamond took his side to Crossmaglen for the opening game of Ulster. After a battle, Bellaghy came out on top, but lost in the next round by a point at home to Castleblayney. “We shot in and shot inand Blayney went on to beat Burren in the Ulster final. I went to it in Dungannon, it was a dour match, - to -,” Diamond recalls, as Burrens quest for four-in-a-row failed. ”I said I would take themas far as I can, there wasnt much hope for them. We got them going rightly and I was disappointed we didnt win an All-Ireland with that team. I felt they were good enough.” *** Another passion is golf. He has been member of Ballymena Golf Club for  years, where he still plays with lelong friend Gerry McCann. He has been a member of Moyola, where he is now the Ranger.  Tommy andSeve Ballesteros Another friend of Diamond, Willie Cassidy, pulled off a coup in  by bringing Seve Ballesteros to play a round at the course, just months after he won the Masters. “I think it cost pound, to bring him to Moyola, he was number one in the world and Willie got him,” Diamond adds. “It is the only course in the north of Ireland I think he played on and I had the honour of caddying for him, I was the lowest handicapper at the club. “I marked his card, he countersigned it and it is up in the clubhouse for ever more amen.” A letime of memories. Aside from the current lock-down, the chat continues every Thursday night over the winter. Tommy plays cards with friends and his sons. It is a ritual. The social hub and the legacy of parents John Joe and Cathys cafe continues. RELATED - Derrys path to their first taste of September. Click here...

Monaghans Gerry Mone gave Derry a torrid time in the Ulster semi-final at Casement before Joe Brolly came from the bench to give the spark needed for victory. The Ulster final saw Damian Cassidy gracefully skating over the puddles in Clones, in a game the Derry players were going to win, come hell or high water. It took a late block by Tony Scullion on Manus Boyle and Brian McGilligans intervention to deny Donegal another goal chance, when they had crafted a two on one situation. googletag.cmd.push In the All-Ireland semi-final, it wasnt until Johnny McGurks wonder pressure point that Derry would eventually rest easy against the Dubs in the season-defining clash. Anthony Tohills outstretched arms of celebration before Joxers kick went over the bar will always stick in my mind. The branch of the Derry Supporters Shop at the top of Hall Street in Maghera was thronged with people in the lead-up to the final. There was so much expectation that Sam wouldon the Monday evening. In a powerful video interview with Shane Stapleton on #OurGame, Tony Scullion touched on how he felt the wave of emotion was almost congratulating them as they departed for the final. It was a Cork team that hammered a poor Mayo outfit in the semi-final, I thought. With hindsight and on watching the final, from someone outside the camp, the mental strength was Derrys greatest asset that day. Cork had nine players who had played in an All-Ireland senior final. They had played in five, winning two and losing twice, once after a replay. Derry, while being the upcoming team and having dispatched the  and  champions on their way, they were untested on the biggest day of the season. HAMMER BLOW From my position on the Hill that day, I can still see Joe Kavanaghs number  jersey cutting through the Derry defence before hammering past the advancing Damien McCusker. It was the first goal Derry had conceded since June , that sunny day in Castleblayney when Derry fans applauded Monaghan scoring their only point of the first half. In the second half, three Farney goals had Oakleafers shaking, before getting out with a draw. Kavanaghs goal brought me back to that day. Derry never do anything the easy way. Colin Corkery won the first two balls off Gary Coleman, John ODriscoll beat Tony Scullion to an early possession. Corks running game had Derry in all sorts of trouble. Fergal P McCusker and Henry Downey couldnt get to grips with Don Davis and Joe Kavanagh respectively. When Derry eventually went on an attack, Mark OConnor won the first battle with Seamus Downey. Derry were - to - in arrears. Was Derry going to fail the final hurdle again  Brian McGilligan then won a vital possession at midfield. It was small, yet massive. Later in the attack Damian Bartons trademark disguised hand pass - where he looked one way and gave the ball the other - found Johnny McGurk who fired over Derrys first point of the game. It took a series of Cork mistakes to swing the momentum. Teddy McCarthy dropped a routine pass from Niall Cahalane and McGilligan curled between the posts. The now dominant Tohill hoovered up a loose Teddy McCarthy pass before going on a storming run to win a free and Gormley slotted over. The Oaks were now only two points in arrears and growing in confidence. McGilligan turned the screw even tighter. John Kerins had been targetting Barry Coffeys height advantage over Johnny McGurk on his kick-outs. Across came McGilligan to win a ball he had no right to. It was inspirational. The big man launched a pass forward that eventually found Damian Cassidy. Cass swung a ball into the square. Seamus Downey made up the guts of  metres to take advantage of a mix-up between Kerins and OConnor, before punching to the net. Boom. Derry were on top. Heaney nearly beat Kerins to the ball for a further goal chance and, earlier, the Cork stopper made a brilliant save to deny Cassidy. Then referee Tommy Howard made two wrong calls. Cahalane buried Enda Gormley off the ball and got off with just a lecture. Seconds later, Tony Davis was harshly sent off for a lazy lunge at Dermot Heaney, with Howard gesturing the use of an elbow. It was the wrong call. The narrative was always that the punch woke Enda up. Thats harsh I feel. There was very little ball directed into his corner before that. Everything went thought Brolly. However, it lit a fire and Gormley went on to score six points. Derry twice led by three points and when Dermot McNicholl curled over, after the interval, it shouldve been the catalyst to push on. Brolly was toasting Brian Corcoran and shouldve been used more. John ODriscoll started the second half at wing forward, with Colin Corkery in on Tony Scullion. But when Don Davis inch-perfect pass took out the entire Derry defence, ODriscoll drilled to the net and Cork were ahead. Thats where the Derry resolve was again tested. And they passed. There was no sign of panic. McGurk was allocated the extra-man role. Fergal P McCusker, Henry Downey - and later McKeever – ran the show in defence. With the extra man, Damien McCuskers outfield experience saw him use short kick-outs before they were even invented. For all their control, they failed to ask any questions of Derrys defence, but when Gormley levelled the game, the Ulster champions superior fitness carried them into the three point lead. Even then, Derry did it the hard way. With Steven OBrien now at full-forward, Cork began to throw the dice for the last time. If every the term getting over the line was used, then this was all so relevant. Derry had performed better on other days during the Eamonn Coleman era, but winning was the only thing. Failure wasnt an option and they refused to be denied their moment of glory. It was richly deserved. Its just a pity there was no back door and that Eamonn was controversially sacked. This group had so much more to offer. RELATED - Sideline View wants Derry to fast forward.Click here...

The smiling photograph of the little girl in a First Communion dress was taken by former Derry Journal photographerLarry Doherty in the s. It lay uncollected in a box for many years until Larrys daughter, Moira Doherty, discovered it recently and posted it on Facebook in the hope of reuniting it with its owner. Tracy Morroi, who is a teacher at St Patricks Primary School in Pennyburn, was contacted by a friend who noticed the striking resemblance to her, but at first she thought it was just a coincidence. googletag.cmd.push I said Im not old enough to be in a black and white photograph, said Mrs Morroi. As time went on more and more people contacted her who suggested it was her mum, Maura Wade nee Doherty, who passed away almost seven years ago. At first Mrs Morroiwas unsureit wasdefinitely her, and she didnt want to collect the picture in case it belonged to another family. However, she was inundated with calls and messages from people who remembered her mother as a young girl and confirmed it was indeed her in the picture. Maura Dohertywas born in  the front room of her grandparentshome in  Bishops Street, which is now the Oakgrove Bar. googletag.cmd.push Her parents Maureen and George Doherty then moved to  Long Tower STreet where she grew up and attended the Wee Nuns school. My mammy worked in all the factories so everybody knew her, explained Mrs Morroi. She was a really bubbly person and would have chatted to anyone. Its been really nice to hear from people who remember her. I picked up the picture and it really made day. It was so emotional. Its so special to get it because I only have two other pictures of my mother as a child.  Mrs Morroisaid the whole experience has been very emotional. I had been doing a redding out the house this week and I had come across a lot of my mothers things so I was just having wavesof emotion anyway and this happened. Ive just been crying my eyes out.

I have been so impressed with how well the children of our District have done in dealing with this strange time we are in.

The Cornerstone City Church is based in the Duke Street building that was previously home to the Red Rooms nightclub. It also houses the churchs Hope Centre which offers food and clothing banks, counsellors and money management help and advice. The Hope Centre has been forced to close due to the coronavirus, but the drive-through food bank service allows them to continue their charitable work whilst observing social distancing. googletag.cmd.push Church elder, John Loughrey, explained: People are able to drive straight in off the Duke Street Roundabout and we have staff in high vis jackets to direct them. When they come in we just ask them to pop their boot open and we can place the bags of food inside. They dont even have to get out of their car. They are only there for a few minutes and it means we can still serve people the best we can. Mr Loughery said the recipients of the food parcels, which contain tinned and dried goods and fresh vegetables, have been very grateful. googletag.cmd.push There was a man who contacted us on Facebook andhe has seven kids. He said you have no idea what this means to me And there was another woman who rang for help and we left her round three bags of food. She rang us back in tears saying this is exactly what I need. We are here tohelp. If Jesus was here he wouldnt be sitting with the rich and famous hed be among the people. As the Cornerstone City Church cannot hold services at the moment it has moved them online. We usually have people from across the city coming to our church, said Mr Loughery. There are people from the Protestant community and the Catholic community. Were here to worship God. People are searching for something right now. There are people that are coming to us for food and they are wondering what are they about  They are sussing us out and thats great. “Our online videos have been shared and viewed thousands of times,” said Mr Loughrey.

The Cornerstone City Church is based in the Duke Street building that was previously home to the Red Rooms nightclub. It also houses the churchs Hope Centre which offers food and clothing banks, counsellors and money management help and advice. The Hope Centre has been forced to close due to the coronavirus, but the drive-through food bank service allows them to continue their charitable work whilst observing social distancing. googletag.cmd.push Church elder, John Loughrey, explained: People are able to drive straight in off the Duke Street Roundabout and we have staff in high vis jackets to direct them. When they come in we just ask them to pop their boot open and we can place the bags of food inside. They dont even have to get out of their car. They are only there for a few minutes and it means we can still serve people the best we can. Mr Loughery said the recipients of the food parcels, which contain tinned and dried goods and fresh vegetables, have been very grateful. googletag.cmd.push There was a man who contacted us on Facebook andhe has seven kids. He said you have no idea what this means to me And there was another woman who rang for help and we left her round three bags of food. She rang us back in tears saying this is exactly what I need. We are here tohelp. If Jesus was here he wouldnt be sitting with the rich and famous hed be among the people. As the Cornerstone City Church cannot hold services at the moment it has moved them online. We usually have people from across the city coming to our church, said Mr Loughery. There are people from the Protestant community and the Catholic community. Were here to worship God. People are searching for something right now. There are people that are coming to us for food and they are wondering what are they about  They are sussing us out and thats great. “Our online videos have been shared and viewed thousands of times,” said Mr Loughrey.

Michael McWilliams writes a weekly column in the Irish News called Dodgy Tackle. For this weeks column, which is in todays Irish News, McWilliams puts forward his best ever team. The criteria for selection is based on the premise that his World XI must be made up of up of players from dferent countries who have never played for the same club sides. McWilliamssfinal selection includes many of the worlds best known footballers - and our very own Felix Healy. googletag.cmd.push His full line-up is: Manuel Neur , Junior , Paul McGrath , Paolo Maldini , Felix Healy , Paul Gascoigne , Dragan Stojkovic , Zinedine Zidane , Kevin de Bruyne , Kenny Dalglishand Diego Maradona . Explaining his choice of Healy in the midfield, McWilliams states that it was a straight fight between the Derry man and the Colombian World Cup Carlos Valderrama. He writes: Carlos Valderrama nearly went in here, but when it comes to moustachioed midfield fulcrums, the Derry man gets in on a dodgy decision. And it is Dodgys decision. Hes playing at the base of the Diamond. Just across from the Sandwich Co. Pulled the strings for an early eighties Coleraine side that delighted this young fan, all shimmies and subtlety. The only things hairier than his upper lip were the legs bulging out of a pair of royal blue Adidas hotpants, briefly ditched for a pair of white ones as he led the Honduras midfield a merry dance for  thrilling minutes at the  World Cup. Swapped blue and white stripes for Candy ones later in the decade and a treble was duly delivered. Can now be seen leading punters a merry dance in music venues across the north-west. googletag.cmd.push And McWilliams had a message for anyone who believes that Colombian star Carlos should have got in to his side ahead of Healy. You can stick your Valderrama up your Bogside, he writes.

In addition, another  food parcels were delivered by last Friday.Local council officials have been working in partnership with their colleagues across local government, health trusts and the Department for Communities to set up the hubs.Down Leisure Centre has been transformed into a processing centre to organise deliveries, with other sites currently being identied should they be required, with staff working in split shts, while observing social distancing and other safety protocols.The new service covers the councilrsquos seven even district electoral areas with deliveries focusing on food supplies with the packages including items such as tinned and dried food, cereals and some essential toiletries.Requests for help from the council and its community and voluntary partners are arriving via Access NI which is processing calls from across Northern Ireland on a freephone helpline.Council chairman Charlie Casey says he is pleased to see just how many of the districtrsquos most vulnerable residents have been able to receive food parcel deliveries recently.ldquoOur sincere thanks go to all our partners who worked with us over the Easter break to achieve this and all the volunteers who have already kindly offered their help, he continued.ldquoIt is important that we provide a leline to those following medical advice to shield to protect their health, or who are self-isolating, and have no other means of assistance.The council chairman said that during the local authorityrsquos COVID- response, it will continue to work hard to deliver essential supplies to those who need them and ensure no-one feels alone or isolated at this dficult time.A COVID- community helpline is operational, with those in vulnerable groups seeking support asked to make contact between am and pm, seven days a week, with the helpline managed by Advice NI who are processing calls from across Northern Ireland.The Freephone number is   , while the email is covid@adviceni.net. Contact can also be made by texting ACTION to .All calls that are relevant to the councilrsquos community co-ordination hub will be passed on to the local authority for action, including referrals from the South Eastern and Southern health trusts.The Downpatrick-based County Down Rural Community Network, the Confederation of Community Groups in Newry and Community Advice Newry Mourne and Down are acting as lead organisations for the community groups involved in this response.Members of the public are reminded that the Down Leisure Centre remains closed and that anyone who requests a food parcel will have it delivered to them directly.The County Down Rural Community Network in Downpatrick is acting as one of the lead organisations for the community groups involved in the response to the new food parcel distribution service.Any other volunteers who wish to assist in the delivery of food and supplies or ensure residents on their own at this time receive phone calls to help ease their isolation, are encouraged to register with Volunteer Now via their website.Further information about volunteering is available at www.volunteernow while organisations can identy COVID- volunteering requirements at www.volunteernow organidations.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd April 2020 Castlewellan.jpg","title":"Castlewellan dressmaker makes scrubs for frontline workers in lockdown  ","story":"FROM wedding dresses to scrubs ndash thatrsquos the new order of work for Castlewellan bridal dressmaker Shirley Moorhead.Sewing a range of scrubs for nurses and nursing home workers has replaced Shirleyrsquos normal orders of stunning gowns, veils, bridesmaidsrsquo dresses and outfits for the mother of the bride and groom since the coronavirus lockdown.The  year-old was facing a full order book for spring and summer weddings until the lockdown resulted in many weddings being pushed back to the autumn and beyond.The woman behind Fairytale Designs, the mother of five was determined not to let her inactivity and seamstress skills go to waste during the lockdown over the last four weeks.She is now sewing scrubs for over  hours each day in her garden workshop, after  years of experience as a dressmaker.ldquoIrsquom sure that in any home where there is a sewing machine, local people are also doing their bit and working to sew to support the local effort with PPE, said Mrs Moorhead.ldquoAt the moment, while Irsquom being very productive, I canrsquot earn a living with what I do, like so many others. Therersquos plenty like me and we are all in the same boat.ldquoIt started when I received requests from nurses who I made their wedding or bridesmaid dresses in the past for. I ended up making scrubs for some entire hospital wards, male and female and in a iety of sizes.ldquoThat widened out to sewing for staff at local nursing homes. I just want to do something to help, particularly for nursing homes as my daughter, Abigail, works in one in Castlewellan.There is plenty of work to be done to complete her bridal orders, but Mrs Moorhead feels that her priority is for scrubs.ldquoMy weddings have been pushed back until October or November or even next year. There are things that would hamper me. I canrsquot see brides to fit them and I wouldnrsquot want to go too far ahead with orders in case some people gain weight or lose weight, she said.ldquoAlso,the wedding changes seasons, that can change the outfit ordered in style and colour. For instance, a mother of the bride might want a jacket as well or might want to lose or shorten sleeves so I feel I canrsquot go to far ahead with my orders. Brides have needed me to reassure them that everything will be alright for their big day, whenever it happens, and I can absolutely promise that.ldquoAbigail is getting married in November and her sister, Johanna, is getting married next May, so they will be the most special wedding dresses I will make in my letime. I feel that I have to keep going with the scrubs as itrsquos so important. However, I will make sure that I will provide all outfits that have been ordered from me. It has become a family affair as Mrs Moorheadrsquos husband, Joe, who also is unable to work as an engineer in the lockdown, helps with the pressing of the garments while Johanna helps with the sewing.Mrs Moorhead has been creating the scrubs from donated material, much of it brand new, and is very grateful for the donations..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd April 2020 Crossgar.jpg","title":"Crossgar man takes Chance with move to Hong Kong 26 years later opens superstore  ","story":"AT the age of  and without a word of Cantonese, Richard Bowsie left his family and friends behind in his home village of Crossgar for a le of adventure in Hong Kong.Twenty-six years later and now a married father of two, Richard has found love, happiness as well as a successful career as the owner of two second-hand furniture stores in the huge cosmopolitan city with over seven million inhabitants.He and his locally-born we, Mavis, run nd Chance Furniture that provides shoppers in the city and online across the world a virtual Aladdinrsquos Cave with thousands of unique and affordable items - ranging from lacquered tables to pool tables, Chinese vases to Balinese drums.While other young ambitious men were told to lsquogo westrsquo, Richard went east, finding Hong Kong to be every bit as much the land of opportunity as the United States.The father of eight year-old daughter Kailey and son George, whorsquos coming five, literally changed his le in three days when he made the decision to fly to Hong Kong.From working as a leguard at the Tropicana centre in Newcastle and at the former Down Leisure Centre, the former student of the High School, Ballynahinch, had been close to completing his BTec qualication in Leisure Management at the former Newcastle College of Further Education.He ped out of his course a few months shy of graduation due to bullying. While his parents, Margaret and Ken, a well-known architect, were shocked at their middle sonrsquos decision, they were not surprised.He recalled: ldquoI had a friend who had travelled to Hong Kong three months previously. During a phone call he told me that the new international airport was under construction and work was easy to find. Three days later I arrived.ldquoI decided to go by myself as I had been trying to find an exciting job at home for a while but kept being told I was too young for the roles or lacked experience. My parents knew I was ambitious and how frustrated I was becoming with my career ambitions being knocked back all the time.Richard admitted he hadnrsquot a clue what to do once he arrived and took a bar managerrsquos job as an interim position as many of the airport workers drank there.His first job at the airport turned out to be with the Northern Ireland company, Lagan Construction Group, before going to another Belfast-based company, Rotary International, with which he worked for two years.ldquoI felt excited and nervous all at the same time when I first moved to Hong Kong, said Richard.ldquoThe first thing that struck me was the heat, after leaving cold and damp of home. Arriving in  degrees and high humidity was certainly a shock to the system, despite having been on family holidays to France most years with my family and once to America with a cross community group. The heat in Asia was a massive shock.Having grown up in a rented manse on the Rademon estate, Richard swapped a quiet rural existence for the hustle and bustle of the global port and major commerce centre. It was still under British rule and would remain so for another three years before it was handed back to China.Richard said: ldquoLanguage was the biggest shock but I made it my mission to learn the language and enrolled in YMCA lessons but also managed to pick it up from also working alongside locals.It wasnrsquot long before Richard felt confident enough to start out his own business, an electrical supply company which employed  staff.He said: ldquoI knew after the first few months that Hong Kong was going to work for me,you worked hard, nothing could hold you back, age was not an issue here. Opening a business here was very straight forward, just need a bank account and register an address.He met his we Mavis during his first month in the city and the two have been together ever since.They opened their first store in  in the after seeing a large amount of good furniture being thrown away each week and were determined to do something that would reduce the waste and help the environment. Within months, they had outgrown this store and relocated to their current , sq ft premises in Tuen Mun.The couple has recently opened a second, , sq ft premises in Chai Wan which is closer to the busy capital.Fluent in Cantonese for many years, Richard has seen Hong Kong go through many challenges, not in the least with the recent coronavirus pandemic.ldquoHong Kong has handled the virus very well, having been through SARS and bird flu before, said Richard. ldquoAs soon as we heard there was an issue over the border in China, Hong Kong went straight into prevention measures before even being advised to. Now everyone wears masks and observes hygiene measures.The preventative measures must have been successful as the city recorded zero deaths on Monday for the first time since the outbreak before Christmas.While the move to Hong Kong was the right one for Richard, he still misses home and his brothers and sisters, Simon, Gillian, Laura and William.He said: ldquoI miss the food, the greenery and, of course, my family who are all still in Northern Ireland. I miss being close to home as I have lost family members and grandparents.ldquoBut we come home as often as we can. Mavis and the kids love Crossgar, especially AJs Diner.

OrsquoHare has the advantage as he is stable amateur to Navan trainer Noel Meade.Noel McParlan also got on the scoreboard and he was the top local point-to-point rider.Last week proved to be a sad one for local racing on Easter Sunday as Dr Fitz Gillespie, MBE, passed away suddenly at the age of .

He is survived by sons Pat and Rollo, daughter Gael, son-in-law, daughters-in-law and grandchildren.A memorial service will be held for Dr Gillespie at a later date as the funeral was private due to Covid-.

Now they have really pulled the carpet out from under our feet at an advanced stage. Irsquom bitterly disappointed at this kind of timing.The problem arose when the Housing Executive was in the final stages of preparing a scheme, which has been on the drawing board for several years, when it was told of the Government objections to a number of potential sites, including the Burren River catchment area and another, the most important, at the Dundrum Road end of the town.The Executive had finally got an agreement to purchase from the landowner of the Dundrum Road site and had made a final routine check with the Government departments before clinching a deal.

It is also my understanding that Newry, Mourne and Down Council and Northern Irelandrsquos other  councils are working closely alongside the government department at this time.Cllr Walker said he would like to see the recycling centres open again, suggesting that strict controls could be introduced to only allow two vehicles access them at any one time.ldquoI would also appeal to people at this time to keep their waste until the recycling centres are open again. I appreciate that many people who are not at work at the moment are making the most of the time they have to clean out their homes, sheds and garages and I commend them for being active.ldquoHowever, it simply isnrsquot on to load up you car with waste, drive to a secluded area and dump it. I just donrsquot understand the mentality of people who engage in this kind of behaviour.Cllr Walker also said the cost of clearing up illegal waste is borne by the districtrsquos ratepayers.ldquoWe have the ironic situation that those who dump their waste illegally end up paying for its removal viatheir rates. This beggars belief, he declared. ldquoThe stupidity of those who dump waste in secluded areas is beyond me.Cllr Walker added: ldquoThe time has come for common sense and people really need to catch a grip of themselves. One of the most worrying aspectsof illegal dumping is that waste which ends up in fields is sometimes eatenby livestock which often results in deadly consequences. To those who dump their waste illegal my appeal is stop now.The local council has confirmed that it is receiving increasing reports about fly-tipping across the district since the start of the COVID- crisis. But the organisation insists that it is currently able to manage the issue within existing resources.A council spokesman said that the organisation continues to work closely with the Environment Agency which also performs a key role in addressing incidents of larger illicit dumping.On the issue of reopening the districtrsquos household recycling centres, the spokesman explained that the decision is continually being reviewed in line with government social distancing measures.He continued: ldquoFly-tipping is illegal and the council will strictly enforce this where evidence can be gathered. Responding to fly-tipping incidents also erts important council resources away from providing other essential services.The spokesman confirmed that the council is unable to remove illicitly-dumped waste from privately-owned land, explaining that where this occurs, both it and the Environment Agency has the legal powers to request its removal.He said the council will enforce this where required.The spokesman added: ldquoThe council would urge the public to avoid producing any unnecessary waste, including undertaking DIY and house and garden clearances at this time due to the considerable pressure being placed on public services.ldquoAny additional waste that is produced should be stored for future disposal at the household recycling centres once they re-open.

In a glittering playing career, the Ballykinlar man went on to win two more All-Ireland medals and established himself as one of the legends of the Gaelic football. Here, he selects his greatest Down team of all timeHIS name alone is enough to rekindle treasured memories of a time when Down football reigned supreme.Paddy lsquoMorsquo Doherty had the deadliest left foot in Ireland and he used it to maximum effect as Down swept all before them.Incredibly, itrsquos  years ago that Down took the sporting world by storm when they defeated Kerry to win the All-Ireland senior football title for the first time. It was also the first time that a team north of the border had won the Sam Maguire Cup.To reinforce their emergence as a new power in Gaelic football, Down retained their title the following year with Paddy as captain of the side which defeated Offaly and he was also a member of the Down team which won a third All-Ireland for the county in , Kerry again falling victim to the Red and Black machine in the final.As well as his three All-Ireland medals, Paddy won seven Ulster Championship, seven Railway Cup and three National League medals. He was the leading scorer in Ulster for eight seasons and in Ireland for three years.Now in his s, hersquos followed Downrsquos fluctuating fortunes ever since, relishing in theof the glory days in the early s, sharing in the disappointment of the barren times and casting a critical eye from the sidelines, though always with the optimistic outlook of the true fan.So what does he believe is the greatest Down team of all time Not surprisingly, given their accomplishments, hersquos largely selected his choice from his team-mates from the Sixties mdash though with typical modesty, he has not picked himself for the starting .ldquoYou have to remember that the Down team of s was the first to bring the Sam Maguire over the border, he says.ldquoThat was a really big achievement and we had beaten Kerry in the final. We had shown we were the best team in Ireland and we proved that again the following year in the final against Offaly after beating Kerry in the semi-final. We also beat Kerry in the  final, which meant that we had beaten them three times.ldquoKerry have always been the benchmark. If we had not beaten them, they would have won another three All-Irelands.Asked how his Down team would fare against present day sides ldquoItrsquos a dferent game now, what with the blanket defence and other things, but the Down teams of the s would have won in any era. Well, thatrsquos what I think, though Irsquom sure there are many people who would disagree. Eddie McKay Eddie won two All-Ireland medals with me in  and . He was a very good goalkeeper believe me, always safe, dependable and brave. He was an excellent shot stopper and made many excellent saves. I also played against him many times when Ballykinlar took on Dundrum. These were local parish derbies and everyone was trying to kill each other, but somehow Dundrum never managed to beat us. George Lavery George also won two All-Irelands in  and . He was the quiet man on the team, but there were few better man markers in the game and he would have been a star in any era. He had played a match of two for Antrim, but Maurice Hayes, who was secretary of the Down county board, persuaded him to sign for Down. He played as sweeper and was a good, tight marker. Leo Murphy Leo was a terric full back, tough and reliable. Not too many players could get past him and he could kick the ball a long distance. He also won two All-Irelands in  and . Pat Rice There was no one better than Pat Rice at catching a ball. His high fielding was magnicent and he was quick at clearing the ball. He gave away few chances and often kicked the ball out for Eddie McKay. He missed little and he wasnrsquot a dirty player at all. Dan McCartan One of only three Down players to win three All-Ireland senior medals along with Sean OrsquoNeill, Joe Lennon and myself, Dan is one of the all-time greats of Down football. He had outstanding ability, tackled hard and always looked for the quick clearance up to the front men. He could play anywhere as he showed when he moved to full back in the  final. Joe Lennon He was our captain in , though he did not play in the second after getting injured. He was a great captain and a terric leader. Joe placed a great emphasis on fitness and pioneered new coaching practices. He thought greatly about the game and was possibly ahead of his time. He was a very talented player. Tom OrsquoHare Tom played in the  team, but was good enough to get his place on any team. He was probably one of our best players that year. He was always steady and was great at delivering a ground ball. Jarlath Carey Jarlath won two All-Irelands in  and . He was a tireless worker, who was at home either in midfield or in attack. He was always forcing his way into the forward line and would wag his finger at me to go back into midfield to cover for him. I didnrsquot mind one bit, because he was good enough and I was fit enough to do what he asked. Colm McAlarney They called Colm lsquoThe Mighty Arklersquo after the famous racehorse because of his long strides up the field. Colm and Tom OrsquoHare were our two outstanding players in  and Colm was definitely one of the best midfielders in Ireland at that time, or any other time. Tony Hadden Tony won two All-Irelands in  and . He could fist the ball further than many players could kick it and he could also move into midfieldthings were going bad. He was tall and well built and could score a point as well as anyone. James McCartan A very strong player. Down would not have won anything without him because he took a lot of the abuse which would otherwise have been directed at me or Sean OrsquoNeill. He played a critical role in the  final against Offaly. We were two goals down in the first half and getting beaten. I crossed the ball to James who turned in mid air and put into the back of the net. Two more goals from Sean OrsquoNeill and Breen Morgan had us a goal up at half time, but it was his goal that turned things around. Sean OrsquoNeill You would have to say that Sean was the greatest Down footballer of them all. He was named in the GAA Team of the Century which says it all. We played well together, wherever I kicked the ball, Sean was there to get it. He had a wonderful sidestep and took a lot of abuse, but he never retaliated. He went on to become a successful manager and won the Sigerson Cup with Queenrsquos University. Mickey Linden Mickey was a flying machine and one of Downrsquos best ever forwards. He could blow defences away with his pace and score with either foot. He was also very versatile. You could play him anywhere and he would still be a threat.

She was selected for Team GBR and last year finished second in the IPF world championships in Sweden.Karen says the journey to her European title and new world record began two years ago.ldquoMany people just see the training and programme side of things, but there is a lot more under the surface, she explained.ldquoDue to starting the sport later in le and competing against lters with -plus years under their belts I had to go to every extreme to give my progression every possible advantage.ldquoAll my food was tracked and measured.

I noticed within the first several days that I was able to breath more easily in the mornings and I was coughing much less. I am not a smoker.ldquoThe incessant pace of traffic in the street has slowed to a hush and my window sills inside my house are much cleaner. Before the lockdown, I could have drawn a line across the sills with my finger and it would have left a white mark in the soot which would gather.ldquoHaving the time that lockdown has inadvertently provided, I decided I would respond to a call-out to have-a-go playwrights to write something about their experience of self isolation.Gavin describes the scene as he pulled out the plug to let the water away. ldquoIt suddenly came to me as I watched the water drain away that it was an analogy for humanity, that we too are in great danger of being sucked down the plug hole to oblivion.So I got ready and immediately wrote the whole play sitting on the edge of my bed. It took me  minutes and I spent the next three weeks reworking it until I was happy.Central to the play is Jake, a man in his late s, who is in self-isolation and being cared for by his put-upon daughter, Martha.Gavin explains: ldquoWhile shersquos out getting groceries, he ponders upon the plight of the human race as it is metaphorically sucked down the plughole to oblivion.ldquoThroughout the play, Jake is visited by several characters mdash a City shark who represents the financial markets, a Navy er who see that humanity is in terrible trouble, the Prime Minister and God, who commands a less-than-enthusiastic Jake to build an ark and save mankind.Gavin says Jake becomes overwhelmed thinking that itrsquos too big of a job to build an ark. Hersquos not surehe has got the energy.ldquoThe play also includes two young mothers debating a brutal and radical way to build a new plug from the flesh and bone of every misfit in society, two floating dim-witted teenagers and a dancing bath plug bearing a last minute solution to the problem, said Gavin.ldquoAt the end of the play, Jakersquos lottery numbers come up and his winning ticket appears in the beak of a dove mdash the Christian symbol for peace.Down the Plughole, which reads as a tragicomedy, shines a spotlight on modern society and its impending doomlove and kindness fail to prevail.Gavin says he has taken inspiration from two comic plays, One Man, Two Guvnors by Richard Bean and Government Inspector by Nikolai Gogol, and the classic novel by William Golding, Lord of the Flies.Gavin added: ldquoJake realises that in the end money is worthless and that love and good health, which are in short supply in the play, are all that is important.Amelia Madan, head of amateur plays at Josef Weinberger Plays, said: ldquoDown the Plughole is a hilarious, ludicrous and bold play for these crazy unchartered times.ldquoWe are delighted Gavin chose to put some of the uncertainty about out fate as a species we all feel, into words, with a generous dash of delicious absurdism and a fabulous ending..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd April 2020 Spa.jpg","title":"Spa Wells LOL provide gift packs to health workers  ","story":"LOCAL Orangemen have been looking out for frontline workers during the current public health emergency.Members of Spa Wells Orange Lodge distributed free gt packs which included Easter eggs and cosmetics for health workers based at two local nursing homes.Approximately  staff who care for elderly residents at Fishbourne House and Spa Nursing Home were thrilled to receive their pamper packs and thanked the lodge for thinking of them in the current situation.Lodge member John Aiken said they were delighted with the success of their community project and added they are currently working on another similar community-based initiative..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/9603183.jpg","title":"nathan carter concert helps heroes fund top  ","story":"PLEASENOTEIt is a tough time for our entire community and especially the business community.

This would be known as Serious Condition Criteria.While widely welcomed, what was not made clear was Departmental staff have discretion around who meets criteria and can overrule a claimantrsquos medical evidence.A number of enquiries were submitted to the Department under a Freedom of Information request.The responses are concerning.The Department stated legislation does not refer to serious conditions but rather whether there is a relevant change of circumstances. The decision not to reassess those with severe, lelong disabilities or health conditions who are unlikely to ever move into work: ldquoTook effect from  September , but did not result in legislative change.The Department was asked about the right of appealing a decision rejecting a claimant for Serious Conditions Criteria, who responded: ldquoThere is no automatic right of appeal against a determination which is embodied in or necessary to a decision. , a claimant has a right of appeal against an outcome decision rather than a determination, which is merely a component of the outcome decision.This was complicated for non-legally trained or represented claimants, so questions were put around full compliance with the Disability Discrimination and Human Rights.The Department responded stating it: ldquoDoes not hold any information relating to this hellip.may have been undertaken by DWP.A copy of the risk-assessment template used by the Department in instances of considering Serious Condition Criteria, was requested, but: ldquoNo template existsInstead, the response referred to assessment procedures where Departmental Healthcare Professionals advise on the re-referral period, and consider whether a claimantrsquos condition meets: ldquoThe new severe conditions criteria andno further assessments are required.However, the claimantrsquos own medical professionalrsquos opinion around Serious Condition Criteria could be over-ruled, with this decided by: ldquoAn Administrative Officer appointed by the Department.In respect of providing the legislation or guidance which permits the Department to overrule clinical opinion provided by a claimant seeking consideration under the Serious Condition Criteria, the response referred to ESA Regulations , which: ldquoProvides for the redetermination of whether someone has limited capability for work. The time period in relation to this is not set down in the legislation but is largely at the Department Decision Makers discretion ndash usually based on available medical evidence including medical reports from ATOS hellip The decision not to reassess those with severe, lelong disabilities or health conditions who would be unlikely to ever move into work, took effect from  September  but did not result in legislative change.As the Freedom of Information request was answerd prior to the restoration of devolution, the Department was asked with a Minister now in post, to comment on current processes around Serious Condition Criteria decision-making and in particular, how it can by discretion supersede a medical diagnosis by a claimantrsquos clinician. It was also askedprocedures are under review andthere is intention to bring forward legislation to allow for scrutiny or challenge.A spokesperson said: ldquo Anyone claiming ESA will be automatically assessed for the Severe Conditions criteria at their Work Capability Assessment by a Healthcare Professional. If the personrsquos condition or its al effects meet the criteria, the Department will be advised that no further assessments are required.In response to the overruling of clinical decisions, the spokesperson said: ldquoThe Work Capability Assessment looks at the al effects of a personrsquos condition, rather than the diagnosis itself. It is not a supersession of the opinion of their clinician.This dfered to the response provided prior to the Minister taking office, which appeared to show the Department was permitted to over-rule the evidence of claimantrsquos clinician.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The reality is we will look at the medical evidence. The Northern Ireland Executive will have its own flexibility and we may see across the country some iations we saw some iations going into lockdown as well. Itrsquoll be a decision that all four nations take together based on the evidence, he said.Mr. Lewis said he was aware of the complexities of Northern Irelandrsquos Border with the Republic of Ireland amid the pandemic, explaining that he has been meeting with First Minister Arlene Foster, Deputy First Minister Michelle OrsquoNeill and Taacutenaiste Simon Coveney.ldquoEven where there are dferences in the approach between the Republic and the North,there are,we know that we can make sure we are clear with residents why those dferences are there.ldquoThe challenge of having iations within Northern Ireland is how we manage that.An investigation in The Sunday Times at the weekend featured a Whitehall source claiming the government ldquomissed the boat on testing and PPEand ldquojust watched as the death toll mounted in Wuhan, China.The report also claimed that Prime Minister Boris Johnson missed five crucial COBRA meetings in the Cabinet Office in London.When asked to respond to these serious allegations, Mr. Lewis said: ldquoI didnrsquot recognise some of what I saw in the Times.ldquoI was in the Cobra meetings in January and February COBRA meetings are chaired by the Secretary of State in the Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms. Itrsquos a place, not a thing.ldquoWe were making decisions the scientists and medical experts were making decisions at that time and planning was going on. This is the point to judge it now when we have two months more evidence is dangerous and a misleading thing to do.Turning to PPE which has been an issue in Fermanagh, Mr. Lewis used his own constituency of Great Yarmouth as an example of where there has been ldquono problems with accessing equipment.He added: ldquoWersquove had gowns sent over to the UK, OrsquoNeills [sportswear] converted to gowns, there is gin distillery in your part of the world producing sanitisers.ldquoWersquore shting five and a half million pieces of PPE across to Northern Ireland. Wersquove been able to supply that itrsquos in good order. I am talking to the first minster every day that.Mr. Lewis said the priority of the United Kingdom government is to make sure ldquowe donrsquot hit the second peak of the virus.ldquoOne of the most damaging things economically would be, as well as health wise, to start coming out of lockdown ndash restaurants, pubs, whatever start opening again ndash and suddenly you have to close down again and thatrsquos not viable.ldquoI think itrsquos right to be cautious about this wersquoll make that decision in a few weeks.ldquoThe science is shting on this the experience is changing. I am cautious about predicting what will be in a few weeksrsquo time.He believes the government could ldquoflatten the curve of Covid-people continue to stay at home, adding: ldquoWe want to see past the peak, you donrsquot want to see a downward trend and ease up as all you do is let it shoot back up again.ldquoIf you think back to the beginning there were some quite scary numbers being put about by some experts about what the deaths might be. Now any death is too many and we have sadly lost people, friends and family who have gone through tragic experiences recently, and the figures are nowhere near those numbers we saw at the beginning.ldquoThatrsquos because the public across Northern Ireland and the UK have done a good job generally of following the guidelines which means we can flatten that curve, he said.Mr. Lewis explained that he had personal experience of people close to him who had been diagnosed with Covid-, including his parliamentary private secretary.ldquoSomeone I know lost a member of their family this week, I have a few people in family who had the disease.

There is a transition period where you are not really the Archbishop of Armagh but you want to be as helpful as you can and you are also I suppose trying to work out what and how you are going to approach the task.The Archbishop-Elect explained the three facets to the roleHe said there was the appointment of Bishop of the Diocese of Armagh, which has a larger population with a great number of large towns in it than Clogher Diocese.In addition, there is the role of Primacy of All Ireland, considered lsquoFirst among equalsrsquo acknowledging there is another Primate in the southern province but to some degree to be an ambassador for the Church of Ireland.He added: ldquoThe third element is your place within the wider Anglican Communion which I have relatively little experience of. You become a member of the Primatersquos Meeting which is one of the instruments of communion within Anglicanism. There are a number of ways we hold ourselves together, the Lambeth Conference, the office of the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Anglican Consultative Council and more recently, the Primatersquos Meeting.So what type of church do you see under your leadership ldquoItrsquos dficult to speak for the church as the Church of Ireland General Synod is the body which has that authority. There is a saying that the Church of Ireland is synodically governed and episcopally led. What the Archbishop of Armagh can do is to speak to the Church and suggest can concern itself with. It sets a bit of a tone as well. Itrsquos about its spiritual le and its own governance and the need to acknowledge that like probably all institutions and all bodies some bits of it do well and some do not do well some bits are growing and some bits are shrinking some bitsvery well and some bitsnot so well and to maybe try to discover that the bits that do not do well could do a bit better, in terms of spiritual le and acknowledging there is a huge ersity within Anglicanism and to remember that thatrsquos all part of the Anglican heritage.ldquoThere are obviously particularly challenges at the moment, what the church says to society and what it does for the society in which it is placed. You cannot pretend it doesnrsquot live in a political context. Politics is not something that just happens in Parliament. Democracies are places where political discussion or dialogue are about what we can do together or decisions which are deeply embedded. There are institutions which are recognisable bodies in civil society such as the business community, trade unions, voluntary sector and churches are one of those. I think they have their particular things to say and its perfectly legitimate for them to say it.ldquoThe big imponderable at the moment is coronavirus and we have no idea how deeply that will affect the patterns of society. We could come out the other side of that challenge a changed society, with maybe small changes and maybe some very profound changes. Of course the other big external issue is Brexit which involves the relationships between the dferent regions within Ireland and the United Kingdom.ldquoI could be in both parts of that jurisdiction in one day praying for good governance for both of them and for their leaders, he said.In terms of reaching out to people in the Church of Ireland, the Archbishop-Elect recalled how a Northern Ireland Le and Times survey revealed around  per cent of people in Northern Ireland attend church at some point. He said the heyday for attending church was in the period from the late th Century to the period to the middle of the s. But he thinks current attendance is ldquoback to the old norm with fewer people committed to regular churchgoing.He rightly points out that churches are among the very few inter-generational bodies with people of dferent ages attending.The Archdeacon-Elect says people in very small rural parishes are committed to their churches in the sense that they are contributing to their community who feel it is being enriched with their presence. He said the church finds its place in the community.ldquoThe second challenge is what we are for ourselves as a group, as a faith community, how we build up the church, which canrsquot live in isolation but we have our particular family traditions - how we contribute to the ersity of Ireland, how we build up the church to be confident communities of faith and not hesitant or fearful or invisible communities of faith.He said for the Church of Ireland, there was tremendous heritage from Anglicanism.ldquoThe Church of Ireland has a particular way of doing things, liturgically. Liturgy is both the expression and source of our belief. Our vocation may be to hold together what on the face of it appear to be contradictory things is maybe one of our roles in religious and spiritual le. I have no ideait is the best way to be a Christian but it is our way and it seems to contribute something to the catholic church, the wider church.ldquoHarry McAdoo, a well-known Archbishop of Dublin and a great scholar, once said, lsquoIf I hadnrsquot been born an Anglican, I would have had to become one.rsquoThe Archbishop-Elect leaves Clogher Diocese after forging and maintaining good relations with other denominations.He said: ldquoI think the vast majority of committed Christian people see more in common with other Christian traditions than separating us. There is a very long history of ecumenism in the diocese of Armagh as well. There is a long association and friendship with Archbishop Eamon Martin and I hope we can continue to build relationships and friendships.The Archbishop-Elect trained for Church of Ireland ministry after a career in industry in which he held a senior role in Shorts and was for a time, Assistant Director of the CBI in Northern Ireland.ldquoThat probably give me some skills in organisation and about leadership. Irsquove been very lucky here. Irsquom not very fond of the word lsquoleaderrsquo in the ecclesiastical world but one of the things a leader does is to build a team around him. It is almost a contradiction in terms to be involved in a leadership role in Christianity, to do it on your own.ldquoThere are certain things as a bishop that end with you. There are plenty of lonely moments in that sense where you have to make decisions. But by and large business acclimatised me to working with all sorts of dferent people from all sorts of dferent backgrounds in dferent ways and to experience what every parishioner experiences, normal working le with those pressures.As Bishop of Clogher the new Archbishop-Elect held a number of positions nationally and internationally representing the Church.He was the Church of Ireland contact person to the Churches of the Porvoo Communion which represents the Scandanavian and Baltic Lutherans as well as the Spanish and Portuguese Anglicans and other Anglican churches and provinces from these islands making contact at senior level travelling with them.He has also held senior roles on the Irish Council of Churches, the national ecumenical instrument and also the Irish Inter-Church meeting, the latter which includes the Roman Catholic church.He said those bodies were important especially as ecumenism was becoming bland and it was important to keep going and keep talking.These inter-church bodies contribute to providing resources for churches around Brexit, homelessness, welfare reform and subjects churches would be expected to have a voice in.ldquoI enjoyed that hugely, I am coming to the end of that, six years in total two years as vice-President, two years as President and two years as outgoing Vice President. I will be involved again as a member of the Church Leadersrsquo Meeting.The Archbishop-Elect says of his time in Clogher Diocese ldquoItrsquos always been an aim of mine wherever I have worked to try to create a family atmosphere where there are degrees of mutual respect and degrees of mutual accountability. I remember saying that the diocese of Clogher is big enough to do thingswe all pull together in the same direction and small enough for everybody to be necessary for that to happen and to be accountable for what the contribution is. If you treat people with respect, then relationships are easier.ldquoBy and large I felt people were for me rather than against me. It helpsyou are reasonably interested in people and their families and what they do and acknowledge that as an important factor in their faith. Whoever the next Bishop of Clogher is theyshould allow him or her to be his or her own bishop of Clogher and not that they should be like me, Brian Hannon or Michael Jackson or like St. Macartan.The Archbishop-Elect says he enjoys reading history and poetry and in terms of music, takes particular pleasure in the tradition of Anglican anthems . He does admit to particularly enjoying the Psalms which are poetry.The Archbishop-Elect acknowledges that his mother who had a profound influence on his le, reciting the Daily Office at home and was happily committed to God and His Church and would have sung the Te Deum while washing the dishes. One of her favourite biblical phrases was from the Gospel of St. John, Chapter  ldquoI come that you would have le and that you might have it more abundantly.Relaxation for the Archdeacon-Elect is visiting one of his favourite places, the Ulster Museum to see the collection of Irish Art and reading.ldquoThe thing I am looking to reading most is I took possession of the third volume of Hilary Mantelrsquos Wolf Hall trilogy about Thomas Cromwell, lsquoThe Mirror and Light,rsquo an historical novel, he adds.The Archbishop-Electrsquos we Mary teaches in Enniskillen Royal Grammar School and his daughter, Dorothy, is at the University of Oxford.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.
