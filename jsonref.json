Billionaire tycoon Stephen Ross\u0027 many companies include Equinox and SoulCycle         Various celebrities have cited the fundraiser and announced boycotts of SoulCycle and EquinoxAll this is part of a wider, deeply sinister theme about the hard millennial left that suggests they feel entitled to shame and abuse anyone who supports Trump.A few days ago, Democrat congressman Rep. Joaquin Castro from Texas named and shamed 44 Trump donors in his state, accusing them of ‘fuelling a campaign of hate’.By doing so, and including the names of all their firms, he wanted these people punished, professionally and personally.He made them targets for abuse, and possibly violence.When news broke that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, 77, had broken his shoulder in a fall on Sunday night, enraged liberal protestors raced to his home in Kentucky to scream ‘F*ck you, f*ck your wife, f*ck everything you stand for!’They proudly broadcast their actions on Facebook Live.We’ve seen female White House officials like Kellyanne Conway and Sarah Huckabee Sanders horribly abused, physically assaulted, and thrown out of restaurants.Yet the people doing all this vile stuff are the same people who profess to hate Trump because he is so ‘intolerant’.The truth is that there is nothing more intolerant than the modern American hard millennial left as represented by the likes of Chrissy Teigen.They furiously preach ‘compassion, empathy and humanity’ yet have none themselves.And their own moral self-righteousness is of coursed riddled with rank hypocrisy.Ms Teigen and her celebrity friends all enthusiastically supported Barack Obama in fundraisers despite the fact he deported 3 million immigrants, broke all US presidential records for dropping bombs, and kept illegal torture center Guantanamo Bay open throughout his presidency despite making its closure a key campaign pledge in 2008.I have no problem with Chrissy Teigen cancelling her accounts with Equinox and SoulCycle.In fact, I’m delighted that this will now reduce the chance of me finding myself accidentally stationed next to her irritating little PC-crazed face on a spinning bike.But I do have a big problem with her and her multi-millionaire celebrity pals trying to destroy the jobs of so many hard-working young people working at these gyms just because she doesn’t agree with the political views of a man who owns the parent company.It’s a new kind of fascism, and it’s disgusting."},{"url":null,"title":"Thought holiday water parks blast Read stories youll think twice","story":"Share this article ‘Waterparks should be investigated by someone independent from the Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA) or tour operators. Inspectors contracted are not independent. They’re not going to bite the hand that feeds them.’He says water quality can be dangerous, too, with the risk of superbug infections such as E. coli or norovirus, adding: ‘I recommend using dip sticks or tablets to test water.‘Lifeguards need to be on hand to ensure users follow instructions, including red and green lights indicating when it’s safe to use a slide.’However, even when holidaymakers follow instructions, there can still be serious injury.Nick Harris, a partner at Simpson Millar solicitors, says they are currently representing four people who have been injured on the same waterslide at Didim Beach Resort in Turkey, which is still in use today.         David Briffaut, 23, a talented golfer from Benfleet, Essex, was left paralysed from a broken neck after sliding head-first down a ride at a Benidorm waterpark on July 8 this year. He remains in hospital after being flown back to the UK‘They can be extremely dangerous, he says. ‘We see all sorts of injuries, the most common is people shattering their heels on the base of the pool, often because the water is not deep enough.‘There is a lack of proper regulation. There’s a real conflict of interest because tour operators who have sold thousands of holidays to a resort do not want to tell people about things such as poor swimming pool water quality or waterslides not being safe, as that’s thousands of people who will want their money back.’One of his clients is Des Jarvis, 51, from Peterborough, who was on a £5,500 holiday with partner Nikki, 49, and their children in August 2012.He was hurt so badly his claim against TUI has yet to be settled, although he says the company admitted liability a few days before his case was due to go to court last month.He was left with devastating injuries — very nearly losing his right leg — and is no longer able to work as a window-fitter following five major operations.‘It was our second morning after we arrived and we went to the waterslide,’ recalls Desk. ‘I followed the instructions — feet first, flat on my back and hands on head. There was a lifeguard but he was chatting to two young girls.‘As I came to the bottom of the slide, I smashed into the concrete steps in the pool and shattered my leg in eight places.’After being taken to a hospital in Bodrum, two hours away, he underwent surgery to have plates and wire rods put into his leg.After a ten-day stay in hospital, he returned to England where doctors discovered his leg was seriously infected. Over the next 18 months, he underwent further operations to remove the infected flesh. When all this failed, he was told his bone was infected and his leg may have to be amputated below the knee.The news was devastating, and in a last-ditch attempt to save his leg, he paid to see a private specialist.         The words of his mother, Lorraine, will resonate with every parent with grown-up children currently having fun overseas: ‘We are living in every parent’s nightmare. Our son went on holiday with his girlfriend now we’ve been told he might never walk again\u0027‘The consultant told me there was a chance it could be saved if he removed two inches of bone, bolted a metal frame to the outside and fused my ankle. He said the bone would grow back slowly if the frame was adjusted each day. ‘It was an absolutely horrendous procedure but it was my only choice.’ Des says he lived under a constant cloud of anxiety, from which he will never fully recover. ‘I was told I could lose my leg, that I could get gangrene and die.‘I’m full of anger. I used to be fit and active — I skied, went to the gym, cycled and played football. Now I have pain constantly. And if I ever break my leg again, there’s a very real chance I could lose it.‘I went down a waterslide and now I will be disabled for the rest of my life. There needs to be a worldwide body regulating waterslides. I would urge all holidaymakers to avoid them. It’s just not worth the risk.’Leah Molloy is another to have suffered life-changing injuries after using a waterslide. Leah, 20, from Preston, Lancashire, was enjoying a £2,000 week-long TUI holiday with her parents in July 2015 at the Sunny Beach Aqua Nevis hotel in Burgas, Bulgaria.At the time, she was 16 and had a promising career before her as a footballer. She’d been talent-spotted aged ten by Preston North End’s youth team and was about to go to Accrington and Rossendale College, which regularly sends students to football programmes in the U.S.‘I was very good at football,’ she says. ‘It was my life, my future and I didn’t have a back-up.’She had just finished her GCSEs and, to celebrate, her parents — nurse Lynn and joiner Paddy, both 58 — booked a holiday. They chose the resort because of its activities, including football pitches, tennis courts and the waterpark.‘It was our first day when I went down the slide. The water was only waist-high and my feet smashed into the bottom. I came down following the correct procedure, with my legs straight and arms crossed. But the water just wasn’t deep enough.’Ultrasound imaging later showed injuries to her Achilles tendons. Since then, Leah, who is taking legal action against TUI, has undergone years of physio and spinal injections. Meanwhile, her football career is in tatters.‘I took my place at college for a year but it was no use, I couldn’t play and I just had to watch on the sidelines. I’ve been very depressed, sport was a huge part of my life and my dream has been destroyed.’In a statement, TUI said it is ‘sorry’ to hear of Des and Leah’s holiday experiences, adding: ‘As these are now legal matters, it would be inappropriate to comment further.‘We’d like to reassure customers that we regularly audit all of the hotels we feature in respect of health and safety.’For now, Leah wants to warn others of the dangers: ‘If it happened to me, it could happen to anyone. Something needs to change before anyone else is hurt.’Additional reporting: Stephanie Condron"},{"url":null,"title":"JAN MOIR imagines secret diary Summers summer love","story":"Share this article Chapter 7: Just mucking about  Paul\u0027s orce from his wife comes through.

Myers’s novels have always been challenging, intelligent and linguistically adventurous, and he built up a loyal underground following with books such as Beastings, Pig Iron, and The Gallows Pole. This latter was his breakthrough success, winning the Walter Scott prize. He lives in Hebden Bridge with his wife, the novelist Adele Stripe.Your previous novels were put out by a small independent publisher, Bluemoose. After the Walter Scott prize and the huge sales of The Gallows Pole, The Offing feels like a departure both in the fact that it’s being published by Bloomsbury and in its more gentle, pastoral feel.I would describe it as quite a U-turn. It probably sounds a little bit disingenuous to say this, but I wrote the book for myself and for the preservation of my mental health. It was somewhere to escape to during dark winters in Yorkshire, but also I was reading a lot of pastoral fiction, a lot of Laurie Lee and HE Bates. For want of a better word, stuff that’s quite “nice”. I thought the world was getting very angry, bitter and ided. I thought I’d put out something that’s positive, inject a bit of sunlight into the proceedings.Like all your novels, it’s deeply engaged with place, in this case Robin Hood’s Bay. What was it about that landscape that made you want to write about it?This is something I’ve only figured out in the last few weeks as the book has gone to print. When I was 12 years old, I was really ill. I injured myself skateboarding and was taken to hospital and I was pissing blood and was in a really bad way. I ended up having my kidney removed. I was in and out of hospital for months. My parents wanted to take me away for some recuperation, but we couldn’t go far, so we went from Durham to North Yorkshire, to Robin Hood’s Bay. So subconsciously it’s a place I went to when I was ill and just found it a slightly otherworldly place with these smuggling connections and the history. I’ve been going for a few years with my wife to stay there and every time it’s been an escape from my writing and the grey, windswept landscape of West Yorkshire, where I live.You started your career as a music journalist for Melody Maker. Your first novel was about Richey Edwards of the Manic Street Preachers. How much did this influence your subsequent work?It was always only a means to an end to writing fiction. But I’ve always had that hardcore punk mentality where you do things for yourself and you don’t wait for anyone to accept it or approve things. The difference is that I’m a hardcore punk who’s now writing about poetry, wild meadows and beekeeping.What do you read for sheer pleasure?I’ve read a lot of books by bare-knuckle boxing gypsies. Memoirs of bad men. True crime books. I like reading old rural books – accounts of poachers from the 1920s. I don’t consider anything a guilty pleasure.What book would you give to a child?Either My Side of the Mountain by Jean Craighead George or Danny the Champion of the World, which had a massive impact on me as a child.How do you organise your books?Vaguely alphabetically, but not strict and definitely not by colour. That’s the behaviour of a psychopath.What classic novel have you recently read for the first time?The Inheritors by William Golding. That’s been by my bed for years and I knew I would love it and I did.• The Offing is published by Bloomsbury (£16.99). To order a copy go to bookshop or call 0330 333 6846.

Beat novelist William S Burroughs adored cats so much he wrote a whole book about them The Cat Inside is a dreamlike love letter to the cats he knew through his life and a meditation on humanity’s relationship with our favourite “psychic companions”.Many of the best-known cats in fiction tend towards the mischievous (Alice in Wonderland’s Cheshire Cat, The Master and Margarita’s Behemoth), the machiavellian (the eponymous protagonist of Terry Pratchett’s delightful The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents) or the outright malevolent (Church in Stephen King’s Pet Sematary).For something a bit different, I’d recommend dipping a paw into Japanese literature, where cats feature in wonderful variety. Natsume Sōseki’s I Am a Cat is a biting satire of Meiji-era Japan told through the eyes of the sardonic street kitten Mr Sneaze (sic), while The Travelling Cat Chronicles by Hiro Arikawa beautifully explores the friendships we share with our pets through the eyes of Nana, as he takes a road trip with his beloved human Satoru. Genki Kawamura’s If Cats Disappeared From the World is a much more pleasant read than its horrifically dystopian title would suggest, while 1Q84 by renowned cat-obsessive Haruki Murakami features a town populated entirely by cats. Heavenly.My favourite literary feline is Marlinspike, the impish black kitten given by Cardinal Wolsey to Thomas Cromwell in Hilary Mantel’s Wolf Hall. He’d run off by the sequel Bring Up the Bodies, “as cats do, to make his career elsewhere”, but I live in hope that he’ll make a triumphant return in next year’s The Mirror and the Light.Jessie Burton’s new novel The Confession will be published by Picador on 19 SeptemberSubmit your question to book clinic below or email bookclinic@observer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b898bf8cd0017959115d9d51039e15d1954ab5a3/0_48_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f38fc1652a8cb3cf65f3fca495ee6a1","title":"mystery bidder joins race to buy british steel","story":"New funds thought to be enough to secure a sale to widening list of interested private biddersThe government has moved to rescue British Steel with a financial support package worth as much as £300m that ministers believe will be enough to secure backing from a private bidder.It is understood that the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) has agreed to substantially increase support to bidders for British Steel, which employs more than 4,000 people, after months of wrangling following the company’s collapse into administration.The rescue package will include beefed-up grants, indemnities and loans that could be worth as much as £300m, according to sources quoted by Sky News.A Turkish pension fund is considered to be the frontrunner to takeover the company’s main plant in Scunthorpe and subsidiaries across Teesside, although a consortium which includes a leading civil engineering firm working in west Africa is also in the running after making a late bid.Despite the late interest from elsewhere, the business secretary, Andrea Leadsom, is expected to approve exclusive talks with Ataer Holdings, a subsidiary of the Turkish military pension scheme Oyak. An announcement that Ataer has won preferred bidder status could be made by the government’s official receiver David Chapman and EY, which is managing the sale, as early as next week.Ataer is believed to be the frontrunner after it committed to keeping all parts of the steel company together. While the plant in Scunthorpe makes up the vast majority of British Steel’s operations, the government has so far expressed a preference for selling the company as a single entity, including satellite operations in areas such as Teesside.When Greybull Capital bought British Steel in 2016 it promised great things. The private equity firm pledged to invest £400m and within months it was boasting of a\u0026nbspreturn to profit and a bright future ahead. Two years later it appears to be on the brink of collapse unless it receives a government-funded bailout. In a letter to staff last week, the British Steel chief executive blamed weak market demand, high raw material prices, the weakness of sterling and uncertainty over the outcome of Brexit discussions.It is not the only factor in the crisis but it is very important. Steel contracts are typically agreed well in advance of the product being delivered. As things stand, the UK is\u0026nbspdue to leave the EU on 31 October\u0026nbspand the terms of that separation are\u0026nbspyet to be agreed, meaning British Steel’s overseas customers don’t know what tariffs will apply to steel they buy from the company. Sources close to the company say orders from customers in the EU and further afield have dried up as a result.The steelworks in Scunthorpe represents the bulk of the company and it is hard to see who would be an obvious buyer for the site, given that it has struggled under successive owners. The fundamental problems affecting it show no sign of solution any time soon.The UK steel industry has been in decline for some time due to a variety of factors such as overcapacity in EU steelmaking and Chinese state-subsidised firms flooding the global market with cheap product. An industry that employed 323,000 people in 1971 now employs less than a tenth of that, at 31,900. The closure of the\u0026nbspRedcar steelworks in 2015\u0026nbspwas a significant blow to the sector and left the UK with just two blast furnace steelworks: Scunthorpe and Tata Steel-owned Port Talbot in south Wales.The government has already provided a £120m loan to British Steel to help meet its obligations under an EU carbon credits scheme for industrial polluters. Nevertheless, the firm is understood to be losing £5m a week. has approached EY and BEIS for comment.Earlier this week, BEIS said: “This government will leave no stone unturned to get a good solution for British Steel at Scunthorpe, Skinningrove and on Teesside.”If discussions with Ataer break down, three bidders are waiting in the wings: Liberty House, led by Indian-born metals tycoon Sanjeev Gupta Greybull Capital, the investment group which owned British Steel when it collapsed and the west African consortium led by an as-yet unnamed civil engineering firm.While not revealing its identity, the firm said it would not require any government assistance or grants, unlike some of the rival bids.“The consortium is working on a long-term massive infrastructure project in west Africa,” said a source close to the company, which has masked its identity. “The successful purchase of the Scunthorpe site would mean an export opportunity of steel to this project – with immediate effect.“The project has an estimated 10-year delivery timescale and has multiple related additional export opportunities for British steel to the region.”Oyak pension fund’s experience in the steel industry stems from its shareholding in the Turkish steelmaker Erdemir.Liberty House would prefer to convert the Scunthorpe works from a blast furnace plant, which makes steel from scratch. It seeks government loan guarantees to replace the blast furnaces with electric arc furnaces, which would be used to make products by recycling scrap steel.Greybull Capital is understood to be interested in picking up parts of the business if the government’s preference for selling the whole business fails to materialise. In that case, the Scunthorpe steelworks would be likely to close for good.The Turkish fund has offered to invest between £60m and £70m to take control of British Steel, according to sources.Insiders told Sky News the funding would satisfy EU state aid rules, which Theresa May’s administration claimed prevented ministers from providing support to British Steel before it collapsed into insolvency in May."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23308e08985269d35c3323e83341f30cb7eaa4ce/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8457072ae948394746be4a0a71ebe19","title":"house of fraser year of mike ashley","story":"Empty beauty counters, acres of discount sportswear and stores in need of repair. One year after Sports Direct bought House of Fraser out of administration, many of the shops now have entire floors that look more like branches of Mike Ashley’s pile-it-high sportswear outlets than an upmarket department store.When Ashley bought the chain for £90m in the wake of its collapse in August last year, he outlined a plan to create the “Harrods of the high street” and expected to keep about 47 of the 59 stores open. Last month he admitted the chain was losing more than £1m a week, said he expected to close more stores in the year ahead and conceded that its problems were “nothing short of terminal”.The chain now has 53 branches, and there are plans to turn at least five into “Frasers” – a more upmarket department store akin to the Flannels designerwear chain, also owned by Ashley. Sites in Belfast, Bluewater in Kent and Meadowhall in Sheffield as well as the existing Frasers in Glasgow are all tagged for conversion.House of Fraser’s struggles mirror those of the wider high street. A net 2,481 stores disappeared from Britain’s biggest high streets last year – a rate of 16 closures a day – and at least 75,000 retail jobs have been lost since early 2018.Department stores are key fixtures in the retail environment. They are often the cornerstone of high streets and shopping malls, accounting for tens of thousands of jobs and large amounts of floor space. If the British high street is to survive, the likes of House of Fraser need to succeed.But further closures are now on the way at House of Fraser, and many will leave gaping holes in local high streets. Hull closed earlier this month, Altrincham and Lakeside, Thurrock, are expected to be redeveloped and four or five more are expected to pull down the shutters once Christmas is out of the way. As many as 20 more could go in the following 18 months as Ashley scrambles to carve out a profitable business. Two sites likely to be on the closure list are Camberley and Epsom in Surrey. When the Observer visited last week, both seemed to be braced for the worst. In Camberley one escalator is broken, and yellow and black hazard tape decorates the floor.The beauty hall is depleted, with several counters empty. Perfume stocks are running low, with some major brands, including Chanel and John Paul Gaultier, unavailable. The Clarins counter is unstaffed and an assistant apologises for the lack of stock available on the Guerlain stand.About half of the top floor, where the furniture and carpets departments used to be, is filled with discounted men’s sportswear. Racks of Lonsdale tracksuit bottoms, Karrimor outdoor wear and SoulCal jackets – all brands owned by Sports Direct – sit alongside Lee Cooper jeans and Pierre Cardin tops, some carrying Sports Direct’s gaudy Mega Value discount price tags. There is more discount sportswear downstairs on the womenswear floor, filling spaces which used to be home to brands including House of Fraser’s now discontinued own labels Therapy, Maison de Nimes and Linea.Sir Philip Green’s Arcadia – the owner of Miss Selfridge, Topshop, Dorothy Perkins and Wallis – has pulled its brands from House of Fraser’s online store and moved out of a third of its concessions. These brands were once major suppliers to House of Fraser – and were owed more than £1m when the chain collapsed a year ago.In Epsom, where the store could close after Christmas, it is a similar story. There are empty beauty counters and acres of sportswear filling spaces once used by former House of Fraser own labels and brands including Jacques Vert and Eastex.“It’s going to close isn’t it?” says Sylvia Hewes, a shopper in the aptly named Ashley Centre in Epsom, where House of Fraser is a tenant. “I still like it – they always have handbag bargains. They recently told us they are not allowed to order new stock when we brought back a shirt that was the wrong size. It will definitely disappear. It’s a shame, as it will ruin Epsom.”Like many landlords across the country, those in Epsom and Camberley are already considering their options for new tenants or redevelopment.Camberley is still struggling to adapt after the 2016 closure of its BHS – the upper floors of which are currently being turned into flats. Shopping centre The Square – where the House of Fraser store is a tenant – is owned by the local Surrey Heath borough council.Kevin White, a partner at property consultancy Montagu Evans, which advises the council, says the local authority would like to keep the store, but is also considering alternative uses of the site. “We want House of Fraser to have a sustainable future in Camberley,” he says. “It has been an important part of the town for a long time and supports many people’s employment.“We also need to think about the town centre’s long-term purpose though, and are reviewing the opportunities to get best value from the retail spaces, including alternative uses that will sustain economic growth and development.”Ashley’s vision for the future of House of Fraser includes, it seems, plenty of his own labels, where he can be sure of supplies, and higher profits. It’s a formula that worked well for Sports Direct, helping it wipe out many competitors, including JJB.It’s no surprise, then, that Sports Direct last week bought out of administration upmarket Jack Wills – a business which already has concessions in House of Fraser. Owning such brands is protection against sudden changes, such as the planned closure of dozens of Karen Millen and Coast concessions after those brands also went bust. (They were bought out of administration by online fashion group Boohoo last week.)Brand owners say they are happy that House of Fraser now pays on time and more quickly, and are prepared to give the company time to turn things around. But Sofie Willmott at retail consultancy GlobalData says House of Fraser stores are now generally quieter, as shoppers have lost trust in the brand following widespread reports about its financial difficulties. “There is no reason to get branded products from House of Fraser. You can get them elsewhere and feel more comfortable that you can return them or get your money back if you need them.”Floors of cheap sportswear also sit at odds with the more upmarket brands House of Fraser has retained so far, such as Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, Ted Baker, Whistles, Phase Eight and Mint Velvet.Richard Hyman, the veteran retail analyst, says: “However devalued the House of Fraser brand had become, it has been devalued significantly further. It’s difficult to carry aspirational brands next to functional un-aspirational brands.“I find it hard to believe there will be even 20 House of Frasers. It may happen in stages but in three years, my bet is there will be under 10.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f30ba029d8c90880a4f3a2bff711a7a834f25a68/295_260_1674_1004/master/1674.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e13b8604e265708b5f35e349dc0f21db","title":"all the stuff of life goes on here the wine bar that bath fell in love with","story":"Intimate, personalised service has made Beckford Bottle Shop a favourite for first dates, long lunches and more As you enter Beckford Bottle Shop, a new bar, restaurant and wine shop with views over Bath’s Assembly Rooms, it’s impossible to miss the huge, U-shaped sofa skirting the back wall. It’s the focal point of the room and, as it turns out, the focal point of the business. “The sofa creates this space for people to hang out,” says Dan Brod, Beckford’s co-owner. “It’s also communal, so it kind of forces people to talk to each other – which, as a nation, we’re generally terrible at. When you go to Spain everyone hangs out and chats in the village square. The sofa is our version of the square.”The welcoming atmosphere is something the team at Beckford have considered since day one. The owners all come from a background of members’ clubs and own several other “poncey pubs with rooms, I think is the official name,” laughs Brod. As a result, customer experience is key. “We’ve come at the wine world putting wine at the bottom and service at the top. Traditionally wine shops aren’t like that – it’s wine over everything else and they’re pretty intimidating. You walk in, get scared and choose whatever’s on the middle shelf,” he says.“We don’t want to be elitist here. Whether you’re a wine aficionado or just want a glass of something with a snack, our staff will look after you regardless. We’re a sociable environment, the lighting, the music and the welcome when you walk through the door it’s all very considered because hospitality is in our DNA. We want people to have a great experience that sticks with them. I almost want this to be a community centre, which sounds ridiculous but that’s what hospitality is ultimately about – community.”Brod is certainly achieving that wish, as every customer references the atmosphere and the people they’ve met over long lunches or cosy evenings in the snugs.“I don’t think I’ve ever sat on this sofa without everybody on it talking to each other,” says customer Soo Arber. “I’ve made a lot of friends here, including a girl who has recently moved to Bath and doesn’t know anyone. She came along with her glass of fizz we got chatting, ended up swapping emails and now regularly meet up. It’s a space where, particularly as a woman, you don’t feel intimidated by sitting alone, because it’s so friendly.”Fellow customers Anthony Christie and Simon Jones say the venue suits different moods. “If you want to socialise with new people, the sofa is a good place for that. We’ve met a lot of people there,” says Christie. “But then you’ve got the snugs downstairs, which are the perfect place to sit with a gang of friends and lose track of time.” As we chat, the waiter brings some salted almonds over. “They’re not on the menu any more but I know you love them,” he says, much to the pair’s joy. “That shows how personalised the service is here,” says Christie. “We have a relationship with all the guys who work here and they take pleasure in recommending wine and food that they know will meet our palates.”Christie and Jones are self-confessed wine buffs but Casey Ryder, Beckford’s general manager, says their customers are a broad range of people. “We’re very non-pretentious and get customers of all ages and walks of life,” he says. “We see lots of first dates but also older couples out having fun, whose kids come and pick them up afterwards.”He says the small plates menu makes it the perfect date spot. “Sharing plates takes out the slight intimidation of a long three-course meal with a huge bill at the end. Plus, if you decide you’re not into each other, you can leave after a plate of charcuterie. If things are going well you can have a whole meal and take it downstairs, which is much more intimate.”While the management team own other pubs and businesses, they view Beckford Bottle Shop as a business within a business – effectively a startup – and that is why they chose iZettle. “They are a genuine disruptor within the fintech industry. They offer something different and the level of customer service is excellent,” says Brod.“It’s incredibly easy to set up, there are no long contracts, as it’s all month by month, and it’s simple to add new machines. It’s all cloud-based, which is good, as we often do events so can take the machines with us. If I was starting any business I’d use iZettle. Card machines are the last thing you want to think about in a business, but also one of the most important. And I love that iZettle regularly check in and care about what we do, because that’s what our business is about: customer care. I like dealing with companies that share our ethos.”Another customer, Joanne Hodges, echoes Brod’s sentiment around customer service. “You don’t even need to look at the wine list here. I often tell them I fancy trying something new and they just know what you’re after. You don’t have to drink the same wine each time you visit, which gets boring. And I love the mix of people – I’ve met locals as well as people on holiday and everyone is lovely. I particularly like sitting at a table in the shop. It’s like being in a library surrounded by books, only with wine.”Brod says the key to the Beckford Bottle Shop experience is that it’s an evolving space. “You can come for coffee with your laptop in the morning, have a small plate and glass of wine solo, or meet with friends and put a lot of plates together for a full meal. We’ve seen it all: proposals, marriages, dates and affairs – the whole gamut. All the stuff of life goes on here.”So, whatever you’re looking to celebrate next time you’re in Bath, try this community centre with a difference.Explore the benefits of joining the iZettle community at izettle"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b46647fb10643e93868cbcc48b7ee1d9cbd20586/0_108_3229_1938/master/3229.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=572a90b141e0cc5749db82c9dbd3b7ed","title":"angela merkel on hols less despotism please","story":"One of the reasons I tend not to mind the tinny hiss of other people’s headphones on public transport is that I am a horribly nosey person. Recently, I sat next to a middle-aged man in a work suit who played that ubiquitous Lewis Capaldi got-dumped song not once, not twice, but on a loop that lasted as long as my train journey. I should have asked him if he was OK.The same nosiness applies to what people are reading. Getting lost in a good book should never be a self-conscious act, but it is hard not to wonder what brought that particular person to The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck.Summer is great for lots of reasons: stretched-out days, busier nights, the fact that the climate emergency means you get the chance to wear every item in your wardrobe in a single week. Catastrophically unpredictable weather sure keeps you on your sartorial toes but it also brings the wave of famous people’s holiday reading recommendations, which is a bit like staring at a stranger’s book on the bus, only far less creepy.When asked for his summer pick by NBC reporter Dylan Byers, Mark Zuckerberg chose The Last Days of Night by Graham Moore, a historical novel that tells the story of Edison’s attempts to preserve his monopoly on the United States’ electricity supply. Zuckerberg was roundly rinsed for this, as if we were all shocked that he has an interest in power, as if he was ever likely to choose Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine and a sudoku compendium like the rest of us.A rewarding sub-genre of literary voyeurism is what famous people are seen reading. Angela Merkel was spotted with Stephen Greenblatt’s Tyrant, which draws on rulers in Shakespeare’s works to explore real-life messianic despots, while she was on holiday in the Italian Alps, which suggests that someone should remind her what a holiday is.Celebrities have long since been aware of what a book can say about them, from those famous images of James Dean reading poetry and Marilyn Monroe reading Ulysses, to Justin Bieber, shortly after his engagement, flashing Tim Keller’s The Meaning of Marriage, which offers relationship advice according to the teachings of God. Then there is Lindsay Lohan, who knows exactly how to keep the jacket facing outwards. More recently, she has been seen reading the Qur’an, but in the olden days, she’d go for something such as Toxic Friends. It is the very essence of read into that what you will.Farewell to The OA, the Netflix series created by Brit Marling and Zal Batmanglij and starring Marling, which lasted two ambitious, lopsided seasons. It told a story of alternate realities to which characters could travel by working through the rejected sections of a community mime class.“Zal and I are deeply sad not to finish this story,” Marling wrote on Instagram. “The first time I heard the news, I had a good cry.” She went on to say that working in “speculative fiction” gave her the chance to start with a world not already defined by pre-existing norms. “Science fiction wiped this ‘real’ world clean like an Etch A Sketch,” she said. It summed up the reason why so many people find solace in science fiction and fantasy. It is escapism amplified into power and agency.I am sad to see The OA go. It was both hysterically silly and deeply earnest in a way that, in this age of archness and irony, few shows dare to be. But it didn’t quite know how to pull off an ending. Each series laid the breadcrumbs of a labyrinthine conspiracy, only to implode in the finale, as if collapsing under the weight of all that plot. As a result, season two ended on such a meta note that it seems almost a crime to not be allowed to see what happens next.Still, if you wave your arms around in the right combination of moves and then hiss, there may be hope. There are rumours that the cancellation announcement could be a fake. However, Netflix also announced that it had brought over Game of Thrones creators David Benioff and DB Weiss from HBO, for a rumoured $200m, so let’s just assume that the financial portal has been well and truly sealed.Many of my American friends have announced that they will be giving up their gym memberships, so I was intrigued by what might have inspired this wave of rebellion against physical activity.They posted that they would no longer be giving their money to the companies owned by billionaire Stephen Ross, Equinox and SoulCycle (someone shouts at you while you try to move but remain fixed in one place). Reports have emerged that Ross, a long-time friend of Donald Trump, would be hosting a fundraiser at his Hamptons home, which the president would attend, with tickets costing up to $250,000 each. Public figures and celebrities such as Billy Eichner and Chrissy Teigen joined the #GrabYourWallet chorus, advocating that gym-goers renounce their memberships. As was pointed out repeatedly, when it comes to people such as Ross, money talks.However, as a sidenote, I would question the strategic sense of conceding exercise to supporters of the far right, while, out of principle, we weedy little snowflakes are stuck at home with nothing but a Davina DVD."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec814252104853b51b4d9172854484b9f161582d/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=992c6c0b239a70cabe73fcc970e3f3b4","title":"clearing 2019 what students can expect and how they can succeed","story":"However confident students feel about A-level predictions and course choices, in this buyers’ market it’s good to know when to check the Ucas websiteThis year two factors are set to shape the clearing process: a birthrate dip in the early 2000s means there are fewer 18 year-olds in the UK than in previous years and universities are looking to recruit more students. This means it’s an ideal time for savvy students to shop around, even if they’ve already accepted an offer. Perhaps they feel differently about their course or institution choice now that summer’s rolled around, or maybe they think they could have aimed higher. Either way, the choice is theirs.Last year, a record 60,000 students entered university via clearing. Lots of universities run open days and start advertising their vacancies well before A-level results day on 15 August, knowing that many students use this as a second application window. This year, clearing opened on 5 July.“There will be lots of availability in clearing, even on very selective courses at Russell Group institutions, though I do think those top courses will go quite quickly,” says Mary Curnock-Cook, former chief executive of Ucas. “It’s more like universities scrambling for applicants than applicants for places, so applicants can afford to be quite choosy.”This is particularly the case for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Cambridge has entered clearing for the first time this year, but applications are only open to students from the poorest areas of the country. Edinburgh is also awarding all its places in clearing to students from the most deprived parts of Scotland.For students who’ve missed out on their grades, there are plenty of quality courses on offer. Hope Clay Belsham got a place at Nottingham Trent University (NTU) through clearing last year to study animal science, after missing out on a place at its neighbour, Nottingham.“When I spoke to NTU I was greeted with a friendly and helpful staff member who assured me everything would work out,” she recalls.While she had only considered universities in the research-intensive Russell Group prior to applying, she’s now finding she’s better suited to NTU’s assessment style. “I love that I have assignments rather than loads of exams.”The secret is to start your preparations early. Emma Leech, director of marketing at Loughborough University, says that in recent years “the speed of folks hitting the phone lines has got quicker”. She advises students to have a list of the unis and courses they meet the grade requirements for, and to start ringing the moment they have their results.If students are confident about their decisions, Leech says, they’re less likely to fall prey to “aggressive marketing”, such as offers of free laptops from unis looking to fill places. “Don’t get pushed by an institution to say yes on the spot.”Curnock-Cook adds that students who have read about the government’s review of tuition fees might be tempted to wait a year, in the hope of paying £7,500 in fees rather than £9,250. But, she cautions: “The timing has quite a big question mark over it, because of the political shenanigans going on at the moment, so you could be waiting a long time.”Instead, students should take the opportunity to work out which subjects most inspire them. “Don’t just look at course headlines,” says Curnock-Cook. “Read about all the modules and make sure you feel comfortable with them – you’re going to spend three years studying this subject in depth. If the modules or choices available on a particular course don’t make you feel ‘Yes, I could stay up all night reading that’, then it’s probably not the right one to go for.”15 AugustA-level results day. While students without any offers will already have been browsing for courses, today is the day when students who missed their grades are able to enter clearing. Adjustment also opens for students who received better results than expected. To find out which route you’re eligible for, check Ucas Track.31 AugustThe deadline for providing extra information on your application, such as other achievements, to enable you to meet offer conditions. Adjustment closes today.4 SeptemberFor students who want to take a gap year and defer entry to 2020 rather than go through clearing, applications open for Ucas courses starting next year.20 SeptemberAll applications to Ucas courses starting in 2019 must be received by 6pm today.15 OctoberThe deadline for 2020 applications to Oxford and Cambridge, and most courses in medicine, veterinary medicinescience and dentistry.22 OctoberThe final date for applications to courses starting in 2019 via clearing. After this date, universities and colleges can no longer accept students via clearing.15 JanuaryThe final deadline for all applications to undergraduate courses starting in 2020.1 PrepareIf you suspect you haven’t made your grades, anything you can do beforehand will ease the rush on results day. Clearing opened on 5 July, although universities can’t make an offer until you have your results. You can check which courses have vacancies – university websites and Ucas give some details before results. Ring around to register your interest in advance.2 ReflectNow is a good time to look at the universities and subjects you shortlisted back in your original Ucas application and consider what appealed. Are these the same things you want now? Gather module marks and GCSE results, and reread your personal statement. Then make a list of possible courses – take notes about what appeals.3 Take notesShortlist potential courses and note contacts and names. While you’re thinking clearly, note specific details of what interests you on each course – teaching methods, content, internships etc. 4 Sign up for alertsThe Ucas direct contact service allows universities to get in touch directly about courses from 15 August. It’s open to students without an offer.5 Consider alternativesThis might be a gap year, a different subject, or the same elsewhere. You can also apply for apprenticeships alongside your Ucas application, although deadlines vary.6 Explore campusesSocial media, city guides and student portals are great for figuring out what it’s like to live and study somewhere you don’t yet know. Think again about campus versus city sites, accommodation and the relative cost of living.1 Seek supportIf you’re feeling emotional, remember that’s a normal response. Don’t feel like you have to go through clearing alone – a parent or teacher will be happy to help.2 Stay calm and follow the stepsAt 8am you can check Ucas Track to see if you’ve been accepted by your firm or insurance choice. Some universities accept students even if they are off by a grade and you can ring to check. Track will show whether you are in clearing.Once you’ve collected your results, which universities will need before they can offer you a place, and you have your Ucas Track login details to hand, you can look at the live list of vacancies on Ucas and inidual university websites.After browsing availability, you can start ringing university hotlines and using social media to ask questions. If possible, have a spare phone for callbacks while you ring around. Write down details, names and contacts from calls.3 Take your timeYou can’t formally accept a place until 3pm, and normally you’ll have two or three days to decide. Once you’ve decided, enter your single choice in Track. When a uni has verified your grades, you’re in. Don’t feel like you have to accept a place as soon as you’re offered it. Ask how long the university will give you to reflect on your decision and make sure that it’s the right one for you.

Now it has come together to turn things aroundThe sisters were buried in their favourite clothes: Patricia in a white dress and Mirana in plimsolls, a skirt and a blouse. Patricia was three and loved her Barbie. Not the Barbies that most girls in the village play with – dolls made from bamboo sticks, with grass “hair” tied in elastic bands – but a real one, with a pink plastic face. Her father, Augustin Randrianasolo, now 62, had bought it a few years earlier from the market for 200 Malagasy ariary (then worth 50p), a lot of money in the early 80s.Mirana died seven years after her sister, in the early 90s she was two and a half. “Not yet old enough to really speak,” says her older sister, Odile, who is now 35. “She was the most beautiful of all of us,” she continues. “She had the nicest hair, the most beautiful face. She looked like my dad.”Patricia and Mirana were two of six girls born to Isabelle and Augustin. They married when Augustin was 20 and Isabelle was 16, and settled in Ambatoantrano, a remote village in the central highlands of Madagascar. Augustin was measured, thoughtful and could read and write. She was a talented seamstress and embroiderer.The sisters died in the rainy season. The village is built on a slope and, when it rains, water streams down the pathways. Today, it is mainly red soil that gets swept into puddles. Back then, it was mixed with human faeces. There were hardly any toilets in the village until three years ago, most people defecated in the maize fields at the edge of the village, or in the tall grass behind the school. The puddles the children splashed and jumped in were sources of life-threatening disease. Cases of diarrhoea always peaked with the rain, from November to April: children suffered most. Patricia’s death happened very quickly – three days from the onset of a persistent stomach ache and diarrhoea to death. “We didn’t pay too much attention at first. Diarrhoea is very common,” her father says. “But then it got worse.”They tried to take Patricia to the health centre in the next village, but heavy rains cut off the road. They gave her an infusion made from ground guava leaves that she could not keep down, and bought some pills from the village shop. “But when it’s really bad diarrhoea, these pills don’t work,” he says. Patricia died in the night of profound dehydration. Her parents were stunned. “She had been there, and then, very suddenly, she went,” Augustin says. His face is full of pain.When Mirana got ill, it took a long time for Odile to understand what was happening. “My mother wanted to take her to the hospital because she saw how dangerous it was, but my dad wanted to go to his father, a healer, in the village. He gave her some medicine, but my mum didn’t want it. She burnt it.” Finally, they got someone to drive them to the hospital in town, but it was too late. The parents blamed each other and separated a month later.“She was disappointed about life, about us,” Augustin says of his wife. Isabelle left for a man who was improving the road to the village. She took the four girls and moved to a town 500km away.Although he was only 35 when his wife left, Augustin never remarried. “I decided to live my life alone,” he says. For the past 30 years, he has focused on farming and village affairs he is currently vice-president of the community, after serving as president for five years. “Sometimes when I think about my wife and my daughters I go to the shop and buy something to drink,” he says. Usually Malagasy rum.Odile says all the pain in her family can be traced back to one thing. If there had been toilets in the village, everything would have been different. “My sisters wouldn’t have died and we would have had a better life.”To make a lasting change requires more than a high-level political push, Hueso says. “You need real work at grassroots level, and behavioural change.” Defecating in the open is as old as humankind – and a practice that is still celebrated in countries such as Madagascar with startling fervour. “Men will say: ‘I like going in the fresh air. I like the walk in the morning. I like socialising with my friends when I go in the open,’” Hueso says. “But very rarely will women say they enjoy it.”Going to the toilet outdoors is dangerous and embarrassing for women and girls. In many communities, modesty requires that they get up at 4am to do it under the cover of darkness, leaving them vulnerable to sexual assault and snakes. “In almost every developing country, you will hear women say: I go at night, so people don’t see me. I always go with a friend, so she can keep an eye on people prying,” he says.Only one road connects Ambatoantrano to the nearest town of Ts’didy. The drive takes two hours, snaking over mountainous terrain. The village is home to about 2,000 people, none of whom own a car. Only three have a motorbike. Augustin, like most people in the village, gets around on a bicycle it takes him three hours to cycle to Ts’didy – longer when the rains turn the road into a quagmire.It is a pre-industrial life. People depend on the land, with dozens heading off to work in the fields as morning breaks, having been woken by cockerels. The women, young and old, are always working – pulling weeds from the ground, crouching in the red dust to pound rice, hanging washing out to dry on bushes and trees. With no toy shops or TV, children make up their own games. Boys play marbles with rounded pebbles or guava stones girls plait skipping ropes from the long grass at the edge of the village.There are cattle-drawn carts and guinea pigs are food, not pets. Getting mobile coverage is a laborious process, as the sole hotspot is by a tree in the centre of the village. There are more churches (five) than shops (three) and the congregations gather for Sunday morning services that last for three hours. Raymond Razafiarison, 63, the pastor of the Lutheran church, is one of only a few people in the village to have solar power.Aurelie Ranoeliarimanana, 56, was one of the first in the village to get a latrine. She is now the head of a church’s women’s association and is wearing her church finery (black patent shoes with buckles) when we meet one Sunday morning. Her childhood ambition was to be a midwife, although a lack of money held her back. “I had an aunt who was a doctor in a hospital and she allowed me to do a kind of internship. Because I wanted to work in the health sector, I knew that a latrine and a bathroom were really important.”She remembers the early 80s, when many young villagers died after having diarrhoea. “We kept on burying children, maybe 10 a year at that time,” she says. They included her own nieces, who were aged one and three. In 1997, pastor Razafiarison led the funeral service for his granddaughter, who died when she was barely four weeks old. “She had diarrhoea, continuous diarrhoea,” he says. Her name was Tafita. “It means succeed,” he says.Ranoeliarimanana’s first latrine dates from when she was newly married, in 1979. It was similar to the pit or long-drop toilets built in the village today. These have three components – a deep hole in the ground a concrete slab or mud floor with a small hole (sometimes laid with two bricks squatting distance apart) and a shelter – and are built close to the house (but not too close, because of the stench).A pit toilet is ideal for places without water or sewers, because the faeces compost in the deep hole. When it is full, after four years or so, the owner digs another one and starts again.The ready supply of water undoubtedly makes handwashing easier. But long-drop toilets don’t require water to work, only ashes to neutralise the smell. Nevertheless, the effect was dramatic. Latrines appeared, not gradually, but all at once. Mialy Randriamampianina, the head of policy, communications and campaign for WaterAid Madagascar, puts it down to the “integrated message of water, sanitation and hygiene”. Others say it was peer pressure, and the fact that the community imposed fines on refusers that were enforced by the gendarmes.The latrines were funded and designed by the villagers – an approach, say sanitation experts, that helps to make people feel more invested. Augustin’s is pared-down, like his bachelor home, which is dark and basic even by local standards: no floor covering, only earth no bed, only a wooden couch hidden behind a rag curtain. He shares his latrine with a neighbour who has a family of nine and who helped build it. It cost about Ar10,000 (£2.20) and has mud walls and a straw roof. Augustin tends to visit early in the morning. “One person always takes a long time, but I am not going to say who,” he says.Ranoeliarimanana’s daughter, Saholy, in her early 30s, has one of the smartest latrines in Ambatoantrano. She and her husband run the shop-cum-cafe, which sells coffee and noodle soup as well as packs of spaghetti, biscuits, dried fish and plastic bottles of paraffin. They live in an aspirational part of the village, near the money lender’s house, which is bigger and grander than the rest. Her husband gave up his job as a maintenance engineer for the mobile phone company Orange three years ago.“We were always moving and our two boys were suffering,” she says. The cement floor of her latrine is inlaid with beautiful ceramic tiles, inspired by the more upmarket toilets she saw on her travels.But the latrines have brought new problems. Jeanne Ramanandraisoa, 58, has lost five ducks down the hole over four months. “They follow the flies,” she says. “We got three out with a stick, but two died. We need to make the hole smaller.” Her crops, at least, are no longer infected. “Now I can eat what I grow. Before, I could not. There were lots of flies on the sweetcorn, because there were so many people shitting just next to the field.”“It is the habit of the Vezo to come to the beach early in the morning to see the fishermen set off for the day,” says Angeline. She is married to a fisherman and has five children, aged 12 to 28. Dawn is also the time when people relieve themselves. “That is one of the places,” she says, pointing to some rocks.The toilet seems to  the entire length of the beach. The contrast between the beauty of the surroundings – the beach in the golden light pirogues, boats made from a hollowed-out log, each powered by a hand-stitched sail, being manoeuvred into the sea – and the sight of people squatting down is surreal.Kolo Fritjob, the mayor of Morondava, agrees a “sanitary block” on the beach front is an answer, but he has the budget to build only one latrine a year. He receives no money from central government for sanitation. “It is not their priority,” he explains. “Pensions, education, health – they have money for those things, but not for water, sanitation and hygiene.” Fritjob says the council has funded a team of 12 “poo policemen” who prohibit people from defecating on the beach. But that is only in “touristy areas”.Florette Raharinirina, 16, who has bleached hair and a mobile phone, tells me that young people are angry about the lack of sanitation. Is she hopeful that latrines will get built? “No. It’s too hard. It’s always about money and people don’t have money.” I ask if there are any benefits to pooing outdoors. She sighs. “There is nothing good about it,” she says. She and her friend Shella Nomenjanahary, 15, use the isolated side of the beach, where they crouch side by side. “People can see us, every time we go.”As she prepares to leave, I ask her to describe her fantasy toilet. She has given this subject some thought. It would be “really big with rose walls and white tiles”, she says, “with a flush soft toilet paper”. And a lockable door.It is the middle of the rainy season in Ambatoantrano. The maize and cassava plants are bushy and green squash vines loop over the trees. One woman’s front garden is filled with geraniums. This has been a shift since water arrived people grow plants for decoration, not just to eat.There is change, too, in Augustin’s family. Odile’s son, 10-year-old Nantenaina, has moved in with Augustin. “I really love my grandfather and worried he was a bit lonely,” Nantenaina explains. His favourite time of the days is after school, when he and Augustin work together in the fields. “We weed the cassava, or go fishing,” he says. Odile, who lives next door, is happy with this arrangement.The village latrines have survived their third year. The worry with self-designed toilets is they will collapse in the rainy season if not built in a “technically sound way”, Hueso says. But aside from a few grumbles about leaks, the outlook in the village is optimistic.There is still malaria, of course, and most recently plague. But Stella Vaonirina, 38, the village community health worker, says she used to treat about 30 cases of diarrhoea a month when she arrived in the village in 1999. Now it is about four. “Some people still have diarrhoea, but they don’t die from it,” she says. “That’s the difference.”• Sally Williams travelled to Madagascar with WaterAid.

From roadside verges and patches of waste ground to the flowerbeds in my Somerset garden, I am seeing dozens of these attractive black, white and orange butterflies, as they flit from flower to flower, feeding hungrily on nectar.They’re not the only butterflies currently on the wing. As the last meadow browns, pale and faded from the sun, straggle along the hedgerows, I’m seeing newly minted gatekeepers and common blues wherever I go. And, on a recent visit to my coastal patch, I came across two exquisite little butterflies, brown argus and small heath: the latter the 21st species of butterfly I have recorded there in less than five years.But we should remember that butterfly populations have always fluctuated from year to year, depending largely on the prevailing weather conditions. To assess these figures more carefully, we really need to look at the long-term trends, which are rather less positive. For many of Britain’s favourite summer butterflies, including the once-common and familiar small tortoiseshell, there has been a steady decline over the past 40 years or so. This is due to a combination of factors, of which the most serious are the intensification of farming, combined with a more general fragmentation and loss of habitat.Peter Marren, a naturalist whose latest book, Emperors, Admirals and Chimney Sweepers, tells the compelling story of the weird and wonderful names of our butterflies and moths, sounds a note of caution about the recent glut of sightings. While accepting that warm weather is good for adult butterflies, he points out that it may not be quite so favourable for their offspring, which often rely on a specific plant on which their caterpillars feed.“Where butterflies come unstuck in prolonged hot weather is if their larval food plants dry up – for example, if the chalkhill and adonis blues find only stunted, dried-up horseshoe vetch to lay their eggs on.” As he points out, the famous long, hot summer of 1976 was a bumper year for these species, but the following year, 1977, a very poor one, as the majority of caterpillars failed to survive.He also notes that the recent mass appearance of painted ladies – recalling the extraordinary summer of 2009, when tens of millions of these butterflies could be seen throughout the UK – has absolutely nothing to do with the weather here in Britain. Instead, it indicates that conditions were favourable on the fringes of the Sahara in Morocco, where these butterflies came from.The ones we are seeing now are actually the offspring of an earlier generation, which arrived in the UK back in the late spring. These butterflies are now feeding to boost their energy levels in preparation for flying south again.Research by scientists at Butterfly Conservation confirms that the long-term population trend of some of our most charismatic insects is indeed downward, with more than three-quarters of the UK’s butterflies and two-thirds of larger moths in decline.This has a knock-on effect on ecosystems and species: cuckoo chicks, for example, rely on their host parents finding large moth caterpillars for them to survive. But partly because of the shortage of these, cuckoo numbers have dropped by two-thirds since the early 1980s, mirroring the fall in their food supply.We need to know more about population trends in Britain’s butterflies – as we do for any declining species and groups – so Butterfly Conservation urges people to take part in the charity’s annual Big Butterfly Count. As its spokesperson Katie Callaghan explains: “This will provide a picture of how butterflies and larger moths have fared this year, compared with every summer over the last 10 years.”Last year more than 100,000 people took part in the survey, logging almost a million inidual butterflies during just 15 minutes of observations. This year’s count ends on 11 August, and so, weather permitting, you still have a chance to take part. As Sir David Attenborough, the organisation’s president, has pointed out, doing so helps contribute to our wider understanding of the UK’s wildlife: “The Big Butterfly Count is about more than just counting butterflies – we’ll be taking the pulse of nature.”One of the biggest threats – and opportunities – facing Britain’s butterflies is the current climate emergency. And, as with any response to higher temperatures, there will be winners and losers. Common and adaptable species, such as the peacock and comma, have already begun to extend their ranges northwards into Scotland, and are likely to continue to do well as the climate heats up. But, as Marren points out, rare and localised species are less likely to be able to respond to change, especially if, as predicted, it changes the nature of their more specialised habitats.One example is the wood white, a delicate butterfly found in woodlands in a few parts of southern England and the West Midlands, where it can be seen fluttering along woodland rides and the sheltered edges of clearings. Although higher temperatures should in theory allow the wood white to shift its range northwards, its inability to cross large swathes of unsuitable habitat means that it is unable to take advantage of a warming world.We would also expect that, as average spring and summer temperatures continue to rise, new butterfly species will cross the Channel, adding to our paltry total of fewer than 60 species (compared with almost 500 in Europe as a whole).Yet despite the rise in records of continental European species such as the large tortoiseshell, long-tailed blue and the spectacular queen of Spain fritillary during the past decade, none has yet managed to establish permanent breeding populations here.That’s in sharp contrast to other groups of flying insects, such as moths and damselflies, of which several species have successfully colonised in Britain. Surely it is only a matter of time before those new butterflies join them.So, to sum up, some of Britain’s butterflies are enjoying the benefits of hotter-than-average summers – at least in the short term – while, as with all our wild creatures, they face an uncertain future in a rapidly changing world.Stephen Moss is a naturalist, author and lecturer based in Somerset • Persuading butterflies to choose your garden is relatively simple: provide plants that produce the nectar on which the adults will feed• Native wild flowers are often considered to be more suitable than non-native ones, but the real key is making sure there are nectar-rich flowers in bloom from April through to October• Letting part of your garden go wild, with nettles, thistles, grasses and other “weeds”, will provide a place for caterpillars to feed and pupate, ensuring you have a new generation of butterflies later on• In autumn, leave fallen fruit on the ground: painted ladies and red admirals love feeding on the fermenting juices• Avoid using pesticides and chemicals.

Although these desert dwellers require much less water than most plants, the most recent year-long drought in California left the ground too desiccated to support many young trees, the researchers said.Eventually, most of the park will become too hot and dry for the Joshua trees. The predictions, based on climate change data from the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and other global-scale models, forecast that summers in the national park would be an average of three degrees celsius hotter, in the best case, and five degrees hotter in the worst case.“It makes me angry, and I do get tired and burned out,” said Rand Abbot, a Joshua Tree resident and park volunteer. “I don’t want this beautiful area to end up looking like something out of Mad Max.”Right now, “the landscape looks like it came out of a Dr Seuss book”, said Barrows. “Joshua trees look like a fantasy.” They’re also a keystone species that provide food and shelter for other plants and animals – once they’re gone, much of the desert ecosystem would disappear as well, he noted.Even if the trees manage to ride out warming temperatures, they face additional threats from smog and wildfires. “The national park is right on a path for the smog from LA to go east into the desert,” Barrows said. Nitrogen dioxide from polluted air has acted as a fertilizer, encouraging the growth of non-native grasses across the desert, which have fueled unprecedented wildfires.In recent years, crews have been working to cut down the invasive grasses, but in the dry, desert environment, “just one lightning strike can wipe out acres,” Barrows noted. “And very few Joshua trees tend to survive wildfires.”The study didn’t evaluate how Joshua trees outside the national park, including ones that grow in parts of Nevada and Arizona, will fare. “It’s possible they’ll have a better future there,” Barrows said.A 2011 study predicted that while global heating would wipe out most of the Joshua trees in California, some could survive in the northern-most areas of their natural range. It is unclear if that forecast will change in light of more recent climate data indicating a hotter future than scientists previously expected.Overall, the latest report “is extremely discouraging”, said Kenji Haroutunian of the volunteer group Friends Of Joshua Tree. “But at the same time – I don’t see it as a case where we might as well give up.”“Yes, the park is underfunded, and threatened by overuse – but at the end of the day getting more visitors to come and see what an amazing place it is maybe the key to saving it,” said Haroutunian, who’s been frequenting the national park since the mid-1980 and leads groups of visitors on rock climbing trips.He wants to encourage more people to come and experience the landscape – perhaps before it’s too late.“It’s just a fascinating place. You know, a few years ago, literally every Joshua tree in the park bloomed at the same time,” he said. “In my mind, it was like the trees were fighting back. Like, ‘Alright everyone, let’s go.’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4bf02fea6ca6dcd92cdc9ed927a9f1bfc5de5f5e/25_531_534_321/master/534.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99cead37c0c7aae27537dc5064a20b0e","title":"suspected pollution incident turns river frome tributary blue","story":"Environment Agency analysing Somerset stream but says there are no reports of dead wildlifeA mysterious substance that has turned a tributary of a river in the West Country bright blue is being investigated by the Environment Agency.Tests are being carried out on the River Frome in Somerset this weekend after the water turned a luminous colour.

His complex tale of immigration and integration was not the easiest sell.But, in today’s unsettled world, the story feels pertinent as never before. Now the film, starring Mark Rylance, Johnny Depp and Robert Pattinson, is receiving its world premiere at this month’s Venice film festival.“Now all governments try to push away immigration, so immigrants are not really welcome. But this movie will show how important and beautiful integration and immigration can be … We believe that the message which this movie gives is very important, more important than 10 or 20 years ago.”The film is the first English-language movie for the film’s Colombian director, Ciro Guerra and the screenplay is by Coetzee. When his novel was published in 1980, critics described it as a “masterwork”, a parable about the use of mythical enemies for social control. In a story set in an imaginary empire populated by barbarian tribes, Rylance plays The Magistrate, “a responsible official”, who begins to question imperialism. Iervolino described by Variety magazine as one of the industry’s most powerful independent producers, is investing hundreds of millions of dollars in major movies, said the actor deserved an Oscar for his performance.“He plays someone who realises that the government was trying to scare the population by saying that ‘the barbarians are coming, bad people are coming, the invasion is coming’. Actually, the government was only instilling fear.”Depp portrays a heartless bureaucrat despatched by the Empire’s secret service amid claims that the barbarians are preparing to mutiny."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/978c4dc5b5a33525523716d1cd6dfd53df4a7d3d/675_133_1810_1086/master/1810.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=643359134ef832355fff415cffcc3a1b","title":"west ham manchester city premier league match report","story":"Welcome to the new world. Which looks, it must be said, quite a lot like the old world. On a breezy afternoon in east London, Manchester City’s two-times champions kicked off the new season with a defeat of West Ham that barely required a shift out of second gear.Raheem Sterling made it four goals in a week with a wonderful hat-trick. Riyad Mahrez was involved throughout, passing, moving and dribbling with a familiar elan, and taking a decisive hand in the first four goals. Kevin De Bruyne looked close to his hard-running best in midfield.Inbetween this, VAR kept up a regular commentary on City’s dominance, disallowing one goal, retaining another and ordering a penalty retake.This will surely become a feature of City’s matches given the rhythm of their attacks, the way cut-backs from the flanks and cute runs along the defensive line are key to their best moments. Otherwise it was a breathtaking show of controlled strength. Their opponents may come forewarned of the way City attack and facing essentially the same set of players. Trying to stop them is another matter altogether.The stadium was full at kick-off, the skies above an autumnal grey, the atmosphere inside largely undetectable beneath the brain-mangling volume of the pre-match PA.West Ham had seven players in their starting lineup who have joined the club in the past year. This included their record signing Sébastien Haller, who had previously mused on whether he might get a touch of the ball.But West Ham did start brightly, with Jack Wilshere prominent in midfield, and Haller was sharp in the opening minutes, dropping deep at times and playing neatly with his back to goal.Steadily, City began to exert their own patterns. With nine minutes gone, Mahrez had their first shot at goal, grooving in from the left and drawing a low save from Lukasz Fabianksi.After 20 minutes Manuel Pellegrini appeared for the first time on his touchline, a small, sharp-suited figure in the middle of all that branded claret carpet, gesturing anxiously towards West Ham’s left.Perhaps he was asking Michail Antonio to offer a little cover to his full-back. If so it went unheeded. Almost immediately Mahrez did his Mahrez thing, sitting Aaron Cresswell down on the turf inside his own area with that same old shimmy, but shooting into the side-netting.The first goal arrived two minutes later courtesy of a lovely move down that side. De Bruyne carried the ball across from the left. Mahrez played a delightful through pass for Kyle Walker, tearing down the right. The cut-back was deflected on to Gabriel Jesus, who finished neatly.It was a move City repeated throughout the first half. It seems odd that opponents still set up against them as though in fear of being pierced down the middle. One day someone is going to say hang it all and just play two full-backs instead.On 32 minutes, there was a first intervention from VAR as a bored-sounding voice said: “They’re checking for a red card.” Followed, a few moments later, by “No red card”.Ten minutes before half-time the home team had their first shot at goal, a hooked effort over the shoulder from Haller and City went to the break having barely broken into a collective sprint.It was 2-0 five minutes after half-time. This was a glorious move down the right. Mahrez fed De Bruyne on the charge. He glided into space and played a perfectly weighted ball to Sterling, who veered in on goal and finished with ease.Two minutes later it was 3-0, then 2-0 again as VAR scrubbed off the goal for a very narrow offside against Sterling’s shoulder a moment of technical offside-dom that offered no advantage and a decision that penalised a fine piece of movement.Clearly the offside rule needs to be tweaked for the post-VAR world. The best suggestion being: you are onside until the whole of you is offside.For a while West Ham pressed hard again and after 72 minutes they should have pulled one back. Ryan Fredericks whipped in a cross from the right and Ederson pulled off a fine double save, first from Javier Hernández’s left thigh, then from Manuel Lanzini’s header. Moments later it was finally 3-0.Mahrez cut inside and lofted a beautiful little pass over the defence. Sterling read it, stayed onside, then produced a lovely lobbed finish.There was time for Fabianksi to save a weak 83rd-minute penalty from Sergio Agüero, on as a sub, before VAR ordered a successful retake for encroachment by Declan Rice and as the stadium began to empty Sterling completed his hat-trick with a lovely low finish after fine work from Rodri."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b601c115512b9569f505185601226b21f4d9b68/0_114_2816_1689/master/2816.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5333ce6a58e82ebe09c771869af2f4c9","title":"crystal palace v everton watford v brighton and more clockwatch live","story":"Minute-by-minute report: Scott Murray is on hand to bring you the latest from White Hart Lane, where it’s scoreless after three minutes.

The amount you have will determine what sort of plans you can turn into reality.Putting together a financial plan for each of these defining moments can give you greater freedom and choice. You’ll be able to enjoy each stage without worrying so much about money issues.If you are financially secure, you can take more informed decisions about moving jobs or changing career you may even get better deals on products such as mortgages and loans and you’ll have more time to spend on the things that matter to you – like leisure, travel and family.Taking time to set goals, thinking about what your priorities are, and putting in place a savings scheme for the future are all essential elements in good financial planning. The good news is that it’s never too early or too late to start.You would imagine that you need a lot of money in order to start saving or investing. In reality, even relatively small sums can grow into a sizeable nest egg over time.The real secret of financial planning is making regular contributions and sticking at it over the long term. Building personal wealth is not a quick fix. Taking a lot of risk with your hard-earned cash in the hope of securing a short-term gain could be counter-productive.Instead, you should think of managing your money as a lifelong strategy and the key to future freedom, which can change and adapt as your personal circumstances change. When you are younger, you might take a little more risk and perhaps consider investing as a way of protecting your savings against inflation. In retirement you might need to think about how to protect your funds against sudden falls in value.Whatever age you are, the best way to start is to put away a bit of money at a time and allow interest to accumulate and investments to grow. If you save or invest into an inidual savings account (Isa), then everything you earn will be free of income and capital gains tax – giving your savings plan a boost.If you think of managing your money as the key to freedom, rather than a chore, you gain a new perspective on your finances. There are three key elements to planning for the big events in your life: setting goals, making it a habit, and reviewing your progress.What do you want to achieve with your savings and investments? Identifying a tangible goal – such as saving up a deposit for a home, being able to afford a wonderful honeymoon, or taking time off work after the birth of a baby – can be more motivational than having a vague idea of saving for some undefined future event. It’s important to have a rainy day fund first, for those unexpected events, so you won’t need to dip into your goal pots in troubled times.Now build in a timeframe – when will you need the money? What will you need to do in order to start saving? How much can you start with and could you make savings in your monthly spending in order to free up some spare cash? Small changes can make a big difference over the long term. For instance, if you have one less takeaway coffee at £3 a day, this equates to £15 a week, which over a year will amount to more than £700.If you have multiple goals, split your saving priorities into pots of money – short term, medium term and long term. Short term might be money for a fantastic honeymoon or overseas trip in a year or two medium term might be wanting to save for a house deposit over five or six years and long term will be your retirement planning.When you are clear about your goals and your timeframe, then you can start to think about the best home for your money.For funds you want to access within the next five years, you might consider a deposit account. You can make small incremental payments into a savings account or cash Isa. Moving money from your current account to a savings account on the day you get paid, or setting up a standing order, will mean you’re not tempted to spend it. However, as many of these are instant access, you’ll need to be disciplined about not touching it. If you think you might be tempted, consider a fixed rate savings product that locks your money away, often in return for a better interest rate.If your goal is five years or more away, you could consider investing in a variety of ways, at different levels of risk. Although these carry a higher risk than cash savings, they can also protect your money from the effect of inflation if your investments outperform the rate of interest offered by savings accounts. As you start this journey, it might be wise not to chase big wins or follow fashion – but instead to opt for a slower but safer approach, perhaps choosing funds that invest in a broad range of shares rather than trying to pick inidual companies. There are many sources of information about market trends, and it’s always good to become familiar with these.Any money you put into Pension savings has the benefit of being boosted by tax relief, but you can’t access the fund until you’re at least 55 and it’s best to wait until you retire. You should join a scheme at work if they have one, or save into your own private pension.It’s easy to start off with good intentions, and then forget to continue because of a lack of time or motivation.The key to successful money management is automating your financial commitments. Set up a regular amount to leave your bank account and be paid directly into your Isa or savings account. That way, the money has moved before you spend it, and you never have to set a reminder.Playing the long game can work in your favour, because the interest you build up in a deposit account will accumulate naturally. If you are investing for the long-term in the stock market, you’ll be less concerned with the short-term ups and downs of share prices. Sometimes people approach saving and investment in an emotional, rather than a rational way.It’s easy to buy shares when the stock market is doing well, and then panic after they have fallen. Try to take a long-term view, and check how your strategy is working for the long term, rather than from month to month.

Born Larissa de Macedo Machado in the same year the Meltdown festival began, the 26-year-old is curator Nile Rodgers’ most eye-catching booking. The Chic guitarist has taken great care to ensure that his nine-day festival wraps its arms around as many ages, genders, sexualities and continents as it can, and Anitta embodies his inclusive ethos. A bisexual singer-songwriter-dancer-producer-manager brought up in the favelas and raised up by Instagram, Anitta has curated her career, her brand, to appeal to every possible demographic. Some, however, have criticised her for not denouncing the reactionary Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, quickly or loudly enough, as if her very existence wasn’t a rebuke to his toxic stew of misogyny and homophobia.The energy Anitta inspires tonight is hugely female, slightly gay and head-spinningly euphoric. There’s more Portuguese being spoken than English, and a bewildering number of you’re-not-going-out-like-that outfits for a Tuesday night, not least on Nile himself, who’s chosen a luminous yellow camo confusion that probably has a half-life of around 500 years. He’s an expert, self-deprecating crowdpleaser, lying on the stage for front-row selfies, then leading us in a thunderous chant of “Anitta! Anitta!” before ing out of the way lest he get crushed by the oncoming pop juggernaut. Everyone who can stand is jumping and yelling, and the venue totters on the verge of an actual meltdown.Breaking into her 2019 crossover album Kisses, and its opening song Atención, Anitta doesn’t immediately have the best voice you’ve ever heard, but it’s strong and malleable, perfect for her music, a teetering tower of grinding, 15-certificate baile funk, reggaeton and modish urban pop-R\u0026ampB that slows down only briefly, if at all. The stagecraft is, like her setlist, uncomplicated, efficient, calculated to create ludicrously exciting results. It’s focused around mostly female dancers in all-black outfits who spend a remarkable amount of their time on stage bent over, facing away from the audience, jiggling. Somehow it never seems sleazy, perhaps thanks to the ruthlessly professional, decisive choreography. It’s no ifs, all butts, the women in control. When one male dancer has to slap Anitta’s proffered bum, he does it sheepishly, looking pleadingly at the crowd as if he knows he’s being paid to do it, but still isn’t sure he won’t be sacked in the morning.Anitta also slow-dances lasciviously with one of the female dancers, but mostly she crouches slightly as she sings, a hunter stalking the stage, setting out an unimpeachable string of hits as bait. The alpha and omega of her performance are the two long twerking interludes, when she sets the microphone aside and just goes for it. Within seconds, people in the aisles are imitating her moves, then freestyle dancing, singing and waving back at her. Later she does a mid-song slutdrop, sticks a tongue out at the nearest phone and breaks into a brilliant grin, all without breaking stride or dropping a note.Three days earlier, Chic’s opening ceremony gig is much more of a stately swoon by comparison. As ever with Rodgers’ fantastic band, there is an occasional frustration that a setlist entirely composed of some of the greatest songs ever sung celebrates their 7in rather than 12in forms: the true transcendence of I Want Your Love or Sister Sledge’s Lost in Music and He’s the Greatest Dancer is difficult, although not impossible, to locate in two minutes.Although Rodgers’ fizzingly enthusiastic pre-gig opening address is fascinating, climaxing with a 15-minute explanation of how he rearranged David Bowie’s demo of a folk song called Let’s Dance into a worldwide disco-funk-pop smash, it’s hard not to imagine how some of this time could have been spent on a properly expansive Studio 54 Chic live set. Still, when you have an endless store of stories that begin: “So, one night David Bowie walks into my bedroom...”, you can do what you like with your time on stage.Yes, it’s a shame that the festival is expensive and there aren’t more free live performances, which means it’s difficult for people to stumble across inspirational performers such as Anitta, or thrilling young Afrojazz collective Kokoroko, who bewitch the Queen Elizabeth Hall on Monday night. Still, the things Meltdown does well – smooth organisation, affable atmosphere and thoughtful curation – have been particularly notable in this 2019 edition. A great collaborator should make a great curator, and Rodgers is perhaps pop’s greatest collaborator. Importantly, his Meltdown is a love letter not to a type of music but a type of person, a call to the open-minded. Rodgers has long known that the key lessons of Saturday Night Fever, arts festivals such as Meltdown, and of disco itself, are that even those from the most closed communities can be transformed forever through music and dancing. His Meltdown is trying to tell us that sometimes just showing up is a political statement, that even hedonism can be a revolutionary act."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ed95c6acec044736a1563ec10994ab9b14d9d36/0_195_1825_1095/master/1825.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c43fa97365609791930026e70ebb3f7","title":"dominic cummings owns farm got eu subsidy","story":"Boris Johnson’s controversial enforcer, Dominic Cummings, an architect of Brexit and a fierce critic of Brussels, is co-owner of a farm that has received €250,000 (£235,000) in EU farming subsidies, the Observer can reveal.The revelation is a potential embarrassment for the mastermind behind Johnson’s push to leave the EU by 31 October. Since being appointed as Johnson’s chief adviser, Cummings has presented the battle to leave the EU as one between the people and the politicians. He positions himself as an outsider who wants to demolish elites, end the “absurd subsidies” paid out by the EU and liberate the UK from its arcane rules and regulations.But his critics say the revelation that Cummings has benefited from the system he intends to smash underscores how many British farmers are reliant on EU money that would evaporate if the UK leaves.An Observer analysis of Land Registry documents and EU subsidy databases reveals that a farm in Durham, which Cummings jointly owns with his parents and another person, has received roughly €20,000 a year for most of the last two decades.The revelation opens Cummings up to charges of hypocrisy, as he has attacked the use of agricultural subsidies “dreamed up in the 1950s and 1960s” because they “raise prices for the poor to subsidise rich farmers while damaging agriculture in Africa” on his blog.He notoriously came up with the claim that leaving the EU would allow the UK to spend an extra £350m a week on the NHS. His blog clarified the claim, explaining “the Treasury gross figure is slightly more than £350m of which we get back roughly half, though some of this is spent in absurd ways like subsidies for very rich landowners to do stupid things”.The money was paid out to Cummings’s parents and another family member for several reasons including “set aside” – the now abolished and controversial scheme that paid farmers not to grow anything. The programme has been blamed for making it harder for food producers in developing countries to compete with their European counterparts.A separate website, operated by the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, confirms further payments of roughly £6,500 each were made to Cummings’s parents “for practices beneficial for climate and environment” in 2017 and 2018.And scrutiny of a third, offline database, reveals that subsidies worth nearly £19,000 were paid out in 2014.The Liberal Democrats’ spokeswoman for young people, Layla Moran, said: “It shows sheer hypocrisy from Cummings that his farm has raked in hundreds of thousands from the ‘absurd subsidies’ he so often criticises.”It is not clear when Cummings became the co-owner of the farm which his father reportedly bought after retiring from the oil industry. Land Registry searches show he was a co-owner in 2013. Reports suggest he moved to the farm in 2002, after leaving his job as the Conservative party’s director of strategy.A profile of the Oxford-educated Cummings, for the Conservative Home website, explains that after quitting the post, “he then proceeded to spend two-and-a-half years in a bunker he and his father built for him on their farm in Durham, reading science and history and trying to understand the world”.His return to frontline politics has ided Tories. Some question whether his desire for Brexit comes at the expense of appreciating what may happen in key industries if EU structures and financial support disappear overnight.Farmers have expressed their fears about what would happen to their sector. Last month, Helen Roberts of the National Sheep Association in Wales, said it would be “absolutely catastrophic” to leave with no deal and could lead to civil unrest among sheep farmers.According to the National Farmers Union, today is the day the country would notionally run out of food if it had only eaten British food from the start of the year.In the absence of EU subsidies, the NFU wants the government to give a long-term budgetary commitment for food and farming through a new agricultural policy that “rewards farmers fairly for delivering public goods, supports stability and resilience, and provides funding that recognises the long, multi-annual timeframes farmers and growers operate to”.Boris Johnson, however, has so far declined to spell out what help would be given to farmers once EU subsidies end. A Downing St spokeswoman declined to comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/efba110962cf4d5668531bbf336cd08482e4200d/138_0_2118_1271/master/2118.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d7bd1457fea5db2a2055f630322931d","title":"most important isotope how carbon 14 revolutionised science","story":"Martin Kamen had worked for three days and three nights without sleep. The US chemist was finishing off a project in which he and a colleague, Sam Ruben, had bombarded a piece of graphite with subatomic particles. The aim of their work was to create new forms of carbon, ones that might have practical uses.Exhausted, Kamen staggered out of his laboratory at Berkeley in California, having finished off the project in the early hours of 27 February 1940. He desperately needed a break. Rumpled, red eyed and with a three-day growth of beard, he looked a mess.And that was unfortunate. Berkeley police were then searching for an escaped convict who had just committed several murders. So when they saw the unkempt Kamen they promptly picked him up, bundled him into the back of their patrol car and interrogated him as a suspected killer.Thus one of most revolutionary pieces of research undertaken in the past century was nearly terminated at birth when one of its lead scientists was accused of murder. It was only when witnesses made it clear that Kamen was not the man the police were after that he was released and allowed to go back to the University of California Radiation Laboratory to look at the lump of graphite that he and Ruben had been irradiating.It did not take the pair long to realise they had produced a substance with remarkable properties, one that has since transformed a host of different scientific fields and continues to help scientists make major discoveries. By irradiating graphite, they had created carbon-14.“That gloomy night and morning of 27 February 1940 began a revolution in physiology, biochemistry, archaeology, geology, biomedicine, oceanography, palaeoclimatology and anthropology as well as nuclear chemistry,” says environment researcher John Marra, author of the newly published Hot Carbon: Carbon-14 and a Revolution in Science. “Carbon-14, perhaps the most important isotope to life on Earth, was ‘born’.”Carbon-14 has six protons and eight neutrons in its nucleus. By contrast, most of the carbon in our bodies and in the outside world, known as carbon-12, has six protons and six neutrons. Crucially, those two extra neutrons make the nucleus of a carbon-14 atom unstable so that it decays radioactively into an atom of nitrogen. More importantly, these decays are relatively infrequent so that it is possible to measure changes in a carbon sample over tens of thousands of years. (See box below.)The nucleus of an element is made up of subatomic particles: protons and neutrons. The number of protons in the nucleus of an element defines its chemical behaviour. But atoms of the same element can possess different numbers of neutrons in their nuclei. These different forms are known as isotopes.Carbon has three main isotopes: carbon-12, carbon-13 and carbon-14. The first two are stable but the last decays radioactively.In any sample, carbon-14 atoms will take around 5,730 years to lose half their number. Thus carbon-14 is said to have a half-life of 5,730 years.“Carbon is what we are made of,” says Marra, who is professor of earth and environmental sciences at Brooklyn College, New York. “Carbon is life. It is fundamental also to how we live, how the Earth is habitable – pretty much everything. And since the discovery of a long-lived radioisotope of carbon, we have an amazing tool to delve into almost every aspect of existence on Earth – and perhaps the universe.”As Marra reveals in this remarkable history of carbon-14, scientists quickly realised the isotope must affect living beings today. Cosmic rays batter the upper atmosphere and send cascades of neutrons through the air, they calculated. These neutrons strike atoms of nitrogen, the main component of Earth’s atmosphere, and transform some into atoms of carbon-14. In turn, these atoms combine with oxygen to create radioactive carbon dioxide that is absorbed by plants, which are then eaten by animals. “Every living thing on Earth thus becomes radioactive, albeit slightly,” says Marra.And it dawned on Willard Libby of Chicago University that the radioactivity generated by carbon-14 could be exploited to tremendous advantage. A chemist who had worked on the Manhattan Project to build the first atom bomb, Libby realised that when an organism dies, it will stop absorbing carbon, including carbon-14, and its existing store of the latter will slowly decay. So, by measuring the radioactivity of a sample taken from the organism, its carbon-14 content could be estimated and the date of its time of death could be measured. The sciences of archaeology and palaeontology were about to be revolutionised.A major problem had to be overcome, however. Carbon-14 exists in only very low levels in the tissue of recently deceased animals and plants: about one in a trillion of their carbon atoms are carbon-14. By contrast, natural background radiation – from thorium and uranium in rocks and other sources – is much, much higher. How could researchers separate carbon-14’s weak signal from this overwhelming background noise?Libby solved the problem by carefully shielding his detectors and developing ways to tune out any radiation that made it through to the walls of his device. Then he turned to the gas methane, which contains carbon, to provide final validation of his technique, comparing samples from two very different sources. One sample was extracted from natural gas, a fossil fuel whose carbon-14 should have decayed long ago. The second came from the city of Baltimore sewerage system and was extracted from human excrement. It should be rich in carbon-14, having just been produced by humans, Libby reasoned.And that is exactly what he found. Ancient methane had no carbon-14. By contrast, methane newly excreted by humans was relatively rich in the isotope. As Marra says: “Human waste from sewer lines sent science onward.”Libby then provided final proof of his dating technology by measuring the radioactivity – and, by inference, the age – of a series of organic samples of known antiquity: wood from the Egyptian funeral ship of Sesostris III, linen that had wrapped a Dead Sea scroll and a bread roll that had been “cooked” in the volcanic eruption that buried Pompeii. His results perfectly matched the known dates of the items he had scanned.It was a brilliant undertaking for which Libby was awarded the Nobel prize for chemistry in 1960, though he was lucky in one sense. Libby assumed that the rate of carbon-14 production in the atmosphere had been constant for the past few tens of thousands of years. In fact, it has varied fairly widely, thanks to changes in sunspot activity, atmospheric nuclear bomb tests and rising emissions of carbon dioxide from fossil fuels. These have to be taken carefully into account when estimating ages, scientists now realise, though the underlying basis of radiocarbon dating remains sound.More recently, radiocarbon dating has changed from simply measuring the radioactivity emitted by carbon-14 nuclei to directly counting numbers of atoms of the isotope in a sample. This is done using a technique called accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS), which has allowed scientists to date bones, artefacts and other carbon-based items from the tiniest sample. “This was a huge advance,” says Marra. “Instead of grams of material to analyse, AMS requires only milligrams.”In this way, the developers of AMS triggered a dating revolution that began in the 60s and has since “ushered in a ‘new archaeology’ revolution”, says Marra. One example involving the use of carbon-14 resulted in the overturning of the idea that past western European cultures had depended on practices and ideas that began in the Middle East and slowly disseminated westwards with the spread of farming. Radiocarbon dating revealed a very different picture and showed that the neolithic cultures of Britain, France and central Europe must have evolved independently.Later, the technique was used by laboratories in Britain, Switzerland and the United States to date the flax used to weave the Turin shroud. This cloth, marked with the negative image of a bearded man, was believed by some to be the burial shroud in which Jesus was wrapped after crucifixion. Using only a few fragments of cloth, scientists dated it to 1260-1390AD.Over the years, uses of carbon-14 have spread well beyond dating ancient artefacts. Drugs can be labelled with carbon-14 and followed as they pass through the body in order to test their safety and efficacy. Other researchers have used the isotope to trace the way in which plants convert carbon dioxide into sugar, revealing the intricate processes underpinning photosynthesis.In addition, carbon-14 has been exploited to study plankton and other forms of sea life, revealing how the waters of the oceans circulate in a great interconnected web of currents that sweep round the planet. “The carbon content of a fish will register what it has been eating, which in turn will reflect the chemistry of the surrounding water, which will be influenced by how the ocean has mixed,” says Marra. For good measure, carbon-14 is now playing a major role in uncovering how climates have changed on Earth over tens of thousands of years, work of immense importance as scientists struggle to understand how rising carbon emissions are now triggering dangerous global heating.“We have gained substantial understanding about the natural world over the past 60 to 70 years, in no small part because of carbon-14,” says Marra. Certainly, it is hard to exaggerate the impact it has had on science. Yet its discoverers, Kamen and Ruben, both fared badly in the wake of their breakthrough.Kamen, who came from a family of Lithuanian and Belarusian émigrés, aroused the suspicion of US security forces after the US entered the second world war and he was observed dining with Soviet consular officials. He was summarily sacked from his laboratory and his passport was impounded. Kamen was later brought before the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1948, accused of passing secrets to the Soviets. It was not until the end of the century that his reputation was rehabilitated.Ruben had even worse luck. After Pearl Harbor, he began research on the physiological effects of phosgene gas, a chemical weapon. During one test, an ampoule of the gas broke and he was sprayed with phosgene. He died a few hours later.If the story of carbon-14 is one of the remarkable examples of scientific progress in the 20th century, the sad fates of two of its main players is a sign of the turbulent times in which they lived. • Hot Carbon: Carbon-14 and a Revolution in Science by John Marra is published by Columbia University Press (£27).

It’s hard for her – but just as tough for mum and dad After graduating three years ago I moved back in with my parents – it was the most logical thing to do at the time as I was only in my first job, so not having to pay rent in London was a no-brainer. Unsurprisingly, I’m not the only to return to the family home. As it turns out there is a whole community of us still living under our parents’ roofs – a community most commonly referred to as the Boomerang Generation.According to the Office of National Statistics, one in four young adults aged 20-34 were living with their parents in 2018 – a significant increase on previous years. With the rent for a home in big cities rising disproportionately to our salaries, topped with zero certainty in jobs and the political climate, the results are hardly surprising. Due to astronomical house prices, if you are lucky enough to get on the property ladder in your twenties, it will most likely be with money loaned or given to you by your family.Other generations – particularly those baby-boomers who were lucky enough to have reaped the rewards of a successful economy, rising property prices and generous welfare state – might label being forced to live in the cushy comforts of your own family home as a first-world problem, and in some ways they aren’t wrong. The fridge is always full your clothes seem to appear magically clean and ironed just a couple days after you’ve worn them.Your relationship with your parents has probably improved as you’ve left your ungrateful teenage attitude behind you and you might even enjoy each other’s company. And, most importantly, your financial contributions to all of this are next to zero.So what’s the catch? Well, personally, this wasn’t how I imagined I would be spending my mid-twenties. Living under your parents’ roof after existing independently for a few years at university inevitably changes the family dynamic. On the one hand there are certain expectations that crop up once you move back in – I now need to pull my own weight with household chores, for example, cook dinner twice a week and contribute towards the weekly food shop.Then there are aspects which are exactly the same as they ever were: the fixed dinner times, the reluctance to watch my “rubbish” TV programmes in the evening (RIP Love Island) and having to update my parents on whether I’ll be at home for dinner months in advance.What comes from these requests is the pressure to not only comply, but also to be grateful. Whether it’s not thanking my mum for all the ironing she does for me, or forgetting to feed the cat, it is very easy to seem ungrateful. Living under your parents’ roof in your mid-twenties is a constant reminder that you are not living your own life yet, a psychological obstacle to your own identity and freedom.My parents are fully within their right to expect all of this of me: after all, it is their house and their rules. For fear of sounding ungrateful, I just wish it was my own house, with my own rules.However, I know that in order to have me at home my parents are sacrificing freedoms of their own. For starters, I’m sure they don’t actually want me to join in every time they have a dinner date, but nevertheless I will always be invited along.You hear about “empty nest syndrome” among parents who can’t cope once their children leave for good. But I know that my parents, like many others, very much intend on us eventually leaving the nest. Whether it be golfing, travelling or simply engaging in a bit of “repowering”, as the TV presenter Fern Britton put it last week, surely all parents have a plan for when their offspring finally move out.Unfortunately, the current climate is keeping us at home much longer than expected and, instead of seeing the world, they’re building an extension on to their homes because the children are back and they’ve brought their girlfriends with them. (And maybe a pet or two, too.)It’s hard for us millennials, but spare a thought for our parents, too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b6713fe6699edd06eab8f3fd55f33c651599d89/0_267_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4a052b6eaa0ffe2514c3733b88c0db3","title":"tidy your room teenagers guide arguing with parents","story":"As a teen, it can feel like everything your parents say and do is meant to ruin your fun. But if they understood what was happening to your brain, things might be different...So, you’re a teenager, or soon will be. You probably have lots on your mind, and are feeling pretty stressed thanks to all the expectations and demands you have to deal with. Then there are the drastic and chaotic changes occurring in your body and brain.But at least you can rely on your parents to see things your way, to support your decisions, no matter what. Right? In fact, your teens are usually when you argue with your parents more than ever.You share the same lives, the same homes, often the same DNA – you might think your parents should agree with you on practically everything. So why is it so difficult? Much of it is, of course, down to biology, specifically the differences between your developing brain and your parents’ more rigid ones. But it’s not hopeless: there are things you can do to get along better. Here are a few of the arguments you might typically have with your parents – and how best to deal with them.Finding it a struggle to get out of bed in the morning? Do you also stay up late at night? Most teens do – but parents rarely approve of this, accusing you of laziness.The good news is that you’re not lazy. Far from it. Those biological changes you’re undergoing can play havoc with typical sleeping patterns, and while adults usually start feeling sleepy at around 10pm, studies suggest that for teens it’s more like 1am. So, for you, trying to go to bed at 9pm is like your parents going to bed at 6pm. Ludicrous.Also, you need more sleep because your brain is developing more and working harder. While eight hours’ sleep may be enough for adults, you might need nine, or more – so as well as getting to bed later, you need to sleep in later the next morning. It’s biology. Criticising a teen for sleeping too much is like having a go at someone running a marathon for breathing too hard.Sadly, school and work start when they start, so opportunities for sleeping in are restricted. But try explaining some of these biological facts to your parents, and emphasising that insufficient sleep can affect your school work by obstructing learning and memory, for instance. They may be more willing to let you have those weekend lie-ins.You can also help yourself. Regular exercise makes it easier to get to sleep. And after the early evening, try avoiding stimulating activities such as video games, social media and knocking back energy drinks – these can keep your brain awake even longer.Has there ever been something you think is vitally important, like being at a certain party, or owning a specific item of clothing, but when you explain this to your parents they just look confused? Or even laugh?Maybe they’ve said you’re being too dramatic. This can hurt and frustrate, but it’s not that your mum and dad are choosing not to feel the same as you. It’s more that they can’t. Their brains aren’t wired that way.Your teenage brain is constantly maturing, but not every part matures at the same rate. Those that produce emotional responses mature quickly, so they are operating at peak performance for much of your teens. But the more logical parts of your brain that keep your emotions under control? They aren’t fully ready until your mid-20s.The result is that teens have far more powerful emotional reactions, that require extra effort to keep under control. That’s why you are prone to emotional outbursts, and why you get so passionate about stuff that baffles your parents.But your brain learns how to deal with powerful emotions by experiencing them. Suppressing your emotions at such a key developmental time can lead to emotional dysfunction later in life.Think of emotions as like music: your parents are listening to tunes on the radio while driving the car, but you’re standing right next to the speakers at a concert. It’s a lot harder for you to ignore the racket, and your parents still criticise you for yelling to be heard.If something upsets you, try to put off responding until you feel calmer. But also, don’t feel you should constantly bottle up your emotions. Any chance you get to vent or scream or punch a pillow, take it. As long as nobody, including yourself, gets hurt.A lot of arguments revolve around who does what in the family home. It’s not uncommon to experience blazing rows over where to put wet towels, who washes the dishes or messy bedrooms.Ironically, arguments are often about something that both you and your parents insist is “no big deal”, and yet you’re both yelling about it. Why? One big factor is how your teenage brain is suddenly responding differently to familiar events.The parts of your brain that process rewards and pleasure have been updated and overhauled, so what used to make you happy – such as toys and colourful cartoons – no longer does. Simultaneously, the parts of your brain that crave independence and control, as well as novelty, are being ramped up, meaning you’re driven to do things your way, on your terms, and seek out new experiences.Meanwhile, your parents have just spent more than a decade providing and caring for a small child who depended on them entirely. That’s how they understand your relationship. But now, your changing brain is throwing all that out of the window and your parents will appear to have transformed from being a source of safety and comfort, to wardens and gatekeepers. This is why teens often stick close to their friends and peers, and spend less time with their parents.There can be tension and uncertainty as you all try to figure out how your relationship now works. But some research suggests that these arguments can be a good thing, helping everyone reach a newfound understanding much faster – so long as they’re not just about the negatives. Take every opportunity to show them how independent you are, and in a quiet moment you might even praise them for letting you have some space.Parents often complain that their teenagers are closed off and reluctant to talk to them about school. Can anyone blame you? School is a huge part of your life. You’re there all the time, absorbing knowledge constantly, to pass exams you’d rather not do on subjects you’re not bothered about, so you can pursue a career you were made to choose without really knowing what it all means.Then there are all the social pressures. Never is the human brain more sensitive to approval and respect than during your teenage years, so being at school and surrounded by hundreds of your friends (and enemies) is exhausting and stressful.Come the end of the day, you just want to forget about school. But, no, here come your parents with questions, nagging and reminders.Actually, one solution is to give in and just tell them something – anything – about your day. Opening up about issues can take the edge off them. But do it when you’re ready, on your terms, not the moment they demand – usually when you’ve just walked through the door.Finally, remember that underneath the bickering and friction, the unique bond you have with your parents is still there. One day, you might even be friends again.• Why Your Parents Are Driving You Up The Wall And What To Do About It by Dean Burnett (Penguin) is out 22 AugustIf you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ed69afe92f887eddff53d9ef886c6ee7c2e3b3f/0_266_4163_2497/master/4163.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31a1d2c3ecb1dffcf62a8989859c7cfa","title":"against all odds wallabies restore pride against all blacks","story":"Just six weeks out from the opening game of their Rugby World Cup campaign, the Wallabies restored pride to the gold jersey as they romped to a famous 47-26 victory against New Zealand in Perth and inflicted the highest points tally the All Blacks have conceded in a test match.The visitors played the second half with 14 men after Scott Barrett was dismissed for a shoulder charge to the head of Michael Cooper, with the Wallabies making the extra player count after the interval.The hosts impressed throughout the 80 minutes though to ensure that the Bledisloe Cup goes down to a decider in Auckland next weekend.The six-try showing was a clear vindication of Michael Cheika’s experimental team selection. The biggest joker in Cheika’s deck was James O’Connor, whose vision and ball playing ability saw him expertly combine with Reece Hodge to set up the winger for two tries. The 29-year-old never looked out of place in his first test start at 13, showing Australia what the Wallabies’ back-line could look like with a natural ball player in wide channels.While there were mitigating circumstances with Barrett’s red card, the Wallabies’ gameplan of keeping ball in hand rather than kicking for territory proved key. The half-back combination of Nic White and Christian Lealiifano started together for the first time and combined admirably. White was pivotal in the Wallabies’ performance, orchestrating the forwards while looking equally dangerous with regular breaks from the base of the ruck.Even with 14 men, the All Blacks did not give up hope, making the most of the their limited time in possession. Both their first-half tries came shortly after turning over the Wallabies, while the playmaking duo of Richie Mo’unga and Beauden Barrett linked up nicely after the break for a try.In the build-up, much was made of the All Blacks’ potentially lethal back row selection of Ardie Savea, Sam Cane and Kieran Read. However, the hosts were able to nullify their threat for the most part, with the Wallabies forwards deserving credit for limiting the opposition back row’s opportunities to attack the ball at the breakdown.The opening 20 minutes was fitting of the atmosphere inside the sell-out Optus Stadium in Perth, which ferociously embraced the national anthems of both sides following a minute’s silence for Sir Brian Lochore.The Wallabies kept ball in hand in the opening exchanges with Marika Koroibete and Lealiifano both offering promise after breaking through the All Blacks defensive line.Western Australia has been home to some of the lowest moments of O’Connor’s Wallabies career. It is now home to some of the finest after he set up Hodge for the first of two tries after running a lovely line on the right flank.The All Blacks’ response was instant as Anton Lienert-Brown touched down after Jack Goodhue’s kick caused calamity in the Wallabies’ in-goal area. Rieko Ioane added a second try just four minutes later as the visitors took the lead for the only time in the game.Scott Barrett’s red card in the 40th minute was undoubtedly a turning point – Jérôme Garcès left with little choice to dismiss New Zealand’s number 4 following World Rugby’s stricter laws on head contact in play.The Wallabies came firing out of the blocks after the break, crossing twice in the first 10 minutes of the second half as Lukhan Salakaia-Loto scored his first Test try before White ed over in the corner to cap a fine scrum-half display.Beauden Barret pulled a try back for the All Blacks following that link-up with Mo’unga, before Koroibete and then Hodge, again after good work from O’Connor, put the game beyond doubt.Mo’unga crossed straight from the restart, only for Kurtley Beale to get his name on the scoresheet to round off a resounding Wallabies’ victory and provide hope for Australia fans – and prove the All Blacks are indeed beatable."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/398cec0772417e6abca55ceefe53311742aa95c1/0_88_1974_1184/master/1974.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42953ccf77751a75dc17df60f5c06e23","title":"hayley turner ascot shergar cup top jockey horse racing tips","story":"Some jockeys are just made for a particular raceday. Lester Piggott had a pretty good thing going with Derby day but close behind that pairing on any list must come the blissful union of Hayley Turner and the Shergar Cup.The mounts for this unusual day’s racing are distributed according to a formula that should ensure a level playing field for the dozen jockeys taking part, some of whom came from Australia and Japan this time. But once again Turner dominated, winning two of the six races and carrying off the Silver Saddle for top jockey, becoming the first to do so in consecutive years.Her enthusiasm for the Shergar Cup is no secret and she went so far in the buildup as to refer to the day as being “like Christmas for me”, but even her most loyal fans would have had to concede she arrived here in poor form. Her most recent winner was back in mid-July and she was on a losing run of 43.“I was hoping we weren’t going to mention that,” she said, when asked about her appearance on the Racing Post’s dreaded cold list. But something about this card brings out the best in her and the 36-year-old delivered accomplished rides to land the Stayers on Eddystone Rock and the Classic on Sapa Inca, a 36-1 double.One of the more excitable members of the press corps was moved to suggest that Turner is 10lb better here than elsewhere, bearing in mind her 33-1 success on Thanks Be in the Sandringham during Royal Ascot. She paused, seeming to consider whether this was an oblique criticism of her record at Britain’s other 59 tracks.“I don’t think so,” she finally replied. “I think I just get on some good horses here. But I am available for Royal Ascot next year, if anyone else thinks I’m 10lb better. I should probably go with that.“I’m really chuffed. It’s a massive thrill this event means so much to me.” Her family had not been present to watch her on Thanks Be in June but she made sure they were all here this time and they delivered a raucous welcome each time she returned to the winner’s enclosure. The post-racing concert, due to be headlined by Jessie J, was cancelled because of strong winds but Turner’s parting shot was: “We’ll probably do some singing in a bit.”Turner’s team-mates, Jamie Kah and Nanako Fujita, were not so lucky with the mounts they drew, though Kah was beaten just a nose in the opener.The team competition was dominated by Rest Of The World and there were wins for both Mark Zahra, from Australia, and Hong Kong’s Vincent Ho, who was tactically impressive in a couple of races.One of Turner’s winners was for the trainer Mark Johnston, who said he broadly enjoyed the event but wishes Ascot would not insist on dressing the jockeys in team colours, rather than the owners’ silks that are worn on every other day of the year. “That may seem like a trivial thing but I hate it,” said Johnston, who was finding his runners hard to identify in mid-race.“Obviously I could see she had won but I couldn’t see where my other two were. It’s undoubtedly the same for owners.“They can have breeches, bridles, hats but not colours. The colours belong to the owners. They’re not supposed to be camouflage. They are supposed to help us identify the horse.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15b660c6872c3aff2163d03ab516bc81066e2f12/128_375_4924_2954/master/4924.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83ec51dd428d408d7802c8094d7a8d11","title":"neil jenkins wales england rugby world cup","story":"Wales used to approach World Cups with hype rather than expectation. No major union has failed to qualify for the knockout stages more often but, as Warren Gatland takes his players on a final march 12 years after taking charge following a ruinous tournament in France, making the quarter-finals will not prompt an explosion of champagne corks.Only winning the final will satisfy Gatland, whose final Six Nations campaign this year yielded a grand slam. Wales are on a record run of 14 consecutive Test victories and have climbed to second in the world rankings behind New Zealand victory on Sunday against England at Twickenham would take them top, after the All Blacks lost 47-26 to Australia on Saturday.“Before Warren’s arrival we were very inconsistent,” says Neil Jenkins, who is preparing for his sixth World Cup and fourth as a coach. “We would win a championship one year and lose every game the next. Now we demand more of ourselves and expect to win every game whoever we play. I love that about this setup. Gats has been unbelievable a good man whose message is to work harder than the opposition. He knows something about every aspect of the game and keeps you on your toes. He wants to be the best and we follow him.“I am not going to be disrespectful to the other teams in our World Cup group or the tournament itself by saying what would mark a successful campaign. I have been involved enough to know that you look no further ahead than your first game, which for us is against Georgia. We have four matches before then and I am reluctant to call them warm-ups because playing both England and Ireland home and away will mean full-on encounters, not friendlies. We have to ensure we hit the ground running in Japan. You can train as much as you want but, if you are not playing, you don’t have a clue.”Wales have under Gatland enjoyed their most successful period since the 1970s, winning three grand slams and four Six Nations titles as well as reaching the semi-final of the 2011 World Cup when they lost to France after playing the last hour with 14 men. Yet they are not ranked among the leading contenders by bookmakers for the World Cup, with New Zealand, England, South Africa and Ireland all having shorter odds.“We could have won another two Six Nations, made the 2011 World Cup final and got to the semi-finals four years ago,” says Jenkins, Wales’s record points scorer who is the only one of the management team who will be part of the setup under Gatland’s successor, Wayne Pivac, next year. “We always demand more of ourselves.”The role of a kicking coach, which was marginal when Jenkins started in the middle of the previous decade, is now central. “There is not much space at Test match level and you manipulate it by kicking,” he says. “When I was a player, we would have dozens of back moves but the decline in the number of set pieces has reduced them to the point where it is mostly about variations on the move.“You have to understand defences and where the space is. That makes communication vital and players today have a fantastic feel for the game: they have to be able to react and make decisions on the hoof. Rugby union was designed for all shapes and sizes but at the top level today it is all about being lean and fit: props no longer carry much fat. The sport moves on. A couple of years ago it was a power game, all about being big and physical and dominant in the set pieces, but now it is mobile. Other than at set pieces there are no numbers on backs.”No European team made the last four of the 2015 World Cup but Wales and Ireland are in the top three of the world rankings while England are fifth, a fraction behind South Africa. The All Blacks have held first place since 2009 but their hold on the top position is looking its least secure in that time. If Wales are to make an impact in Japan, they will need to improve on their tournament record against the major southern hemisphere sides, which is currently one victory (against Australia in the 1987 third-place play-off) and 10 defeats.“Preparations for a World Cup are at a different level every tournament and every side will be ready to rock,” says Jenkins. “That is why the next month is important, starting with England. They have world-class players throughout their squad and strength in depth. They will be there or thereabouts in the World Cup. It is a big match for us.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e293fa61035c9bf54d13da89dd81402c62b405ef/0_61_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2378cb361012e7a2245786aabf9515a","title":"anthony joshua ruiz boxing rematch saudi arabia controversy","story":"It is nearly 45 years since the Rumble in the Jungle – and still the myth of that wild night lingers, dangerously ignored.There is much to learn from deconstructing the most famous sporting event of the 20th century. When a fierce storm swept through Kinshasa shortly after Muhammad Ali had landed his perfect finisher on George Foreman in the eighth round, coming off the ropes to level the most feared champion since Sonny Liston, it was not enough to cleanse Zaire of the stench of collusion and bad dealings.A morally anaesthetised audience of 60,000 people had earlier gathered that 30 October 1974, in the Stade Tata Raphaël – once a place where dissidents were executed – as well as millions watching and listening elsewhere, all witnesses to the Great Deception.Chief among the myths the world was asked to believe was that this was a dignified return by Ali and Foreman to their African roots, when the ogre was slain by the voodoo skills of a 32-year‑old opponent cloaked in magic. It was sold as a celebration, a wholesome metaphor for change in the wake of the moral vacuum created by the Vietnam war. It was only superficially so. And even the clichés stank.There were African bands and their descendant heirs from America, jazzing it up for a film that would gather dust until 1996 smart writers from magazines expressed their views on the art and blood of fisticuffs. Hunter S Thompson got stoned back at the hotel and missed it all. It was of its time, an exercise in freewheeling cynicism. As the late Hugh McIlvanney wrote in these pages, it was a night when “ethnic pride and financial avarice became ardent bedmates”.It was undeniably a great fight – probably the Greatest’s greatest. And there was no shortage of mystical brilliance. As Ali told McIlvanney: “I even cancelled the rain. It stayed dry for the fight, then an hour after it there was a storm that nearly flooded the place.” But it was overridingly a business deal hiding under the halo of good intentions and mired in the muck of dictatorship. Don King told each fighter the other had agreed to a purse of $5m. And they had. How could they say no? There are ways ...When and if Anthony Joshua and Andy Ruiz Jr sign contracts for a heavyweight rematch that looks almost certain to take them to Saudi Arabia on 7 December, maybe they should recall the much bigger occasion that was the perfect template for looking the other way.For Mobutu Sese Seke, the despot who ruled Zaire, read Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, still in the dock of global condemnation for the assassination of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, as well as the daily atrocities being committed in Yemen. The Saudi regime have for at least two years used sport to draw a curtain of legitimacy over their doings. They even tried unsuccessfully to co-opt the spotless tennis stars Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal.As Amnesty International UK’s head of campaigns, Felix Jakens, said on Friday: “If Anthony Joshua fights Andy Ruiz Jr in Saudi Arabia, it’s likely to be yet another opportunity for the Saudi authorities to try to ‘sportswash’ their severely tarnished image.”If Joshua, a decent man, doubts that judgment, he should look to the Rumble in the Jungle. There is still time for him and Ruiz to change their minds, but not a lot of it.The rope-a-dope strategy attributed to Ali’s unlikely victory spoke to a more significant trick, that dealt to the world by King and by Mobutu, who bankrolled the circus with his poor country’s money. They convinced everyone that a mere boxing match mattered more than the subjugation of a nation and its people.And the blame needs spreading. John Daly, the Londoner who found the money for King and Mobutu through Barclays bank in Switzerland, offered Ali $10m to fight Joe Frazier for a third time, in Beirut. They went to Manila instead, for the Thrilla. And it nearly killed both of them.Matchroom will announce details of the Clash on the Dunes at a press conference in London on Monday, Eddie Hearn sitting alongside Omar Khalil, representing Skill Challenge Entertainment, the kingdom’s official “event partner”. Ruiz, who wants the fight in the United States, will not be there.There is only one bottom line in boxing and it resides underneath the words composed by lawyers and promoters and television moguls. There the antagonists write their names and take their money. Some say they should not be accountable for the residual filth that surrounds their participation. Maybe. But at least they should hold their noses to the prevailing wind.• Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

Really tired. It had been a while since I’d taken a break for more than a long weekend. I wanted to see a big sky. And horses. I hadn’t been on a horse since I was a kid and had no idea what I would do with one when I found it, but that was the plan. That was it. Big sky. Horse. I settled on Colorado. You can swing between beautiful towns like Lyon, Loveland and Boulder, and smaller places with family-owned ranches along the way. For a girl from Walton Vale in Liverpool, names like Eagle Rock and Crested Butte leapt off the page and reignited a childhood fascination with the culture and history of the West.I hadn’t given it much thought before I got there, but to my relief, I discovered I still loved to ride. Being around the animals was restorative. I kicked around, travelling from place to place, and picked up trail rides along the foothills of the Rockies, often by word of mouth. You can get around by shuttle bus or the Lyft car-sharing scheme if driving isn’t for you. The landscape was breathtaking. Riding on trails through mountain ranges was easier than I’d thought, bar a sore backside and a few mosquito bites. I stayed at the Sylvan Dale ranch (a family-owned business that has offered room, board and a cowgirl school for generations) and cabin-style places (Estes Lake Lodge was a cracker). I hiked the foothills, visited hot springs, camped out and hung out. There was everything and nothing to do. I spent almost as much time reading in coffee shops (Boulder’s Pearl Street was boutique everything heaven) as I did in the saddle. I found my dream hat in a gas station on Route 36. I indulged my love of crystals at roadside gem and jewellery stores. It’s important to check where traditional pieces are from, but it’s fairly obvious which stores are authentic and have relationships with indigenous artists.I came away from the trip rested and invigorated in equal measure. Even though I didn’t venture completely off road, I wandered far enough to have a fair few Cheryl Strayed moments that will stay with me forever. It’s a place I hope to return to again and again. My own little piece of big sky.• Leanne Best appears in Carnival Row, on Amazon Prime Video from 30 AugustSpaced out in CopenhagenI went on holiday with my mates in our early 20s. We thought we were going somewhere hot. I’m not sure who was to blame, but we arrived for our flight and discovered somebody had booked us a trip to Copenhagen. Four of the guys only had shorts, one had flip-flops, and none of us had a guidebook. When we arrived it was bitterly cold, so we went to an army surplus store and bought some long, heavy, 1970s grey coats for about a fiver. We looked like escaped prisoners of war.The only thing we could really do in that situation – being youthful and fairly inexperienced at life and travel – was to get very drunk. One bar, Woodstock, which I’ve since been to as a more sober older person, was like something from Star Wars in an off-world colony – particularly after a couple of hash cakes. It was in Christiania, the anarchic, free-love area.One of the guys decided to ring his ex-girlfriend, who was working on the Öresund bridge and tunnel project, connecting Denmark with Sweden. She took this group of drunk British men down to the tunnel, a building site at the time. We were in hard hats and tripping. There were lights coming at us – and me and a mate got it into our heads that there were aliens attacking, so we ran out of an emergency exit and security was called. They had to stop construction, but decided not to press charges. That’s what I think holidays should be about – not a vanilla-beige experience but a memorable one. Bonding over weirdness and adversity is a wonderful thing to do.Obviously I want people to have deeper experiences and have their eyes opened. But I also think it’s OK to have a weird experience – and a hash cake – with your mates.• Step By Step by Simon Reeve is published in paperback this week, available for £8.79 from bookshopSeduced by BrazilAfter I first saw pictures of Trancoso, near Porto Seguro in the state of Bahia, Brazil, I fantasised about it for over a decade. I finally visited two years ago. From São Paulo, you have to take a internal flight, then a two-hour drive along a dirt road. All around the Quadrado, the main square with its church, there’s a real sense of community. There’s football, weddings, funerals, rituals … there’s even a horse that wanders in and out of bars. All you need do is sit in the cafes looking out and you’ll see life.Suddenly a coffin will go by in the back of a Chevrolet, and everyone’s singing. At night, all the trees sparkle with little lights and people open up the front of their homes as bars, sitting there with their chickens. As you go by, someone will grab you and do the samba. In the next bar there’s capoeira (the Afro-Brazilian martial art that’s like ballet).It’s not a place that’s locked in tradition, it’s playing with tradition. There’s one ritual where everyone dresses in white and they take a long pole and shove it through the window of the person they feel is the most fertile.I travel a lot, but Trancoso is a Dalí painting. Every house around the Quadrado is a different, blindingly bright colour: turquoise, fuchsia, lime. Inside, there are carved native masks with tribal feathers and religious icons lit up with fairy lights, all mixed with modern elements.The back of the Quadrado drops off to the ocean, and it’s surrounded by the sexiest jungle I’ve ever seen, with lots of exotic birds. People live in the jungle and there are indigenous tribes who’ll invite you to their villages. It’s a neighbourhood, and it’s inclusive. My favourite hotel in the world is here – Uxua, where everything is made out of natural materials – even the sinks are in hollowed-out tree trunks. There are a lot of backpacker places, too.I became friends with someone who was about 20, an artist. We didn’t speak the same language but would dance together at night – and we wept when we had to say goodbye.• Ruby Wax: How to be Human is at the Pleasance Grand, Edinburgh, from 18-24 August, then touring the UK until 30 NovemberLaughter in the AlpsEvery year for the past decade we’ve been skiing in Mayrhofen in Austria. It has a nice mix of easy slopes, a few challenging fast runs and some excellent off-piste. The Tirol has flat valley bottoms with spectacular cliff faces on either side. You can ski or snowboard for miles, ending up at the top of the valley in very remote and beautiful spots. On several occasions I’ve got lost and had to find a ride back to town.One year, Rachel (now my fiancee) and I went walking and found a tiny church perched on a rock. It had some of the grisliest depictions of Christ’s end that I’ve ever seen – weird and interesting.Strictly speaking, because we go for the Altitude Comedy Festival, it’s a “work trip”, but it feels like a holiday to me. It’s a bunch of comedians up a mountain making people howl with laughter. The après-ski gigs start around 5pm and go on until late. It’s a pretty resort and it turns out that the straightforward, plain-speaking, efficient Austrians are also daft, funny and generous.They also like meat. Pork mostly but meat in general. It’s all a bit fleshy if you’re a vegetarian. Particularly the spa, I suppose. They insist that you spa naked – so if you want to see comedians having the time of their lives on stage and on skis, but also wonder what they look like naked, this is the place.• Marcus is writerdirector of The Red, at the Edinburgh Festival until 26 AugustOn the juice in PortugalAt the beginning of last year, when it was clear I had already spent the advance for my book, The Guilty Feminist, before I’d finished writing it, each new (over-optimistic) deadline haunted every moment of my fretful sleep. So I went on “holiday” to a juice-only retreat up a mountain near Rio Cimeiro in Portugal. A friend overcome by a similar anxiety-inducing writing challenge swore that, taken exclusively, juice is “cocaine for healthy people”. Here are some excerpts from my diary …Day one: A perky woman called Tamara gives us juice and says: “Your friends all think you’re mad coming on this, don’t they?” “No,” we reply, mystified. “Well, they’re probably saying it behind your back. But you’re not mad. Don’t listen to them. They think it’s a cult. It’s not a cult. Repeat after me: Your friends think you’re mad but you’re not in a cult.”Day two: I am overcome with a crippling headache. Not only can I not write my book, I cannot hold my head up or look directly at light. Tamara claims it’s caffeine withdrawals. I believe it to be “everything withdrawals”. She recommends napping in a “womb basket” or a caffeinated colonic irrigation. I cling to the womb basket with both hands.Day three: I am dying. Tamara tells me I can have one official juice-based power bar. I have three. I see now there can be no book-writing without food. There is no food. There is no way off the mountain.Day four: I wake up at 3am like a meerkat on amphetamines. I write for four days straight, like Jack Nicholson in The Shining except all the words are different and in a very pleasing order. I need to run each day to burn off the excess energy. I now believe myself to be only two-thirds human and one-third Black Mirror app.Day seven: The mountain is spectacular. The air is bracing. The book is finished. Tamara schools us in hosting a party for our friends back home. The theme of the party is: “Juice is Good and This is Not a Cult”. I’m converted. Juice is good. This is definitely not a cult. I am tempted to throw such a party.Day eight: I’m home. I remember bread.• Deborah Frances-White hosts The Secret Policeman’s Tour at Edinburgh Playhouse on 24 August. The Guilty Feminist is available for £7.91 from bookshopThree go mad in LisbonThe first holiday I went on after a pretty major depressive episode in my twenties was to Lisbon. Me and Hannah, one of my best friends, went to stay with another best friend, Morwenna, who was teaching abroad for a year. I’d barely left the house in two years, but as a determined person I forced myself to go.In the five days of laughter, faffing and catching up on who’d done what, and with whom, we visited a castle, Castela de São Jorge, one of the highest points of the city, each ate at least 100 pasteis de nata (Portugal’s famous custard tarts), and stayed up dancing in a nightclub, Esquina da Bica, that to the untrained eye looked like someone’s house. Sitting in a sunny square writing postcards to everyone back home, I was reminded of who I was when I wasn’t trapped in my bedroom in Lewisham.None of my predictions of panic attacks or Candice-imposed drama came true. The only mini-drama came when we hired bikes and took the ferry over to Costa da Caparica, a quiet, pretty stretch of coast that seemed like it had been almost abandoned to nature. We were chased by a pack of feral dogs and I fell off my bike. I didn’t mind, though. We just laughed, as we’d done all holiday. I was out of the house, I was with my best friends, and I remembered what it felt like to be happy.• Candice Carty-Williams’s novel, Queenie, is available from bookshop for £9.99 inc UK p\u0026amppIceland is one of my favourite places, because it is so different from anywhere else. It feels like being on another planet. A planet with a volcanic landscape, black sand beaches and steaming geysers. It also feels distinctly different in terms of its culture and food.Despite freezing temperatures, people here love ice-cream – we even discovered a shop in the town of Akureyri that was open until midnight. People also love swimming in the cold sea. We didn’t try this, but we did swim in the Silfra fissure – between the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates in Lake Þingvallavatn.We wore dry suits – the water is around 2C! But once I was in I got distracted by the incredible views and didn’t notice the cold. I floated in the dry suit, and the current gently moved me right through the rift. The water was crystal clear, so I could see everything – both sides of the tectonic plates, beautiful rock formations and plant life. I never thought that being in a dry suit in freezing water would be peaceful, but it was exactly that. It was so quiet and the blueish green hue of everything was very calming.Many people in Iceland have outdoor hot tubs too, which are cheaper to heat thanks to geothermal energy. This has also led to Iceland creating its own unique bread called hverabrauð (volcanic bread). It’s non-yeasted, but unlike most British tea loaves the dough is enclosed in a well sealed metal pot, buried underground and baked for over 24 hours using the natural heat from the ground.We visited an underground bakery in the Lake Myvatn area. Being a baker, this was one of my highlights of the trip. We didn’t get a chance to make any, but we did visit several cafes to try some. I loved the taste – full of dark rye, wholemeal flours, plus golden syrup to offset the bitter grains. It’s very rich and flavoursome.

And while the weather may be as unpredictable as Donald Trump’s tweets, the warmth of the people and breathtaking west coast scenery await you around every bend.I left my beloved Glasgow in 1992 for what was meant to be three months in London. Three months became three decades: children were born, London lives were led and Glasgow felt each and every one of those 500 miles away. Yet still, I knew I would return. I had a plan: one day I would find a wee ramshackle place up on the west coast, grow vegetables and raise pigs. So, when I think about holidays, for me it is so much more than a fortnight of fun it’s my future.My perfect break means a drive up the west coast of Scotland, past Loch Lomond and beyond Glencoe, heading for the incredible Isle of Skye.The island takes it name from ancient Norse, meaning “isle of cloud” for its mist-crowned mountains and hills. Overhead, a big, bold, beautiful sky. Ahead, ever-changing, dramatic vistas. One minute silken moors, then jagged mountains, followed by sheer sea cliffs.If you have yet to visit, my best advice is to practise not being able to breathe. The scenery and the wild nature of Skye will take your breath away – repeatedly.  • Hardeep Singh Kohli’s Edinburgh show, It’s Hard to Be Deep, is on at the Assembly, until 24 AugustTees and tipples, ScotlandWhen I drive north and see the sign “Welcome to Scotland”, my shoulders relax, I breathe a little deeper and I can’t help but smile. The first time I visited was for work experience as part of my postgraduate course in newspaper journalism. I went to Edinburgh, celebrated Hogmanay and marvelled at just how cold it was compared with London. Still, I loved the energy and vibe of the place, and the big sky. For the past six or seven years I have taken a break there annually, to play golf and, more importantly, to feel more free.In fact, by the end of the summer I’ll have been four times this year alone. The most recent was a dream golfing holiday with my husband. We started with friends in the Borders, near the village of Cardrona, then hopped over to the Isle of Islay to play at Machrie. Within minutes of sitting outside in the sunshine – yes we always get good weather when we go to Scotland! – I felt so relaxed. To be honest, we did have one day of inclement weather, but it was so beautiful on the beach that we went for a two-hour walk in the warm rain and revelled in getting drenched as we soaked up the endless dramatic views.A whirlwind tour of amazing golf courses and cities followed. And the whisky flowed. I’ve previously always shied away from that particular tipple. Now though, with a little bit of help from my Scottish friends, I have been won round to the non-peaty types – and there are so many: with beautiful clear, clean water on tap, why wouldn’t there be? I’m always surprised when I meet people from England who have never been – it’s so close. Even when it’s cold, it’s one of the warmest places on Earth because the Scots are simply lovely. Belly laughs and great grub … don’t get me started on the seafood.On one knee in Sri LankaOur friend owns a house in Sri Lanka, and when I mentioned that I wanted to propose to my girlfriend, he offered it to us for a week last August. It was an amazing location in the south, inland from Unawatuna, which is near Galle. The house is about five miles from the beach, up a big hill and surrounded by trees.It felt as though it was in the middle of the jungle. Just as it was getting dark each day, the monkeys would come swinging through the trees and stop for a minute. They’d look at us, we’d look at them, and they’d be on their way. It was on the first day that I proposed to her, surrounded by candles and fairy lights under the pergola. The ring was burning a hole in my pocket. I was really nervous. So I had about six beers, got down on one knee ... and she said yes. After that we relaxed at the house a lot, and hung out with Frank, the most chilled-out dog ever.We went to the beach and visited a wood-carving workshop, where a man had been making statues of elephants for over 30 years. We also went to the local markets in Galle. They were colourful and super-vibrant, and had pretty much everything you could imagine food-wise. We ate curry for a week. It was full of fresh flavours, like pineapples and sweet potatoes ... the best curry I’ve ever eaten.• Tom’s Walker’s latest album is What a Time to Be Alive. His current world tour includes UK dates in OctoberNovemberA family feast in PlymouthWhen I was a young girl, every summer we would take a trip to my Auntie Helen’s in Plymouth. She was my grandad’s sister, a tiny Greek-Cypriot woman with a huge sprawling house and a generosity to match. She had a secret walled garden filled with fruit trees, a well and two geese, Charlie and Geraldine, who would chase me around the garden. I’m not sure who made more noise, me or the geese, but Helen would appear at the back door, waving a tea towel at us to signal that we were interrupting her peace.Dinner was always a communal, enormous affair. A dozen assorted cousins and relatives would sit around a table heaving with koupepia (stuffed vine leaves), roast chicken, salt-and-pepper potatoes, fat marrows cooked in plum tomatoes and olive oil, and sticky juicy plums from the garden. I would sit in her galley-kitchen, built into the conservatory with a glass roof and a vine growing up the inside, as her aged fingers deftly peeled potatoes and rolled koupepia. I’d watch as she sat in her large wicker chair crocheting the heavy blankets that would keep us snug at night.Auntie Helen passed away several years ago now, and a photograph of her with her precious geese sits in my kitchen. When I grow up, I’d like my family, no matter how loosely attached, to have the same memories of hospitality, endless dinners and a perpetually open door. If I could relive one holiday for the rest of my life, it would be those carefree summers of my childhood, roast potato sandwiches with lukewarm avgolemono soup, and a cup of tea snuck upstairs to bed by an elderly Greek goddess, with a heart as deep and beautiful as the Mediterranean Sea.• Tin Can Cook: 75 Simple Store-cupboard Recipes by Jack Monroe is out now, and available for £6.15 at bookshopLooking for a holiday with a difference?

I have to say I couldn’t be happier. In fact it’s been the best day in ages. Isn’t it funny how it goes that way sometimes? Thanks very much to everyone who has been so kind,” Laverne wrote.Radio critics such as the Sunday Times veteran reviewer Gillian Reynolds and the ’s Charlotte Runcie had already expressed doubts about the future of the music-based interview format with Laverne at the helm. Then the Spectator magazine weighed in. In a piece published online yesterday columnist Melanie McDonagh suggested Laverne had no enthusiasm for classical music. “There’s no getting away from it,” wrote McDonagh, “Lauren is lightweight and uncerebral. Her capacity to come up with the forgettable phrase is quite something.”But McDonagh’s words have now prompted an avalanche of social media support for the Sunderland-born Laverne, a former columnist on this newspaper. Other vocal defenders include David Lammy, Sara Cox, Mark Kermode and former DID interviewees singer Tracey Thorn and composer Nitin Sawhney.“I am very much in your corner,” said Thorn, while Sawhney told Laverne: “A great interviewer has compassion, empathy, interest in their subject, sharp wit and an ability to extract the heart and soul of a personal journey. All traits of yours.”The nub of McDonagh’s contentious argument is that Laverne’s appointment was a vain effort to attract younger listeners. She also claimed the speech radio station’s new controller, Mohit Bakaya, is looking for another presenter. And another female Radio 4 presenter with a regional accent is also in McDonagh’s sights. Kathy Clugston’s new role chairing Gardeners’ Question Time was described as “the worst appointment Radio 4 has made in its apparent effort to alienate its listeners”.Young has also spoken in the past of her harsh reception in 2006: “I knew it was coming, but it’s not very nice when you get hit in the face with a concrete slab and that’s what it felt like,’ she once told John Bishop.The programme that asks its guests to imagine they are castaways on a remote island, with only eight tracks to listen to, was the creation of Roy Plomley and was first recorded in a bomb-damaged Maida Vale studio on January 27, 1942. Sir Michael Parkinson took over the role before Lawley became the first female host.The Observer’s radio critic Miranda Sawyer has welcomed the arrival of Laverne, who is also a 6 Music host, and who is paid more than £300,000 by the corporation. “Since she began sitting in for Kirsty Young, Laverne has been good, but she’s really hit her stride in the past few episodes. Last week’s interview with Bob Mortimer was a delight: good questions, easy atmosphere, excellent interviewee. And great listening from Laverne,” wrote Sawyer this February."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52193a44042cae4c226c28a0dc8aa34238f869a6/0_372_4904_2942/master/4904.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e18aea7fc37444821eb0eb91707e079","title":"jamie demetriou interview fleabag stath lets flats","story":"Jamie Demetriou, 31, was born in Friern Barnet, north London, and joined the Chickenshed theatre group aged five. He studied at Bristol University and took an acclaimed student revue show to the Edinburgh fringe. His acting credits include Fleabag, This Time With Alan Partridge, Sally4Ever and Paddington 2. He is currently appearing in Horrible Histories: The Movie and Hulu’s TV version of Four Weddings and a Funeral. The second series of his Bafta-nominated sitcom Stath Lets Flats, about an incompetent Greek-Cypriot estate agent, airs on Channel 4 next week.Why did you set your sitcom in a lettings agency?God knows! I ask myself this question every day. I had no stake in that world. They say “write what you know” but I wrote about the thing I know least about. I needed to find a home for this character, an asexual idiot with a Greek-London accent. One early version was called “Flats \u0026amp Chips”, about a lettings agency and a chip shop side-by-side and the rivalry between them. That would have had legs for about, ooh, half an episode.How do you feel about lettings agents: loathe them or secretly fond?Not secretly fond, openly fond, just because I’ve spent so much time thinking about them. When my friends go for flat viewings, I’ll tag along as research. I’m always curious how the agent will react, but they’re usually quite into it. It doesn’t stop them acting like fucking dickheads, though. I went on one with a mate and the flat was freezing. My mate was like: “It’s pretty cold in here. Isn’t it insulated? The windows feel thin and draughty.” The estate agent went: “It feels cold, like the windows are thin, yeah? But trust me, it’s not and they’re not.” Oh, that’s OK then. Nobody ever says “trust me” if they have done their research, right?Have you had terrible flat viewings yourself?We all have, haven’t we? One guy who showed us a flat in Brixton was really sweating and panicking. Eventually he blurted out: “Look, are you going to take it?” When we said no, he just turned and legged it out of the flat. Then we watched him through the window, furiously thumping the bonnet of his car. He’d spotted that he’d been given a parking ticket but was so desperate for the sale, he obviously thought “If I get this commission, that fine will pay for itself”.Your sister Natasia plays Stath’s sister Sophie in the show. How does that compare with your real relationship?Sophie and Stath are us in a parallel universe. If we hadn’t been given the confidence to get up and perform, we’d have ended up crying on a sofa together, watching TV and eating crisps. Tash is very confident, outspoken and hilarious, but Sophie shows her sweet, vulnerable side that few people get to see. She’s exquisite in it and counter-balances Stath’s multi-coloured buffoonery.The unrequited romance between Sophie and Stath’s colleague Al is lovely. Was it influenced by Tim and Dawn from The Office?For my generation, it’s impossible to not be influenced by The Office. It was inspirational to see someone write and star in a comedy that felt true to his sensibilities. That’s what I always wanted to do. If you put an unrequited hetero romance in any comedy nowadays, it’s difficult to avoid comparisons to Tim and Dawn because theirs is the greatest love story in British comedy.What’s the feedback been from London’s Greek-Cypriot community?Mixed. The younger generation are way more into it. My dad tells me about rows he has at his cafe, where older people complain about it making Greek people look silly. Would they really rather I played a dull Greek straight man in the background? I see it as a celebration of the culture. Everyone’s stupid in the show, it just so happens that I’m Greek and I’m mocking myself.And the letting agent community?Not happy either. I read a few forums and one said: “Oh typical, a sitcom about crap letting agents, not the classic diligent, hard-working letting agent we all know and love.” Er, what show is that and how can I not watch it? “Rent a flat again, did you?” “Yeah I did, smashed it.” Roll credits.Tell us about the new series…Stath’s dad has appointed a manager who isn’t Stath, so he’s struggling to come to terms with that lack of nepotism. The new boss brings an understanding of where the London property market is headed, so Stath has to get his tiny brain around gentrification and meeting millennials. He struggles with the fact that exposed brick is good and plastic garden chairs are bad. We also see more of his desperate desire to be a family man. I’ve always been fascinated by those deeply broody wideboys. They have the whole naughty boy lifestyle but, my God, their son’s going to be an angel.Are you broody yourself?I am, actually. It’s in my blood. Virtually my first words were “Can I have a baby?” I’ve wanted a kid since I was a kid. I grew up in London, so my nurture was very western, but my dad’s Cypriot and there are three areas where my Mediterranean heritage comes to the fore: my broodiness, my taste palate and my love of deep Euro r’n’b cuts. The latter is why I’ve considered asking Peter Andre to appear on the show. I’ve resisted so far but it’s a matter of time.Do you enjoy wearing Stath’s costume of cheap suit, pointy shoes and diamond ear stud?I love the crap shoes and mundane suits but the magnetic earring takes its toll. I was hoping to get my ear pierced to make it easier but the Baftas were the day before we started shooting and I just got it into my head: “What if I have a reaction and have a freakishly swollen ear at the Baftas?” It might be the only time I get to go and don’t want my memory to be of a deformed ear. So I went back to the magnetic one, which crunches the flesh. My left earlobe is now longer than my right.You played “Bus Rodent” in the first series of Fleabag. Do people still come up and ask about your goofy teeth?Weirdly, there’s been a resurgence since series two came out – people demanding I open my mouth to see if they’re real. Phoebe Waller-Bridge has an insane grasp of the human condition. She had to stick to her guns to get it made, but wasn’t precious about it. She was collaborative open to people mucking around rather than being tied to the script. There’s a scene where I say: “You don’t go through life with teeth like these and not know when someone’s pretending.” She came up with that just before the take, yet it’s the line that gets quoted at me most.Your dad’s a chef. Didn’t George Michael work in one of his restaurants?Yes, as a dishwasher. We saw George Michael on TV a few years ago and my dad went: “Ugh!” I said: “Not a fan?” He was like: “No, he was always bloody singing when he should have been washing dishes.”Are there any real-life characters you’d like to play?Darius from Popstars in a billion-dollar Hollywood biopic. This is purely out of fondness. I genuinely rewatch that series on a monthly basis. I know every word.Stath Lets Flats returns to Channel 4 at 10pm on 19 August"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfc7155541d5bdb050d5f15358ee85a7be19b5ef/0_65_5664_3398/master/5664.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7af2c9a8a724182b157c3e41dd0aee4c","title":"peaky blinders in the oswald mosley era","story":"Fascist leader Oswald Mosley has featured on TV and film before, but the portrayal of the charismatic demagogue of the 1920s and 30s can rarely have been so timely.Mosley, the Labour MP who would go on to found the British Union of Fascists, is the main antagonist in the forthcoming fifth series of the Bafta-award winning Peaky Blinders – and the show’s creator, Steven Knight, says despite the politician’s abhorrent views, the decision to feature him prominently was an easy one.“The show always leapfrogs forward two or three years with each series, and in 1929 the most eye-catching storyline, and the one that felt the most resonant to now, was the rise of fascism and the growth of populism and racism in politics across Europe,” he says.The dapper Mosley was celebrated when younger for his sharp style and “personal magnetism” Knight admits that the show had to walk a fine line when depicting his appeal.With the notorious 1936 Battle of Cable Street, in which Mosley’s fascists were sent packing from London’s East End, some years away, the show’s version of the politician is very much the man described by the Westminster Gazette as “the most polished literary speaker in the Commons”. A young and arrogant politician on the make, whose thuggery is hidden under a polished veneer, he is still convinced that he can bend the Labour party – which he joined after a spell first as a Conservative MP and then as an independent – to his will.Claflin, who made his name on Hollywood blockbusters such as Pirates of the Caribbean and The Hunger Games, describes the role as “the most grown-up thing I’ve ever done”, and prepared for it by watching clips of the fascist leader addressing the faithful.“You can see from watching the footage that’s out there of him that he was both incredibly charismatic and incredibly manipulative,” he says. “What was important was trying to get the essence of him without doing an impersonation, because I want the people who remember him to feel that there is real flavour of him there.”It was important, too, not to underestimate the appeal of Mosley’s populist message. “It’s easy to see how and why people fell for it without agreeing with anything he says,” adds Claflin.“It’s the same as the Trump situation. People wanted change. They felt that what was happening in politics wasn’t working, and they aren’t really listening to what’s being said. They’re just thinking, ‘oh, this all feels refreshing and new.’”Anthony Bryne, the series director, agrees, describing the populist politics of the time as an ideology that’s “spreading like a virus, and it seems as though there’s no cure for it”.The show also has fun drawing parallels with Tommy Shelby’s own attempts to present himself as a man of the people. “To begin with, Mosley and Shelby are very much the same side of the coin,” says Knight.Peaky Blinders returns on BBC One at 9pm on Sunday 25 AugustSir Oswald Mosley of Ancoats, sixth baronet (1896-1980), has been portrayed and pastiched on British television and in film in a string of dramas and satires.In 1998, the actor Jonathan Cake played the fascist leader in Channel 4’s Mosley, a drama based on books by Mosley’s son, Nicholas.One of the first to base a character upon him was the writer Aldous Huxley. Everard Webley in his 1928 novel Point Counter Point was inspired by Mosley’s Labour party days. PG Wodehouse’s unappealing Roderick Spode, a character seen in TV adaptations of the Jeeves books, was also based on him.HG Wells’s The Holy Terror features a leader, Lord Horatio Bohun, who owes much to Mosley, while the BBC revival of Upstairs Downstairs included scenes of Mosley during the Cable Street riots.Sir Geoffrey Wren in Kazuo Ishiguro’s The Remains of the Day is another close copy.But Mosley or Mosley-like figures have appeared most frequently in alternative histories that imagine a Nazi victory in Britain, such as the 1964 film It Happened Here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a0a7d7c443305d59f273cd34982b6774b918e7a/0_49_1838_1103/master/1838.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08bd9ab95b90bc492c1874d67266a3a9","title":"chagos children stuck years unsafe lodgings","story":"Families descended from islanders evicted from the Chagos Islands are being housed in council-allocated accommodation deemed by social services to be inappropriate for young children, the Observer has learned.The latest revelations prompted fresh calls for an independent investigation into the treatment of British Chagossians, forcibly removed by the UK in the 1960s and early 70s to allow the US military to establish a base on the largest island, Diego Garcia.Last month the Observer revealed British passport holders from the Chagos Islands were being systematically targeted by council officials to get them removed from the UK. Now it has emerged that British Chagossians in Crawley, West Sussex, are being accommodated in lodgings about which social services have expressed serious concerns.The child, who turns three next month, has lived in the hotel all his life despite the accommodation being classed as temporary. Other Chagossian families with young children also claim they have been stuck there for several years. They say white British tenants are prioritised and usually given social housing after a few weeks or months.Calls are mounting for an inquiry into the attitude of UK authorities towards the community with local Tory MP, Henry Smith, writing to Crawley borough council “expressing significant concerns at disturbing reports in the Observer”.Chai Patel, legal policy director at the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants said: “We need an independent investigation into how the government has been able to put these families in this appalling position, and what steps are needed to ensure it never happens again?“The government needs to act now to ensure that these families are able to continue their lives in the UK safely and securely. It’s the least that it can do.”The Chagossians were expelled from their homeland by Britain and exiled in Mauritius and the Seychelles, 2,000km away. In 2002 native Chagossians and their children were given the right to British passports and since then more than 3,000 have emigrated to the UK, most of them settling in Crawley.One of them, a mother, has begged Crawley borough council to find her more suitable accommodation and says that her family finds it difficult to live in a single room.“It’s not an easy life. Crawley council say they can’t help me. Even when I was pregnant, they didn’t want to help,” she said.Another British Chagossian and former resident claimed the hotel, which declined to comment, was “not safe … there are men living there with drink and drug problems.”While Crawley council denies reports of mistreatment, the council’s leader, Peter Lamb, has said they have investigated claims of discrimination from the Chagossian community but they were not acted on due to insufficient evidence.Crawley borough council said: “Unlike the housing act, which limits family stays in hotel accommodation to six weeks, there is no limit under the children’s act. This may explain why those families have been there for an extended period of time, and may also explain why others are being reported to have moved on more quickly. We take complaints very seriously and all are thoroughly investigated.“We are genuinely committed to getting to the bottom of these allegations and take appropriate steps if found to be true.”During a meeting set up last year to air grievances from the town’s Chagossian community the council spokesperson added: “We were informed that on occasion housing officers were unsympathetic to their situation, unfriendly and considered unhelpful. The council apologised if this was how officers were behaving, and a commitment was made to raise the matter with the housing department to ensure that such behaviours were addressed.”A West Sussex county council spokesman said: “In some circumstances we support families with children who have urgent housing needs. When this happens we make every effort to find a suitable placement. As temporary accommodation is not best suited to meet longer term needs, we work with a family to identify accommodation that meets the children’s needs as soon as we can.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f5b98f770c1f4a4ccc8cfd72ceca2da83e88482/0_335_5026_3015/master/5026.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=60e630ade1d3cbb03e9769e583cca7dd","title":"russian nuclear agency confirms role in rocket test explosion","story":"Rosatom says five staff died in accident that caused radiation levels to spike in ArkhangelskRussia’s nuclear energy agency has said an explosion that caused radiation levels to spike in the Arkhangelsk region was caused by an accident during a test of an “isotope power source for a liquid-fuelled rocket engine”.In a statement released late on Friday, Rosatom said five of its employees had died as a result of the accident and three more were being treated for burns.The statement was the first confirmation that the agency was involved in the incident, which briefly drove radiation levels up to 20 times their normal levels in the nearby city of Severodvinsk.Rosatom’s description of the incident could indicate it was testing the nuclear-powered cruise missile Burevestnik mentioned during a speech by Vladimir Putin last year.Russia’s ministry of defence first confirmed the explosion on Thursday, saying two people had been killed and six injured in a botched test of a liquid-fueled rocket engine. The injured included ministry employees and civilian contractors.Rosatom’s statement may indicate that three of those first reported as injured had since died. Despite reports that the wounded had been transported to Moscow for medical care, neither their names nor locations had been confirmed.The explosion caused radiation levels to rise for about half an hour in Severodvinsk, contradicting official ministry of defence claims that there had been no rise in radiation levels. Severodvinsk removed a statement confirming the spike in radiation levels from its website, saying the ministry was managing the response to the incident.While local officials urged calm, residents in several cities stocked up on iodine, which is often used to limit the effects of radiation exposure.Russia also closed a bay in the White Sea to civilian traffic for a month, driving speculation that either the water had been contaminated or that a search operation was being launched."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b55701425ea06197f0ddcdada21a7fbc188ad15/0_178_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=762f0ec9483768024e7f3dd67fc8056f","title":"thousands march in moscow disqualification city elections","story":"More than 100 arrested in biggest opposition rally in six years, prompted by disqualification of independent candidates Russia’s opposition held its largest protest in years in central Moscow in a show of strength and defiance after previous rallies were forcefully dispersed with mass arrests.Monitors from the White Counter group, an NGO that counts participants at rallies, reported that nearly 50,000 people attended the demonstration on Saturday, making it the largest opposition rally since 2013.By 7pm, police had made more than 100 arrests, many coming after a group of protesters left the larger, sanctioned demonstration and walked toward Russia’s presidential administration building.Riot police in balaclavas wielding nightsticks picked demonstrators out of the crowd and dragged them to nearby police vans, marking the third successive week of protesting in Russia’s capital marked by mass arrests. Military vans carrying troops in body armour were also seen in downtown Moscow.As mass arrests began, some protesters unsuccessfully sought refuge in an upscale hotel. One protester in the process of being detained said: “The demonstration ended and we came here to walk. Now they’re just picking people and detaining them.”Police also detained opposition leaders and raided a media studio tied to anti-corruption crusader Alexei Navalny.Earlier, chanting “dopuskai!” or “let them through”, members of Russia’s opposition had called for independent candidates to be allowed to appear in Moscow’s municipal elections.Shortly before the demonstration, police officers wearing masks detained Lyubov Sobol, an opposition activist who has declared a hunger strike over her disqualification from the elections. The police said she was planning a “provocation” at the rally.The rally had been permitted to go ahead by the city government, even though some speakers called for a march on the presidential administration building.Monitors allied with the opposition said they counted 49,900 people at the protest at 4pm Moscow time, although police estimated the crowd at 20,000.Municipal election fraud is an unlikely cause célèbre in Russia, and several months ago few expected the elections to attract widespread attention. But the disqualification of independent candidates and then thousands of arrests at unsanctioned rallies in the past two weeks served to bolster attendance at Saturday’s event.“Everyone has his own reason to be here,” said Maria Ostozheva, 53, standing in a plastic poncho on a cold and rainy summer afternoon. “The elections are just part of it. Nothing is changing. We need change.”Many attendees held signs saying “I have a right to a choice” or photographs of those charged with inciting protests in the past two weeks. Russian police have cracked down on the protesters more forcefully than usual, opening criminal cases, checking debt and military service records, and even initiating a process to take an infant son from her protesting parents. The case was later dropped.“It’s a police state,” said a young protester who gave his name as Mikhail. “My parents know I am here today. They support me. And I wouldn’t forgive myself if I didn’t protest.”The protest was attended by a number of prominent musicians, including the rappers Face and Oxxxymiron, the popular video blogger Yury Dud and others with mainstream appeal among younger Russians.“I honestly don’t get politics,” said Face, whose real name is Ivan Dryomin. “But I believe that freedom is life.

DLRCC said on Saturday it has taken the decision to extended the temporary prohibition notice for all bathing areas in its locality until 3pm on Monday due to waste water overflows from Irish Water’s treatment network.The beaches covered by the ban are Seapoint, Sandycove, the Forty Foot, Killiney and Whiterock. This decision was taken pending test results from Friday, and also as the weather forecast for the weekend is for more rain, which could lead to the possibility of more overflows.“Testing of water quality was undertaken early Friday,” said a spokesman. “We will continue to assess the risk to water quality based on test results and information provided by Irish Water.“Bathing water results will be published here. Water testing results are available approximately two days after sampling.”The pollution problem, which has at times led to almost all of central and south Dublin’s bathing spots being closed, is because of the system’s inability to cope with a growing population, Irish Water says.A major €400 million upgrade is currently underway but in the meantime residents and swimmers have been left “disgusted” by the latest incident, according to Green Party councillor Ossian Smyth.“They are angry at the idea of sewage getting into the sea,” he said. Dublin City Council added Dollymount beach to its list of “no bathing” zones on Friday, saying it would continue to monitor water quality before making a further statement on the matter.A spokeswoman for the council said on Saturday that testing was continuing to take place.Seasonal bans are already in place at Merrion and Sandymount beaches due to ongoing issues around bacterial levels in the water. Most of the closures this year have occurred during the summer season, a further irritation to those who regularly use the sea, particularly at bathing areas along the south coast. Overflows occur due to sudden and rapid rainy spells during which large amounts of water falls in a short period of time. This “storm water” mixes with the network’s “wastewater” and runs into overflow tanks. However, when these tanks reach capacity their contents are vented into the sea at Poolbeg. Testing of water quality is then undertaken, usually for a couple of days, during which time precautionary steps are taken in keeping people out of the sea. Irish Water maintains that what is ultimately released into the environment is “heavily diluted” and already screened to remove debris.The problem of overflows may escalate this weekend as the forecast is for a continuation of stormy weather, possibly with more thundery downpours and flash flooding.Mr Smyth said it was announced on Thursday that “because there was a forecast for heavy rain that today might be a bad day for a swim (because) there might be polluted water.“I think that’s a first. Instead of telling you after the fact they are now telling you beforehand and I think that’s a good thing by the council.”DLRCC has had cause to close some or all of its beaches on four occasions - in February, twice in June and this weekend. Dublin City Council has done so twice in June and this weekend, as well as the seasonal closure already in place at two sites.Irish Water reports incidents of discharge and overflow to the Environmental Protection Agency. In the first half of this year there were seven incidents of storm water overflow at Ringsend between March and August. Once complete, the ongoing upgrade at Ringsend means the capacity of its overflow tanks will be increased and such incidents “will be fewer in number although in extreme weather conditions they could still occur,” the agency said.It apologised for the disruption but moved to reassure the public “that there should be no lasting effects on bathing waters. The tide will wash out the spill and the salt water and sunlight acts to clean the water.”When the upgrade is complete in 2025, the Ringsend plant will be able to treat wastewater for a population equivalent of up to 2.4 million people, it said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3982908.1565444215!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"kilkee bathing ban follows extension of dublin beach notices","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe seafront at Kilkee, Co Clare. Photograph: Alan BetsonA swimming ban has been imposed at Kilkee beach following a discharge of wastewater into the sea.The beach in the small coastal town in Co Clare is a popular location with tourists and swimming enthusiasts.Clare County Council issued a “do not swim” notice on Saturday after the discharge which entered the water via the beach.“On the advice of the HSE and in the interest of public health, members of the public are advised not to swim or engage in other recreational activities in the water at this time,” said the local authority in a statement.The discharge is understood to have occurred after a three foot section of storm water piping was overwhelmed by rain water and burst. “Irish Water is aware of the wastewater incident relating to its wastewater infrastructure,” added the council.The discharge into the beach was contaminated with sewage from the area and the nearby Kilkee Wastewater Pumping Station.The burst pipe has been fixed so there is no longer a discharge, but tests must now be carried out to determine whether the water has been contaminated with E. coli or other bacteria. The lifting of the notice will be a matter for the HSE.Clare County Council has raised red flags at the beach until the water quality tests can be carried out. These are expected to occur on Monday, but, due to the lag period between testing and results, the beach is likely to remain closed until at least midweek.There have been a number of such incidents at Kilkee beach in recent years. Swimming was prohibited there twice in the same week in July 2017 due to an issue with the pumping station.The previous December, a ban was issued following an emergency discharge which contained elements of waste water.That incident occurred due to a safety device failing combined with heavy rainfall. The prohibition was lifted in May following repair work at the station.Meanwhile, the ban on bathing at beaches in south Dublin has been extended until Monday, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council (DLRCC) has said.Dublin’s main beaches have been shut down to swimmers for the fourth time this year following another wastewater overflow at the city’s treatment plant in Ringsend.DLRCC said on Saturday it has taken the decision to extend the temporary prohibition notice for all bathing areas in its locality until 3pm on Monday due to waste water overflows from Irish Water’s treatment network.The beaches covered by the ban are Seapoint, Sandycove, the Forty Foot, Killiney and Whiterock.This decision was taken pending test results from Friday, and also as the weather forecast for the weekend is for more rain, which could lead to the possibility of more overflows.“Testing of water quality was undertaken early Friday,” said a spokesman. “We will continue to assess the risk to water quality based on test results and information provided by Irish Water.“Bathing water results will be published here.

Photograph: The Royal Malaysia PoliceAPAs the search for 15-year-old Irish girl Nóra Quoirin entered its seventh day in Malaysia, the missing girl’s mother thanked search-and-rescue teams for all they have done so far.Being comforted by her husband Sebastien while she spoke on Saturday, Meabh Quoirin said: “We want to say thank you to each and every one of you. We know you are searching night and day for Nóra.“We see you working so hard and also praying with us, being with us. We know you have given up your time, especially at a special festival time, to be with us here. It means the world to us and we are so grateful for everything that you are doing for us, everyone here and everyone who is helping who is not here.“We are extremely impressed with the effort, your expertise, your dedication and we hope you find Nóra, and thank you so much. Terima kasih (thank you).”This is the first time Maebh has spoken publicly about her daughter’s disappearance. The Lucie Blackman Trust, which supports British nationals in crisis overseas, has been helping the family deal with the media.Nóra’s father reported her disappearance last Sunday morning when he discovered that she was missing from her room at the Dusun holiday resort, about 63 km south of Kuala Lumpur. The family checked in at the resort last Saturday morning (August 3rd).About 250 people have been scouring the jungle next to the resort. Extra personnel were drafted in on Friday.Expert indigenous trackers are involved in the search operation, ers have been scouring the river that runs through the forest, and helicopters and drones equipped with thermal imaging cameras have been deployed. Police said on Friday the search area, which is ided into six one-kilometre-square zones, was being expanded.Nóra’s photograph is being handed out at roadblocks in the area.DetailOn Friday, Nóra’s family issued a statement, going into great detail about the kind of person she is.“Nóra is a very special person,” they said. “She is fun, funny, and extremely loving. With her family, she is very affectionate – family is her whole world and she loves to play games, like Cat Bingo, with us. She likes to tell us silly jokes and wear clever, colourful t-shirts. She is not like other teenagers. She is not independent and does not go anywhere alone.”The family explained that Nóra’s verbal communication is limited. The statement said: “Nóra can read like a young child, but she cannot write more than a few words. She has a good memory, but she cannot understand anything conceptual. She is unable to do maths and so things like money are impossible to manage.”Nóra’s family explained that she cannot make or receive phone calls independently, that she can wash and dress herself, but cannot manage buttons, and that she struggles to wash her hair. At school, she is learning to ride a bicycle properly.“Nóra likes to walk with her family, but her balance is limited and she struggles with co-ordination. She has been to Asia, and many European countries before, and has never wandered off or got lost,” her family said.Nóra’s relatives explained that she was born with holoprosencephaly, which, they say, means that her brain is small. Holoprosencephaly is a rare congenital brain malformation resulting from incomplete separation of the right and left hemispheres.“All her life she has spent a lot of time in hospital,” Nóra’s family explained in their statement. “When she was born, she needed operations to help her breathing. She has specialists that monitor her growth, her physical abilities and her strength, and especially her mental capacity.“Nóra has always needed dedicated specialist educational provision, and now attends a school for children and young people with learning and communication difficulties.”Nóra and other members of her family are bilingual and bicultural, her relatives added in their statement yesterday. “Nóra is very proud that she can speak French as well as English.”Nóra, her family says, is very sensitive. “Outside the family, Nóra is very shy and can be quite anxious. Every night, her special time is for cuddles and a night-time story with her mum. And she was extremely excited about the family holiday in Malaysia,” the family added.AssistingThe deputy police chief for Negeri Sembilan, Che Zakaria Othman, said on Friday that members of the elite 69 Commando unit of the Royal Malaysian Police, also known as VAT 69, are now assisting in the search for Nóra.Mr Che Zakaria said almost all of the original search zones had been covered and teams were now rechecking areas, including the resort buildings. They are not focused on any one particular spot, he said.Numerous media reports have said fire-and-rescue personnel, assisted by sniffer dogs, found footprints in the jungle that they thought might be Nóra’s, but Mr Che Zakaria said yesterday that no footprints had been found.Questioned about the living room window through which police think Nóra may have exited the guest house, Mr Che Zakaria said the window could be opened from outside if not locked on the inside.Police have released photographs of the living room window, on which they found unidentified fingerprints, which are being analysed.To aid in the search for Nóra, a recording of her mother Meabh’s voice is being played via loudspeakers. The voices of other relatives have also been recorded. Search teams are also playing the recording of Meabh’s voice on their mobile phones as they go through the jungle.Malaysian police have said Nóra’s disappearance is being treated as a missing person case and that there is no evidence of foul play, but have said they are ruling nothing out. Nóra’s relatives believe that she has been abducted."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3981992.1565380913!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"britain has always struggled to take ireland seriously say irish ex diplomats","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Garret FtizGerald and  British prime minister Margaret Thatcher signing  the Anglo-Irish agreement. “We will have to work with the British and they with us to get out of the present unfortunate situation.” Photograph: Matt KavanaghThrough years spent operating at the top of Anglo-Irish relations, Irish ex-diplomat Séan Ó hUigínn detected what he sees as a curious gap in British thinking when dealing with Irish matters.”Ó hUigínn has good reason to know. One of the most distinguished diplomats of his era, he served as joint secretary of the British-Irish Secretariat in Belfast, established after the Anglo-Irish Agreement in 1985 led the Anglo-Irish ision in the Department of Foreign Affairs and served as Ireland’s ambassador to five different countries, including the United States.Speaking to The  in his Dublin home this week as fears grow of a no-deal Brexit, Ó hUigínn said issues Britain would take seriously in any other context “can be disregarded if it comes with an Irish label”.Mirroring the attitudes of other senior officials who dealt with British-Irish relations at key moments over the past 40 years, Ó hUigínn, now retired, views Brexit as a policy that “seems unhinged”.Officials who helped repair British-Irish relations after testing periods, such as when Margaret Thatcher’s government refused to engage with Dublin in the early 1980s following tensions over the Falklands war, and built towards great achievements such as the Anglo-Irish and the Belfast Agreements now watch on as exchanges become fraught once more.“The British do not engage very willingly with or about Ireland, ” Ó hUigínn says. “Burke said that the English have only one ambition in relation to Ireland, which is to hear no more about it. And that is still not a bad working maxim if you want to analyse British relations.“When they have to focus on it, there is another mechanism which comes into play which I would call the Irish anomaly. Something that would be taken very seriously in another context can be disregarded if it comes with an Irish label. The Border is a classic example of this.“Why didn’t the British focus on the fact that they had an extensive land border with the European Union? The answer is that it was in Ireland. It wasn’t serious.”Statement of intentAn exhibit of this, he argues, were comments made by former UK Brexit secretary David Davis just days after the initial Brexit joint report first containing the backstop, the insurance policy to avoid a hard Border, was signed in December 2017.Davis told the BBC the backstop was “much more a statement of intent than it was a legally enforceable thing”.“He gave a very broad wink to the British public,” says Ó hUigínn. “This is Irish stuff. Don’t take it too seriously. And I think there’s a kind of psychological shock among the Tories that the Europeans don’t seem to grasp this fundamental convention.”Michael Lillis, who was a diplomatic adviser to Garret Fitzgerald and was a negotiator of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, also says there have been “numerous very difficult moments” and “a lot of obdurate, of almost blind attitudes by the British”.While acknowledging the difficulties caused by Brexit, he says “it’s been much more difficult several times in the past”.“This was in the middle of the worst period of violence that we’ve had in the 30 years, mainly Provisional IRA violence of course, but also disastrous policies by the British like internment, other disasters like Bloody Sunday. And you know eventually, in both instances, we got over it.”Lillis believe Boris Johnson, the British prime minister, will lead the UK to a no-deal Brexit at the end of October, while Ó Uigínn says “they will crash out or they will leave, certainly”.“I think Boris Johnson is determined that there will be no issue between himself and Brexit as he goes toward an election,” he adds. “And that’s why he has to avoid the practical stuff which is messy and go for the Agincourt.”FundamentalPaddy Teahon, who was secretary general at the department of the taoiseach between 1993 and 2000 – working with Albert Reynolds, John Burton and Bertie Ahern – shares a similar view.“If you listen to Boris Johnson, they want out come what may. And, really, we are very much at the receiving end. So I would have thought that’s that, in the sense.”While there have been strains in the Anglo-Irish relationship in recent decades, Brexit makes the current changes more fundamental in nature, Teahon adds.“When I was involved in the peace process, Britain and Ireland were on the same side: we wanted to get peace in Northern Ireland. You were very much in the same direction. Now, we’re in almost fundamentally opposite directions. They want out of the European Union. ”He also believes that not enough attention is being paid to North-South relations, and questions what Johnson’s real attitude is to the Belfast Agreement.“He was on with this rhetoric ‘I’m 100 per cent for the Good Friday Agreement and there’ll be no hard Border on the island of Ireland’ and all the rest of it. But it’s a little bit like his ‘I want to deal with Europe’. There’s no reality to it. He doesn’t spell out.”Even though Ireland insists it will not be drawn into bilateral negotiations with the UK and will remain under the umbrella of the EU, one source with past experience of Anglo-Irish relations said engagement continues in private.“What you hear in the public space is the bit of the iceberg that’s above the water and there’s a lot more to it underneath. I can go back to the 1970s, and at the same time there was always a strong current of official and senior official and other levels of quite constructive engagement.“And that engagement over a period of 30 years did get us through some pretty rough times when pretty bad things we happening.”EngagementThis source argues that whereas engagement between British and Irish leaders at a European level in the past created space for discussions on Northern Ireland, the reverse may be true in future: that UK-Irish encounters in the North may help with how the UK interacts with the EU.On a practical level, Teahon says “there are always contacts going on, and I suspect there are contacts going on”.Ó hUigínn says Ireland, out of self-interest, will be very sensitive to British concerns.“We would be inside the European Union, they would be outside, and they will need friends in the European Union. There would be elements to build on again. I’m not saying that we would be a proxy for them within the union, but in a legitimate way setting store by the best possible relationship with the European Union.”All of those who spoke to The  believe that Ireland and the UK will have no choice but to pick up the pieces after a crash-out Brexit, if there is to be one, and reset relations.“You still have to work through it,” says Teahon. “We’re obviously going to relate to Britain possibly in a different way going forward. There’s relations with the EU which arguably will become even more important to us, but different.For Lillis there is “no other possible way forward” than for both countries to work together.“Will we have to work through a hard Brexit before we get down to serious business again. We will have to work with the British and they with us to get out of the present unfortunate situation.”InitiativeHowever, he cautions against any Irish government waiting years, until the British relationship with the EU has settled, to make a move, and says it is up to Dublin to take the initiative. “It’s always a bit more up to Dublin than to London to take initiatives to get sort of an agenda going.”One of his own ideas is a process whereby both Dublin and London could move to clarify, for both communities in Northern Ireland, the potential shape of the province in a united Ireland.In the event of unity, Lillis argues, the British government would have a responsibility to “work with the Irish government” in representing the concerns of the unionist population.“That’s a reverse of how the Anglo-Irish agreement worked in ‘85, where the Irish government in practice represented the concerns about the nationalists.”Ó hUigínn and Teahon also say the debate around unity must be managed over the next decade or so. Teahon is concerned in particular about the economic impact of a no-deal Brexit on Northern Ireland.“What doesn’t get recognised is the people who would really suffer from a no-deal Brexit is Northern Ireland. I may be too much of an optimist, my friends tell me, but I feel Ireland is very adaptable. I think we will adapt relatively quickly”.For Ó hUigínn managing unionist concerns will be the greatest challenges of Irish politics over the next decade.The tragedy of the “Black Swan event of Brexit”, he says, is that it has turned the question of Irish unity into a “game of margins”.“You have a core hereditary nationalist, a core hereditary unionist and then an in-between item, a swing factor that is very crucial.”This dynamic has scotched the “secret hope” of those who worked on the Belfast Agreement that “it would create a breathing space, a decompression chamber where people could dismantle the poisons of the past” and calmly consider what kind of future constitutional model they wanted.“And that a united Ireland if or when it comes on the agenda will do so against a background of a Northern Ireland, you know, not being a failed entity, so to speak. I think that hope is gone.”Provoking the beastIn the immediate future of Anglo-Irish relations, he says there is “nothing for it except as patiently as we can, and as constructively as we can, try not to break any relationship that we don’t have to”.“Avoid any sort of provoking the beast or tweaking the tail or anything like that. And then just wait for the exaltation to subside.“I think the great Mr Johnson – not Boris, but Samuel – said nothing odd lasts long. And what’s happening British politics now is so odd, it will not last long.“And it’s trying to be poised as best we can for what comes afterwards and I think, by instinct, both the population here and the Government would want to be as constructive as possible.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

File imag: Dara Mac Dónaill  The Ireland should not expect the United States to play any role in resolving the current impasse between the UK and the European Union over the backstop given president Donald Trump’s desire to break up the EU, according to former taoiseach John Bruton. “I don’t see America being any help because as far as I can see Donald Trump would like to break up the European Union which he sees as a sort of an adversary and he would prefer the US to deal with inidual European countries rather than have to deal with the EU as a whole,” Mr Bruton told an audience in Co Cork on Friday evening.British prime minister Boris Johnson is insisting that the EU drop its demand for the backstop - guaranteeing no hard border on the island of Ireland - or the UK will crash out of the union on October 31st.A former EU ambassador to the United States, Mr Bruton said Mr Trump was the first US president to adopt such a position towards the EU while many in the Republican Party were also in favour of Brexit in the hope it would lead to a break-up of the EU.“There are people in the Republican Party like Tom Cotton who said they are ready to negotiate a deal with Britain as long and as soon as they leave the European Union… I think that’s just designed to feed into the pro-Brexit rhetoric in the UK,” he said.“I think those sort of statements are aimed at encouraging public opinion (in the UK) towards a no-deal Brexit in the in the hope of people holding that view in the United States that a no-deal Brexit could contribute to breaking up the European Union.“Well, it’s not going to happen. The European Union is not going to break up and it’s certainly not going to break up on the initiative of president Trump or Steve Bannon or other people with Irish names serving in his administration.”Speaking at the opening night of the West Cork History Festival in Skibbereen, Mr Bruton also defended the Government’s handling of Brexit amid accusations that Taoiseach Leo Varadkar had been provocative to unionists in some of his comments.Media commentary Mr Bruton acknowledged there had been media commentary with regard to the UK’s position on the backstop which had been less than respectful to Britain but he didn’t believe the Government had been disrespectful in anything it had said.Last month, DUP leader Arlene Foster told Mr Varadkar to “dial down the rhetoric” over Brexit after he warned that everyone in Ireland and the UK should be afraid of a no-deal Brexit which could lead both nationalists and moderate unionists to question remaining in the UK.Mr Bruton said: “As I understand it, offence was taken at an answer given by Leo Varadkar when he was asked if a no-deal Brexit could lead to a united Ireland and he said that it might and because he even uttered the words, it was seen as provocative but it wasn’t provocative.“It was simply a reflection by him on an opinion poll that was done in Northern Ireland in November of last year...“It wasn’t in any way provocative to refer to it but unfortunately people can be unduly sensitive to the point that unpalatable facts, even though they are facts, can be seen as provocative just because of the nature of the facts and the facts in that opinion poll were quite revealing.”Asked by ITN News Political Correspondent, Carl Dinnen in an Q\u0026ampA session what advice he would give the UK when it came to negotiating a trade deal with the US, Mr Bruton replied: “I would advise them to give priority to getting a trade deal with the European Union first. I don’t know the exact multiple but I would guess they do four to five times the amount of trade with their physical neighbours in Europe than they do with the United States.”Mr Bruton said he believed if the UK had reached a secure trade deal first with the EU, it would stand them in good stead when it came to negotiating a deal with the US as it would leave them less vulnerable to the US reneging on any deal.He said that negotiating with the US without a trade deal with anyone else in place would leave the UK exposed to possible changes in the US position once Brexit had been achieved in keeping with president Trump’s anti-European Union agenda.“President Trump may go back to his mercantilist approach to trade agreements which won’t be favourable to Britain or China or Mexico or Canada or any of the countries that have done trade deals with the United States because the United States doesn’t stick with its trade deals.”Mr Bruton pointed out that the US had withdrawn from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) while it had renegotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) as they wish to deal on their own terms. “I wish the British Government luck,” he concluded.

It wasn’t there last night and it won’t be there tomorrow.”The moon is less than half a million kilometres from the earth, while Jupiter is almost 2,000 times that.Mr Moore says size is the reason Jupiter will be so blinding. “Although it’s five times further from the sun than we are, it’s so big, it reflects more light. You’d need 1,300 balls of Earth squished together to fit inside Jupiter.”SpheresWhile this event happens technically every month, the two spheres are rarely this close. “This is a probably a once a year or so event,” he says. “Eighteen-year cycles exist behind all these close approaches, and we’re at a part where the close approaches can be very close.”The spectacle of glowing orbs will be visible for a window of three hours all over the island, from sunset at 9pm until Jupiter sets just after midnight.“You’ll see it north and south, with the naked eye,” says Mr Moore. “There’s no need for telescopes or binoculars.”“The only potential problem is the Irish weather — three out of four nights in Ireland are cloudy,” he adds. “But you can even see a glow through the clouds.”Ireland is home to many astronomy-enthusiasts, with Astronomy Ireland being the most popular astronomy society in the world relative to population size.The society is inviting the public to send photos of this rare sight to be published in the Astronomy Ireland magazine."},{"url":null,"title":"revealed really goes recycling rubbish behind scenes","story":"The chaos of Britain’s recycling system is exposed today with hundreds of thousands of tons of waste being redirected to landfill or incinerators.Despite residents sorting their household waste into separate bins, up to half of “recyclable” material is not being recycled in some areas of England, government data shows.It comes as an undercover investigation by The  and Unearthed reveals staff at a recycling centre in London are sending recyclable plastic and paper to be incinerated.Today, The  launches a Zero Waste campaign calling on the Government, local councils and private companies to do more to boost the country’s lacklustre recycling rates.It is backed by Boris Johnson...To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Police officer \u0026#39deliberately run over by car thief \u0026#39 days after Stuart Outten was attacked with macheteGurkha charity appeals for sympathetic hearing for veterans\u0026#39 adult children seeking life in Britain\u0026#39Blokes less likely to show vulnerability in front of women\u0026#39 says father of soldier killed in Afghanistan, as he sets up new men-only trauma charity Government launches inquiry into causes of power cut chaosWarning over fake trusts using name of charity regulatorAnne Boleyn\u0026#39s nursery for the male child that was never born to be explored for first timeComment: Now the EU has lost its chance to humiliate us, it’s time to renegotiate a deal with dignityWarnings over \u0026#39Texodus\u0026#39 as Republicans flee after mass shootingDuke of York among those named in 1,200 pages of Jeffrey Epstein court documentsCourt unseals pages of documents relating to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine MaxwellComment: Our short-sighted politicians have fallen prey to mindless green posturing\tParents of murdered British backpacker fear trial in Kashmir could collapseUK weather: More chaos for Travellers as heavy rain shuts railways between England and ScotlandMillions of Brexit 50p coins to be minted in time for October 31US pledges to continue Epstein investigation amid fears his death will silence future revelationsNational HRT shortage leaves 200,000 menopausal women suffering as experts warn alternatives could also run out The Polish village where no boys have been born for almost a decadePétanque for pensioners?

Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22.

However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.Marvel recently announced their full plans for Phase Four at Comic-Con.\u0026nbspYou can find a rundown of the 10 biggest\u0026nbspannouncements\u0026nbsp – including Natalie Portman\u0027s promotion to female superhero alongside Chris Hemsworth\u0027s Thor and the announcement of a new Blade film starring Mahershala Ali –\u0026nbsphere.While in Comic-Con, Feige revealed which Avenger could have single-handedly taken down Thanos if he had no back up from his army.Avengers: Endgame\u0026nbspwill be out on Blu-ray on 2 September – and you can see our ranking of every character, from worst\u0026nbspto best,\u0026nbsphere.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A crucial first step would be to automatically issue all necessary companies with an EORI number to minimise the hoops that firms need to jump through to be ready for day one.“There are many fundamental outstanding questions relating to the rules and processes of trade in the event of no deal.“While the Department for International Trade has been working with third countries to ensure the rollover of existing FTAs, many of these critical arrangements have not yet been formally agreed, and firms can’t plan for the future based on warm words.

But the fundamentals of the British economy are strong â wages are growing, employment is at a record high and we are forecast to grow faster than Germany, Italy and Japan this year,” Javid said in a statement.“The government is determined to provide certainty to people and businesses on Brexit \u0026nbspthat\u0027s why we are clear that the UK is leaving the EU on 31 October.”Here\u0027s the full story on the UK\u0027s unexpectedly poor economic performance from The Independent\u0027s business and economics editor, Olesya Dmitracova:\u0026nbspUK economy shrinks for first time since 2012 as fears of no-deal Brexit chaos mountThe pound is hovering perilously close to the 31-month low against the dollar of $1.208\u0026nbspit reached earlier this month.\u0026nbspIt\u0027s now at $1.2083...One bright spot in today\u0027s economic numbers was the continued resilience of British consumers.\u0026nbspSpending rose 0.5 per cent in the second quarter, although this was down slightly from 0.6 per cent in the previous three months.\u0026nbspConsumers have seen wages begin to rise above inflation in recent months.A British-West African industrial consortium has submitted a last-minute rescue offer to snap up the British Steel plant in Scunthorpe, the Press Association reports.\u0026nbspPA understands the unnamed industrial group has submitted a late bid to the government in an effort re-establish the international trade credentials of the site.\u0026nbspThe consortium, which involves a leading UK civil engineering company operating in West Africa, is the latest to enter the fray to take control of the steel supplier after it collapsed into liquidation 11 weeks ago.\u0026nbspMore on the potential impact of closure on Sconthorpe, here:\u0026nbspBritish Steel: Closure would ruin a historic industrial town and allow Britain to be ‘held to ransom’Package holiday firm On the Beach has blamed the plummeting pound foe a profit warning\u0026nbspissued today.\u0026nbspIt says\u0026nbspsterling\u0027s tumble\u0026nbspagainst the euro has forced it push up its holiday prices compared to competitors.\u0026nbspUnlike many of its rivals, On the Beach it does not hedge its exposure to currency changes.John McDonnell has seized on the latest GDP figures, which he says are a\u0026nbspdirect result of Tory incompetence.\u0026nbspThe Tories\u0027 Brexit bungling, including Boris Johnson now taking us towards no-deal, is breaking the economy.\u0026nbspMore on the reaction to today\u0027s numbers from political correspondent Ashley Cowburn:\u0026nbspBoris Johnson accused of \u0027breaking economy\u0027 over no-deal Brexit threats as recession fears mount\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAdvertising firm WPP led Friday\u0027s FTSE 100 firms as its shares jumped after it performed ahead of analyst predictions.\u0026nbspInvestors cheered the beleaguered firm\u0027s revenue performance as its major turnaround programme gathered pace in the second quarter.

The slide could be even steeper as the OBR’s prediction was based on the assumption of a particular type of no-deal Brexit – the less disruptive of the two laid out by the IMF earlier this year.Howard Archer, economic adviser to the EY Item\u0026nbspClub, forecasts a similar decline, saying house prices would quickly fall by about 5 per cent as the economy weakened and the market was mired in acute uncertainty over Britain’s future trading relationship with the EU.For now, house prices look on track for hardly any growth over this year.\u0026nbspAccording to RICS, a net balance of 9 per cent of respondents reported a fall in average prices over the past three months in England and Wales. Samuel Tombs, economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the result is consistent with the official measure of prices showing a rise of only 0.5 per cent in 2019.\u0026nbspHalifax data also showed that UK house prices dropped slightly in July for the second consecutive month and now stand at £236,120 on average.“The market continues to tread water,” said Russell Galley, managing director at Halifax.\u0026nbsp“In the longer term, we believe there is unlikely to be a step change in market activity until buyers and sellers see some form of resolution to the current economic uncertainty.”RICS echoed this prediction, noting that its survey now points to zero growth in sales – as well as a steeper fall in prices – in the next three months.On Thursday Boris Johnson reiterated his trademark message that Britain will leave the EU on 31 October, even though no progress has been made on securing a withdrawal agreement acceptable to both sides.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 443 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.543 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1343 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1443 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1743 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2143 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2743 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2943 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3143 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs.On his debut album, the 24-year-old Collard mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto.   Dedicated covers the full, but generic, spectrum of relationships: dizzying love, lust, and break-ups. But whether she’s pining for the return of a former love in the funky disco banger “Julien”, or singing about masturbating post-break-up in lead single “Party For One” (“I’ll be the one If you don’t care about me Making love to myself Back on my beat”), the vibe remains positively jubilant.Getty Images for Spotify3643 Tyler, the Creator - IGOR“I don’t know where I’m going,” Tyler, the Creator begins on the song “I THINK”. “But I know what I’m showing.” The US artist’s words ring true throughout his fifth studio album, IGOR, where he adopts the dark and twisted mutterings of the Frankenstein character from which the record gets its name. It’s been a long wait for Flying Lotus’s new album. In fact, the LA producer has been masterminding Flamagra for the past five years – snatching moments between collaborating with Kendrick Lamar on To Pimp a Butterfly, directing and writing the comic horror movie Kuso, producing much of Thundercat’s Drunk and growing his Brainfeeder label.A heftier sound is never at the cost of melody, which shines through in Thomson’s vocals, the rest of the band’s backing falsetto, and the searing blues grooves stamped all over Future Dust. Those qualities are captured nowhere more satisfyingly than on “25”. “All Over Town” is their singalong anthem, neatly positioned in the middle to ease the pace.In keeping with the relatively restrained guest spots, it’s heartening just how much Skepta has rejected overloading Ignorance is Bliss with high-profile producers, preferring instead to burrow into his own aesthetic. There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums.Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece.A revolving door of female vocalists (A-listers, indie darlings like Angel Olsen and unsung songwriters) deliver heartbroken lines over big, shiny beats and synths. The emotional cohesion the record loses in its shifting cast of singerssongwritersgenres it makes up in DJ-savvy textural variety. Help Us Stranger reaches all corners of guitar rock: funky Detroit garage (“What’s Yours Is Mine”) country soul (“Somedays (I Don’t Feel Like Trying)”) psych (a cover of Donovan’s “Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)”) blues and bluegrass (“Thoughts and Prayers”). A cornucopia of instrumentation is woven into its brisk 42-minute yarn.4343 Hot Chip - A Bath Full of EcstasyWhen Hot Chip achieved chart success with their second album, 2006’s The Warning, it seemed more like a happy coincidence than a sign they were conforming to current pop trends. Since then, they\u0027ve released a string of consistently great albums, from 2008’s Made in the Dark (featuring their only Top 10 single to date, “Ready for the Floor”) to this, their seventh and best record, A Bath Full of Ecstasy. It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 443 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.543 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power.

Chrissy Teigen, an outspoken critic of the Trump administration, was among those who reacted to Rock’s tweet. She shared it and told the musician: “You’re pathetic” – signing her message “Chrissy Teigen” in an apparent imitation of Rock’s tweeting style.Swift publicly endorsed two Democratic candidates in Tennessee, her home state, during the 2018 midterms, after years of not making political statements.She has since spoken out on topics such as sexism in the music industry and LGBT+ rights.Rock’s tweet has been met with more than 15,000 comments, many of which dismissed his comments against Swift.One person branded his message “sexist”, “ignorant” and “ dripping with jealousy”, while someone else called it “lame and unoriginal”.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The balance of exporting manufacturers that have increased orders also fell to +9, down from +21 in the same quarter last year. In services, it fell to +5 from +14.Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersUncertainty has increased significantly since the April to June period as the prospect of a no-deal Brexit has become more likely under Boris Johnson’s government.The BCC warned that many businesses are not ready for the “immediate and abrupt” changes that leaving the EU without a\u0026nbspdeal would bring.It urged the government to fast-track through paperwork that all UK businesses will need\u0026nbspto trade with the EU after Brexit.A “worryingly low” number of firms have obtained an “Economic Operators Registration and Identification” number\u0026nbsp(EORI), which is required for customs purposes, the BCC said.How badly could Brexit disrupt farming exports from Northern Ireland?Hannah Essex, co-executive director at the BCC, said: “There is real frustration among business communities across the UK at the lack of clarity about trading conditions after the UK leaves the EU, and we’re already seeing the impact of that uncertainty.“While the majority of firms want the government to avoid a messy and disorderly Brexit, we’re calling on the government to put practicalities first and implement measures to ensure firms are as prepared as possible for whatever scenario they face. A crucial first step would be to automatically issue all necessary companies with an EORI number to minimise the hoops that firms need to jump through to be ready for day one.“There are many fundamental outstanding questions relating to the rules and processes of trade in the event of no deal.“While the Department for International Trade has been working with third countries to ensure the rollover of existing FTAs, many of these critical arrangements have not yet been formally agreed, and firms can’t plan for the future based on warm words. Maintaining preferential access to countries where the EU has trade agreements is critical to maintaining competitiveness in key markets.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Just four years ago, a mosque was opened at Gilwell Park – the UK’s biggest scout camp – adding to the Buddhist sala, Jewish synagogue and two Christian chapels already on site.And, here in Blackburn, Nisbah’s own troop\u0026nbsphas exploded from just 16 Beavers when she first set it up in a local primary school in 2014 to exactly 100 youngsters – including Hedgehogs, Beavers, Cubs, Scouts and Explorers – five years on. And there’s a waiting list with another 110 more names on it.All but a handful of the group are practising Muslims. “We have halal meet when there are camp fires and we meet on Saturdays because a lot of the youngsters go to the mosque in the week,” says Nisbah, a solicitor by training. “But that’s about the only differences to any other troop.”Brownies volunteer shortage means ‘thousands of girls missing out’She founded the group after becoming concerned her own three children – Maya, 10, Raihan, 8, and six-year-old Zayn – weren’t getting out of the house enough.She wanted them learning to camp and hike and cook beans on a stove (“to have adventures, basically”) after she herself had fallen in love with the great outdoors while living for a brief period in Warwickshire.Seeing a possible fit, she got in touch with the Scout Association, asked to form a group in the Whalley New Road area of Blackburn, and held her first meeting at the town’s Brookhouse Primary School within a few weeks.“In terms of getting the community involved, it was just pushing at an open door,” she says. “I think families here were crying out for something like this without even realising it, so when we launched, there was interest pretty much straight away.“Our first year we had six leaders for 16 kids because all the parents wanted to get involved and see what it was all about too.”Since then, as the group as expanded, the adventures have come thick and fast. They’ve been to parliament, had a sleepover at Blackpool Tower and, just last year, visited a fellow Scout troop in Malaysia.“One night we were ended up dancing the Macarena in the middle of Kuala Lumpur with all these new friends we’d made,” she laughs. “How else would we ever have got the chance to do that?”The movement, she adds, may have had its origins in colonialism and Christianity, but it is today entirely pluralistic.“There’s this misconception that Scouts is very white and exclusive but its ethos and the activities it offers to young people, there is a huge compatibility with Islam,” she says. “It’s a very natural fit: things like spending time in the great outdoors, finding happiness through helping others, doing your duty – these are key aspects of our faith.”She points out how, in fact, a third of Scouts across the world are Muslim – with vast membership numbers in places like Indonesia and the Middle East. “So, there’s no reason we shouldn’t see even greater numbers grow in the UK too.”Certainly, that’s the hope of the Scout Association itself.Nisbah’s troop now boasts over 100\u0026nbsp(Scout Association)Five years ago, it took a key strategic decision to focus on trying to widen the movement’s appeal across the broad spectrum of communities in the UK. Crucially, it set aside a chunk of its budget, employed a number of development officers and instructed them to go into deprived neighbourhood and extol the virtues of scouting.“What we are seeing now is the rewards of that,” says Simon Carter, spokesperson with the association and himself a leader of the 1st Bishop’s Stortford troop. “What Scouts has always done, ever since it was founded by Robert Baden-Powell in 1908 is remain relevant – it’s a mass-participation movement so it can’t survive if it doesn’t – and to remain relevant in the 21st century, we realised we had to reflect the changing face of the UK.”More work still needs to be done, he admits.In an organisation that has a total of 638,794 youngsters signed up, the numbers of Muslim Scouts as a proportion of overall membership remains significantly less than the population as a whole.“But we are not resting on our laurels on this,” says Carter, who has himself been involved with the movement for almost 40 years. “We’ve had success in attracting members from ethnic minorities. Now we want more. We have something to offer, and we want to make that available to everyone.”Dozens of troops held iftars during Ramadan this year as part of an initiative to invite the local community in, while a jamboree organised by the MSF is set to attract almost 3,500 Scouts in 2021.For now, though, there seems little doubt that those already involved are glad to be so.“I love it,” says Tahseen Patel, an 18-year-old student who has been a member of Nisbah’s troop since day one. “My Saturdays wouldn’t be the same without it. It’s such good fun but you always leave feeling you’ve achieved something or learnt something.”Favourite memories include meeting the Duchess of Cambridge at Gilwell Park (“very sophisticated”) and that sleepover at Blackpool Tower. “We have breakfast in the ballroom,” she beams. “What an experience.”Back in her garage, meanwhile, Nisbah is contemplating all that equipment.“We want to make the group sustainable and ongoing,” she says. “And, as much as we love the primary school, the best way to do that is have our own home, so that’s the aspiration now. It would be lovely, a little hut to call our own.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But the fundamentals of the British economy are strong â wages are growing, employment is at a record high and we are forecast to grow faster than Germany, Italy and Japan this year,” Javid said in a statement.“The government is determined to provide certainty to people and businesses on Brexit \u0026nbspthat\u0027s why we are clear that the UK is leaving the EU on 31 October.”Here\u0027s the full story on the UK\u0027s unexpectedly poor economic performance from The Independent\u0027s business and economics editor, Olesya Dmitracova:\u0026nbspUK economy shrinks for first time since 2012 as fears of no-deal Brexit chaos mountThe pound is hovering perilously close to the 31-month low against the dollar of $1.208\u0026nbspit reached earlier this month.\u0026nbspIt\u0027s now at $1.2083...One bright spot in today\u0027s economic numbers was the continued resilience of British consumers.\u0026nbspSpending rose 0.5 per cent in the second quarter, although this was down slightly from 0.6 per cent in the previous three months.\u0026nbspConsumers have seen wages begin to rise above inflation in recent months.A British-West African industrial consortium has submitted a last-minute rescue offer to snap up the British Steel plant in Scunthorpe, the Press Association reports.\u0026nbspPA understands the unnamed industrial group has submitted a late bid to the government in an effort re-establish the international trade credentials of the site.\u0026nbspThe consortium, which involves a leading UK civil engineering company operating in West Africa, is the latest to enter the fray to take control of the steel supplier after it collapsed into liquidation 11 weeks ago.\u0026nbspMore on the potential impact of closure on Sconthorpe, here:\u0026nbspBritish Steel: Closure would ruin a historic industrial town and allow Britain to be ‘held to ransom’Package holiday firm On the Beach has blamed the plummeting pound foe a profit warning\u0026nbspissued today.\u0026nbspIt says\u0026nbspsterling\u0027s tumble\u0026nbspagainst the euro has forced it push up its holiday prices compared to competitors.\u0026nbspUnlike many of its rivals, On the Beach it does not hedge its exposure to currency changes.John McDonnell has seized on the latest GDP figures, which he says are a\u0026nbspdirect result of Tory incompetence.\u0026nbspThe Tories\u0027 Brexit bungling, including Boris Johnson now taking us towards no-deal, is breaking the economy.\u0026nbspMore on the reaction to today\u0027s numbers from political correspondent Ashley Cowburn:\u0026nbspBoris Johnson accused of \u0027breaking economy\u0027 over no-deal Brexit threats as recession fears mount\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAdvertising firm WPP led Friday\u0027s FTSE 100 firms as its shares jumped after it performed ahead of analyst predictions.\u0026nbspInvestors cheered the beleaguered firm\u0027s revenue performance as its major turnaround programme gathered pace in the second quarter.

The slide could be even steeper as the OBR’s prediction was based on the assumption of a particular type of no-deal Brexit – the less disruptive of the two laid out by the IMF earlier this year.Howard Archer, economic adviser to the EY Item\u0026nbspClub, forecasts a similar decline, saying house prices would quickly fall by about 5 per cent as the economy weakened and the market was mired in acute uncertainty over Britain’s future trading relationship with the EU.For now, house prices look on track for hardly any growth over this year.\u0026nbspAccording to RICS, a net balance of 9 per cent of respondents reported a fall in average prices over the past three months in England and Wales. Samuel Tombs, economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the result is consistent with the official measure of prices showing a rise of only 0.5 per cent in 2019.\u0026nbspHalifax data also showed that UK house prices dropped slightly in July for the second consecutive month and now stand at £236,120 on average.“The market continues to tread water,” said Russell Galley, managing director at Halifax.\u0026nbsp“In the longer term, we believe there is unlikely to be a step change in market activity until buyers and sellers see some form of resolution to the current economic uncertainty.”RICS echoed this prediction, noting that its survey now points to zero growth in sales – as well as a steeper fall in prices – in the next three months.On Thursday Boris Johnson reiterated his trademark message that Britain will leave the EU on 31 October, even though no progress has been made on securing a withdrawal agreement acceptable to both sides.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Arab, explains how he has lost $1000s of dollars being displaced due to the water crisis in Iraq (Photo: Bel Trew)A United Nations report released last month warned that the world is heading for a “climate apartheid” scenario, “where the wealthy pay to escape overheating, hunger and conflict while the rest of the world is left to suffer”.\u0026nbspIn Baghdad, that is already a reality. On 48C\u0026nbspdays, which are now coming earlier in the year, air conditioners are the most effective way of staying cool. But an electricity crisis in the country is putting even that essential tool out of reach to low-income families.\u0026nbspThe crisis – caused by a combination of corruption, mismanagement and a creaking national grid\u0026nbsp– has exacerbated the country’s energy ide. The result is a huge gap between electricity supply and demand, especially in the summer. A diesel generator can be used to meet some of the shortfall, but running an air conditioner from a generator is a luxury only a few can afford.\u0026nbsp“The electricity is completely unpredictable,” says Abu Ahmed, a metal shop owner just down the street from Muhammad. “Sometimes it comes on at 10am and lasts all day, sometimes it’s only one hour. The air conditioner is out of the question without the government grid.”\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAbu Ahmed pays around £50 a month to run a generator that gives him a supply of four amps of electricity. That is all he can afford. If he goes over the allotted amps, the power turns off. \u0026nbsp“I can run the fridge and the lights, that’s all,” he says. “I can’t sleep at night and I’m always sweating.”Boiling Basra: Iraq’s water crisis threatens to destabilise the regionIraq’s electricity crisis may be a local problem, but the inequality of keeping cool is a global issue that is likely to become more relevant as temperatures rise.\u0026nbspNearly 2.8 billion people live in countries where the average daily temperature is greater than 25C, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), and less than 10 per cent of them own an air conditioner. The agency estimates that by 2050, 1.9 billion people living in hot countries will be without access to an air conditioner.\u0026nbspProfessor Philip Alston, the UN’s special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights and author of the “climate apartheid” report, says the lives of the world’s poorest will be at risk.\u0026nbsp“The ever-higher record temperatures that will be recorded in Iraq and around the world will put vast numbers of vulnerable iniduals at grave risk. Children, older persons, those who are already ill or are just not very strong, will all be at risk of dying from excessive heat,” he tells The Independent.\u0026nbspAFPGetty)“The only way for some of these to get a degree of protection will be from air conditioning. But that costs money both for the system or the equipment as well as for electricity. The poorest people will often have neither access nor the money needed to have access to such relief.”\u0026nbspIraqi cities have some advantages over Europe when it comes to dealing with extreme temperatures. Its neighbourhoods and homes were designed with the heat in mind. Narrow streets carry the wind through tall windows, cool air flows up from the basements in older houses.\u0026nbspAs the recent heatwaves in Paris, London and Berlin have shown, European countries are significantly less well-equipped to deal with these higher temperatures.\u0026nbspLast month’s record-breaking temperature of 38.7C\u0026nbspin the UK prompted apocalyptic headlines, transport chaos and a spate of government health warnings –\u0026nbspand for good reason.\u0026nbspHigh temperatures in Europe are usually accompanied by a spike in deaths, usually among the elderly and people with heart and lung conditions. In 2003, a heatwave caused an additional 70,000 deaths across the continent. The British parliament’s Environmental Audit Committee has warned that Britain faces 7,000 heat-related deaths every year by 2050 unless action is taken.\u0026nbspAs it stands today, Europe is ill-prepared. The IEA estimates that less than 5 per cent of European households are air-conditioned, but it adds that air conditioning could become one of the top drivers of global electricity demand within a few decades.The UK’s Met Office describes heatwaves as “extreme weather events,” but adds that with climate change they are likely to become more frequent. Its own projections show that heatwaves could occur on average as regularly as every other year by the middle of the century.\u0026nbspChildren, older persons, those who are already ill or are just not very strong, will all be at risk of dying from excessive heatThe rise in temperature is likely to have an impact on how we work, too. According to the International Labour Organisation, the best-case scenario predictions for the level of warming would result in a 2.2 per cent reduction of global working hours due to heat stress by 2030, the equivalent of 80 million full-time jobs.\u0026nbspBut as Europe considers a future of climate crises, here again, Iraq is years ahead. Muhammad, the hardware store worker, knows very well how the heat can stop you in its tracks.\u0026nbsp“This job is easy, I don’t move around so much. But it takes an extra effort to do anything. Other jobs, like labouring, is much more difficult.”\u0026nbspAnd while European countries may at least have the time and means to adapt, Iraq is fast approaching an environmental disaster. \u0026nbspAFPGetty)A 2018,\u0026nbspreport produced by a group of academics from the EastWest Institute and the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) described Iraq as “one of the Middle East’s most climate-vulnerable countries”.“Climate change is currently manifesting itself in prolonged heat waves, erratic precipitation, higher than average temperatures and increased disaster intensity,” the report says, adding a prediction that the country’s mean annual temperature will increase by 2C\u0026nbspby 2050.Mahmoud Abdul Latif Hamed, a weather forecaster and manager of environment at Iraq’s Meteorological Organisation, says Iraq is experiencing extreme temperatures earlier in the year. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“In 2011, the temperature in Baghdad reached 50C\u0026nbspin August. Now it’s June and the temperature in Baghdad is already 49C. That means there has been a two-month shift in reading the temperature,” he says.\u0026nbsp“Fifty degrees is very dangerous if you’re out in the open. For the poor it is even more dangerous. They have no air conditioning to cool down.”According to Hamed, there are things the government can do to deal with the extreme heat.\u0026nbsp“The ideal solution is to make more vegetation, which can lower temperatures. And we need to remove all the factories and old technology,” he says. \u0026nbspBut despite Iraq’s massive oil wealth, corruption is hampering reform and Iraqis are furious. Last summer, deadly protests erupted in the southern city of Basra over the government’s inability to provide reliable electricity and water. The government has promised to invest billions in improving the national grid, but few have noticed the difference so far.\u0026nbspProtesters have been back on the streets this year in anticipation of another sweltering summer.\u0026nbsp“We expect the future climate of Iraq to be very dangerous,” Hamed,\u0026nbspsays. “I expect that if the issue isn’t fixed, it will bring down the government.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Dame of the British Empire. Oscar winner. Recipient of more awards than Mr Hollywood’s had hot buns.And favoured guest of chatshow host Graham Norton. But there she was, browsing the aisles and totally unbothered by anyone.Why  Well, firstly, she wasn’t wilfully drawing attention to herself by radiating self-importance. And secondly, while she’s paid to be dramatic on screen, her le outside of it is anything but.Meaning that, in everyday le, her showbiz currency — the aforementioned “clickbait” — is, depending on how you view such things, blissfully low.But , say, she decided to dump her conservationist partner David Mills for a young barman from her local pub, a photo of her low-key shopping trip would be front-page news. Simple really.Aside from the marvellous Ms Dench, there are oodles of A- listers who live non-famous lives, popping to the supermarket or going for a low-key dinner — for example, not The Ivy et al — with loved ones.Occasionally, they might be spotted and photographed, but they just keep their head down and ignore it, accepting that it’s a small price to pay for the myriad other benefits fame brings.NDAsare now commonly used by celebrities to ensure the silence of, say, a nanny who will be privy to what happens behind closed doors — and that’s perhaps understandable.But asking a lover to sign on the dotted line when you’ve already been together two years is saying, in so many words: “I don’t trust you, but I want to carry on sleeping with you.”Who can blame Summer for telling him to stick it where the sun don’t shine Famous US basketball coach and mentor, John Wooden , once said: “Talent is God given Be humble. Fame is man-given Be grateful. Conceit is self-given Be careful.”Wise words that Mr Hollywoodwould do well to heed.WHATEVER you think of Boris Johnson’s politics, it can’t be denied that he’s working his King Ashurbanipal socks offas our new PM.Hospitals, factories, flood-hit towns – you name it, he’s popping up there to put a smile on everyone’s face and reassure them that everything is under control.He’s the frontman while the rest of the bandare putting in the hours at the studio, hopefully producing the hits. Time will tell.But suffice to say, he’s already shaping up to be the UK’s cheerleader – a feat the more reserved and aloof Theresa May never quite managed.WHEN asked about children, Prince Harry replied that he and we Meghan might have “two, maximum”.Fair enough, I thought. After all, she’s  now and,she’s lucky, Mother Nature might let her conceive one more before her womb shuts shop.But no, it seems the royal couple’s decision is to do with population growth, despite experts saying that, globally, the birthrate is shrinking and the real issue is how long we’re all living.So unless he’s planning to pack Granny off to Dignitas, there’s not much he can do about it. But I digress.Regarding royal babies and, in particular, Harry and Meghan’s sensitivity around their firstborn’s privacy, perhaps they should copy his cousin Zara.She and husband Mike Tindall have two daughters, Mia, five, and Lena, one. There’s no showboating or churlishness, they just give their daughters as normal a le as possible via picnics, getting muddy, painting faces and rough and tumble – as seen in thisdelightful photo of mischievous Mia hitching a ride on Dad’s back.They occasionally get photographed, but clearly accept that it’s just one of those things and don’t let it bother them. A parenting template to be admired, whoever you are.THE author Alex Elle once said: “I am very cautious of people whose actions don’t match their words.”In which case, let’s hope she wasn’t invited to the recent Google Camp party in Sicily which,you’re one of the self-regarding A-listers in attendance, was a high-minded gathering to discuss the issue of climate change.Or to the rest of us – a boondoggle for entitled fools. How  to describe an event attended by  of some of the world’s richest people who arrived on eco-unfriendly private jets and luxury yachts Oh, the unacknowledged irony. Meanwhile, Leona Lewis and ious other celebrities, who advocate gun control, happily took a shilling or three to attend the Austria-based party of Gaston Glock – one of the world’s most famous gun makers.But back to Google Camp where – and I can’t quite believe I’m writing this – residents and hotel guests near the archaeological site of Selinunte were told by police to avoid looking out of their windows to protect the privacy of the invited A-listers dining al fresco.The same slebs, one assumes, who regularly virtue signal their moral credentials by advocating a world without borders, where everyone should be treated the same . . . yada yada. If hypocrisy was a movie, they’d all be winning Oscars.SCHOOLBOY Jay Hughes, , was talking to a friend outside a chicken shop in South London when a van pulled up and three men armed with machetes jumped out.His friend ran off and escaped but Jay stood in the shop doorway, where -year-old Nyron Jean-Baptiste stabbed him before boasting, “I got one”, and leaving the scene.Jean-Baptiste has now been jailed for “le” – whatever that means these days – while poor Jay’s distraught mother Cindy has been condemned to a letime of painful loss.Another devastated mother, Linda Burke-Monerville, spoke last month about sending her remaining children back to Nigeria for safety after losing three of her sons to violent crime in the UK.What on earth is happening to this country  Entire communities feel they have been abandoned by the police while criminal gangs rule by fear – and no one in power seems to know what to do about it.New Home Secretary Priti Patel said this week that she is resolutely focused on restoring law and order to our streets via extra police officers with greater powers.Talk is cheap – particularly when uttered by the majority of politicians.

In winter there is nothing quite as satisfying as a steaming jam roly-poly with custard.Trle, my favourite, dates back  years. The word originally meant a light dessert, literally “a nothing”.But many desserts are disappearing from our menus.It’s not just the unfortunate overtones of roly–poly and spotted dick that are putting people off.Today, sugar, eggs, dairy and bread are out of fashion. People are opting for healthier desserts. Trendy cafes serve raw, dairy-free cakes.But I have to say “healthy dessert” is possibly the most disappointing combination of two words in the entire English language.Perhaps millennials are scared about the calories from eating out because of the growing pressure to look good on social media. If that’s the case, it’s very sad. Everything in moderation is fine.Processed food with lots of mysterious ingredients and high levels of salt and sugar is a very recent contrivance.Our grandparents ate ­simple, home-cooked meals made from fresh ingredients, and food was comparatively expensive, so people tended to eat smaller portions.Eat sensibly. You can enjoy sugar just as you might enjoy the occasional glass of wine.My kids love baking and making cakes is a great way to introduce them to cooking.Millennials are eating more fresh fruit, which is good. But food isn’t medicine. It should be something we look forward to and enjoy.Something that, eaten in moderation, will leave us feeling fully satisfied.

But things aren’t quite working out that way.While the UK economy is far from booming, it is holding up much better than those in the Eurozone. Figures released yesterday show Germany’s manufacturing sector contracted by . per cent in July and is now a shocking . per cent smaller than it was a year ago.Given the importance of manufacturing to the German economy, it is likely the whole economy is now heading for recession — a fate the country only narrowly avoided at the end of last year.In Italy, too, economic growth has ground to a halt again — after the country only just hauled itself out of last year’s recession. In France, growth in the past three months fell to . per cent.By contrast, our economy looks relatively perky, with growth of . per cent in the three months to May. Figures released on Monday showed a rebound in confidence in the dominant services sector.Of the large Eurozone countries, only Spain is currently outgrowing us — but Spain is still recovering after a very deep recession from which it emerged in . In common with Italy, the Spanish economy is still smaller than it was before the - banking crisis.Not that you will hear any of this from Remainers. Every time a car factory is earmarked for closure or a steelworks runs into problems, we hear no end of people saying, “We told you so”.All bad news in the UK economy is automatically attributed to Brexit — on the BBC, especially. What we don’t hear is that manufacturing industries, especially cars and steel, are suffering the same problems across Europe.Germany’s car industry is still reeling from the scandal of Volkswagen cheating in emissions tests by installing software to detect when a car was in test mode.On top of that comes the proposed switch from petrol and diesel to electric cars. Many motorists — myself included — have put off buying new vehicles because we don’t know what to get.We have been told new petrol and diesel cars will be banned from  and worry they might be taxed out of existence well before then. Yet electric cars are still prohibitively expensive and can’t travel nearly far enough between charges.As for the steel industry, all across Europe it is struggling to compete with cheap competition from China — especially since the trade war with the US forced Chinese exporters to search for new markets away from America.Of course,we end up with a No-Deal Brexit and tarfs are imposed on imports and exports between Britain and the EU, it will cause some disruption to trade. But it is wrong to assume Britain will come off worse. In truth, EU exporters have more to lose. Britain runs a huge trade deficit with the EU.In  we exported £billion worth of goods and services to other EU countries and imported £billion from them — a trade gap of £billion. Moreover, EU exports to Britain are concentrated in products that attract relatively high tarfs.Cars, for example, attract an EU import tarf of ten per cent. If Britain chooses to impose that levy in reverse after Brexit, it will cause further mayhem in the German car industry.We also have a high deficit in food — which under EU rules attracts average tarfs of  per cent. For dairy products, the average EU import tarf is  per cent. If our Government decides to impose this on imports from the EU, it will mean the end of quite a few French cheese producers.Of course, the EU can avoid damaging these export industries by agreeing to a trade deal with the UK — one that doesn’t include the hated Irish backstop.Nearly half of Irish food exports go to the UK. Irish exports to other EU countries would be deeply affected as so many rely on UK roads. If there are delays at ports, traffic between Ireland and the Continent will suffer twice over — once crossing the Irish Sea then crossing the English Channel.EU leaders want to punish Britain for voting to leave their sacred project. They fear thatBritain is seen to do well, other countries will want to leave. But playing hardball with Britain will do deep harm to their own export industries.Does German chancellor Angela Merkel want to suffer the wrath of her country’s car makers  Does French president Emmanuel Macron wish to anger winemakers already struggling with an economic downturn at home A hard Brexit could cost Denmark as much as one per cent in lost gross domestic product. Their former economy minister Simon Emil Ammitzboll calls Brexit “the most visible threat to the Danish economy”.Holland and Belgium calculate similar falls will hit their economies, with the Dutch losing ten billion euros by . In Spain, wages for unskilled youths are lower than they were in the late s. Youth unemployment is a huge problem. Even qualied youths face a lower annual salary than their counterparts a decade ago.The alternative to all this is for the EU to swallow a bit of pride and agree to keep free trade flowing, perhaps via a temporary deal while long-term arrangements are negotiated.It won’t take much. Just remove the backstop — really just an underhand way of trying to keep Britain in the straitjacket of EU regulations and trade barriers — and some kind of withdrawal agreement would almost certainly make it through the Commons.If not, then yes, British industry will suffer in some ways from No Deal. But the Eurozone economies already lagging behind will take the bigger hit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Destroy the union and scupper Brexit — Magic Grandpa doesn’t care.Butthis whole thing ends with Labour des- troying Brexit, the party will never be trusted again.Oh sure, it will still get the votes from the metropolitan, middle-class lefties. But its working-class base will desert it, for good.So the message for Magic Grandpa is very clear. Win your vote of confidence, lose your voters. He’s not the brightest of men, but I do hope he grasps this.And Boris  Keep straight ahead. Play as hardball as possible with Brussels, knowing they want a deal. Strike as many deals with the likes of the USA and Canada as possible.And remind Brussels thatwe walk away without a deal, they don’t get a single penny from us. That should help to concentrate their minds for a while.This has been revealed in a new report by researchers with too much time on their hands. What these men want, I think, is the best of both worlds.I used to have a girlfriend who spent all day long sitting on the roof of the shed. Then she’d dart out into the road after a thrush. She was great.Had a little bell around her neck. And did her business in a small tray by the back door.A WOMAN in East London said nasty things to someone taking part in a gay Pride march. She was wearing a niqab, so the lefties didn’t get too cross.Still, it is at last beginning to dawn on the woke liberals that the more fervently Muslim a person may be, the less likely it is that he or she will take kindly to people who have a knack for interior design and enjoy watching Mamma Mia!.This has put them in a bit of a quandary. Much as have those largely Muslim protests outside schools in the Midlands which insist on teaching kids how wonderful gay relationships might be.The same sort of quandary that affects feminists, who are not entirely convinced that a ft chap with a todger and a beard who wishes to be called “Loretta” in the name of gender freedom actually is a woman.This is the thing with identity politics, protected characteristics and so on. Tug gently on one of its threads and the whole thing begins to unravel like a pink mohair jumper knitted by an imbecile. HERE’S some consol­ation for you cricket fans, in despair at our Ashes defeat. Steve Smith, the man who did most of the damage, is at least HALF English.He’s got an English mum and has dual nationality.He used to play cricket for a team in Sevenoaks, in Kent.So what we should do is ide his run total down the middle – we get half, the Aussies get half.

They voted to leave the EU. The only problem, as we have since discovered, is that many MPs don’t share the Queen’s trust in the judgment of the British people. Rather than respect the decision, they have sought to overturn it.Given their lack of respect for the British people, it is perhaps not surprising to see their total lack of respect for our Monarch and our long political traditions. It is not the job of hard-Left politicians or Remainer MPs to decide what the Queen should or should not do.The only person from whom the Queen can take constitutionally binding advice is the Prime Minister. Should Boris Johnson lose a vote of no confidence then the Queen will be advised by her outgoing Prime Minister about who can or cannot command the confidence of the House of Commons.Further, as Prime Minister, it would be up to Mr Johnson to advise the Queen on whether to give Royal Assent to a Bill passed by the Commons and Lords blocking a No-Deal Brexit. It would be well within his rights to advise the Queen not to sign such a bill into law.Were Johnson to seek to remain after  days without calling an election, he would be breaking the law, and it would then be for the courts, not the Queen, to intervene.It is certainly possible in theory that the sovereign could be called upon to choose between two rival claims to form a government. However, this would be regarded as highly political and has not been done since .In reality, it is far more likely that the numbers in Parliament will tell us who does or does not have a majority, and that a general election will be called before getting the Queen involved.We all know what this is really about, though. The vote for Brexit was always destined to bring us to a constitutional crisis. It was the first moment in our country’s long and proud history when a majority of people outside of Parliament asked for something that a majority of people inside Parliament did not want to give.The right way through this mess is not to drag the Queen into politics but to deliver on the decision that was made by the British people more than three years ago.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She’s since become a celebrity chef in her own right.I recall that Alex brought her sheepish husband along with her that morning for her first appearance on live TV.Perhaps it was for moral support, but I reckon it was more likely to keep an eye on him. He did his best impersonation of a penitent man and they somehow managed to reheat the souffle.Of course, it didn’t last.They split up in  and that same year, Hollywood began his relationship with ex- barmaid Summer.Alex was convinced the affair began before they finally split but this was vehemently denied by both Paul and Summer.Paul and Alex, of course, are now orced. And he apparently faces an imminent court battle over cash.Alex could even end up with half her ex-husband’s ­estimated £million fortune.She is currently enjoying a holiday in France, where she was photographed looking chic, cool and effortlessly ­elegant.No one could fail to forgive her for feeling a bit smug that her ex has been so publicly dumped. After all, she had to bear her share of public humiliation over his behaviour.Meanwhile, it gets worse and worse for Paul, as inevitably there is now talk of ­Summer writing a book and appearing in a clutch of reality shows.She didn’t sign the NDA so is completely free to warble about their sex le and all sorts of potentially embarrassing revelationsshe wishes.So it looks like Paul is leaving Summer behind him and entering the autumn and winter of his le alone, with only himself to blame.I’ve just gobbled up the entire new BBC series Fosse Verdon about the hugely talented husband and we team who, among many other hits, gave us musicals Sweet Charity, Cabaret and Chicago.It’s gratying to see Broadway legend Gwen Verdon finally given the acclaim she deserves for the part she played in Bob Fosse’s success.He was a genius choreographer and director but also a notorious womaniser, chain-smoker, heavy drinker and pill popper.This series never shies away from Fosse’s sleazy side, showing how manipulative he could be – and his seduction of vulnerable young actresses and dancers is not easy to watch.We are light years from the #MeToo movement, and this series illustrates why we need it so much.Sam Rockwell plays a blinder as Fosse, but Michelle Williams is a revelation as Gwen Verdon.It’s as though the red-headed dancing star has been brought back to le.You know those stock responses you get after stating the bleedin’ obvious – about the Pope being Catholic and bears defecating in the woods.There is another one which I always thought was very callous.“Does Rose Kennedy own a black dress ”This is particularly unfeeling given the many tragedies visited upon the Kennedy clan – continuing right up to the present day.Theirs is a long litany of pain and suffering.Matriarch Rose endured the death of her eldest son Joe during World War Two, before the unimaginable ordeal of seeing two more sons publicly gunned down.First when John, as US President, was assassinated in . Then his younger brother Bobby, the former Attorney General turned senator and presidential candidate, was brutally slain in .The “Kennedy curse” has persisted through the decades.Twenty years ago, John F Kennedy Jnr, JFK’s only son, died while flying his light aircraft to the Massachusetts island of Martha’s Vineyard when it crashed into the ocean.In , Mary Kennedy, the estranged we of Robert Kennedy Jr – Bobby’s son – was found dead in her New York home, having apparently taken her own le.And this week, the family gathered for yet another tragic occasion.This time it was the funeral of Bobby’s -year-old granddaughter Saoirse Kennedy Hill, who died from a suspected overdose at the family compound in Cape Cod.Rose died in  aged .She was spared witnessing the deaths of some of the younger members of the family, including poor Saoirse.But after all she endured during her long le, she deserves a bit more respect and understanding than being the punchline to a weak joke.Whoever signed up Michelle Visage for Strictly Come Dancing deserves a pay rise.Michelle, right, one of the stars of the fabulous RuPaul’s Drag Race, will be a firecracker of an addition to Strictly. She’s sassy, sexy, ballsy and a real grafter.She has a wonderful dirty laugh and a terric outlook and she’ll seize this show by the throat.I’d have paid real money to have seen her reduce sacked former pro Brendan Cole to a whimpering jellyfish.It’s a huge shame that’s no longer a possibility, but bosses need to make sure Michelle is paired with a young, hungry dancer not afraid to take risks.There could perhaps be a chance for Kevin Clton to win two Glitterballs in a row after his success with Stacey Dooley last year.Kevin and Michelle could really burn up that dance floor and there would be no hanky panky from this loyal woman whose -year marriage to hubby David is rock solid.So no Strictly “curse”, but knowing Michelle, maybe rather a lot of Strictly cursing.Her big-heartedness remains undimmed even under the cruel shadow of Alzheimer’s, so it was no surprise that Dame Barbara Windsor used her nd birthday this week to demand more action to help fellow sufferers and their families.While other entertainers with long careers might have used their special day just to celebrate their achievements, Dame Barbara instead pleaded for us all to show compassion towards those with dementia, and for the Government to ensure more resources are made available.Barbara and her devoted husband Scott Mitchell have become ambassadors for the Alzheimer’s Society charity and have sent an open letter to Boris Johnson to sort out the care crisis that is making le so very hard for everyone affected by this disease.Now Boris might profess to being unafraid of all of the EU grandees as he tries to deliver Brexit, but he should be quaking in his boots at the prospect of the wrath of our Barbarahe doesn’t deliver vital help and money to those affected by dementia.More power to this incredible woman and how lucky she is to have Scott to take care of her because, sadly, not everyone dealing with dementia has such a devoted partner.They have both made a huge dference in raising awareness and much-needed cash.When this horrible disease is finally vanquished, and one day it must be, we will never forget the part Barbara and Scott played. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Revolutionary Guard officials released the short video in which it allegedly shows the Type- destroyer being pursued by their fast attack boats.Video footage seemingly shows a warship sailing in the distance while a group of smaller boats follow behind at a distance.The boats appear to be armed with machine guns.It is unclear whether the warship in the clip is actually HMS Duncan.One MP said “not in a thousand years” in response to the ship being the Royal Navy destroyer.HMS Duncan has been in the Strait of Hormuz for the past few weeks amid ongoing tensions between Britain and Iran.Type- destroyers have a distinctive silhouette due to their powerful orb-like SAMPSON tower radar – which is used to help fire the Sea Viper air defence missile system, reported Daily Star.The ship being chased in the video appears to lack this feature.James Heappey MP voiced his opinion on the matter, tweeting: “Not in a thousand years is that HMS Duncan.”Mr Heappey, an aide to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, then posting the hashtag #IRGCFail.Costing over £billion per ship, the ships vessels are equipped with missiles, a .-inch naval gun, marines and can carry two helicopters.The destroyer has been hailed as the world’s best air defence ship, and is the backbone of the Royal Navy.It comes as Iranian ships are posing as US or British warships and interfering with the GPS of oil tankers so they can seize them, officials have warned.A new alert has been issued to commercial ships in the Strait of Hormuz and Persian Gulf amid an escalating tanker row with Iran.US officials revealed vessels have reported “spoofed bridge-to-bridge communications” from unknown ships ly claiming to be US or coalition warships.Tensions with Iran have reached breaking point in the past few weeks, with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard seizing three tankers in a month.The latest warning listed a series of incidents involving Iran since May, including the seizure of the British-flagged Stena Impero on July .The detention and subsequent release of the Liberian-flagged MV Mesdar – within hours of the Impero – was also mentioned.US officials said vessels reported GPS interference during at least two recent encounters involving Iranian military forces.One vessel reportedly shut off its Automatic Identication Systembefore it was seized, complicating response efforts.The stark warning comes days after Iran seized a foreign tanker in the Gulf, in what would be the third such seizure in a month amid heightened tensions.The surprise attack was near tiny Farsi Island, half way between Iran and Saudi Arabia.The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps claim they seized the ship because it was carrying around , litres of smuggled fuel.Seven foreign crew members were arrested in the operation carried out last Wednesday night, said Fars news agency, which is considered close to the Guards.Tensions between arch-enemies Iran and the US have soared this year after Washington stepped up its campaign of maximum pressure against Tehran.Ships have been attacked, drones downed and oil tankers seized since May, a year after the US withdrew from a landmark nuclear deal between Iran.At the height of the crisis, US President Donald Trump called off air strikes against Iran at the last minute in June after the Islamic republics forces shot down a US drone.Boris Johnson ordered the Royal Navy to accompany all British-flagged vessels through the Strait of Hormuz in an escalation of the Iran crisis.The seizure of the latest tanker would be the third by Iran in less than a month in Gulf waters - a conduit for much of the worlds crude oil.On July , the Guards said they had detained the Panama-flagged for MT Riah for alleged fuel smuggling.And a day later, they announced they had impounded the British-flagged Stena Impero in the Strait of Hormuz for breaking international maritime rules.The seizure of the Stena Impero came two weeks after Royal Marines seized a supertanker believed to be carrying Iranian crude oil to Syria on July .The oil tanker Grace  was detained on suspicion it was breaking European sanctions by taking oil to Syria.Three Iranian boats also tried to seize a BP oil tanker as it passed through the Strait of Hormuz on Wednesday July .Royal Navy frigate HMS Montrose - which was escorting the tanker through the flashpoint region - was forced to sail in front of the boats.After quickly training its mm deck guns on the enemy boats, deploying its Wildcat helicopter and issuing a radio warning, the Iranian boats scarpered. HMS Duncan was then deployed to patrol the busy shipping lane as all UK flagged vessels were put on the highest security alert level.But an Iranian bomb boat was found in its path, meaning the HMS Duncan could have been destroyed by the unmanned attack ship packed with explosives, the Mirror reports.Iran had earlier been blamed for a series of devastating sea mine attacks on US-linked oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz.The Iranian republic has been squaring up to the West as it reels over the scrapping of the so-called nuclear deal by the US.Iran today unveiled its latest upgraded missile defence system which it brags can detect enemy missiles and drones from more than  miles away.The mobile Falaq radar installation is said to be an upgraded version of the current Gamma system, which military experts said was of Russian origin.The announcement comes at a time of rising tension between the Islamic republic and the United States."},{"url":null,"title":"brussels chiefs want showdown with boris but order him to

Theresa May’s hated deal.He has previously warned thatthe EU dont budge on getting rid of the backstop, it will be their choice to push Britain out of the bloc without an agreement by October .The backstop, which would come into playa future trading arrangement falls short of keeping the border open, has been the main stumbling block on Brexit negotiations.However, Andreeva said it was not the

The outcome on the table is the best deal possible and I dont think that there is any fault or blame to be looked for in this.“We just simply expect the UK to live up to its commitment to avoiding a hard border while protecting Irelands place in the internal market.”However, despite Andreeva saying the EU was open to meeting Boris, the bloc’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said there will be no new deal.But Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay called on EU leaders to give Barnier the mandate to re-broker an agreement, otherwise no-deal is coming down the tracks.Mr Barnier needs to urge EU leaders to consider thisthey too want an agreement, to enable him to negotiate in a way that finds common ground with the UK. Otherwise, No Deal is coming down the tracks, Barclay wrote in the Mail on Sunday.It is our firm view that Irish border issues should be dealt with in talks on the future agreement between the UK and the EU -- where they should always have been -- and were ready to negotiate in good faith on this basis.The backstop, which would come into playa future trading arrangement falls short of keeping the border open, has been the main stumbling block in the Brexit talks and one of the reasons why Britains parliament rejected the deal three times.Johnson has vowed to get rid of the backstop and the new government has taken a hard line with the EU, saying it was turbo-boosting preparations for a no-deal Brexitthe bloc fails to agree alternative arrangements for the border.Barclay said officials were working on those arrangements.We have already started work across Whitehall to find the solutions, and they can and will be found, in the context of the free trade agreement we will negotiate with the EU after October , he wrote."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit buckingham palace downing street talks labour","story":"Palace officials have been holding talks with Downing Street in a bid to avoid a constitutional crisis.Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill and Edward Young, the Queens private secretary, are said to have been holding talks over the past few days.Labour chief John McDonnell has threatened to “drag” the Queen into BrexitBoris Johnson refuses to quit as PM in case of a no confidence vote.Buckingham Palace will not confirm whether political matters would see her comeback from Balmoral, reports Sky News.However, she delayed  her holiday two weeks ago to appoint Boris at the palace - showing how seriously she takes constitutional matters.The PM has vowed to take Britain out of the EU “do or die” by October .Tory rebels and Labour remainers want a vote of no confidence well before this deadline so they can block any chance of a No Deal scenario.ButJohnson ignores the result of a poll, as he is expected to, remainers could plunge the country into a constitutional crisis by asking for the Queen to intervene.Her Majesty is not due back from holiday until October but MPsfrom recess by September  – meaning the monarch could be called home early.Her Majesty famously stays away from matters in Westminster and is careful to be “above politics”,The only person the Queen can take constitutionally binding advice is the Prime Minister.Should Boris Johnson lose a vote of no confidence then the Queen will be advised by her outgoing PM about who can or cannot command the confidence of the House of Commons.It would also be up to Boris to advise the Queen on whether to give Royal Assent to a Bill passed by the Commons and Lords blocking a No-Deal Brexit.It would be well within his rights to advise the Queen not to sign such a bill into law.Were Johnson to seek to remain after  days without calling an election, he would be breaking the law, and it would then be for the courts, not the Queen, to intervene.Earlier this week Shadow Chancellor McDonnell said Labour would “take over”Johnson ignored the results of a no confidence vote.And his party would send leader Jeremy Corbyn to Buckingham palace “in a cab”.He also threatened to jail Tory MPs over benefits cutsthe party ever comes to power.McDonnell said: “I don’t want to drag the Queen into this but I would be sending Jeremy Corbyn in a cab to Buckingham Palace to say we’re taking over.”Former Tory leader Iain ­Duncan Smith told the Daily : “They will effectively arrive toting their guns.

Seven-year-old Cameron Wahid, of East Grinstead, West Sussex, went into anaphylactic shock after having spaghetti containing dairy products on a family holiday in Sorrento, Italy, in . Dad Riz, who now lives in Dubai, said: To tweet about what someone  has is totally unecessary. In terms of the point that heaposs asking people to tell them beforehand, I get that. But then to turn it into a bit of mockery on Twitter, itaposs just uncalled for. The words he chose could have been a lot more sophisticated. He added: Itaposs a stupid tweet, itaposs a naive tweet. Obviously I think he needs to sit down with some people who go through very hard times or people with allergies so he understands their le.  And Julianne Ponan, , whose severe allergies inspired her to set up Creative Nature Superfoods, which offers products free from additives, nuts and seeds, slammed the chef. She said: You canapost change your allergies. I think itaposs awful that someone would so dismissive and publicly shame someone over their intolerances. I already feel like an inconvenience when I have to inform restaurants about my multiple allergies, I donapost expect the chef to then tweet about it.  Especially when youaposre going out for a really nice restaurant, they should be able to accommodate you without making a fuss about it on social media. On Twitter, the official account for Chez Bruce, in Wandsworth, southwest London, added: “One has sympathies for guests with allergies food intolerances. “But handing us a list like this without prior notice is hardly the most sensible way of ensuring that we are able to do our best to cater for them. “Good luck with that in most other restaurants!”  In response to the chefaposs post, Andrew Stevenson tweeted: “While I sympathise with people with real allergies and intolerances, this looks like silly faddiness and just trying to make your le dficult. “And I find it dficult to believe that theyaposre allergic to tomatoes, but are ok with potatoes and aubergines.”And a Twitter account run for posh pub Abbot’s Elm, in Abbots Ripton, Cambridegshire, scathingly dubbed it “attention seeking.”But on Twitter, Julie Andrews added: As someone with multiple GENUINE le threatening food allergiesthis is worrying. And Freya said: This looks like a list from someone who might be struggling with an inflammatory bowel condition. While some advance notice should absolutely be given it’s a real shame to see so much mockery and lack of understanding in the comments.  Holborn Dining Roomaposs executive chef Calum Franklin said diners needed to ring ahead so kitchens could prepare. He said: I think my major problem with this is the unannounced part of it. “If you have this many allergies honestly it must be really c*** and I do really feel sorry for you but help restaurants out with a bit of pre warning and they will look after you so well. “Just dropping it on the night causes havoc in kitchens, which are usually set up to deal with a couple of allergies and options but this many makes things complicated and affects the experience of everyone around you as chefs scramble around trying to create a new menu for you. If you are then rude to the staff whilst they are trying to accommodate these requests in the middle of a full service thataposs pretty inconsiderate and you need to do a bit of one on one mirror time in the morning. “We often get emails from guests who have lists longer than this and do you know what, we enjoy planning a menu for them. “Itaposs a challenge and we want to make sure they feel very well looked after but thataposs only possible with a bit of notice.”    After removing his tweets this morning, Mr Christmas added: Deleted my allergy tweet. For the record I just wished to highlight the benefit of letting restaurants know in advance of any dietary requirements, that way we can better look after you on the day with more options. I have the utmost respect for diners with genuine allergies. Also, when I said anyone would struggle to deal with it professionally, I meant with the standards of hospitality that we endeavour to deliver to every guest, in no way was it a reference to the preparation of the food.

During a year in hospital waiting for a suitable donor organ, Esme thought of all the things she would love to do, from visiting Disneyland to riding a horse.And since finally going home last August, she has set about completing them. Mum Lisa Mallett said: “Esme was in hospital for over a year waiting. Every day we’d add to our list of what she’d do when she finally got out. “Turning those dreams into reality has been the most le-affirming journey for us all.”  Last week Esme celebrated her fth birthday surrounded by friends and family – marking a full year of her new le. She was born with aortic stenosis, a narrowing of the aorta which restricts blood flow to the heart. That left the organ so scarred she developed cardiomyopathy, with the left side no longer able to pump blood. As well as needing a new heart, Esme then developed pneumonia followed by parainfluenza. She was eventually transferred to London’s Great Ormond Street Hospital, where she was kept alive with an external Berlin heart. Lisa, , recalled: “Every day it felt like we could lose her – she was in intensive care before she had the Berlin heart fitted, needing  hours of surgery.”  Even the lesaving device came with risks. “I saw three children with a Berlin heart have strokes,” said Lisa.  “Some children never recover, and while we never told Esme, we feared the worst.” Uncannily, Esme herself appeared to predict when her transplant would come. She had been given a doll with a Berlin heart, which the child gets to remove after their own surgery. Esme took it out and told mum Lisa and dad Kevin: “She’s had her transplant now, we can go home.” The next day Esme told Kevin she was going get her heart – and minutes later a transplant nurse arrived to give the family the news they had waited for.  Yet it was a moment of heartache too, for the family knew too well the tragedy that must lie behind a donor organ being found. Sixteen years earlier, Lisa had donated her own daughter Jadene’s heart valves to save another le, after the -month-old suffered an unexpected fit in the bath and died. “I knew how bittersweet it would be to hear that news,” said Lisa. “Behind our joy was a family who’d had to say goodbye to their child and make the hardest decision possible –nothing , I wanted the months and years after Esme left hospital to be a thank you to them, to that family who had given us the ultimate gt.”  Days after the op in July last year, Esme celebrated her fourth birthday. Lisa said: “We were visited on the ward by her Disney favourites, Belle and Moana. Having been in isolation for so many months, she’d constantly said how when she got out she would meet Moana – it was a dream come true for her. Seeing the smile on Esme’s face I knew this was the start of our new le. “I gave Kevin the biggest hug ever and told him we’d make every day special for our amazing girl.”  The next month the family, who live in Reading, ticked the next item off Esme’s list – Disneyland Paris. Lisa explained: “We couldn’t fly for  months so Florida wasn’t on the cards, but Paris was just as magical. “All the characters she had watched endlessly on her iPad in hospital were suddenly real. We went on so many rides, met all the princesses and she went swimming for the first time.” In October Esme learned to ride a bike. Lisa said: “She was so determined, she had zero fear – once she was going I couldn’t get her off it.”  The following month she went to the park for the first time in her le, and in December she did a Santa Dash run with dad Kevin to raise money for GOSH – the hospital that had turned her le around. Then in January the family were able to welcome two puppies, both German Shepherd- Border Collie crosses, called Max and Belle. Lisa said: “All Esme wanted to do was lie down and cuddle them. “Seeing her fall asleep with her two best friends was heart-melting.” While in hospital, Esme had lost mobility after being ventilated for  weeks before her Berlin heart was fitted. Physios had used Pets As Therapy dogs to get her back on her feet. Lisa said: “Ever since, she’d said we’d have dogs when she got home.”  February saw Esme enjoy her first ever trip to the seaside, at Milford on Sea, in Hampshire, then in March she held a snake when the family went to Longleat. Proud Lisa said: “She basically became completely fearless. I wouldn’t go near the snake while she stroked it.” The next month another of Esme’s dreams came true when she learned to ride a horse at stables near Oxford. In May, she went ice skating for the first time, then in June she finally started her reception year at school. And she rounded off her remarkable year last month by celebrating her th birthday – complete with piñata, water slide and a princess cake. Army veteran Kevin, , said: “It was the most emotional day imaginable. “So many times we thought we’d lose her – for to be here now with a clean bill of health and a new heart… words can’t describe the joy.” Lisa added: “I just wish the family who donated the heart could have been here with us for Esme’s big day. “She’d have shown them her dogs, whizzed down the water slide and shown them tricks on her bike. “Nobody cherishes le as much a family given a second chance.” "},{"url":null,"title":"incredible new dog charity first","story":"AdvertorialWhy incredible new dog charity - the first of its kind in UK - could be set for huge cash prizeThe Brainy Dogs scheme is a finalist in the th Birthday National Lottery AwardsShareByAlex LloydDave Masters:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG AdvertorialBrainy Dogs is run by the charity Headway Suffolk\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRESCUE dogs are being trained by vulnerable adults and teens to become canine companions for people with brain injuries. The Brainy Dogs scheme has created more than  le-changing new friendships to date, while giving offenders the chance to learn new skills. Now the National Lottery-funded project, the only one of its kind in the UK, is a finalist in the th Birthday National Lottery Awards, where you can help choose the winners. Brainy Dogs, which is run by the charity Headway Suffolk, is expanding to include one-to-one pet therapy sessions for clients who are not suitable for a companion dog and care home visits.  It is also offering people on probation, veterans, those with mental health problems and children excluded from school opportunities to train the animals. Headway Suffolk chief executive Helen Fairweather says: “Companion dogs can make a real dference to someone who is living with a neurological condition. “Their disabilities can often be hidden and may leave them with a personality change or dficulties that mean they lose friends and their families struggle to support them. “A dog can fill this void and provide help, comfort and confidence as they attempt to navigate le.” The charity boss came up with the unique scheme after reading a book about an assistance dog who aided the recovery of a brain-injured man and then watching a programme about prisoners in Australia training dogs. She realised that many of the people Headway works with could benefit from a similar furry friend. Many are not eligible to receive a dog from other charitable organisations as they are not regarded as having adequate need. Helen teamed up with Blue Cross Felixstowe and HMP Hollesley Bay in Suffolk for a one-year pilot in  and the concept has gone from strength to strength, receiving a £, grant from the National Lottery last year to expand. Brainy Dogs Coordinator Sophie Wellum-Mayes says training is inidual to each dog and client, taking around eight weeks.  Volunteer trainers gain work experience, le skills and improved confidence, along with improving the futures of the dogs and their new owners. She says: “The dogs calm clients in a way humans cannot. They do not judge and for many people, this is a rare feeling. “We have been told that the dogs are a leline, they have stopped a couple of clients from ending their lives. “They get people out into social networks, give them a sense of normality and something in common with others. There are similar emotional and confidence benefits for the trainers too.” The National Lottery Awards are an annual celebration of the UK’s best National Lottery-funded projects, with this year marking  years since the first draw. The winners will receive £, towards their extraordinary work and appear on a star-studded BBC One show in November. Voting is now open in five categories.

Bryan Adams later ­recorded Summer of ‘, with the words, “I’d always wanna be there Those were the best days of my le”. It seemed like the long glorious summer of love and freedom would never end. Fate had other ideas, and the signs were already there... The Isle of Wight pop festival – Britain’s answer to Woodstock – inspired a generation of music lovers. But The Beatles, icons of the decade, were falling apart. This razzmatazz summer is remembered for the Moon landing, not for a fatal fallout between Labour premier Harold Wilson and the unions. America was still a beacon of hope, but the murder of Sharon Tate and her unborn child by the Charles Manson gang revealed its dark side.    In Northern Ireland, the civil rights movement was growing, but a loyalist backlash was about to spark  bloody years of the ­Troubles. And it was when the first stirrings of revolt were felt among the nation’s badly treated coal miners, leading to the insurrectionary Great Strike for Jobs  years later. All the ingredients of the grim s and the Thatcherite revolution of the following decade were there,only we could have seen them. I was there, and I didn’t. And supposedly wiser men than me failed to grasp the shting of the tectonic plates right under our feet. We paid for our myopia. Butnot “the best”, they were good days all right. I was the London-based industrial correspondent of the Sheffield Morning , working my notice to join The Times. Fleet Street was still jumpin’: boisterous and hard-drinking, asthe magic roundabout would never stop. We were living in a rented semi in Kingsbury, in North West London, on the Bakerloo line, which ran by the bottom of our garden. Our daughters had just started primary school. I was earning £,. A year, not a month. Obviously, le was a lot cheaper, too. Some of it, at any rate.    Beer was p a pint, a loaf of bread cost p. Wine was a quid a bottle, whisky less than £, and fags p for . The average house cost £, – but double that in the capital. The average car cost £,. We had neither, and we didn’t even have a proper stove but we had finally got a telly. Black and white. We illegally sub-let the upstairs to two lads from the now-defunct London Evening News. And we still had parties. High summer had started so well. The ­nation was gripped by the splendour of Prince Charles’s investiture as Prince of Wales in ­Caernarfon castle. Months later, he began his affair with Camilla – long before meeting Diana. Under legendary manager Don Revie, Leeds United had won the football league for the first time, six points ahead of Liverpool, with iconic players such as Bremner, Charlton, Hunter, Giles, Gray and Lorimer in the side, and across the city Leeds were also the rugby league champions.  The Beatles made their famous photocall walk over a pedestrian crossing in Abbey Road. They were on their way to recording their last album together – the end of a musical era. They sang “Come Together” but they were drting apart.From across the Atlantic, Richard Nixon made history with the first visit by a US president to a communist country – Romania, groaning under the heel of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, a  start to international detente. On August , cult leader Manson and his drug-crazed gang murdered five people, including Roman Polanski’s eight-months pregnant we Sharon Tate, in her Los Angeles home, a crime that reverberates today. A few days later, Mick Jagger was accidentally shot while filming the biopic of outlaw Ned Kelly in Australia. He survived, unlike Rolling Stones founder Brian Jones, who had died mysteriously weeks before in a Sussex farmhouse swimming pool. Mick and Marianne Faithfull didn’t attend the funeral, claiming their contracts permitted no delay in their travel Down Under. On the th, British troops were deployed for the first time in Northern Ireland. It was to be “a limited operation” of  soldiers of the Ist Battalion, Prince of Wales’s Own Regiment of ­Yorkshire, to restore law and order in the rioting area of Bogside, Derry.  At first, they were cheered in the streets by Catholic residents, but the mood swtly changed and the Provisional IRA began a war of terror that was to cost , lives, more than half of them civilians. British politicians lethally ­underestimated the powerful tribal, religious and secessionist forces at work. There are still , British soldiers in the province, down from a peak in the s of ,. Over the pond, it was music mayhem. On the th, , young people attended Woodstock in New York to hear Ravi Shankar, Joan Baez, the Grateful Dead , Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin. Three days later, a fan died from heroin overdose, an occurrence that would become all too familiar. On the st, legendary boxer Rocky Marciano died in a plane crash over Iowa, on the eve of his th birthday. These were the events that hit the ­headlines. Under the radar, Henry ­Kissinger began secret talks in Paris to end the Vietnam War. They soon foundered. This was the month of the first US Army mutiny in the long conflict, a harbinger of what was to come. It was hushed up.  Here at home, Harold Wilson was at ­loggerheads with the unions over Employment Secretary Barbara Castle’s notorious In Place of Stre proposals to curb their powers. Labour was determined to stamp out unofficial ­stoppages, which accounted for % of strikes, widespread at that time. But fiery Mrs Castle – married to Mirror journalist Ted Castle – faced hardline ­opposition not just from union leaders but from rebel Labour MPs led by ambitious Home Secretary Jim Callaghan, lining up his bid to become Prime Minister. The Government caved in to a face-saving deal, Programme for Action, a “solemn and binding” agreement to curtail walkouts and inter-union disputes. It was approved by delegates assembling for the annual Trades Union Congress in ­Portsmouth that month.I was there for that, too Isle of Wight festival . It was an anti-climax. The TUC’s reform programme – derided as Solomon Binding – failed to halt industrial unrest, and the fiasco of the brothers and sisters embroiled in a bitter civil war ­contributed greatly to Edward Heath’s Tory victory in the general election nine months later. Again, a portent that was missed. The lesson of ministerial weakness was not lost on Britain’s coal miners, who were becoming more militant by the day. The National Union of ­Mineworkers had just lodged a claim for shorter hours for low-paid surface workers. They were often older men unable to work or those who had been injured. There were even women – “pit brow lasses” – working on the screens, sorting coal from slag, often in the coldest of conditions. This was the dispute that invented Arthur Scargill, and set the pattern for the future. Militants in the coalfields spent this month working on the first rolling all-out strike in the state-owned industry since . It was unofficial, but the NUM moderate leaders were elbowed aside and by the autumn, , men were out in Yorkshire, the Midlands, South Wales and Scotland. The strike ended when Lord Robens, chairman of the National Coal Board and a crafty former Labour politician, conceded in full the union’s annual pay claim for all miners: s d a week.

Obviously he didnapost reply to that message. Keith, who works as a civil servant, said there were no clues that his son had been upset before the night out. He added: He had obviously been drinking heavily and had got upset, but that is not unusual for someone of his age and is typical student behaviour and just part of growing up. But you would usually just wake up the next day with a hangover and it be forgotten. I just donapost know why he did it.  I donapost knowhe had had something on his mind and after having alcohol it had pushed him over the edge.

Beto O’Rourke reckons the racist El Paso Walmart massacre happened because Donald Trump has “dehumanised” those who are dferent to the majority of Americans. O’Rourke, who is fighting for the right to go up against Trump in next year’s election, said: “What America needs is hope, not hate. “Donald Trump has dehumanised or sought to dehumanise those who do not look like or pray like the majority here in this country. “What happened in El Paso is not an isolated incident. “After the President warned of ­caravans, you had somebody go into the Tree of Le synagogue in Pittsburgh warning of caravans.    “You had the mosque in Victoria, Texas, burned to the ground on the day President Trump signed his executive order to ban Muslim travel to the United States. So there are very real consequences to his words, to the tweets, to the racism that he fans. “He’s not the source of racism in this country. This country has been racist as long as it’s been a country, but he is certainly fanning the flames, he is certainly making violence like this more possible and more real.” Mr O’Rourke thanked the Mirror for its support in the fight against racism. “Together, we can and must defeat hate.” Earlier last week Mr O’Rourke was askedTrump was a “white supremacist”, to which he replied “yes”. The Irish-American was virtually unknown until he challenged Republican heavyweight Ted Cruz for the Texas Senate seat last year. Although he did not win, Mr O’Rourke almost unseated Cruz – which is unthinkable in the deeply conservative state.    So great is the congressman’s threat, Trump this week turned his attacks on him in the wake of last Saturday’s Walmart massacre. Mr O’Rourke has emerged as possible White House contender as a Mirror investigation discovered a surge in those prepared to commit murder and mayhem. It is a concern shared by millions including Melany de la Rosa. The -year-old makes the short walk along the Stanton Street Bridge border crossing, where for at least the next eight hours she feels safe. Getting up at am, she leaves her home in one of the world’s most violent cities, Ciudad Juarez, for one of America’s safest, El Paso. Despite Trump’s rhetoric about the perils from Mexico along the border, El Paso was one of America’s least murderous and secure places to live. But the facts did not deter Trump from using the Texas city for his political means. In February, during his State of the Union address, he said “the border city of El Paso used to have extremely high rates of violent crime... one of our nation’s most dangerous cities” until, he said, a border fence was built.  The lie put America’s “Safe City” in the crosshairs of hate. Last week, Patrick Crusius, , drove  miles to target the Hispanic community there. He turned into a Walmart packed with , Saturday shoppers before taking out an AK--style assault rle and selecting who should live or die. In total, he killed  people. Witnesses said he spared white shoppers as he hunted for Latinos. “I used to think I was safe in El Paso,” accountant Melany said. “The drug cartels rule Juarez, murders there are part of everyday le. When I was at work, I knew I was safe, but now it feels like we are the hunted in this city.” She believes it is because of one man – the President. The Walmart shooter is said to have published a manesto that states the attack targeted Hispanics and characterises immigrants as “invaders”. The document was reportedly posted to online forum chan, which is widely used by white supremacist “accelerationists”, who believe such mass shootings will collapse society and allow them to rebuild the all-white world they dream of.Manestos written by the suspects in shootings carried out in Christchurch, New Zealand, and Poway,Calornia, were also posted there."},{"url":null,"title":"prince andrews party paedo pal","story":"NewsPrince Andrew was guest of honour at party with paedo pal Jeffrey EpsteinWoody Allen also reportedly attended the dinner at billionaire Epstein’s New York mansion where the Duke of York was guest of honourShareByChristopher Bucktin:,  JUL Updated:,  AUG NewsPrince Andrew and Jeffrey Epsteins friendship dates back to the early s \"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPrince Andrew partied with paedophile pal Jeffrey Epstein just after his release from jail.

A source told the Daily Beast website: “Epstein and Andrew were not there to begin with, then the doors were flung open, and they made their entrance.  “They were both charmless, they looked like bored people who wanted to be entertained.” The source said Epstein called the prince “Andy” and was “clearly confident” in his company. “He wanted to show how comfortable he was in his presence, and make clear that while he was a guest of honour, he was a regular, routine and repeat guest,” they added. “Epstein, Andrew, and Ghislaine were a trio, a party within the party, the insiders among the other guests.”  Another attendee said: “There were a lot of ugly old men, with Prince Andrew in the middle of it all. We left pretty quickly.” Epstein, who was last week charged with underage sex trafficking offences, was reportedly introduced to the prince in the s by Ghislaine Maxwell. At the time she was the American’s girlfriend. The party came two months after the engagement of Prince William to Kate Middleton. Sources said the main topic of conversation was the upcoming wedding of the future Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

We know that as a team.“But you ask for a reaction and you ask for character – that was there in abundance in the second half.“I thought the two boys, McDaid and Todd, coming on did really well and we looked more of a threat.“Looking back at the game now it was a game of two halves — a cliche I know — but it probably ended up a fair result.“Near the end I thought we might nick it, too.“Both McDaid and Todd have been in the mix. I like both of them, and Jamie Ness is back in the mix now, too.“It’s healthy we have him back and healthy we have those two pushing for places. That adds to the squad.”So, what are the possibilities for the Dens gaffer against Ian McCall’s Honest Men Despite an error for the second goal at Dunfermline, Jack Hamilton is the undisputed No  goalie at the club and will almost certainly retain his spot ahead of second-choice Calum Ferrie.After seeing the three-man backline perform well in a commanding performance against Inverness in the Betfred Cup the match previous, it’s clear the same line-up didn’t work at Dunfermline.Every game is dferent but should McPake switch to a back four, that’ll obviously see one centre-half drop out.The knock picked up by skipper Josh Meekings and his injury history make him favourite to miss out.Andrew Davies is nowhere near match fitness so that leaves Jordon Forster and Jordan McGhee as central defenders for this one.At full-back, Jordan Marshall did OK and will likely continue, as will Cammy Kerr on the right, though he didn’t have his best night at East End Park.A shake-up in defence would bring another midfielder into play and with McDaid, Todd and Ness all banging on the door for a starting spot, McPake has decisions to make. Young Finn Robertson has been excellent so far this campaign but his youthfulness may see him replaced by the more experienced Ness for this one.Paul McGowan and Shaun Byrne are key players but,Dundee go to a -- that’s likely to see one miss out – or McGowan moved further upfield.On the wings, McDaid and Todd may have done enough to earn their starting spurs.Danny Johnson’s three goals in two matches make him almost certain to start. Less certain is Andrew Nelson’s place after he was replaced at half-time on Friday, however.Injury and illness have hampered Craig Curran lately, though he is expected to be fit for Saturday.McGowan in behind Johnson could be McPake’s pick for this big early-season clash."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/10/5bb72b7a2643d-e1538733701970.jpg ","title":"dundee united coach mcculloch wants to keep momentum going against partick","story":"Assistant boss Lee McCulloch wants to see Dundee United gain some momentum by recording their second Championship win inside a week at Partick Thistle tonight.However, to do so, they’ll first have to snuff out the threat of a man he knows very well in veteran striker Kenny Miller.The pair worked on opposite sides of Tannadice Street in the final months of last season while Miller was at Dundee but, for years before that, they were team-mates at Rangers.From that time together, Lee knows, even at , the former Scotland striker is a force to be reckoned with.“Kenny is a threat. I played with him for years and years, and I know how good a player he was then. He’s still got that burst of pace, he’s still got the movement, the mentality and he is a leader on the pitch,” he said.“It’s going to be dficult to keep him quiet but we’ve got ways and means to do that. I think his attitude has been spot-on all through his career. I think he’s maybe changed his game a wee bit since he’s got older but he’s still very effective. He’s one of a number of danger men they have.”This week has seen talk of financial crisis at Thistle, who cancelled their team bus for last weekend’s opener at Alloa.They’ve also seen lottery winner Colin Weir withdraw his seven-figure backing.Whatever the repercussions, Lee knows, with the likes of Miller in their dressing-room, come the kick-off tomorrow, the Jags players will only be concentrating trying to get three points.“I think that’s the mentality their players will need to show. I don’t know what’s going on there, we just need to concentrate on ourselves, get ourselves ready,” he said.United, meanwhile, are relaxed over their young talent being tracked by a string of clubs down south.Although they declined to comment on the matter, there has been contact from Crystal Palace who were willing to pay £, for Scott Banks.That was never close to their valuation and, right now, there is no need to sell any player.The likes of Louis Appere and Logan Chalmers have also been watched in recent weeks but they are very much seen as part of the future plans at Tannadice."},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-can-recognise-anyone-old-pictures-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Times."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-can-recognise-old-pictures-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Times"},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-elvis-presley-visits-prestwick-airport-pictures-glasgow-39-s-history","story":"A selection of images from the archives of the Herald and Times."},{"url":null,"title":"plans-dentist-beauticians-pharmacy-bishopbriggs","story":"An empty retail area in Bishopbriggs could get a new lease of le, possibly bringing a new dental practice, pharmacy and beauty salon,councillors approve a planning application."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-leading-way-planet-saving-meat-free-movement","story":"GLASGOW is leading the way in encouraging the public to eat less meat as a new report warns lsquodrastic changesrsquo in human diet are needed to safeguard the planet."},{"url":null,"title":"report-reveal-extent-chemical-exposure-coatbridge-schools","story":"THE findings of a review into a school campus at the centre of health and safety concerns will be published later."},{"url":null,"title":"st-ambrose-buchanan-high-school-pupils-return-review-finds-blue-water-site-safe","story":"A school campus where parents had pulled their children from over health concerns has been deemed safe after an independent review."},{"url":null,"title":"volunteers-wanted-work-glasgow-tennis-tournament-named-murray-family","story":"Tennis Scotland have launched a drive for volunteers to work at a prestigious Glasgow tournament."},{"url":null,"title":"nina-taylor-cohabiting-couples-cost-separation","story":"Letrsquos cohabit.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

Day one saw us head out from Carloway aboard the SYSAC II under the watchful eye of skippper Robbie Bell who knows these waters like the back of his hand.The day kicked off with a bait hunt in the East Loch but the mackerel were pretty scarce, it took an hour or so to fill the baskets before steaming out to the two-mile mark in search of spurdogs. By then there was a fair wee wind picking up and it was a tad rough to say the least, with the heavy swell claiming a few breakfasts along the way.All that was soon forgotten as the battle commenced with the mighty spurs. The action started on the first drop with some thumpers coming aboard, single and double shots causing mayhem thrashing about the deck and we lost count of the number of rigs sliced through on the way up. But that’s what we came for, not everyone’s choice but great sport all the same.In between the madness we picked away at the haddock, whiting, grey and red gurnard, ling and pollack, until we had our quota and decided to seek the smoother waters of East Loch Roag for some flattie bashing on the soft ground. It was good to get into the calm and fish the light gear, picking away for dabs and plaice. There was plenty around, nothing huge but a steady flow coming aboard taking us to the end of the day with a good mixed bag of species.Day two set off in brilliant sunshine and not a breath of wind, it was almost tropical conditions. We quickly got our supply of fresh bait in West Loch Roag and set off for the rough ground in search of a few more species, but there was little or no drt so we took a turn into Clf Bay and settled in for a day on the rays. It was brilliant fun, everyone got their fair share with loads of thornback rays and a few spotted rays coming aboard, plenty of dabs, plaice, dogfish and a bonus lb oz turbot to add to the tally. It was a great opportunity to brush up on some of fishing techniques that don’t get practised much at home.We decided to hit the hard ground on the way back to the harbour. It was quite slow, maybe a wee bit early yet, but it produced more haddock, a lovely lb cuckoo wrasse and pollack bringing our two day adventure to an end. All in all another excellent club trip.This year we picked up  species,  counting fish and a few personal bests. Add to that, great company, loads of banter, a good skipper who makes a mean cup o’ tea and you have the ideal ingredients for another memorable few days away on Lewis. We’ll be back next year for sure.Results: Nikki Thompson  points, Robert MacBrayne , Nick Friel , Jim Smith , Gary Sinclair , Steven MacBrayne ."},{"url":null,"title":"mach1 scottish tarmack rally championship report","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWith  starters and  Cobble shop STRC registered the championship tables were always going to change on this mid-season two day event.Sunshine was forecast for the Machrihanish Airbase Community Companycourse and that’s what was delivered. Some crews were hoping for rain but this year it wasn’t to be. Last year’s winner Bruce Edwards in the Darrian T GTR was favourite and since Bruce had not driven the car competitively since Mach   we all thought he would be a bit rusty.Bruce led from the start and set some impressive times throughout the two days but on the last stage he threw it all away and rolled the car as he clipped a large lorry tyre a mile from the finish line, unable to right the car and with the stage blocked the clerk of the course decided on the grounds of safety to cancel the final stage. This allowed Alistair Inglis in the lotus Exige and a previous Mach  winner to clinch the top spot.Class  had  STRC registered this year and new to class  was Tom Blackwood in the gorgeous yellow and Black Fiesta R+. Tom#s first event driving in anger and showed that with some tweaks here and there with suspension settings it’s a great car to drive. How well the car drives notwithstanding, there was a slight moment coming out of one of the tight sections onto the main runway when Tom ran wide and clipped a boundary fence damaging the front bumper of the car but kept the fence intact. Tom finished third Overall and second in class .John Rintoul in another Fiesta R on the back of the recent win at Crail was on it all weekend but just couldn’t clinch the win this year, John finished second overall and took the class win.Alan Wallace in the distinctive green and white Mitsubishi Evo finished a very well deserved th overall and third in class. Harry Chalmers was a Mach  virgin and loved every mile of the venue. Harry commented at the end of the event they we had no problems at all on day one and the car ran faultlessly all day to give him a real confidence boost to push on harder and let him get used to some new parts on the car. Harry kept it neat all day and came away with rd overall after day one.Day two was very fast. Fastest he’s probably been in the car to date with these faster stages suiting faster cars Harry just had to push on brake late and keep it tidy and with that being said the team dropped to th overall due to some of the quicker cars retiring out.Harry said: #I couldn’t be happier for how this event turned out for the team and are all delighted with the result and how far they have come.#Harry also managed the full two days on the same Hankook Tyres Finishing th overall.Alan Stark in the stunning Red Mitsubishi Evo had decided he was playing the long game and would drive accordingly. The plan went well and they played about with tyres trying to make them last for the two days. On the second last stage on the Saturday the manold gasket started to blow and he lost a fair bit of power mid stage. The service crew managed to bolt it up again but the long stages were killing it and it usually faded about  rds in each time.On Sunday he decided to push on a bit and of course it bit him. The interior mirror fell off and he became aware there was a car coming up behind after a merge but wasn’t sure how close. He decided to do the next lollipop and then see where he was on the straight but in his enthusiasm got to him and he understeered into the bales bouncing off them, hitting his bonnet. He also noticed the brake pads were rattling more than usual and it turned out they had lost a pin.

It currently hosts an exhibition of Crinan Canal paintings by artist Richard Demarko, who when asked how he would describe them said they were: ‘a love letter to the Crinan Canal.’Mid Argyll Councillor Dougie Philand attended the launch and said: #It was a very well organised event and well attended. It sends out the signal that not only Scottish Canals but other partners are interested and are now investing in Ardrishaig. Long may this continue in order to regenerate the village back to the splendour it once enjoyed.#Councillor Donnie Macmillan, who also attended said: #I had a wonderful day at the opening of The Egg Shed. I would like to congratulate everyone who helped to make it a professional and successful day. Everyone involved played their part in a professional manner.#I hope this is an important part of the regeneration of Mid Argyll and I will continue to give them all my support in my duties as a councillor.#The Egg Shed is the latest marker in the regeneration of Ardrishaig Harbour and has already been taken to the community’s heart.

It is bounded to the west by Montgomerie Terrace.ldquoThe proposed new development will be accessed via a new access created off Montgomerie Terrace, with the two new houses towards the front of the site, which replace the existing ldquodoran pre-fab and former canoe shed, accessed off the B.ldquoThese proposed homes reflect high standards of design to ensure successful integration with the character of the local area, without damaging the design characteristics of the conservation area.ldquoThe materials, scale and height of the surrounding area have all been assessed to ensure the proposed development is in keeping with the existing housing.The plans attracted five objections relating to the height of the buildings in relation to nearby properties, and raised issues surrounding privacy and sunlight.However, at a meeting of Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning and building standards committee on Monday August , planning officers urged councillors to approve the plans.In a written submission to the committee, planning officer Julie Hayward writes: ldquoThe main issue with the development is the potential impact of the dwellinghouses proposed on plots five and seven on the light, privacy and outlook of Orchard House to the east due to the position of the proposed houses and dfering ground levels.ldquoThe agent has submitted a drawing to show the relationship between the three houses and section drawings showing ground levels.ldquoIn terms of the impact of the proposed house on plot seven, the proposed house would have two bedroom windows in the east elevation at ground floor level and would be on slightly lower ground. Applying the guidelines in the approved supplementary planning guidance, there would be no signicant loss of light or privacy to Orchard House from this property.ldquoIn terms of the impact of the house on plot five on Orchard house, the garage would be positioned on the eastern side of the proposed house and the decking is shown on the western side beyond the rear wing.ldquoThere would be a window and door to the garage and a window to a WC in the rear elevation, which are not considered to be habitable rooms. There would be a large glazed area in the rear wing serving the living room.ldquoThe house is on signicantly higher ground than Orchard House.ldquoAgain, when applying the approved guidance there would be no direct overlooking and no loss of privacy to the habitable rooms of Orchard House.Kelso councillor Simon Mountford said he did not object to the proposals, but wanted to see a design change: ldquoWhat we have here those very boring roof shapes, although I appreciate modern roofs do not have chimneys or anything to break them up a little bit.ldquoIrsquom wonderingwe could ask the developer to break up the roof lines with some new designs.Tweeddale West councillor Eric Small told the committee: ldquoIrsquom quite happy with the way itrsquos sited in this location, so Irsquom going to go with the officers on this one.

Built around a single, beautully menacing chord, which apparently symbolises the background radiation in our universe, the finale discusses the search for discovering a unying theory of everything.To quote Small from Imprints, As you travel through space, you are displaced, imagining time. You exist like a plant, you bloom and you grow, then wither and die. But the one card you play, genetically, is always an ace.

at Barrel Law, near Hawick.In September, plans for an poundm wind farm were rejected by Scottish Borders councillors.The proposal would have seen seven turbines, of up to m in height, erected on land to the north-west of Roberton, near Hawick.The company behind the plans, Germany-based ABO Wind, then submitted an appeal to the Scottish Governmentrsquos planning and environmental appeals ision .As part of that appeal process, the DPEArsquos appointed reporter Elspeth Cook held a hearing at Forman Hall, Roberton.However, the hearing was simply to clary and define legal terms and certain technical standards in order to help inform Ms Cookrsquos decision.For example, one point of contention between Scottish Borders Council and ABO Wind is whether or not the combined appearance of Barrel Law and the existing wind turbines at Langhope Rig will create a lsquolandscape with wind turbinesrsquo or a lsquowind turbine landscapersquo, as per the legally-defined definitions.The councilrsquos position is that a distance of between -km is required in order to maintain the current landscape type in the valley, but ABO Wind suggest the turbines should be less than km apart, as they state that spreading out the two turbine sites would actually make the landscape look more saturated as the wind turbines would effectively cover a larger area.Furthermore, they state that a greater distance between the two developments would push the Barrel Law turbines outside of the topography which makes wind farms viable in this area.Appearing as part of ABO Windrsquos  of representatives, land and development consultant James Welsh told the reporter: ldquoIn our opinion we preserve the distinct identity of the two groups.ldquoThere are examples of wind farms being approved with similar distances between them but still being accepted as being clearly separate wind farms.ldquoTo insist on a greater separation would increase the effect of a cumulative effect between them.Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning consultant, Dr Guy Wimble, said: ldquoI donrsquot dispute that they are identiable as separate elements, my issue is the effect of the wind farms on the landscape, and recognising that they are two dferent wind farms not one development.ldquoThe proximity of them makes this appear more of a wind farm landscape rather a landscape with wind farms.ldquoWhile I accept that separating the developments would make the wind farms seem more spaced out, by putting them closer yoursquod increase density.John Campbel QC, appearing on behalf of a group of objectors called Barrel Law Action Group, said: ldquoIf you pull the wind farms apart then clearly you increase the area of cumulative effect.ldquoIf you pull them together, yoursquore going to increase the cumulative effect just by sheer numbers, and you lose the ability to discern the two as distinct entities.Melrose and Leaderdale councillor Tom Miers, appearing in his capacity as Scottish Borders Councilrsquos executive member for planning and environment, told the hearing: ldquoIt seems to me that the guidance allows for developments in this area but doesnrsquot necessarily promote it.ldquoNo one is disputing that the two wind farms would be separate, wersquore working to find out what degree of separation would be appropriate.Mr Welsh responded: ldquoIf you increase to a km distance it will push all m turbines outwith the area that has been identied as having the appropriate topography for this type of development.Ms Cook also sought clarication on certain technical points, mostly surrounding tables and figures contained within ious reports submitted by the appellant and the local authority."},{"url":null,"title":"art-thou-shakespeare-cyclists","story":"BORDERS

are fortunate in Scotland to have a way out of such dficulties in the form of a Debt Arrangement Scheme , which is one of Scotland’s best-kept secrets.  It’s available from charitable organisations such as StepChange and from commercial debt advisers such as TC Debt Solutions, too.  It is a Scottish Government scheme that is legally binding and prevents creditors from taking further action against people who owe money.Set up back in  by the Scottish Government, the scheme allows people to freeze interest and charges on their debts and pay their debts off interest-free over a longer period of time.  This brings payments down to levels that people can afford and gives people the chance to get their lives back on track.  Interest and charges are simply written off.Apart from reducing debt, one of the best things about the DAS scheme is that it protects people from their creditors but is not a form of insolvency: people get to pay back their debt in an affordable way.  Lenders like the scheme because they know they will eventually get their money back – and borrowers like it because they don’t have to pay interest charges and they get longer to pay their debts off.  It’s a case of everyone wins.There’s plenty of information about the Debt Arrangement Scheme online at  www.aib.gov.uk debt-arrangement-scheme.  Thousands of people have used the scheme, but so many

summer tournament, winning the competition in , the one-off match was played in a good spirit, but it was the Pupils who found their ruthless streak to snatch a win in the closing minutes.Rhu, fielding a team with plenty of height and energy, featuring several former youth players from Dumbarton FC # and former teammates of Pupils’ playmaker Donald McCallum # threatened early on.At the other end, though, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils had first-half chances, with Scott Souden and youngster Calum McKillop both having one-on-one opportunities, but their efforts were stopped by the Rhu keeper.The second half exploded into le on the hour mark as former Sons youth Callum Scott made his mark for Rhu, turning inside his marker to curl a classy left-footed finish beyond stand-in goalkeeper Ellis Robertson.Undeterred, the Pupils searched for an equaliser, and were given the opportunity minutes later when a Rhu handball in the box was penalised by referee Thomas d’Alessandro.John McCallum, playing as sweeper in a back three with Fraser Wylie and Ross Souden, stepped up to send the keeper the wrong way and make it -.However, after a lapse in concentration, the Pupils conceded a second goal, a cleverly guided header from a near-post corner evading Robertson in goal.Then, with the -degree heat and high humidity making the game hard work for both teams, the Feathers-sponsored Pupils rallied to equalise.A sweeping move involving midfield trio Keith Mitchell, Stuart Crossan and Donald McCallum found Scott Souden, who made no mistake when bearing down on goal, lashing a right-foot shot past the Rhu keeper, to the delight of his teammates and the clutch of Campbeltonians making the long journey to spectate.Then, in the dying seconds, after seeing shots

It is an intimate world, personal and subjective, the world of our thoughts and feelings. Children live in it quite naturally, but as adults we tend to withdraw from it.#I use high-key expressionist colour to express how I feel about the landscape.#I’ve been painting the area around me now for over  years, and the more I paint Knapdale, the more intensely I use light and colour to express my emotions for the landscape.#John worked for  years as an art teacher at Lochgilphead High School, then in art education with Strathclyde Region before leaving work to paint full-time in .His distinctive colourful landscapes quickly made him one of the Scotland’s most successful painters, with celebrities such as Sting, Madonna, Simon Le Bon and Gregor Fisher collecting his work.Wilma Meikle, who owns the Archway Gallery with her husband Iain, said: #We’re delighted that John has supported the gallery for all these years. His exhibition is always the highlight of our year and the new paintings are amazing.#It’s also really nice to have a show which is relevant to this area.

I just dont believe they can hurt me. What they shout at me ndash what they might do to me ndash isnt important in the long run. What they do to this body doesnt matter, because it isnt mine. Its Moiras. Whoever that is.Due to suffering depersonalisation and derealisation, I cant feel anything. Both are disorders which are medically recognised. They are categorised as symptoms in the spectrum of dissociative disorders.

I no longer believe that I am \"Moira\", and therefore, her trauma is not mine. I am indferent to it. My derealisation makes me believe that the outside world is not real.

Itrsquos that his character ndash cut-throat patriarch Logan Roy, grouchy boss of all he surveys, including his four sadsack children ndash is Scottish at all.ldquoWersquod [done] nine episodes on season onehellip the -year-old starts to tell me, then stops. Rewind. Succession was created by Londoner Jesse Armstrongand co-executive produced by American director Adam Mackay . A punchy dramedy about New York-based entertainment and media conglomerate Waystar Royco, a family firm with global reach, the series is richly characterised and deftly plotted. Itrsquos also thrilling, appalling and laugh-out-loud funny in equal measure.Butthe onscreen fun is twisty, the charactersrsquo backstory is even more so.ldquoAges ago, before we started, when they first asked me about the job, Cox continues of a show that premiered on Sky Atlantic last summer, ldquoI said to Adam Mackay and Jesse Armstrong: lsquoWouldnrsquot it be interestingLogan was Scots rsquo And Jesse, being an Englishman, said hersquos got to be American. But Mackay, the American, thought that would be good. Then it was nixed, Cox shrugs. In a five-decade career, hersquos been-there, done-that enough to know that in TV, as in Hollywood, nobody knows anything.ldquoSo, fair enough. The compromise was, [Logan] was born in Canada, a native of Quebec. But I wasnrsquot doing a Canadian accent, I was doing a sort of mid-Atlantic mush! he laughs. ldquoAnd then finally, on the ninth episode, Peter Friedman, who Irsquom endlessly sacking, he smiles of the actor who plays Loganrsquos Chief Operating Office and confidante, ldquosaid to me: lsquoI just did an ADR session ndash a dubbing session ndash and theyrsquove changed your birthplace. Yeah, itrsquos Dundee, Scotland.rsquoldquoAnd I went: lsquoThatrsquos my birthplace.rsquo lsquoOh, thatrsquos a coincidence.rsquo I said: lsquoI donrsquot think itrsquos a coincidence!rsquo he laughs again.ldquoSo I went off to Jesse and asked him: lsquoWhatrsquos all that about rsquo And he said: lsquoI thought itrsquod be a little surprisehelliprsquo ldquolsquoItrsquos more than a bloody surprise,rsquo relates Cox in a gravelly chuckle, ldquolsquoIrsquove been playing it a certain way and now Irsquove got tondashrsquoThe Cure: From the Hanging Garden to Bellahouston ParkAgain, he stops, but the meaning is clear: after filming nine episodes, the actor would have to make an internal calibration. Logan Roy was now a Scottish expat, and the truth of his journey from hardscrabble s Dundee to king-of-the-world in Manhattan would surely reveal itself to be intriguing indeed.So it came to pass that, in season two, that backstory is explored. Sadly, for now it must remain intriguing. The scenes shot in Scotland this summer comprise episodes seven and eight of the new ten-part season. Thatrsquos too far into the run for HBO to allow any plot-spoiling details to be revealed at this pre-broadcast stage.That said, given Loganrsquos general irascibility, and his curious relationship with his semi-estranged brother Ewan , it will come as no surprise to Succession fans that the Roysrsquo Scottish childhood was complex to say the least.Coxrsquosto Dundee, then, has certainly been more straightforwardly pleasing and rewarding than it is for his character. He tells me that in the city of his birth, the VA is ldquofantastic and the redeveloped River Tay waterfront was ldquounrecognisable to him.ldquoThe whole of Dundee is incredible, he beams with a nostalgic twinkle. ldquoItrsquos amazing what theyrsquove done to the city. Irsquove always thought Dundee was a city of survival. They [call it] the City of Discovery, but Dundeersquos been battered so many times. But Dundonians are great, lovely people. But itrsquos been really beaten up.ldquoI grew up in the s, when it was one of the most corrupt town councils ever ndash they were literally demolishing the town. All the Overgate area, which was wonderful, these old stone [buildings], and was medievalhellipldquoOf course,it was Edinburgh they wouldnrsquot have touched it. But these crooks, he says bitterly, ldquoone guy was in the demolition business, so he made a fortune out of it, Cox notes pointedly. Hersquos referring to the late Tom Moore, a plant hire businessman who became Lord Provost in the city , was sentenced to five years on charges of corruption relating to development contracts in the city, but later had his conviction quashed.Still, to Coxrsquos co-stars, seeing the showrsquos on- and offscreen patriarch back on home turf was a treat. Alan Ruck plays Loganrsquos son from the first of his three marriages. Connor Roy is no businessman, but he doesthink hersquod make a great President of the United States. Such is the Roy corporationrsquos political power, Connor thinks his dad can fix that for him.ldquoWe had a scene in Dundee the other day, begins Ruck. It involved him, Cox and Hiam Abbas, who plays Loganrsquos current, third we, Marcia. ldquoWe were driving around and [Logan] said: lsquoAh, the old carouselhelliprsquoldquoI said: lsquoWhat happened there, pa rsquo And Scott Ferguson, our producer, said it was so wonderful to watch Brian, as Logan, reminiscing about his boyhood in Dundee ndash on Brianrsquos actual birthday! he laughs of scenes shot on st June. ldquoYou canrsquot beat that. You couldnrsquot write a better scene. And [the emotions] came right out of him. For Logan, it was a very soft and sentimental [side] that you just donrsquot see from him too much.ldquoBrian was so proud to show the city to us, and he told us a lot of stories, echoes Nick Braun, who plays dimwit cousin Greg, a character whorsquos a punchbag for Loganrsquos son-in-law, the toxic clown played by British TV drama stalwart Matthew Macfadyen. ldquoBeing here was a great choice for them to take the story. But Brianrsquos accentrsquos got so thick since wersquove been in Scotland. We can hardly understand him anymore!:In celebration of Hamish Henderson, Scotlands great and neglected folk poetKeeping up with Succession can be almost as challenging, but no less rewarding. The first series saw an embattled Waystar Royco dealing with a hostile takeover bid, partly orchestrated by eldest son Kendall . But itrsquos testament to the skill of Armstrong and his writersrsquo room that the boardroom machinations and quickfire business jargon never bogged down or obscured the entertainment.Equally, they know how to craft a humdinger of a plot development. Kendallrsquos entire secret, Shakesperean plot to kill ndash in corporate terms at least ndash his father came to a cataclysmic halt at the end of series one. At the English castle wedding of Loganrsquos daughter Siobhanto Macfadyenrsquos Tom, Kendallrsquos drug abuse issues caused the death of a young waiter in a traffic accident.In gripping scenes, Kendall had to drag himself from a car submerged upside down in a pond in the dead of night, and make his way back to the wedding party over rain-sodden fields. When his father learns what happened, he covers up the crime ndash the price for Kendall beingthat his father now has him firmly under his heel.When I ask Strong how it was shooting those scenes, he sounds traumatised still.ldquoIt washellip It washellip he starts, stuttering. ldquoI mean, listen, my driver here [in Scotland] drove Chris Pine around for six months doing Outlaw King, and those guys were in the freezing cold and rain and mud, battling for five months ndash and that film was incredible, he enthuses of David Mackenziersquos  film about Robert the Bruce.ldquoBut my point being: I found that sequence to be very dficult and harrowing for me. They were extremely dficult nights, and I felt a need to experience as much as I could, what that would have been like, and how harrowing it was for [Kendall].ldquoSo, wersquore in a lake, in England, in winter, and those nights I would find myself going through thorn bushes and thickets in the woods, in between takes and set ups, just trying to sustain the stakes.Series two starts barely  hours after those events. In a sensational performance from Strong, Kendall ghosts through scenes, shellshocked while having to do his fatherrsquos brutal corporate bidding to shore up Waystar Royco in a rapidly changing media world. His argy-bargy brother Roman , continues his mission to stab Kendall in the back at any opportunity.These high-rolling, highly duplicitous iniduals arenrsquot the most pleasant ndash theyrsquore downright repellent half the time ndash but you canrsquot take your eyes off them.As Macfadyen notes with a grin, ldquothere was a review in the States that described me as a human grease stain. I was really pleased with that.Explaining the overall narrative arc of series two, Jesse Armstrong says: ldquoTherersquos a lot of mergers and takeovers in the media world ndash as there have been for a long time, but it feels like its accelerating now. And I guess part of that is the threat of Facebook and Amazon and Netflix and Google. Our show is meant to be a reflection of the real world, so that tech-pressure is there in the show.ldquoWe ended last season with a potential takeover bid, so therersquos that. And beyond that, therersquos a feeling amongst all these so-called legacy media companies: lsquoSh*t, what are we gonna do when our lunch gets eaten by tech firms rsquoThe obvious comparison for Logan Roy, his business and his children is Rupert Murdoch. I ask Sarah Snook, who plays Shiv: as an Australian, does she see a lot of Murdoch in Logan  She nods.ldquoTherersquos a lot of Lear in Murdoch, a lot of Roman behaviour, Greek behaviour, all mythological behaviours in any of those dynastic families like the Redstones or Murdochs or Packers. Any dynastic family that has wealth and power, it ends up lending itself to these grand, legend-sized stories. Sothere are similarities, of course itrsquos because wersquore doing that kind of story. But theyrsquore fun to play! she says brightly.Those resonances, she thinks, are why Succession was so successful .ldquoMaybe itrsquos the right time for it, the zeitgeist, the moment, she muses. ldquoWersquove got the patriarch of a family whorsquos in a very powerful position in America at the moment whorsquos been well-known as that dynastic power family in New York, famous for years before he became President. So thatrsquos a real switch ndash itrsquos not just a politician whorsquos become President, itrsquos a personality. And I think that certainly would help peoplersquos interest for this kind of show.Therersquos another added edge to Succession series two: a new character, played by Holly Hunter. Rhea Jarrell is ldquothe politically savvy CEO of a rival media conglomerate. Was the star of Working Girl and The Piano a fan of series one ldquoOh, so much, she replies when I meet her in another Gleneagles suite later in the day. Watching the first ten episodes, ldquoI found that I wanted to spend time with these people. It had nothing to do with whether I liked them or not. I just found each of them and the[ir] world utterly fascinating. Theyrsquore missing so many things in their lives that you feel empathy for them ndash even though their acts can be quite despicable.ldquoTherersquos a humanity, she continues, ldquodue to the lack, the subtraction of things they didnrsquot get when they were growing up. When you meet the mother, and you see the father, you can have empathy for the children. But at the same time, Hunter smiles, ldquotheyrsquore all quite funny.Theyrsquore also all, despite their exalted circumstances, real. Jesse Armstrong has taken care to colour the charactersrsquo backstories as deeply as possible. When I ask Jeremy Stronghe noticed a dference in his onscreen dad when they were filming in his hometown, his face actually lights up.ldquoYeah, it was quite wonderful, actually. I read Brianrsquos autobiography, which he wrote about  years ago, and he talks a lot about his childhood in Dundee. Irsquom glad I did read that ndash I sort of read it because itrsquos something Kendall would have done, he cheerfully admits. ldquoBut I gained a lot from it. And he brought his sister to set one day, who I think is  and raised him essentially, so it was very moving.As for whatrsquos next for the Roys, even the clan leader admits hersquos blithely in the dark. Partly thatrsquos down to the realities of long-form television: ten hours of programming mean therersquos lots of wiggle room for plot development. And partly thatrsquos down to Armstrongrsquos writing style: endlessly seeking to improve his scripts, hersquos not averse to making last-minute, reactive switches, as evidenced by Brian Coxrsquos account of how Logan Roy came to be a Dundonian.ldquoWhen I first started I was a bit annoyed about the fact that I didnrsquot know what the next episodes were, admits Cox with another chuckle, ldquothere was no sense of it.ldquoBut now I get a kind of frisson out of the fact that I donrsquot know what Irsquom doing. So I find it actually quite exciting that Irsquom in this no-manrsquos-land and I just donrsquot know where this show is gonna go.Succession launches at pm on th August on Sky Atlantic"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10249925.jpg?type=article-full","title":"david-mundell-independence-majority-holyrood-2021-spark-referendum","story":"The former Scottish secretary said Downing Street would have to listenthe Scottish Parliament electionin  is ldquoexplicitly fought on the issue.He made the comments as he confirmed he would not vote down a Conservative Government to prevent a no-deal Brexit, despite raising concerns it could threaten the future of the UK.Mr Mundell was speaking at a Fringe by the Sea event in North Berwick, where he was being interviewed by the journalist Katy Balls.:Remain voters driving swing to Yes, says John CurticeHe said: ldquoI thinkthe  Scottish Parliament election is fought explicitly on the issue of another referendum, and then there is a majority of nationalist parties, then evidently you do have to listen to that.ldquoThe  Scottish Parliament election wasnrsquot fought on that basis ndash it was sort of a subset of the SNP manesto.Former Scottish Secretary David Mundell in conversation with journalist Katy Bow.ldquoIn my view the wording they put there was deliberately ambiguous, so as to allow them to not major on independence but then claim they had a mandate for independence.ldquoButthe  Scottish Parliament election is fought on an explicit independence referendum basis, then itrsquos harder to push back against the idea that there is a mandate.Mr Mundell has previously said the Holyrood poll is shaping up to be a ldquoreferendum on a referendum.He indicated Unionist candidates should form tactical alliances to beat pro-independence parties.He said: ldquoI think as we head into the  Scottish Parliament elections, which will ultimately be a referendum on whether therersquos another referendum, then all Unionist forces have to think about how they best organise themselves for that election.It comes just days after a poll showed support for independence has risen to  per cent, with % against.Mr Mundell, who was sacked by Boris Johnson last month as part of his brutal cabinet reshuffle, has repeatedly warned about the dangers of a no-deal Brexit.Read more:SNP say Ruth Davidson lsquohumiliatedrsquo after David Mundell sacked against her adviceBut askedwould accept crashing out of the EU without a deal, he said: ldquoI think that we have to have a Brexit rather than no Brexit.ldquoSo Irsquom clear that that is an important principle.

My club, Celtic, ceaselessly proclaim that they are ldquomore than just a club. This, I think, is meant to convey the sense that they are driven by loftier aspirations than those to be found amidst the treacherous and shallow world of football commerce. Celtic have made their humble beginnings and original mission to the poor and victimised Irish refugees a formidable marketing tool. They are bound to a higher purpose in le and a golden thread of human redemption curls up through their DNA.Many Celtic supporters are proud to declare their allegiance to an assortment of left-wing and global movements which we believe reinforce our sense of who we think we are and what we are about. Last week their much-maligned Green Brigade section blazoned their support for the plight of those refugees living in Glasgow who have been threatened with summary eviction without warning. On several weeks throughout this season this same reviled faction will organise foodbanks for some of the most deprived and destitute communities in Glasgowrsquos East End.: Steven Gerrard delighted to get back European pride for RangersYet on all matters to do with the core business of winning football games and gaining trophies we are like fascists. Very little human compassion is permitted to be wasted in the unquenchable thirst for success. We cherish the socialist principles of our club yet are happy for it to profit from the pursuit of pure capitalism. We have more money at our disposal than all of our closest rivals combined. Yet, we would be outragedwe were to share some of this with our neediest neighbours,even merely to engender a keener sense of competition. Like all football fans who otherwise hold to the values of socialism I am happily complicit in this.Celtic have annexed the last nine trophies available to them in Scottish football. Yet, like a billionaire who canrsquot stop accumulating wealth the word lsquoenoughrsquo doesnrsquot figure in a football fanrsquos lexicon. If Neil Lennon fails to deliver a ninth league title in succession he knows he faces a firing squad assembled from among those who previously ascribed to him the gt of walking on water. We proclaim our support for the rights of workers and enlightened employment policies but have no hesitation in making those footballers employed by our club walk the plankwe, who are all hopeless amateurs, donrsquot think they are up to much. Our club only agreed reluctantly to sign up to pay a Living Wage for its poorest employees in exchange for them sacricing their annual bonuses. Like many other clubs Celtic acts as a willing proxy for online betting firms to prey on their most vulnerable supporters.For supporters of most other Scottish football clubs the only consolation is perhaps the glow engendered by an occasional win and a cup upset every five years or so. I sometimes wonderthe joy of an unexpected triumph in adversity is deeper than what you experience when another piece of entitled silverware is delivered.This week, though, Celtic had a taste of what it is like to be at the wrong end of free market forces beyond their control. Reluctantly, they were forced to sell their best player and brightest prospect Kieran Tierney to the London club Arsenal who exist in a galaxy far, far away from Celticrsquos. Certainly, they got decent value for him but what good is poundm when you know the players whom you require as replacements will, in all probability, prefer not to play in Scotland Neil Lennon: Kieran Tierney will go down as a Celtic legend like Kenny Dalglish, Charlie Nicholas and Virgil van DijkCelticrsquos annual goal is to make fleeting contact with clubs like Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Juventus in the Champions League. To get to this hallowed place, however, they must negotiate an eight-game obstacle course that gets stfer each year. Rangers have to face similar odds to reach the Europa League.In this Celtic share the same fate as other once-great European clubs like Benfica, Ajax and Anderlecht in Portugal, Holland and Belgium. Their agony is that they donrsquot belong to a gang of five countries ndash Spain, Germany, Italy, France and England ndash whose biggest football clubs have become magnets for super global wealth.That much of this cash is tainted by human slavery corruption, gangsterism and money-laundering seems not to matter. What does matter is that Europersquos governing football body, which acts like a small but very powerful and cash-rich independent republic, has declared it clean. Its highest pinnacle of competition has now been reduced to an annual, luxury yacht-race reserved for the best clubs in these countries and a host of boutique others. Several are owned overseas by iniduals and states attracted by the opportunity to normalise questionable human rights regimes and cash sources with access to previously denied television markets. Within a few years it will be impossible for a football club on ability alone even to be admitted into the presence of the big five. At this point the last remnants of anything resembling competition will have been expunged. Football, still laughingly referred to as the Peoplersquos Game, will have eaten itself.:Celtic will consider new contract for Callum McGregor after rebuffing Brendan Rodgers poundm Leicester City dealThe answer may lie in the equivalent of well-organised industrial action, the only strategy which ever brings capital to the table. The medium-range countries which lie outside the big five must act in concert and withdraw their labour from UEFArsquos competitions and threaten the establishment of a rival body. The trickle-down effect of Scottish participation in the Champions League and access to the riches that lie there also guarantees the financial future of our smaller clubs.Beyond this lies another modelwersquore serious about the democratisation and long-term sustainability of football in Scotland.

We would not block something like that, he declared.:Scottish Labour in meltdown over stance on second independence referendumHis bulldozing of Scottish party policy came out of the blue for Mr Leonard and his MSPs, but did not appear to be a casual remark. As one unhappy Labour MSP puts it: ldquoJohn McDonnell doesnrsquot make mistakes.Mr McDonnell had doubtless been reading Mondayrsquos poll from Lord Ashcroft which showed a lead for Yes.It also found that, despite leading Scottish Labour for more  days, around a third of voters have no opinion on Mr Leonard. They donrsquot know who he is. Just  per cent felt positively about the colourless crusader, less than Nigel Farage managed.With an election nigh, Mr McDonnell thought it best to show Nicola Sturgeon some love in case her MPs are needed to help a minority Labour government.In contrast, Mr Leonard, who has only ornamental value, and who in May helped Scottish Labour descend to % of the vote, was an afterthought.The backlash to Mr McDonnellrsquos intervention from some Scottish Labour MPs and MSPs has been spectacular.Some are truly angry at the party dropping its do-or-die Unionism, some are using the issue in a proxy war against Jeremy Corbyn, and many are furious at being the lsquobranch officersquo again.It has been an ungodly mess. The impression given to voters is that Scottish Labour canrsquot tie its own shoelaces.Mr Leonard, an authority-free zone, is confirmed as a washout of a leader.:John McDonnell ignores Richard Leonard and keeps independence referendum on the tableA poor, pale, watery creature, he gets sloshed around by forces he canrsquot control, like a jellyfish in a bucket.Most of his MSPs have tried to dig in, refusing to accept the policy change, but theyrsquore on a hiding to nothing.For despite all the mess, the needless aggro, the terrible PR, Mr McDonnellrsquos position is the realistic one. You canrsquot say Naw forever. At some point, Labour and the other Unionist parties will have to square up to a second referendum.I believe Mr McDonnell when he says he doesnrsquot want a referendum, and would oppose independenceanother vote took place. As Brexit has shown, losing a referendum not only costs the UK leader of the day their job, it also wrecks the governmentrsquos agenda.Mr McDonnell and Mr Corbyn havenrsquot come this close to power only to watch their plans being shoved aside by years of negotiations over independence.They could, like Theresa May and the Scottish Labour ultras, simply refuse to engage, and risk watching support for Yes climb ever higher. Or they could grasp the thistle and start thinking about what to do while the odds are still -.True, this is all far sooner than Labour would want. But the five years since  have been extraordinarily turbulent. To paraphrase Facebookrsquos staff motto, politics now moves fast and breaks things. If the public mood is moving towards Yes, it cannot be ignored.There were also clues to how Labour - or the Tories - might respond this week.Mr McDonnell gave one. ldquoLet us demonstrate as a Labour government what we can do to transform peoplersquos lives. And , after a few years, people want to come back and say they want to test the water on an independence referendum, well fair enough.In other words, a Labour government would play for time. It wouldnrsquot block Indyref, but nor would it hurry it along. It would hope the public mood shted after the Tories were ousted and Labour had a chance to promote federalism.That ldquoafter a few years is their version of Mrs Mayrsquos ldquonow is not the time.Of course, Nicola Sturgeon would not wait a few years. The First Minister would ask for a vote in , citing her ldquocast-iron mandate and brandishing a vote by SNP and Green MSPs. Here too, Labour has a get-out. Shadow Scottish minister Paul Sweeney says there is no mandate as those MSPs were elected on dferent manestos. He has a point.:Labour would not block a second Scottish independence referendumThe SNP position was conditional on ldquoa signicant and material change in circumstances... such as Scotland being taken out of the EU against our will.But the Greens suggested a m-signature petition as the trigger.Their manesto said: ldquoIf a new referendum is to happen, it should come about by the will of the people, and not be driven by calculations of party political advantage. Itrsquos a muddled, mongrel mandate that would let a UK government parry the FM until .Which brings us to the next line of Unionist defence. Mr McDonnell, Mr Sweeney, the Labour MSP Neil Findlay and former Scottish Secretary David Mundell all identied the Holyrood election as pivotal this week. Mr Mundell described it as a referendum on whether to have a second referendum.Hinting at tactical alliances, he said: ldquoAll Unionist forces have to think about how best to organise themselves for that election. He and the Labour politicians also said thatthe SNP and Greens wanted to claim a clear and decisive mandate for Indyref, they should fight the election on an explicit commitment to holding it. That would focus Unionist opposition.If the SNP and Greens won a majority there would then be haggling over the form of the referendum. There would be no rerun of , when Alex Salmond was given a relatively free hand. Mr Sweeney said Labour would block a Yes No question and include a federal UK in a multiple-choice ballot. A Tory government might offer more devolution as a third way. David Cameron only insisted on a binary question in  because he thought the Unionists would romp it. The calculation is very dferent now. The UK government would be looking for ways to split the Yes vote.If, after all that, voters did back independence, therersquos another catch. Mr Findlay, who was Mr Corbynrsquos point man in Scotland for a while, said that whatever deal emerged from the negotiations between Edinburgh and London should go to ldquoa confirmatory vote of the Scottish people. As some SNP MPs have warned, Ms Sturgeon would struggle to object as she supports a confirmatory vote on Brexit.So while Mr McDonnellrsquos comments are signicant, they are not the whole story. Obstacles are being piled up in Ms Sturgeonrsquos path - the  election, a novel form of referendum, a confirmatory vote. While Unionists would only have to prevail in one of the three to scupper her plans, the First Minister would have to win the treble."},{"url":null,"title":"thousands-descend-glasgow-world-pipe-band-championships","story":"The competition will welcome  bands from  countries on August  and  as Glasgow Green once again plays host to the event.Nations represented at the championships include New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Austria, Switzerland, Eire, the US, Belgium, England, Spain, Malaysia, Northern Ireland and Scotland.Many tickets have already sold out for the weekend but organisers say there is still a chance to snap up seats for the finale of the Grade  competition where the world champions will be crowned.Ian Embelton, Royal Scottish Pipe Band Association chief executive, said: \"Year after year, pipe bands across the world head to Glasgow and the World Pipe Band Championships knowing they face the ultimate test of their skill.\"The competitions are of the highest quality, with bands constantly finding the smallest improvements in the pursuit of a perfect performance.\"It all adds up to a thrilling competition that builds to an incredible conclusion on Saturday evening when the world champions are crowned.\"It is the culmination of the Piping Live! festival in Glasgow which has held the championships each year since .Glasgows Lord Provost Eva Bolander said: \"It is always a pleasure to welcome so many bands to Glasgow from around the world and to see and hear them play their hearts out on Glasgow Green.\"The inidual skills being utilised in a band is one of the finest examples of team competition in the world and the musical talent on display at the World Pipe Band Championships is simply breathtaking.\"You will never forget a day at the Worlds spent in the company of such brilliant performers.\""},{"url":null,"title":"stakes-high-planet-starts-get-bullish-meat","story":"According to the UN, food production now causes a third of greenhouse gas emissions, and meat is the worst offender. If we must have so much protein, then we ought to be eating insects, they say. I see.The report doesnrsquot go so far as urging us to become vegan or vegetarian, but converting to a more flexible ndash or ldquoflexitarian ndash diet, where we eat more fruit and veg and locusts or whatever and less red meat, which would go a long way to help cut emissions.Needless to say, farmers have a beef with the report and claim that importing vegetarian alternatives from around the world would hurt the environment just as much. Andrews Loftus, a beef farmer and commercial director at Sellmylivestock, said: ldquoPeople need to be cautious theyrsquore not substituting UK-produced meat, some of the most efficient and low-greenhouse-gas meat in the world, with a product such as soya or an avocado, which has been shipped from South America from a former rainforest.I will be relatively candid with you here and confess Irsquom not keen on avocado ndash itrsquos right mushy,I remember rightly ndash and I donrsquot eat soy because amateur experts online say it turns you into a woman. Irsquove nothing against the female sex, but Irsquom not ready to join them just yet and hope to see out the rest of my days as an admittedly inadequate man .I should also say that I was vegetarian for a few years, though I did take the pisces, so to speak, and indeed, to make up for the lack of meat, would consume whole shoals of fish.I just sort of drted into vegetarianism and drted back out of it. One day, I couldnrsquot thole another Quorn sausage roll .I always liked comedian Count Arthur Strongrsquos take on vegetarian sausages. He didnrsquot understand the concept and said the only way hersquod ever buy them would be as the veg to accompany proper sausages. Irsquom not a great cook, and donrsquot eat dairy for other health reasons , so my choices had becoming boring and limited, and I drted back into eating mangled bits of beastie.Irsquom sure wersquore all having a think about our scran. The authorities in some places are starting to get bullish about animal flesh, with German legislators proposing to raise the sales tax on meat from seven to  per cent, with the aim of reducing numbers of livestock, who donrsquot help matters by farting all the time.Germans are notoriously fond of sausages, so you can imagine that the proposal has given some headbangers there a fit of the vapours. Christian Lindner, leader of the Free Democrats, fulminated: ldquoWhoever wants to be a vegan is free to do so, but the rest of us shouldnrsquot be banned from eating our schnitzel.Schnitzel  Bless you. In other nosh news this week, laboratory-grown chicken was offered to a favoured few in yonder America, with reports suggesting it was pretty decent,lacking somewhat in texture.This is undoubtedly the way forward. Food without cruelty, and produced with little effect on the environment beyond the carbon footprint of vehicles to transport it. The question is: will it tempt some vegetarians back to meat I donrsquot think they like eating sinews and tendons and, you know, gross stuff like tongues and hooves anyway, so perhaps not. But, like everything  these days, nothing is simple. More and more of us will drt in and out of meat.All of which is making me hungry so, following Count Arthurrsquos advice, I think Irsquoll have a steak pie accompanied by a Greggs vegan sausage roll.++++BRITONS donrsquot know much about Britain. In a poll of , alleged adults for National Express UK Coach, almost half failed to identy Edinburgh Castle. Sixteen per cent didnrsquot know Edinburgh was the capital of Scotland.Itrsquos like us not knowing that Manchester is the capital of England. Ridiculous. Oddly enough,  per cent were able to identy the Albert Dock ndash the what now  ndash in Liverpool, and two thirds happily recognised Bristolrsquos Clton Suspension Bridge, the poor manrsquos Forth Road Bridge.I jest, of course. Even I could identy and appreciate these, and I donrsquot get out much. I certainly know Hadrianrsquos Wall, having waddled along beside it, pretending I was patrolling my country against southern barbarians. But one in six in this survey couldnrsquot identy it.Of course, wersquore all as bad as each other. Like  per cent, I wouldnrsquot have put Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshireand, like one in seven, would have put Portsmouth in Devon, rather than in Hampshire.Who can we blame for our woeful ignorance  It must be Trump or Boris or the First Minister of Scotland, whoever he is. Certainly nothing to do with us.++++SEAGULLS have been much in the news. Wersquod never paid them much attention before until they started stealing our chips. They should have known that would provoke us to war.However, this week, it was reported that the unprincipled scavengers are big fearties and will back offyou just stare at them. Not sure you want to go around doing that, right enough, or you could attract the attention of the authorities, buttheyrsquore after your chips allrsquos fair in love and war.University of Essex researchers put bags of chips on the ground in Cornish seaside resorts and, out of  gulls who thought it was their birthday and Christmas rolled into one, only  came anywhere near when a staring human stood near by.Perhaps, just as people said of the war against the Nazis ldquonot all Germans, perhaps itrsquos ldquonot all gulls. Irsquove seen well-mannered ones standing by politely, trying not to steal envious glances at your fish supper.Much of the time, indeed, their restraint is remarkable. If I was starving and you had a fish supper, Irsquod be whimpering at your feet and would probably make a grab for your haddock tae.+++AT last, other voices are speaking out against the Edinburgh Festival and Fringe.True, I donrsquot think their concerns are the same as mine. Basically, I donrsquot like to see people enjoying themselves. The words ldquofiesta and ldquoparty scare the bejasus out of me. I prefer my Edinburgh douce, grey and stoney.The new critics oppose corporate corruption of the festivals, ldquogentrication and the Old Townrsquos transformation into ldquoa gaudy theme park.

Its consequences are in plain sight in the form of food insecurity, conflict and migration, and financial instability.\":Issue of the day: The Womenrsquos Tour of ScotlandWhich countries are most at risk Unsurprisingly, due to their temperatures, the most water-stressed regions are the Middle East and North Africa, also known as the MENA region, and home to  of the  at-risk countries.This region could experience the greatest economic losses from climate-related water scarcity, between % and % of GDP by , the World Bank found.Recently it was widely reported that Chennai in southeast India is in danger of running out of water, with its reservoirs drying up.India ranks th on the Aqueduct list of water-stressed countries, but has more than three times the population of the other  countries combined, according to WRI.Experts say that cities including London, Mexico City, Sao Paulo, Tokyo, Istanbul and Jakarta could be facing Day Zero - where they run out of water - in the next twenty years unless they radically revise how they use their resources.:Issue of the day: Facebooks cryptocurrencyHow real a risk is Day Zero Sad to say, but very, very real. Less than % of the worlds water supply is readily available for human use - the rest is salty, frozen, dirty or trapped underground.Around a million homes in cape Town faced their own Day Zero in April , later extended to July that year.Residents of the city collected their rations of water - the equivalent of a two minute showers worth a day per person - from centralised water centres.Although the metropolis didnt run out of water, the supply is by no means stable and residents have had to adapt to living with drastically less water - even having to stop flushing their loos.In , Brazils Sao Paolo was staring its own Day Zero in the eyes.The city took action by turning off its water supply for  hours a day, forcing many businesses and industries to shut down.South Africa already has  million people without access to water. Meeting their needs would require . billion gallonsper year.Can anything be done In the MENA region, more than % of water is not reused, soinfrastructures were built around recycling wastewater, it could generate a whole new source of clean water.The WRI has said that at-risk countries can invest in more efficient irrigation, collect and store rainwater, and conserve and restore lakes, floodplains and groundwater recharge areas.Countries could look to Australia who teetered on the edge of their own Day Zero during the Millennium but almost halved its domestic use.Why is this happening Experts say the crisis stems from more than just droughts caused by soaring temperatures. Growing populations are degrading fresh water resources and aquatic ecosystems.WRI found that global water withdrawals have more than doubled since the s due to growing demand.Even water-rich countries rely on other nations to provide for their needs. Research has shown that around % of the EUrsquos water consumption is reliant on water availability in other countries to grow products that it imports including rice and cotton, making these countries vulnerable to shortages."},{"url":null,"title":"severe-weather-disrupt-weekend-events-across-uk","story":"The Met Office has put in place yellow warnings for thunderstorms in Scotland and Northern Ireland and for strong winds across Wales and most of England.Forecaster Craig Snell said wind gusts of up to mph were recorded on Saturday morning in coastal areas.Early riser Take careyoure heading out on Saturday morning, theres some wet and windy weather in the south.

Internal features such as stone benches have also been found along either side.The hall is oriented towards the sea and finds include steatite , pottery, a bone spindle whorl and a fragment of a Norse bone comb.The find provides tantalising evidence of the earliest phases of inhabitation on this farm and settlement mound which may well have been inhabitated for over , years.It provides another piece to the ,-year jigsaw along this archaelogy rich stretch of coast as Westness in Rousay — described as the #Egypt of the North#.A team of archaeologists from the University of the Highlands and Islands Archaeology Institute, Rousay residents and students have been digging at the site for a number of years, investigating the later stages of the farm complex and its waste heaps with a particular focus on past diet, farming and fishing practices.Although only partly uncovered at this stage, the Skaill hall has parallels with other Norse halls excavated in Orkney, such as Snusgar, and where in Scotland.The excavation is part of the Landscapes of Change — Archaeologies of the Rousay Clearances and Westness Estate project which is exploring the Skaill farmstead.The present farm at Skaill dates to the th and th centuries and was part of the Rousay clearances during the mid-th century.The name Skaill suggests the site was home to a Norse hall or drinking hall, and was a high status site.Westness is mentioned in Orkneyinga saga as the home of Sigurd, a powerful chieftain, so it was always likely that a Norse settlement was located somewhere at Skaill.Earlier structures have been found below the present farm during previous seasons, and this season explored more of the Norse phases of the site.Three dimensional models of the farmstead can be found here.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Now, licensed sellers from Orkney will have a chance to develop the market for their product and people can try goose for themselves, on Orkney, and across Scotland.“Wild geese are an important part of Scotland’s nature, but their rapid rise in numbers has been challenging for farmers and crofters. Striking the balance between conservation, farming and hunting can be dficult. Our goal is to give farmers and crofters the tools they need to safeguard their crops, enabling them to control goose numbers sustainably, and sell goose meat for profit.”Until now, meat generated by the Orkney resident greylag goose project could only be sold locally by retailers based on Orkney.SNH is working to secure longer-term arrangements for the sale of resident greylag goose meat in Scotland.

Understandably, she declared there was “growing urgency” for Scotland to become independent because it faced being “dragged down a political path we don’t want to go”.Cue much licking of SNP lips at thoughts of a No Deal disaster, sweeping gains at a General Election as Scottish Labour’s tailspin turns into a screaming e, victory in a second independence vote next year and,the last prospectus was anything to go by, the  Scottish parliament elections to be for the first independent Scottish legislature. But some pro-independence commentators have begun to question the assumption that Boris Johnson is a gt and a No Deal departure will be the best precursor to separation. It is unquestionably true that the SNP does not want a No Deal exit, but then neither does the UK government, but is a soft Brexit like that agreed by ex-Prime Minister Theresa May really a path Ms Sturgeon doesn’t want to do down For the SNP, it could be the best of both worlds: it would still be Brexit, so Scotland will have been “dragged out the EU against its will” but with customs and regulations aligned the UK would have to play by EU rules over which it had no control. Under those circumstances the SNP would argue an independent Scotland back in the EU would give Scotland a say and with no adverse effect on rUK trade.No Deal is the reverse, where an independent Scotland going back into the EU would mean trade barriers, virtual or otherwise, where none currently exist because automatic harmonisation will have ended and the Irish question becomes the Scottish question. With four times as much Scottish trade going to the rest of the UK than to Europe, whatever the economic impact of the UK leaving the EU it would be four times as greatScotland left the UK.These febrile times are leading to a loss of grip and perspective, like Labour’s John McDonnell who promised yesterday that Labour would let the Scottish parliament decide whether there should be a second independence referendum, which it already has, even referring to Westminster as the “English parliament”. In one-garrulous Fringe chat show, Scottish Labour’s election pledge is now for Indyref , much to the dismay of Edinburgh South MP Ian Murray.Even in the parliamentary recess, the momentum towards an autumn election is accelerating because with no sign of European willingness to renegotiate the alternatives are a new parliament and a change of government or a No Deal departure on October .With his working majority down to one, the chances of a No Confidence vote when Westminster reconvenes in September are high, but Mr Johnson is not compelled to call an election and instead has  days to demonstrate he can form a new government which commands a majority. Onlythat fails must an election be called, so it is not unfeasible for an election to be after October  by which time the UK will have left the EU without a deal.The Conservative position of honouring the results of the  and  referenda and opposing re-runs of both has the benefit of consistency and for the sake of the Union Scottish Conservatives have no alternative but to get right behind the UK government and be ready for November .

Not only did it show a majority in favour of independence, it revealed a majority in favour of a referendum within the next two years.“Importantly though, it confirms the nation is on a journey.

Business leaders warned confidence among UK firms remains “dire” and the figures, released by the ONS, were a “rude awakening”. But Chancellor Sajid Javid said he did not expect the economy to slide into recession, which would require a second successive quarter of contraction between July and September.: Scottish independence: Nationalist MPs support “back door” independence move: Labour at war over split on Scottish independence voteThe economy was weaker than both market expectations and the Bank of England’s latest forecasts, which had pointed to flat growth in the quarter.The setbackemerged after separate figures last week showed Scotland’s economy enjoyed relatively high growth of . per cent in the first quarter of the year.SNP Economy spokeswoman Kirsty Blackman said: “The ONS figures showing the economy has shrank and suffered its worst performance in nearly seven years has left Scotland and the UK teetering on the brink of a catastrophic \u2028recession. “This must serve as an urgent wake-up call for a Tory government that is gambling with businesses, jobs and people’s livelihoods as we hurtle towards the October deadline.“Rather than railroading ahead with his damaging Brexit plans and scheming on ways to bypass Parliament and democracy to inflict such an outcome, the Tory Prime Minister must instead heed the economic warnings andto reality before it is too late.“Earlier this week, revised GDP figures published in Scotland for the first quarter of  showed that Scotland was outperforming the UK’s economy – highlighting that the strengths of Scotland’s economy are now being undermined by Brexit.” The pound dropped on the news and declined further over the morning.

There’s not a single leading forecaster out there that is expecting a recession, the independent Bank of England is not expecting a recession. And that’s because they know that the fundamentals remain strong.”The employers’ body, the CBI, said the contraction was “concerning”.Alpesh Paleja, CBI lead economist, said: “It’s clear from our business surveys that underlying momentum remains lukewarm, choked by a combination of slower global growth and Brexit uncertainty.“As a result, business sentiment is dire.”The Federation of Small Businesses– which is calling for an emergency Budget – said thatthe Treasury delays action until after  October, the date for Brexit, its efforts are likely to prove too little, too late.“Time is of the essence. Unless the chancellor steps in imminently with radical action, we could be heading for a chaotic autumn – and a very long winter,” said the FSB’s policy and advocacy chairman, Martin McTague.John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said the “dismal economic figures are a direct result of Tory incompetence”. “The Tories’ Brexit bungling, including Boris Johnson now taking us towards no-deal, is breaking the economy.”Production output fell by . per cent, with manufacturing showing a . per cent decline.The sector was also weighed down by a drop in transport equipment, which was . per cent lower due to annual car factory closures being brought forward from summer to April, as companies planned for possible Brexit disruption.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"wings over scotland plans new pro independence party to take on snp","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Stuart Campbell, the founder, and author of the popular Wings Over Scotland blog believes a new party would capitalise on demands within the Yes movement for more action to be taken towards independence.

Is it not time you got over it Alas, Ms Sturgeon#sEU policy is vacuous, unsustainable humbug. If Britain stays in the EU, Scotland will automatically leave on Independence Day, creating an immediate “hard border” with the UK . EU tarfs will apply and trade negotiations will be with Brussels, not Westminster. Our . percent budget deficitexceeds EU limits , implying spending cuts tax hikes of around £ billion per year from a total budget of £- billion.We shall face years of austerity, at the end of which we shall adopt the euro and hand over control of our economy and trade, fishing and agriculture to Brussels. ‘Hasta la vista’, independence!Scots will never vote for that.The obvious antidote is to join EFTA, instead of the EU. But that isn’t the policy being peddled to voters. Ms Sturgeon recently confirmed SNP intentions to rejoin the EU on the BBC#s Andrew Marr Show. The policy is unsustainable humbug and it will change before any independence referendum takes place.The problem is Mr Tulloch is you live in a British mindset when it comes to economics and is very much accepting of the present way of government of Scotland .Proactive governments like Norway, Ireland and Iceland run their government and countries a lot dferent from Westminster and have for example a lot higher g.d.ps or bigger economiesthan we have at the moment, Ireland a hundred years ago was an integral part of the British state ,a rural backwater a neo military junta .Today#s economy an open modern European nation is something to be proud of with a g.d.p of  compared to the U.K  or it#s North east of Ireland of dollars.O the JUSTICE of it.Mr Salmond#s  #Declaration of Lerwick# promised new powers for Shetland. The Smith Commission Reportsubsequently made the following recommendation: #Crown Estate#. Responsibility for the management of the Crown Estate’s economic assets in Scotland, and the revenue generated from these assets, will be transferred to the Scottish Parliament. This will include the Crown Estate’s seabed, urban assets, rural estates, mineral and fishing rights, and the Scottish foreshore for which it is responsible.#. Following this transfer, responsibility for the management of those assets will be further devolved to local authority areas such as Orkney, Shetland, Na h-Eilean Siar or other areas who seek such responsibilities…….#Perhaps, Ms Sturgeon will update us on progress, four years on What a great advert for the SNP!!!!# One of the worst education systems according to the international measurement last published.Nicola Sturgeon, albeit unwittingly, chose to wear a Barbour jacket during her brief visit to Shetland. The ‘Barbour’ brand is the ultimate symbol of being proud to be British worn by celebrities around the world, including our own British Royal Family, and made in South Shields in North East England. Although Nicola’s grandmother did come from Sunderland, so it might have been an unconscious calling from her ancestors. ‘Second Working Man– “Leebralism is – feth I can hardly richtly tell dee what hit is!’“What is Leebralism” A Liberal candidate made it clear on a visit to Shetland.It is being in favour of the freedom of business and the freedom of the inidual, even though these may conflict.The man was standing for the European Parliament back when John Major was PM. He was speaking at an NFU meeting in the Lerwick Hotel.Asked about a Tory threat to the minimum wage protection that was in place for agricultural workers, he said he didn’t hold with a minimum wage workers should be free to accept as low a wage as was offered.Their “freedom” was to be exploited.Back then LibDems opposed Labour’s plan to extend the minimum wage on principle. Something to do with their backing from small businesses.Of course they changed their minds once it was clear it was going to happen.A bit like Tavish backing the right of women to join the Royal and Ancient golf club at St. Andrews, after they’d let them in.So the clash between securing the freedom of iniduals and that of business is resolved by sitting on a fence and waiting for a strong wind.What is Liberalism Whose round is it Another classic cock-up from the SNP!

The results are projects which genuinely improve the lives of today#s residents # as well as visitors # and leave a legacy for future generations. What is even more remarkable is the fact these projects are achieved with very little access to loans. The good work of the community trusts is achieved through dogged determination to raise funds within the community combined with seriously clever navigation of the minefield of grant applications. By steadily securing the funds from a myriad public pots and local activities the trusts ensure each project is not only affordable now, but sustainable for generations to come.In Staffin # home to the iconic Old Man of Storr # the local community trust has raised over £, to upgrade existing footpaths and create new ones. There will be new parking, #welcome# structures and interpretation boards at all sites. The whole project will result in what the trust is calling #Skye Ecomuseum# which will encourage visitors to spend more time and therefore more money in Staffin.In the north west of Skye, the Glendale Trust covers a huge area that attracts , visitors a year # many travelling the long and winding single track road to the top five hotspot of Neist Point.The trust, under the leadership of Tim Hunter-Davies and three new directors, is working hard to develop sustainable facilities for the community and tourists. They have taken ownership of Meanish Pier and the foreshore, creating opportunities for local residents and regional businesses alike. It will be run commercially and provide income to enable the Trust to invest in further sustainable community projects.Glendale # which was the subject of Scotland#s first community buyout back in  # is rich in history and the trust is also looking to develop projects that preserve and share the story of the area, as Tim Hunter-Davies explains: #As well as being instrumental in land reform in the last century, Glendale has a rich heritage stretching back through the centuries. A steamer used to sail daily from Loch Dunvegan and was used as a point to transport many people away from Scotland during the Highland clearances. We want to preserve and share our history with the community and visitors.#In south Skye is the Sleat Community Trust. It has been working hard to provide and improve leline services for the community that also benefit visitors arriving and leaving Skye on the Armadale Mallaig ferry.The SCT currently provides shop, post office and fuel services in two buildings no longer fit for purpose. Over £, has been raised from public and private sources to build a new shop with a community #social# space and offices for the employees of the Trust. They hope to open the new shop in early summer .In addition, the purchase by the Trust of the -hectare Tormore Forest in  continues to create additional sources of income, including selling housing plots as well as an attraction for the community and visitors alike. As trust business development manager Mike Shucksmith explains, the success is based on a combination of commercial and voluntary activity.He said: #To maintain the forest, we have to generate income so we sell split logs to the community, create woodchip for biomass boilers and are developing a micro-hydro scheme. At the same time, we have a vibrant volunteer culture in Sleat who have created a network of paths, social areas and a polytunnel where local school children can help grow saplings to regenerate the forest. The trust also operates #Skyenet # a community broadband network # a community transport scheme, Tormore Explore Forest School and the Visit Sleat tourism group, which promotes the area as a destination of choice for visitors.#From the Sleat Peninsula to the gateway to Skye in the south where a new access route to the island is being created by the members of the Broadford and Strath Community Company. They are developing a cycle path all the way from Kyle of Lochalsh to Broadford. One of the project pioneers is keen local cyclist, Andy Neison.#I used to commute from Teangue on Sleat to Kyle by bike,# he said. #I was really unnerved by the road from Breakish to Kyle with a high volume of fast-moving traffic. When friends told me about the old road from Broadford to Kyle I started exploring sections of it. It#s a good starting point and will become a pioneer project for the highlands.#After receiving a grant of £, from Sustrans, a sustainable transport charity, to fund engineering and traffic surveys, the Trust is now working to secure funding for a project officer to take the Skye Cycleway to the next phase. The community is heavily invested in the project with volunteers coming out in all weathers to clear sections of the old road, but this is a long-term project with hundreds of thousands of pounds ultimately needed to complete the full route from Kyle to Broadford.Over the Skye bridge, the Kyle and Lochalsh Community Trust is creating a vast community and visitor experience on a piece of land known as the Plock.Securing funding from the Scottish Land Fund enabled the Trust to take ownership of the Plock and the old Skye Bridge toll office and develop a masterplan for these two community assets. On the Plock itself, there will be a hub building with cafe, carpark and toilets, a network of accessible paths, a #pitch and putt# course, a Viking living village, accommodation pods, a watersports centre, wildle hide and a for thrill-seekers a huge zipline across the bay.Jo Wawrzyczek of the trust expects the Plock to attract , visitors a year. #This is an ambitious project that will cost almost £million,# she said. #However, it is very important for local people and businesses as it will help to create a great community space as well as keep visitors in our community for longer.#The trust also owns and manages the public toilets and pontoons in Kyle which will be a source of income for the project. With the aim of making the project self-sustaining, the Trust plans to lease the café and watersports centre on the Plock as well as generating income through the accommodation pods. Inspired by the success of other community-driven harbour developments such as Tobermory on Mull, Portree and Braes Community Trust want to maximise opportunities for local people and visitors through taking ownership of the harbour and improving facilities.The trust is currently in talks about relocating the oil tanks at the pier head which would be a breakthrough for the project and open up commercial opportunities. They are also considering a new road from the south to improve access and ert traffic away from the town centre. But according to development officer Fiona Thompson a new breakwater and pontoons will be the real game-changer for Portree.She said: #There have been aspirations for improvements to facilities at the harbour for over  years with little major investment.The harbour group are now closer than ever to realizing the community#s vision for a new, vibrant, welcoming port.

annual Féile an Phobail, the visual arts programme continues to attract record numbers through its doors at its base in St Mary’s University College.This year’s programme is packed full of exhibiting artists and groups represented throughout Ireland and worldwide through a range of mediums and topics including paintwork, sculpture and installations.Artists on display range from Aidan Monaghan, Andrew Whitson, Micheál Gallagher, acclaimed music photographer Conor Kerr and David Bell.Féile Operations and Events Co-ordinator Áine McCabe described the week-long event as “one that people don’t want to miss”.“I recently joined Féile, just after Christmas, and it’s been a baptism of fire,” she laughed. “Having been involved with Féile for many years, whether as a participant or volunteer, it’s a completely dferent ball game seeing behind the scenes and what goes in year on year to put the festival on in all its guises.“We have Deirdre Mackel and Micheál Gallagher working for months to bring together the exhibition, to bring together the dferent genres of art and it’s great to see so many repeat artists coming back. It’s really invaluable having Deirdre and Micheál onboard and it was incredible to see so much of an eclectic mix of people at the launch. Art and creativity is very much part of the foundation of Féile.”Aisling Award winner Deirdre Mackel has spent six years at the helm of the visual arts exhibition having previously become involved as an exhibitor. “I have seen the exhibition grow over the years, it’s brilliant to be a part of, to see the amount of people coming in and just taking their time to see the art works,” she said. “It just really warms my heart to see all the art up in St Mary’s.”Deirdre spoke of the amount of preparation that goes into the artistic showcase each year. “There is a lot of background work, the call that goes out for artists to display in the first instance. When you see people coming in and installing their art works it’s just magical. You really get a sense of what it means on launch night which we had last Wednesday, seeing what it means to people, to the artist it lts my spirits. Debuting artists would say ‘I’m so nervous’ and they come back year after year, the exhibition really encourages new artist development and another thing that comes out of it is a real sense of volunteering.”Deirdre continued: “Local artist Micheál Gallagher has also come on board and the team have been very much hands on deck. We have some really stand-out pieces from the West Belfast Arts Society, Richard Kelly and a focal point is always the Relatives for Justice Remembrance Quilt. We have a series of Civil Rights posters which were exhibited in the Tate Modern and now they have been brought to Féile.“We are seeing a lot of the artists coming here with their families and staying for the duration of the festival. The visual arts exhibit gains more and more momentum year on year.” The Féile Visual Arts Exhibition will be on display until Thursday, August . All are welcome to attend."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bmg-advert-banner-classified-v01.png","title":"shock at sudden passing of reds legend breslin","story":"THE local football community was plunged into mourning last night at the sudden passing of Cltonville legend Tommy Breslin at the age of .The former Reds player and manager died while on a family holiday in Spain.Breslin famously guided Cltonville to back-to-back Irish League titles in  and  and won eight trophies in a hugely successful four-year spell at Solitude.In the summer of , he was at the helm when Cltonville took on Celtic over two legs in an historic Champions League Qualier.He ed to the club on an interim basis following the departure of his successor Gerard Lyttle at the end of the  campaign while he was also a revered midfielder in his playing days at the club.Social media was awash with tributes last night as fans and rival supporters alike paid tribute to one of the game’s most affable and popular figures.Having updated their social media feeds to include a picture of their iconic former boss, Cltonville posted a statement which read: “Cltonville Football Club are devastated to this evening learn of the sudden and untimely death of Tommy Breslin.“While the club will naturally pay a fuller tribute to Tommy very soon, at the moment in time our thoughts are very much with the Breslin family circle and all of his many friends, to whom we extend our deepest sympathy.”Lyttle, who was also part of Breslin’s backroom team before taking over the Cltonville hotseat, tweeted: “Shocked and saddened to hear – one of the nicest men I’ve ever known.

To play in West Belfast, the atmosphere was really incredible, it was emotional.”Joby said that he is “looking forward” to sharing a stage with all who are on the ‘Greatest Hits’ bill come August .“They are good friends of mine and have all influenced me one way or another over the years, West Belfast is overflowing with talent.”A roadie “lting gear at the back of the Ulster Hall for U and the Horselips”, Joby was heavily influenced by his brother Martin and his mother Mary. “The house always had music in it,” he says.“The night at the Cultúrlann will be informal, I’ll be telling a few stories of some of the songs that I’ve written, telling of my musical adventures from when I was kid. The first song I ever wrote was Belfast when I was . Ten years later we were in the British charts, that song has really resonated with people,” he said.He continued: “I was doing a gig with Iain Archer in the Oh Yeah Centre recently and he told me that Belfast was the song that made him believe that he could have a career in music, it really took me back to hear that from him as he is credited with writing Run with Snow Patrol. He said that Energy Orchard inspired him to get into music. You never know what a song can do for a person.”Joby spoke of how much he is looking forward to getting “those characters” his musical compadres in the one room come the end of the month at the Devenish event.“Rab McCullough’s guitar playing, the energy of Baraka really rubbed off on us. On the sleeve of the first Energy Orchard album we thanked Rab and Malachy McCambridge, the keyboard player, for giving us the blues. Those days up in the Club-house on the Glen Road, they were days we’ll never forget, it was electrying. The angst of the Troubles, that pent up anger everything was exorcised on a weekly basis through Baraka’s performances.“This month is going to be a memorable one, I’m looking forward to seeing Brianon the night at the Devenish who’d be a good friend of mine. It will be a real celebration.”An Evening with Joby Fox takes place on Friday August  in Cultúrlann.

The yard means so much to this city and beyond, it needs to be re-nationalised,\" Mr Passmore said.\"We need to take ownership. All hands on deck - let’s save our shipyard.\"Unite Regional Coordinating Officer Susan Fitzgerald said that those campaigning to save the yard have been inspired by solidarity from retired workers.“The massive campaign to save Harland and Wolff has struck a chord with people throughout Belfast and Northern Ireland, including many former and retired workers,\" she said.  \"This project reminds us that Harland and Wolff was built by workers’ hands. We don’t just need to save current jobs, we also need to pass on skills to a new generation of workers’ hands”.The east Belfast shipyard has run out of money in the face of escalating financial troubles.As well as a dearth of new contracts, it has also suffered as a result of the bankruptcy of its parent company Dolphin Drilling, which put Harland  Wolff on the market in December.Administrators have said that since they were appointed four days ago, more interested parties had come forward with a view to potentially buying the shipyard, the birthplace of the Titanic.Insolvency experts Brian Murphy and Michael Jennings from business advisory firm BDO are now running the business.Newry-based MJM Group withdrew from the process after previously taking part in talks to buy the firm, while US based-investors Flacks Group also made an offer before the administration process began.

Weve laid out those concerns, we stand ready to work with the Irish Government or EU partners to resolve these problems.\"He continued: \"We want a deal, we believe that a deal is eminently doable. Weve spelt out what we think is problematic with the backstop and why it needs to be removed.\"My role is to make sure the United Kingdom, both the Government and citizens and businesses, are as well prepared as they can be whatever the outcome of those negotiations.\"Mr Gove went on to say he was \"heartbroken\" that Harland  Wolff had entered administration, but promised that other businesses which struggled because of Brexit would get help. He said a Government package called Operation Kingfisher would soon be rolled out to help viable businesses which \"temporarily\" experience some \"bumps in the road\" as well as helping them to identy new opportunities.Pressed for more detail, he said more would be revealed in the coming weeks.He also downplayed fears that , cows in Northern Ireland could face being culled due to possible harsh trade tarfs on milk pricesthere was a no-deal Brexit.\"One of my jobs is to help the agriculture sector or food and drink sector, whatever the circumstances of October ,\" he said. He denied that every business he had spoken to in Northern Ireland felt Brexit would hurt their profits, but declined to say who backed the Government plans.Speaking afterwards, Ms Guinness said: \"The meeting went quite well in so far as he was listening to what we had to say. We gave him an overview of our business and how its a pivotal role in the supply chain as a Northern Irish port between Belfast and Dublin and tried to explain the impact a no-deal would have.\"She added: \"I think its impossible to feel confident at the minute. To my mind I feel less confident as time goes on and the no-deal situation appears to become more and more likely.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38391889.ece/8e8d2/BINARY/farmersbash021.jpg","title":"kiefer sutherland and una healy among performers at framers bash live at the beach portrush photos","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Some of the features retained in the house include a stone floor that is over  years old and a Royal Mail postbox that dates back to Queen Victorias reign. The unusual detail of the thatched house with its steep roof, eaves gutter and tall chimney is unique in Northern Ireland, according to the Department for Communities.This means the house appears to the passer-by as two dwellings, each with a front door, but it is in fact a single dwelling which for most of the past century has been home to the Maccombe family.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetMurray Maccombeis the third generation of his family to live in the magnicent dwelling, which sits on a three-acre site.Speaking to the Belfast , Mr Maccombe said he has fond memories of the house going back to his early years.He said: \"My grandfather Robert Henry Maccombe bought this house around  and it has been in our family since, but the original owner was a man called Hugh McCullagh.\"At the time my grandfather bought it, it was a farmhouse but also a grocers shop hardware store and it stayed like that until  when he opened a shop separate from the house.\"I have very clear memories of visiting my grandparents and obviously living there when my father Alan took it over.\"My father passed away in  but my mother stayed on, on her own.\"I moved in with my own family in  and I will be sad to leave the house, but really it has outgrown my we and I. \"Our two daughters are away at university and the reality it the house is too large for us to upkeep, especially the gardens, but it will be a great buy for someone.\"The house is being sold for Mr Maccombe by Donnybrook Estate Agents in Derry for offers over £,.Stephen McCarron said he expects that the house will attract a lot of interest.He said: \"We are delighted to have this magnicent property on our books for sale and there has been interest shown already from people in the UK and further afield. \"It is a property steeped in history but also comes with so much potential for development and I am optimistic it will have a new owner before long.\"Further details and an appointment to view can be arranged through Donnybrook Estate Agents on   "},{"url":null,"title":"pm ready to talk to eu leaders about border backstop alternatives gove","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

stands ready to engage with any EU leader about alternatives to the Irish border backstop, Michael Gove has said..pushOn a visit to Northern Ireland, Mr Gove was asked why Boris Johnson had not taken up Taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s invite to Dublin to discuss the Brexit impasse.On Friday, Mr Gove, the Cabinet minister responsible for no-deal planning, heard about the potential Brexit challenges facing businesses as he toured Warrenpoint Port in Co Down, which sits beside the Irish border.Brussels and London remain at loggerheads over the prospect of fresh Brexit negotiations.The UK Government has said any new negotiations must focus on developing an alternative to the Withdrawal Agreement.EU leaders insist the deal cannot be reopened but will engage on potential amendments to the Political Declaration on the future relationship between the UK and the bloc.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Michael Gove talks to Warrenpoint Harbour Authority CEO Clare Guinness Earlier this week, Mr Varadkar said the invite remained open for Mr Johnson to join him in Dublin for talks on Brexit and other issues with “no preconditions”.On Friday, Mr Gove insisted his government’s links with counterparts in Ireland remain “very good”, despite the Prime Minister’s decision not to as yet take up the invitation.“I think the Prime Minister has talked to the Taoiseach and there are links at every level between the UK Government and the government in the Irish Republic,” he said.“We have very good bilateral relations and of course we are also talking to other EU partners as well.“In the event of a no-deal then naturally there will be issues to be addressed, not just security but trade issues as well.“We will make sure that we safeguard the security of the people on the island of Ireland and we will also make sure that trade continues to flow as freely as possible.”He later added: “The Prime Minister is keen to explore with European Union leaders how we can ensure we can have a withdrawal agreement that will pass Parliament.“He’s talked to leaders across the EU and he stands ready during the course of the next couple of months to speak to any EU leader and pursue with as much energy and openness as possible what alternative arrangements might be which would ensure we can secure an orderly and timely withdrawal from the EU.”The contentious border backstop is an insurance policy written into the withdrawal treaty that will ensure, come what may in future trade talks, that the Irish border will remain free-flowing post-Brexit.It would see the UK, as a whole, enter into a customs union with the EU for an indefinite period and also see Northern Ireland adhere to EU single market rules on goods.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The Cabinet minister said the UK would leave the EU on October  Askedthe Government could envisage a compromise, where a iation of the backstop could be retainedchanges were made – such as the introduction of a time limit – Mr Gove said he would not “pre-empt” negotiations with the EU.“We stand ready to work with the Irish Government, or EU partners and theCommission in order to attempt to resolve these problems,” he said.Mr Gove said in the event of a no-deal, the Government would want to see a “continuity approach” to the way goods were transported across the Irish border, reiterating the Government’s “cast iron commitment” not to have a hard border or infrastructure at the border.Asked how much the Government would spend preparing for a no-deal, Mr Gove replied: “Whatever it takes.”During his visit to the port, Mr Gove was also asked to respond to the Taoiseach’s contention that a no-deal Brexit will not enable the UK to leapfrog unresolved issues to negotiate a free trade agreement with the EU.Mr Varadkar said in the wake of a no-deal, talks on a future trading relationship would still not begin until matters in the current withdrawal agreement – such as citizens’ rights, the financial settlement and the Irish border – were resolved.“I think the Taoiseach is understandably making clear what he believes is in the interests not just of the Irish government, people on the island of Ireland, the European Union and in the UK as well,” said Mr Gove.“We have good bilateral relations with the Irish Government and good multilateral relations with other EU heads of government and we are going to carry on talking.“One of the things I am here to do is make sure I develop an even deeper understanding, issue by issue, of all the things we need to do in order to safeguard trade, jobs and prosperity across the island of Ireland and within the United Kingdom.”I dont want a general election because I believe it is important that we get on with delivering Brexit.Michael GoveAsked about the prospects of a general election in the autumn, Mr Gove said he did not want a poll.“We will have Brexit on October  – the Prime Minister has been absolutely clear that is the position in law that we have to leave the European Union and that is the date that has been agreed between the EU  and the UK,” he said.“I don’t want a general election because I believe it is important that we get on with delivering Brexit and also ensure that the other opportunities that the Prime Minister has made clear that he wants the United Kingdom to enjoy can be provided.”Mr Gove was also asked about reports that tens of thousands of dairy cattle would have to be culled in Northern Ireland in a no-deal scenario, due to the disruption to the cross-border processing chain.He highlighted that the Ulster Farmers Union had dismissed the reports.Mr Gove added: “As Defra Secretary I am on the record in the House of Commons and where having acknowledged that there are particular sectors of agriculture that face particular challenges in the event of a no-deal Brexit.“One of my jobs is to ensure that we can help agriculture and the food and drink sector whatever the circumstances after October .”"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed five schools share the top spot in gcse league table results","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

Derry motocross racer is one of many patients who are grateful for the rapid response of the Air Ambulance.Eoghan Kerlin from Dungiven was taking part in a quad motocross event in Cookstown in September  when he required medical assistance. He was out on the track and unfortunately went over a jump at the same time as another competitor and collided at speed.Eoghan came off his quad in the air, landing on his right-hand side as he attempted to clear the jump. His we Kerrie, who was at the event, immediately rang .Due to the nature of this incident and the high index of suspicion for potential injuries, the air desk paramedic who was monitoring this call spoke directly with Kerrie to gain further information. The air desk paramedic dispatched the air ambulance on the knowledge that Eoghan was badly injured and required immediate pre-hospital critical care interventions.A road ambulance was deployed and arrived shortly before the air ambulance. Eoghan had a seizure and was sedated by the HEMS team at the scene before being transferred by the air ambulance to Royal Victoria Hospital.The Dungiven man’s injuries were all down the right side and he had an open fracture in his leg, his femur was shattered, and he had broken ribs and a bruised lung.Speaking about the accident, Eoghan’s we Kerrie said: “Standing on the side-lines and watching the accident was one of the worst moments I’ve ever experience, I really thought Eoghan was going to die.“Eoghan had a seizure at the scene which was incredibly frightening but when I saw the air ambulance coming into land my anxiety reduced. Within minutes of the HEMS team arriving, all the craziness seemed to calm, and I just felt so much more at easy as the team were so professional.”As part of his recovery, Eoghan visited the air ambulance base, and the home of the Air Ambulance Northern Irelandcharity, in Lisburn to meet the team who had helped him.He updated them on his recovery, saying: “I’m still undergoing treatment for my injuries and will have to have surgery on my kneecap which has unfortunately been damaged beyond repair. But I’m here and I’m on the road to recovery and every week there is further improvement.“I owe a great deal to all of the medical professionals who helped, and continue to help, me and I’m feeling positive about the future.”Kerrie added: “As a family, we know just how important the air ambulance service is and in recognition of this, we held a fundraiser in November last year and raised £, for the charity.

And, a charity called Think Pacic provided the young woman with the vehicle to fulfil her ambition.“I’ve always wanted to go away to help people, because my degree involves quite a degree of caring for people. One of my friends at university did it last year, so I spoke to him about it and then we had a talk about at university and I looked at the Think Pacic website as well. Then I had a phone interview and got accepted for it.“After I was accepted into the programme, I just read up on it and became more interested in doing something,” Orlaith said.Think Pacic allows volunteers to sample le at the heart of remote Fijian villages far removed from what normally passes as backpacking trips in students gap years. Each team of volunteers stays in a dferent community and they are immersed into every aspect of the le of the country’s customs, values and traditions.“We had a welcome ceremony when we entered the village and were given a traditional Fijian drink called Kava. It’s a sedative drink derived from the pepper plant and it’s used for ceremonial occasions.“The Fijian’s believe in sharing everything so no one ever goes without. They are a very traditional people and we had to dress very modestly so as not to show any disrespect. Our shoulders had to be covered and we had to wear long dresses called Bula dresses and skirts called Sulu’s,” Orlaith continued.The charity was founded in the early s and adopts a bespoke approach to its volunteer work in the South Pacic country. Often, teams of volunteers are the first top have ever worked in the communities they visit because the trips only take placea Fijian community agrees to invite them there in the first place. Rather than focussing on just a single school or location it means that Think Pacic can reach thousands of children each year and spread the message of education, sport and health.This model means that the overall project is sustainable, especially as volunteers train local leaders to carry on the work after they have departed. It’s also a programme that has been fully embraced by the Fijian Government.Orlaith, a former student at Lumen Christi says that Think Pacic have taken specic steps to avoid what’s become known as ‘voluntourism’. The term refers to the growing phenomenon of iniduals travelling to developing countries to carry out volunteer work. Recently, there have been increasing concerns about voluntourism and in particular gap year projects that some have suggested that can cause more harm than good to host communities.Primary concerns are that some charitable organisations are running volunteering trips along business lines and can result in the institutionalisation of children.Orlaith Duffy’s month long stay in Fiji was on the country’s main island Viti Levu at Muanaira village- a remote rural setting around two hours from the national capital Suva.Orlaith told the Derry News: “Think Pacic have moved away from voluntourism because they know that a lot of organisations take students money and students are staying in hotels and then spending a small amount of time helping people.“So, it’s a bit contradictory. Think Pacic want you to live with villagers then every day from am until pm we would go to the school. We would teach from am until pm they do sports in the afternoon.”In fact, teaching in the in the village school where the pupil’s age range runs from six to -years of age is a vital component of the volunteering workOrlaith continued: “Think Pacic have dferent key learning aims. Schooling in Fiji is very basic, so I noticed that children at the same age over they compared to our own children here had very dferent levels of education.“Their education is so far behind because teachers just don’t have enough time or resources to focus on the children that are falling behind. We would have sat in the classroom and noticedthere were particular children falling behind. Then we would take them out and do one on one’s with them. We tried to strip it back to basics and do basic maths with them before moving on to the more dficult stuff that they were getting taught in class.“We also did a lot of letter phonics with their sounds and their grammar because sometimes they didn’t understand why certain words were put in front of other words and sentences. And we did a lot of work with past and present tenses because they weren’t sure about that either. We got to choose what age group we wanted to work with as well so the one on one sessions would have been with primary one’s up until primary sevens. So, I chose ‘kindi’, like nursey, which was five-year-olds. They were learning their alphabet and numbers and arts and crafts. We did a dferent letter with them each day. They would practice how to draw the letter and practice their numbers.”In the classroom the children are expected to converse in English-something which presents another educational challenge.Three main languages are used in Fiji-English, Fijian and Fijian Hindi. Fijian is spoken by most indigenous Fijians who account for almost  per cent of the country’s population. Fijian’s of Indian descent make up another  per cent of the population and mainly speak Fijian Hindi.The English language is a remnant of British colonial rule and was the sole official language until . English is widely used in government, business and education circles, but business is also widely carried out in Fijian, especially in rural areas.A small number of other Indigenous West Fijian and East Fijian regional languages are spoken on the islands, standard Fijian belonging to the East Fijian group. Chinese and Rotuman are also spoken by immigrant populations.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshOrlaith said: “In school it’s all English. The younger children find it more dficult and the teacher would speak Fijian to the nursery children-so half in English, half in Fijian. But everything  is done in English.”Viti Levu is the largest island in the Republic of Fiji and is home to  per cent of the entire population-around , people. The island is just over  miles long and  miles wide. Its rugged terrain is explained by the fact that it was created largely as a result of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.Territorially, the island is ided into roughly equal halves by a mountain range running from north to south. The island’s centre is covered by forest and is dominated by Fiji’s highest mountain-Mount Tomanivi which stands at , feet.The eastern side of the island experiences heavy rainfall, while the western side, also called the \"burning west\" is noticeably drier in the ranges rain shadow. Similarly, sugar cane production thrives in the west, while a dairy industry is being built in the east. Fijis biggest cattle ranch is at Yaqara, with  head of cattle on its , acres.Orlaith Duffy said: “Living with the villagers gave us a better idea of the culture. Living standards are very basic-a lot of mornings there would be no running water to wash or brush teeth. The water pressure was a lot better at night. The houses only had a single tap so the man of the house would spend time filling a lot of buckets with water so that would be used for cooking. The shower we had was a bucket with holes in it, so we just used that to wash ourselves.“In Fiji as well, the diet is very carb heavy and very sugar heavy. There’s a need to encourage children to brush their teeth so we took toothpaste and toothbrushes out there. The school I went to was already quite well developed in that way so that was good to see.“There was a man in our village and because he had severe diabetes he had to have his leg amputated. So, we carried out a health workshop and spoke about strokes and heart attacks and how to spot the signs, prevent them and what to doyou see someone taken one. We also did basic teaching on how to clean cuts and not to leave them exposed. We left first aid kits behind in the village as well.Like the domestic dwellings Orlaith said that the school buildings were also basic consisting of concrete and corrugated roofs.“If there isn’t enough room to accommodate all of the children they would add on a couple of Portacabins.“Some of the villages are remote, so people make their living from fishing. But where I stayed, because it was around two hours from the capital, I noticed that a lot of the Fijian’s who are my age where at university. When we lived with a family, we referred to the parents as our mum and dad.“My Fijian dad was in the military, so it was interesting to talk to him because he was very well travelled. The mum has a degree in accounting, but she has given it up because she’s looking after the children. But, a lot of the islanders don’t work at all because they were the ones that fell behind at school.“Luckily, our school was only a  minute walk from the village but I know that other school’s are about  minutes or an hour’s trek every day. I also noticed that sometimes the children just aren’t encouraged to go to school by their parents because some of them would have just stayed in the village during the day. I think us being there did make attendance better and the teacher noticed that the behaviour was a lot better too,” said Orlaith.The Derry News put it to Orlaith that she could have easily spent her summer backpacking in the region as opposed to volunteering-so why did she become involved “I just thought whenever I was reading on it that it made feel how lucky I was to come from here and because Cardf University gave us the chance to go and do something-I just really wanted to help then.“Some of my friends went to Africa this summer to test eyes, but I couldn’t do that because they are a year ahead of me in their studies. When I looked into Think Pacic I thought that it would be a good idea and I can always go back thereI want to because now that I’ve volunteered there will be an opportunity to go back as a leader next year.“So, I could lead a group of people that were in my position this year. Then you can go on to be a project manager and oversee a few dferent teams.“When I got there at the start I thought ‘what am I doing here on the other side of the world ’ There was no Wi-Fi, barely any signal to call home. I actually bought a ‘brick’ phone so I could call home, but it was very limited, I had to stand in certain parts of the area to get a signal.“But, once I settled in that you saw how rewarding this was because the children improved each day and the people are so friendly. They have nothing, but they never complain or never in a bad mood. The people are very community based soI was walking through the village at night dferent families would be calling me in to eat dinner with them.“It was very rare for my and my family to be eating dinner alone because there was always loads of other people in our house eating with us because they invite everyone in. Even when we were getting a bus to the village,you shout ‘bula’ that means hello, but it also means ‘be given le’.“Everyone says hello to everyone . I thought it was quite similar to home because we say hello when we walk past someone in the street, but at university in Cardf people don’t do that. They put their heads down and walk on.

To provide housing support services to prevent problems that can often lead to hospitalisation, institutional care or homelessness.And finally, to assist with a smooth transition to those leaving an institutional environment to independent living.Following a review of the Supporting People programme by the Department for Communities in , it was recommended that payment rates across all Supporting People providers should be standardised.The new rates are supposed to ensure all schemes represent value for money.However, UNISON Community Branch members have questioned the commitment of certain employers within the sector.Niall McCarroll, UNISON Community Branch Chairperson said: “The Supporting People Programme has at its core the fundamental desire to improve the quality of le of those in our communities who need housing related support at any particular time.“However, the standards of living and quality of le frontline workers are experiencing does not reflect the work they complete, as a result of substandard terms and conditions of employment increasingly pushing them into debt, putting them at risk of homelessness and forcing them to use foodbanks.”‘Amoral employers’The UNISON delegation attending the Public Consultation impressed upon the NIHE that the current measures in place to protect frontline workers were inadequate and gave “unscrupulous employers” too much power. “Power which they use to disadvantage many workers whilst their inner circles led lavish lestyles on enhance contracts of employment,” Mr McCarroll added.He said the decision-making on how to manage staffing is at the behest of Supporting People funded organisations, this needs to change.UNISON told the NIHE that the current consultation process in place, designed to improve service delivery for vulnerable people would achieve nothing and fall short of any objectives,frontline staff were not valued and respected within the programme.The NIHE estimate that frontline workers should be in receipt of band  hourly rates with no mention of other band  terms and conditions such as sick pay or sht allowances. UNISON challenged this benchmarking estimate and its lack of detail in other areas, stating this was not the reality for many Supporting People Programme workers.Mr McCarroll continued: “A UNISON delegation of frontline workers will be meeting with the NIHE to further discuss our members’ concerns and we thank the NIHE for agreeing to continue the discussions on how best to protect and value workers, not forgetting that we are all involved in this programme to work together changing the lives of vulnerable people.“UNISON would like to put on record our appreciation of the position and approach taken by the NIHE in engaging with the trade unions and our continued disappointment at the right wing, anti-trade union position and approach taken by some Supporting People funded employers.“These employers operate with an arrogant, delusionary sense of entitlement, the UNISON led Supporting People Campaign will expose these employers and continue to organise workers to stand up and fight, bringing to an end the increasingly shaky gravy train which stops only at head office, bypassing frontline services.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh\"Head office staff receive  months full sick pay while frontline workers receive just  week in any year.  This particular contractual entitlement along with signicant dferences in take home pay is leaving frontline workers feeling undervalued.\"A NIHE spokesperson said the objective of the consultation is to hear the views of service providers, current and potential service users and their families and carers to enable the Housing Executive to identy the best option and approach for implementing this recommendation.The consultation runs for  weeks, it began on  June  and ends  August .Interested stakeholders are invited to participate by completing an online questionnaire at: https:consultations.nidirect.gov.uk nihe-supporting-people srpr"},{"url":null,"title":"welshpool hand cyclist raises","story":"Andrew Paddison from Welshpool and his Lands End to John OGroats hand bike chaltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtrity ride..Picture bltspan classtruncate-full-screengty Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Welshpool hand-cyclist raises over K for charityAndrew Paddison in training for his Land’s End to John O’Groats hand bike chltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtarity ride.

That total and then some was passed in no time and has now risen above the pound, mark which has delighted Jeff.ldquoMany thanks to all the sponsors, supporters, players, umpires and scorers, Jeff enthused.ldquoThanks also to Liz Byrne, Jackie Wilson and Dave Crudgington who ran the refreshments and food made by chef Ryan Finnegan.

Harry Hitchins got the prize wicket of first team captain Ian Wright.The golden oldies rolled back the years in reply with Rodney Hassardshowing his undoubted class in his first game in five years.Woodruff made , including two big sixes off Cameron and Shilliday danced his way down the wicket, as used to be the norm, for a quick fire . Oldroydand Yeatescompleted the job with five wickets to spare.The second game saw some excellent ball striking and decent bowling from an NCU Select team.Saintfieldrsquos Byron Woodruff and the best young prospect in County Down,  year-old Adam Reid, treated all the bowlers with contempt as the runs flowed quicker than the refreshments.Man of the match Reid hit  not out in only  balls including eight boundaries and one massive six that went out of the ground.Superb all rounder Woodruff showed his old team-mates what a talent he is, hitting  in  balls with four big sixes and the same in boundaries.If both had not retired they would have scored centuries and the Dundrum bowlers were happy to clap them off. Ricky Owens then rolled back the years with a splendid , including three big sixes and three fours, the NCU side posting .It was perhaps fitting that Alan Mills, the oldest player on the pitch and still ultra competitive, finished  not out.Dundrum fought back well after the early onslaught with good fielding catching and astute field placing by captain Gavin McNerlin.Wickets were shared around with Chandar Shekhar the pick of the bowlers, taking  for  of three overs. Shilliday was again on the money and finished with  for . McNerlin, Keba Butler, Neil Reilly and Peter Calvert all got one wicket apiece.Dundrum got a steady start from Greg Hutleyand Rodney Hassard before Drumanessrsquo Neil Gelston removed them both. Oldroyd then hit the middle stump with successive deliveries leaving Dundrum on  for .McNerlin hit Gelston straight over the scoreboard in his  before Stuart Campbellwas run out by Woodruff.

The group was also taken on a walking tour of Montalto Estate in Ballynahinch.The Rowallane and Slieve Croob Community Twinning Group also organised a charity garden party to enable the visitors to meet their friends from the Rowallane and Slieve Croob areas in an informal setting, which included the councilrsquos deputy chairman, Terry Andrews, and concluded with a rousing performance of La Marseillaise.Cllr Casey welcomed the French delegation with a reception at the Millbrook Lodge Hotel, Ballynahinch.He said: ldquoThe main objectives of the three-year plan of the twinning arrangement are to organise healthy activities and events, bring generations together in experiencing two fabulous cultures and share our heritage with partners from all over the south of Ireland, west of Scotland, Galacia in Spain, Wales, the Isle of Man and Brittany.ldquoAs part of our councilrsquos strategic objectives, we are striving to become a premier tourism destination on the island of Ireland, and empowering and improving the capacity of our communities.He told the visitors: ldquoThese objectives could not have been achieved without the continued support we have received from initiatives such as twinning arrangements.ldquoFrom visiting the area and investing in our local businesses, to bringing dferent cultural experiences to the citizens of our district through ious projects, I would like to thank you.He added: ldquoOur mission as a council is to lead and serve a district that is prosperous, healthy and sustainable.ldquoI am pleased to have you all here to celebrate the  years of this twinning arrangement.

If something does not happen soon we are finished, he said.ldquoTo be owed something like pound, by a public body like the Housing Executive is scandalous and someone should step in to sort this mess out.The crisis has been sparked off by staff shortages and industrial action in the accounts department of the Executive.A spokesman for the Executive said they were extremely concerned at the situation and had brought it to the attention of the Government.ldquoThere have been a number of vacancies in the department and we are unable to fill them because of the Government ban on recruitment to the public service. The result is that we cannot porocess these settlements as quickly as we normally do.He added: We are trying to do all we can to help the smaller contractors who are always much more vulnerable in such a situation.NEWCASTLE mdash A verdict of accidental death has been ed on Newcastle motorcycle ace Tom Herron, who died at the North West  earlier this year.Thirty year-old Herron, ranked third in the world, came off his bike at mph and smashed into a lamp post just  yards from the finishing line in the cc race. He died in hospital two hours later.The inquest at Coleraine heard how Herron had ridden in the race with an injury to his thumb and arm, but the pathologistrsquos report could not determine whether this would have interfered with his ability to control the bike at high speed.Two police constables, who witnessed the accident, told the inquest that the bike scraped the ground and the rider then lost control.The coroner, Mr Robin Wray, discounted suggestions to close the Portrush circuit and said that the racing gave a great deal of pleasure to a lot of people. He added that he had seen Herron race many times and always had a great admiration for him.DRUMANESS mdash Fresh hope for the old Drumaness Mill, which was becoming something of a white elephant, emerged this week with the news that Irish Waste Services have long term plans to develop it into an industrial estate.This week a spokesman for the company confirmed they had already moved on to the site. The long term plans for the , sq ft red brick building involve the setting up of an industrial estate with potential for several hundred jobs. The firm will advertise shortly for tenants and the spokesman explained that there was a real need for small factory premises providing employment in the area.The story of the mill since it closed down when owned by Hurstrsquos as part of the Ulster Weaving Group, when at one stage it provided work for  people, has been a long saga of disappointment.The mill was sold to Irish Waste for around pound, recently. This figure falls far short of the original asking price at a public auction held in Ballynahinch last year, which was believed to be around pound,.The news of employment hopes for Drumaness was welcomed by the chairman of Down Council, Mr Eddie McVeigh, who said it was ldquogood news indeed.He added: ldquoI would welcome anything which would bring jobs to the Drumaness area and I hope that this is not one of the many disappointments which we have suffered over the last few years.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Plessey Telecommunications in Ballynahinch was closed on Monday when more than  production workers walked out as part of a national campaign to obtain shorter hours and more pay.The strike action will be repeated on the Monday of the next two weeks and the production workers are also refusing to work overtime.Their demands are for a basic skilled rate of pound, a reduction in hours to an eventual  hours a week and two extra daysrsquo holiday.A spokesman for the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions said: ldquoWe would have prefer to have obtained our realistic claim by mutual agreement with the employers, but unfortunately we are left with no other alternative.STRANGFORD LOUGH mdash A strong plea is being made to boat owners on Strangford Lough to combat the nuisance caused by inexperienced owners of large fast powerboats.It comes from Mr T W McKee, of Sketrick Island, a noted yachtsman with more than  yearsrsquo sailing experience behind him.He is annoyed by a recent ldquomafia-type display of outrageous aggressiveness by a powerboat owner and would like to find an authority with the power to control such ldquoblatant abuse of delightful waters, not to mention the risk to innocent people and their boats by sea-borne thugs.In a letter to the Recorder, Mr McKee describes how his -foot yacht was rocked from side to wide so viciously by the wash of the powerboat, which buzzed around it, that his family and grandchildren were lucky not to be seriously injured as they were flung back and forth across the wheelhouse.He has passed the complaint to the Coastguard in the hope that they can have action taken, but understanding that use of Strangford Lough as a navigable waterway is free to all who wish to use it, he does not expect any success.PORTAFERRY mdash A public meeting is to be held in Portaferry next week to protest about plans for sewage disposal in the town.The meeting has been called by the local development association, which is concerned that the scheme about to be launched will be inadequate.Councillor Paddy Doherty, a member of the development association, appealed for the support of townspeople to support the meeting so that plans can be drawn up to combat the scheme by Ards Borough Council.Mr Doherty said the council originally proposed a filter bed scheme, which would pump treated sewage into Strangford Lough, but then abandoned the filter bed idea.LOUGHINISLAND mdash It was a historic day for the community in Loughinisland when Paddy McFlynn, the president of the GAA, declared open their new Macartan Park on Sunday.The weather certainly could have been kinder for the biggest day in the history of the club, but nevertheless there was a good crowd to witness the opening, as well as the football and hurling games.Mr Vincent Doran, the chairman of the club, welcomed the distinguished guests and said Loughinisland was one of the oldest clubs in East Down.

A few weeks ago Clonduff would have been regarded as red hot favourites to progress against their Division  opponents.However, it is uncertainthe Hilltown outfit will be at full strength as several of their players headed off to the USA a fortnight ago.Clonduff were beaten - to - on Friday night by Burren and given half a chance, Pat Havern and Daniel McCarthy could take full advantage of Clonduffrsquos misfortunes and lead Saval to a surprise win.The curtain-raiser for this game is the IFC encounter between Drumaness and Glasdrumman at .pm. Drumaness are expected to progress as the Quarter Road outfit have yet to win a game this season and seem certain to be relegated from Division .A Gary Murdock-inspired Drumaness beat Glasdrumman - to - at the start of July and they will be intent on repeating that result.There are two IFC games also down for decision over at Fontenoy Park when Drumgath face Darragh Cross and Teconnaught clash with St Johnrsquos.Darragh have been involved in a tense battle for promotion into the top flight, but recent defeats to Carryduff and Longstone have dented their aspirations.However, they are a championship team and in Shane Murray, Michael Monan, Joe McKinney, Matty Hardy and Anton McGrattan they have players capable of going all the way this year and Drumgath, who lie in second place in Division , will do well to get a result.The Teconnaught v St Johnrsquos derby should be a nice opener for the Drumnaquoile side who are more than holding their own in Division  with John Clarke, Conor Morgan, Marty Keenan and the Flanagans all in good form.Teconnaught, who won the JFC title last season, will rely on Paddy Grant, Jack Larkin, Ciaran Carville, David Kelly and Tony Davis to keep them competitive.Friday night sees another four games take place mdash two in Burren and two in Newcastle.A lot of focus will naturally fall on the SFC game between Kilcoo and An Riocht in Burren.Kilcoo have made no secret of the fact that they are determined to regain the Frank OrsquoHare Cup after losing out to Burren in last yearrsquos decider.They have blooded several new faces this season and are well in the running for the ACFL Division  crown, but they will not be taking An Riocht lightly, despite theirindferent season in Division . The Branagan, Devlin, Laverty and Johnston brothers will ensure Kilcoo go into the game in the right frame of mind.At the same venue, Shamrocks clash with Tullylish with the outcome hard to predict.Tullylish have fallen from grace in recent months and have been cast adrt at the bottom of Division . Shamrocks are in the top half of Division , but it looks asthey have missed out on promotion yet again.The game of the night should be in Newcastle where Carryduff lock horns with Castlewellan in the SFC.D J Morganrsquos Carryduff side seem destined for Division , while Castlewellan are battling to avoid relegation to Division .Carryduff have really made their mark this season with James and Daniel Guinness, Owen McCabe, Ronan Beatty, John McGeogh and Josh Connery all to the fore.Castlewellan are just now starting to get a few of their walking wounded back in action and Sean Dornan, Liam, Donal and Gareth McKibbin, Colly Flanagan, Rory Burns and Daniel Morgan could prove a handful for a young Carryduff side.The curtain-raiser to this game is the IFC encounter between Annaclone and Atticall.Ciaran Branniganrsquos Annaclone have been blazing a trail of glory at the top of Division  and it is unlikely that Atticall, who are  points behind them in the table, will inflict their first defeat of the season on them.Annaclone were held to a - to - draw by a fast-improving Ballymartin side on Friday night, but they still should have too much firepower for Atticall.Saturday sees another four games take place.Top billing goes to the Loughinisland v Longstone SFC clash in Castlewellan.Loughinisland have taken Division  by storm since theirthis season and are riding high in third place after Friday nightrsquos - to - win over a good Warrenpoint offering at Macartan Park.Longstone, on the other hand, are embroiled with Carryduff for an automatic promotion place at the top of Division  and now that Ambrose Rogers and Mark Poland are back to full fitness, this should be a cracking affair.Absolutely nothing separated the sides when they met in Division  last year and the same should be the case on Saturday.Loughinisland will rely on their big hitters Dan Gordon mdash still good enough to be playing county football mdash Jonny Flynn, Rory Mason, Stefan Mason and the McClements brothers and they should progress.This game will be proceeded by the Saul v Bosco IFC encounter.Saul,they can reproduce the sort of form they showed a fortnight ago to beat Carryduff, will be expected to ease past their Division  opponents, but championship football doesnrsquot always work that way.Bosco fell to a narrow - to - defeat away to Clann na Banna on Friday night while Saul were soundly beaten - to - by Bredagh.However, Donnan Ritchie will have his charges pumped up for this encounter with the Arnold, Harney and Mahoney brothers prepared to take the game to Bosco.It will be a short trip down the road to Kilcoo for the next two games on Saturday.Glenn play Liatroim in the IFC at .pm and Bryansford take on Bredagh.Neither Glenn or Bredagh have been causing a stir this season, but now is the time to turn it on. Liatroim should be at full strength with the McCrickard connections finally finished with their county hurling commitments and the Fontenoys might just cause an upset.The big game on Saturday night is the Bryansford v Bredagh game in the SFC.Bryansford have been plagued by injuries to key players all season long, but in Davy McKibben, Ruairi Wells, Danny Savage and Conor Maginn they have the men for all jobs and I would expect them to see off Bredagh.Brendan Masonrsquos outfit hammered Saul on Friday night and in Donal Hughes, Tommy McElroy, Eoin Costello and Conor Francis they have players capable of mixing it with the best, but last yearrsquos IFC winners might find Bryansfordrsquos physicality too much to handle.There are another three games to be played on Sunday.Ballymartin face Clann na Banna in the IFC at Mayobridge at pm before Warrenpoint take on Ballyholland and Burren lock horns with neighbours Mayobridge at Pairc Esler.Ballymartin seem to have turned the corner after a few disappointing results, but they are now operating at full strength again and warmed up for the championship with a draw against runaway Division  leaders Annaclone on Friday night.Clann na Banna are sitting in a comfortable mid-table position, but I donrsquot think they will give Ballymartin too much to worry about.The Ballyholland v Warrenpoint game should be another close encounter.Ballyholland may lie bottom of the Division  table, but Warrenpoint are only four points above them. The lsquoPoint have potential match winners in the Boyles and Ross McGarry with Ballyholland looking to the Murphy brothers, Tiarnan Rushe and Seamus Loughran.The Mayobridge v Burrren game is the tie of the round.Paddy OrsquoRourkersquos side, the defending league champions and Frank OrsquoHare Cup holders, will not relinquish their grip on both trophies without a fight.They have been a little bit inconsistent of late, but bounced back to their best on Friday night with a comfortable - to - victory away to Clonduff, while Mayobridge were beaten - to - by Kilcoo.In Kevin McKernan, Donal OrsquoHare, Liam Kerr and the McAvoy brothers, Burren have the perfect blend of youth and experience, while Maybridge will look to Corey Quinn, Shane Annett and the combative Conor Garvey to keep them interested.Downpatrick and Rostrevor bring the curtain down on the first round of fixtures when they clash in Hilltown on Monday night.The sides met last Friday night in the league at Petit Park with Rostrevor winning - to -. However, Caolan Mooney, who was literally unplayable in that game, is unable to play in the championship and that could well hand the initiative to the Hoops.Downpatrick will again look to big performances from their big game players and they donrsquot come any bigger than Gerard Colllins, Michael Magee, Conor McGrady, Jarlath Branagan and the Turley brothers.Without Mooney, Pete McGrathrsquos side will look to Conor Doyle, John Connolly, Shan Parr and Piras Kane for inspiration..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Great turnout for multi cultural event in Ballynahinch  ","story":"HUNDREDS of people attended the multi-cultural family friendly celebration at The Square in Ballynahinch on Saturday.The Connecting Cultures Event was held to help promote community cohesion and encourage acceptance and understanding of other cultures.In addition to music from all over the world, there were dancers entertaining the crowd, face painting, an exotic petting farm, stilt walkers, circus skills and cuisine from ious parts of the world.The African drumming proved particularly popular, with people of all ages keen to take part.

As a charity, we rely on the generosity and support of the local community to sustain our vital work.ldquoAll money raised will help us to continue to fund cutting-edge research into the prevention, detection and treatment of the disease, raise important awareness of the symptoms and support all those who have been affected.ldquoMalachy has been a fantastic support to the organisation and it is his hope that as he retires someone from the area will take over the coordination of the Annual Street Collection and carry on his legacy.Mrs Donaghy said meningitis was a deadly disease which acts fast and is hard to detect. It can happen to anyone, of any age, at any time.ldquoThe vision at MRF is of a world free from meningitis and septicaemia, she continued. ldquoA world where effective vaccinations can protect everyone. ldquoA world where people who do get the diseases get the most effective diagnosis and treatments possible. A world where people affected, and their families, have the best support and information.ldquoIn , around , people died of meningitis and it is estimated that over one million survived who now have to live with the after effects, such as limb loss or brain injury.ldquoFunds raised through street collections such as this one in Downpatrick go a long way towards helping MRF achieve these goals.Anyone who would like volunteer for the collection in Downpatrick on August  is asked to contact Dominic Doran on  , email dominicdoran@yahoo.For more information on meningitis and septicaemia, or the work of MRF, visit www.meningitis.org or telephone   ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/17333834.the-buzz-of-the-farmers-mart/resources/images/10200707.jpg","title":"bandstand usna","story":"What genre genres do you consider your music to be How long have you been performing Where do you perform What is your favourite song to play and why What has been your biggest gig to date Any funny gig rehearsal stories Who are your major influences Do you write your own songs What would be your dream gig Best moment as a musician so far What is your lsquogo-torsquo encore song Whats the best thing about performing Do you always perform solo or do you also play with a band Any last words This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners.

His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

Of those,  have been empty for more than two years.Landlords will be given incentives to bring long term empty properties into use as the council says they attract crime and anti-social behaviour, drive down values and become ldquodetrimental to the lives of residents.Measures are set out in a draft strategy which the councilrsquos cabinet, on July , agreed to publish for public consultation.While the council wants landlords to accept help to get homes in use, the strategy says theauthority will take actionnecessary.Vale council deputy leader Cllr Lis Burnett told the meeting she was ldquostunned more than  homes in the Vale have been empty for more than two years.ldquoItrsquos absolutely staggering, she said. ldquoA strategy on a way we can tackle it is very welcome.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

The paper, which examines the negative impact of a ‘no deal’ EU exit, warns the “Northern Ireland Civil Service’s assessment remains that a ‘no deal’ would have a profound and long-lasting impact on NI’s economy and society”. Among its key points, it says a ‘no deal’ “could lead to a sharp increase in unemployment, with at least , jobs at risk, based on EU export exposure”. “The impact of EU tarfs could reduce NI’s exports to Ireland by % and the inclusion of non-tarf barriers could see a decline of %,” it says. Once again, it raises serious concerns over the agri-sector in particular, meat in particular, and beef especially, in regards to “increased vulnerability to low cost non-EU imports in the GB or NI market”. Its not just the physical goods, though as it says Northern Irelands IT sector is facing the cost of exporting services increasing, by an average of .%. And regarding foreign direct investment– one of the big business buzzwords here over the last few years – it says “under a ‘no deal’ exit, NI’s FDI attractiveness would be negatively impacted”. “A ‘no deal’ would see losses in the medium to long run of % per annum in the case of the number of FDI projects and of .% for FDI-related new jobs.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/hamilton_hotel.jpg","title":"new  bedroom hotel for titanic quarter","story":"Posted on Monday  July  by John Mulgrew Belfast looks set to get a new -bedroom hotel amid freshly submitted plans for a development across from Titanic Belfast.

While an operator for the hotel has not yet been announced, the group has developed a series of Holiday Inn hotels across the UK and Ireland, as well as Seraphine hotels.

A statement, signed by  business organisations and trade bodies, says that “two and a half years on from the collapse of the Executive, and now approaching the likely conclusion of the Brexit process, the Northern Ireland business community is deeply concerned at the continued absence of a ing administration and is calling on political representatives to redouble their efforts to reach agreement to get the Assembly and Executive working again”. “There has seldom been a time when strong and effective leadership has been more necessary, both to deliver on the domestic agenda and also to speak up for Northern Ireland in the Brexit process. “We need a fully ing administration to agree and deliver a Programme for Government that will build infrastructure, reform our health service and education system, ensure we have a strong economy, and create opportunities for our young people. We also need effective representation in the Brexit discussions, even at this late stage in the process, to ensure that the economy is protected through whatever changes arise and that all necessary mitigations are sought and secured. “The business community will give encouragement and support to those politicians who stretch themselves to reach a compromise. Without such a commitment and associated action from our elected representatives, we risk irreparable damage to our economy and our society for which future generations will judge us harshly.””  The letter has been signed by the following organisations: Belfast Chamber Causeway Chamber of Commerce CBI NI Centre for Competitiveness Construction Employers Federation NI Federation of Small Businesses Northern Ireland Freight Transport Association Hospitality Ulster IoD NI Londonderry Chamber of Commerce Manufacturing NI Mineral Products Association NI Newry Chamber of Commerce  Trade NI Grain Trade Association NI Hotels Federation NI Tourism Alliance Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry Northern Ireland Food and Drink Association Northern Ireland Retail Consortium Retail NI Women in Business NIView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/qub_1.jpg","title":"ulster business top  sees sales rise by ","story":"Posted on Monday August  by Ulster Business Michael Neill, head of office, AL Goodbody Belfast, sponsor of the Top , Flavio Malnarcic, chief financial officer, Moy Park and Ulster Business editor John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s largest businesses have seen sales rise by .% to more £.bn, the Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies list  has revealed.The list, sponsored by AL Goodbody, showcases the successes of the biggest firms from right across Northern Ireland.

Editor John Mulgrew looks at the numbers, the analysis and the once household names no longer with us The tattered corner of the Ulster Business Top  list from  probably isn’t the worst way to analogise the then state of the Northern Ireland economy, and a precursor to what was around the cornerWe’ve come a very long way in a decade, and while there are some big and familiar names on the  Top  list, there are firms which have fallen off it entirely, and resigned to the history books post-recession.In former editor David Elliott’s intro to the magazine, it references the fact that most of the accounting periods in the list were just as the downturn was starting to gather pace.Economist John Simpson, writing in the edition, says the “big recession of  and  did not impact evenly across the economy, and recovery will be best seen as a sequence of dferent proportions”.There are some positive things to take from it – including a large glowing image of Victoria Square, which in the more than  years since it opened in the heart of Belfast has become part of the retail fabric of the city.Topping the list at the time was Viridian Group, which owned Northern Ireland Electricity and now includes Power NI as a subsidiary, with turnover of £.bn. However, it made a loss of £m during that period.Second on the list is a business familiar to many. Quinn Group, headed by Co Fermanagh businessman Sean Quinn, posted turnover of £.bn for the year ending    but incurred a loss of more than £m during the same period. There have been enough column inches written about the business in the years since then to fill many a book – and they have.Among those no longer on the list is developer David Patton  SonsLtd, Armaghdown Creameries Ltd and Ballyrogan Holdings.Many others on the list have since been acquired by some of the now giants in their respective industries.Moy Park is an interesting one. Back then it was still a large player in the poultry sector with turnover of £m.Those fortunes have evidently changed dramatically since then, as the company has held the top spot on the list for the last eight years, and now posts big profits and turnover of £.bn.Meanwhile, WR Barnett is on the  list in position , with a turnover of £m and pre-tax profits of £m. In the last  years, it has climbed the list to comfortably take the number two spot with sales of almost  times that of those a decade earlier.As far as employment goes, it was Tesco topping the list in , followed by Bombardier – which at the time had a workforce of around , people – with Royal Mail and Queen’s University following in third and fourth position.A lot has happened in the years since that list. The economy has slowly but surely gotten back on its feet. Growth has been gradual, and in the last year or so has been sitting at around %, while employment levels and unemployment levels are at their respective positive record levels. However, we are amid the most challenging time for business in a generation and some of the signs, and whispered conversations, are far from positive. As I write this, we still sit on the precipice of whether we secure an agreement on Brexit, or shuffle off the edge without a parachute. Let’s hope it’s the former.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/flav_1.jpg","title":"top  moy park takes number one spot","story":"Posted on Thursday August  by Ulster Business From a purely editorial perspective it would be refreshing to have a dferent company head up the Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies list.But Moy Park has now made it to the top for eight consecutive years, as the poultry processing giant continues to expand both its workforce, global sales and pre-tax profit – firmly setting its place at Northern Ireland’s biggest business, with a workforce of more than , here alone.In the last year, it has grown turnover to just over £.bn, up from £.bn a year earlier, while pre-tax profits have surged by % – rising to £.m in its latest set of accounts, ending December .The business supplies Moy Park branded and own label chicken products to leading retailers and foodservice providers throughout the UK, Ireland and Europe.In numbers, Moy Park processes six million fresh chickens each week, , turkeys a year, along with , tonnes of other ‘added value products’.London-born Chris Kirke replaced long-serving boss Janet McCollum in , less than a year after Craigavon-based Moy Park was taken over by new US owners Pilgrim’s.And around a year ago, Flavio Malnarcicjoined the business – then as executive business director – before taking over as the firm’s chief financial officer.He was formerly business director at JBS Global, and has a senior leadership background as executive director of the poultry and export business in Seara, also as chief financial officer and chief executive at Tyson do Brazil and finance roles in Cargill.“There has been a consistence in the performance. We have been growing volumes… we got to six million birds each week, which is about a third of the UK market. For the UK, it is a signicantly big company.“Looking year-over-year, our performance was very consistent in the last few years.”“For people working there, working for a company which is the largest employer in a country, the top company, it is a source of pride for us.“But I don’t think that drives the behaviour of the team. We are more interested in making sure that our performance is sustainable in terms of margins.“It is nice that we arebut that is not our main goal. We are making sure that we are sustainable, work on quality, safety. There are lots of other things. It’s making sure that we fit our customer needs.“We have a lot focus on that, and we need to be competitive.”And as for growth, expanding turnover isn’t necessarily the main focus, according to Flavio“A lot of the efforts in the last year have been to consolidate the management tools they have in Pilgrim’s. They are very keen on efficiency, so that’s one of their strategies. “ a lot of focus in improving our performance, it’s how we can be more efficient, focusing on a portfolio that feeds our customer base, how we deal with our customers.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
