for it it was available","story":"A street in London’s Chelsea district. Rents in the city are up by 16 per cent and in some boroughs  have increased by 30 per cent. Photograph: Getty ImagesTim was trying to showcase the soundproofing effect of an extra sliding panel on the bedroom window but as he yanked and pushed from every angle he could think of, it remained resolutely stuck halfway across.“There’s a few bits and pieces that need fixing,” he said.He had used the same words a few minutes earlier as he pointed to a missing knob on a kitchen drawer, ignoring the cracked, discoloured sink next to it and the broken fan above. I was fairly sure I didn’t want to live in this dark, poky and rather grubby flat but it did have one thing going for it: it was available.When I heard a few weeks ago that I had two months to leave my current place, my first response was to ignore it, hoping for the date to be deferred until something turned up unbidden. I sidled up to the porter, asking him if he knew of anyone moving out of the building so that I could minimise the disruption and avoid the trouble of changing address.He had a hot lead on a flat one floor below me with a slightly better view but when I called the agent, he told me it had gone within a couple of days of going up on the website. I looked at a place across the square, led through his bedroom by the current tenant as he picked up clothes strewn across the floor but it soon became clear that I would have to look further afield.The scale of the challenge took shape right away when Angelika took me on a lightning tour of a large flat in a gated community, available immediately for a king’s ransom. She told me that if I was interested, I had better get an offer in right away because it was likely to go quickly, possibly at above the listed price.“This month last year I had 100 properties to let around here. Now I have 16,” she said.Grim reportsWhenever I saw something promising, a friend would warn me that the innocent-looking building I was considering was a thriving hub for sex work or had some other unwelcome distinction. One handsome old building overlooking the river had three flats available but its charm dimmed when I heard about an outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease there two years ago and grim reports about its ancient infrastructure.I thought I had struck gold when Mario showed me a lovely, bright flat in an old-fashioned mansion block known locally as the Elephant’s Graveyard where I would have been among the younger residents. But before the viewing was over, he offered to show me another place “just in case”, which turned out to have all the character of a brightly lit lavatory in a half-empty shopping mall.During the pandemic, London estate agents reported a “doughnut” effect as people left the city centre for the outer suburbs, looking for bigger homes to work from. Executives renting a pied à terre in central London found they no longer needed it during lockdown and at the other end of the scale, students went home to their parents as lectures went on Zoom.This time last year, rents in inner London were falling by an average of 10 per cent per annum as landlords found themselves with empty flats they were desperate to rent. Now they are up by 16 per cent and in some boroughs rents have increased by 30 per cent.The supply problem that Angelika identified is driven by a number of factors, including the reluctance to move out of tenants paying rents agreed during lockdown. But supply is squeezed further by a surge in landlords deciding to sell up, as mine has done after more than 20 years.A rising property market is one reason for landlords to sell and one estate agent suggested that some sales were driven by a need for cash as businesses found themselves in trouble during the pandemic. Angelika had a more interesting theory.“Everyone’s getting orced after the lockdown,” she said.In fact, there were fewer orces in England and Wales in 2020 than in the previous year although the suspension of family court sittings may conceal the true extent of marital unhappiness. Touring an attic flat a few days later, the estate agent told me that although the tenants had left, they had yet to remove all their belongings.“They broke up,” he said.“But they were very happy here.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"About 2.4 million forced to leave their homes during 13-year-long war with Boko HaramTom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"bbc accused giving vladimir putin politician propaganda platform","story":"The BBC has been accused of giving a platform to a Putin “propagandist” and allowing the “absolute falsification of history” to be broadcast.The Newshour programme on BBC World Service interviewed Vitaly Milonov, a Russian politician in Vladimir Putin’s ruling party who claimed that Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine is a “reasonable reaction” to “aggression”.He also said that Mr Putin’s invasion was “a very necessary and important job” and claimed that people in occupied regions in the east of Ukraine were “welcoming the liberators with flowers”.But the BBC came under fire from Prof Michael McFaul, a former US ambassador to Russia, who asked: “If it was September 1, 1939, would you put on the air a member of the Nazi Party to try and explain this ridiculous absolute falsification of history and information that we just heard from Mr Milonov?”Prof McFaul, who was the US ambassador in Moscow from 2012 to 2014 and is now a professor of international studies at Stanford University, said it was an “ethical question” for the BBC.He accused Mr Milonov of talking “complete and utter nonsense”, adding: “I am wondering if we are doing a service for the world by giving him a voice on the BBC?”‘Utter propagandist uttering nonsense’Prof McFaul, who was interviewed on the programme just after Mr Milonov, said: “I don’t like to be on the news with an utter propagandist who is uttering nonsense about what is happening in Ukraine - there are no flowers being thrown in front of tanks.“This is misinformation that we have just broadcast to the world and I am not sure that is an ethical position for the BBC given the gravity of what is going on in Ukraine today.”Mr Milonov, a politician for the ruling United Russia party, has served as a Member of the State Duma for Saint Petersburg South since 2016.He has previously been honoured by Mr Putin for his work in drawing up the law banning the dissemination of “gay propaganda” among minors.The politician is also known for vociferous statements against gays, calling repeatedly for a “moral police” force in St Petersburg and organising raids on gay clubs in Russia\u0027s second city.On Thursday, he defended Mr Putin’s invasion of Ukraine as a “reasonable reaction towards the aggression” adding it was “small payback time” to Europe.He told the Newshour programme: “You used this country for your own personal political needs to act against Russia - and now you did not succeed so you are trying to cry in the most dramatic way that poor Ukraine is under aggression.”Claiming Europe was to blame for the invasion, he added: “Haven’t you foreseen this situation that if you are trying to force Russia there with the small puppies, trying to bark at Russia, trying to kill Russians in Donetsk and Luhansk, sometimes it can happen vice versa?”A BBC spokesman said: “It’s vitally important to hear voices from all sides at this time and to try to gain an insight into Russia’s motivations.“Our presenter robustly challenged Mr Milanov throughout this interview, pointing out that Ukraine is a sovereign country with a right to self-determination.”More from NewsWhat war in Ukraine could mean for you on the home frontRussia-Ukraine latest news: Kyiv under attack in ‘horrific rocket strikes not seen since 1941’What Nato is doing now in response to the Russia invasion of UkraineWhy have Russia invaded Ukraine?Russia seizes Chernobyl as forces advance on KyivNew laws will give everyone the power to take down online trollsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"former public schoolboy took life sacked via zoom top apprenticeship","story":"A former public schoolboy took his own life 13 minutes after he was sacked via Zoom from his apprenticeship at a major accountancy firm, an inquest heard. Oliver Bredski, a 21-year-old former pupil at Manchester Grammar School, was discovered hanging at his parents\u0027 home following a 14-minute video call with his bosses at Deloitte in August 2020.  His sister Rachel managed to cut him down with the help of a neighbour, with paramedics able to later resuscitate him. The keen sportsman and Liverpool supporter was left with severe brain injuries, forcing doctors to place him into a coma.Eleven months later, they turned off his life support after agreeing there was no chance of recovery. The inquest in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, heard how executives at Deloitte had dismissed Oliver from his apprenticeship as a trainee analyst during a performance review. There had been complaints that he had watched Netflix during office hours and had worked from the offices of a rival company, because he had friends there. His bosses told the coroner’s court he had been performing poorly in comparison to other trainee analysts and had placed him on a series of reviews.The Zoom call, which took place nearly two months after Covid restrictions were lifted following the first UK lockdown, ended at 11.17am on August 25 2020. Oliver was then found at 11.30am. He passed away on July 30 last year.Oliver\u0027s father, Martin Bredski, a 62-year-old company director who runs a retail firm, said: “Lockdown was a struggle for Oli and it must have affected his work. The company took a Zoom call of maybe 11 minutes or so to consider the future of a 21-year-old boy.“Oliver passed away last July but the truth is that we really lost Oliver that terrible day in August 2020 when for a brief moment he mistakenly thought his dreams, his hopes and plans had been brutally ripped away from him.”Deloitte said after the inquest: “This is an incredibly tragic event which we are deeply saddened by.

But they have been blind to the way those decision-makers have spent 30 years promoting just one kind of post-school education, namely the classical model of full-time, academic-generalist three-year university degrees aimed at 18-year-olds.Mass higher education was supposed to mean higher productivity and a more tolerant, socially mobile society. Teachers favoured it and parents saw it as the route to success for their children. It was administratively simple, with universities providing courses students wanted, underpinned by a generous state loan system. But now we have reached Tony Blair’s goal of half of school leavers at university, the unintended consequences of this model have become unbearable. The Government is today announcing sanctions for poor quality university courses, a rejigging of student finance so more will repay their loans, and a renewed focus on non-academic technical and digital courses.The great rebalancing of post-school education and training is under way. And not a moment too soon. We need our great research universities to flourish and must continue to attract foreign students. But from under-providing higher education in the 1980s we are now oversupplying it and the consequences are economic, social and political.The labour market is flooded with academic-generalists when their professional-managerial jobs have, with some exceptions, stopped growing. One third of graduates are not in graduate jobs 10 years after graduating while we have a chronic shortage of “missing middle” technical skills, and a recruitment crisis in care.Employers have noticed that the signalling system that meant someone with a degree had a high level of general academic ability no longer applies. There is a switch to hiring school leavers supported by the Government’s lifetime skills guarantee and other measures. Parents, too, no longer assume that a degree is a ticket to security according to recent polls, (though many young people still like the idea of three years away from home subsidised by taxpayers).Socially, some people from disadvantaged backgrounds have risen up via university into the elite, but that happened before mass higher education, too. As recently as the late 1980s, when only 20 per cent of school leavers went to university, most professionals didn’t have degrees and completed on-the-job training combined with part-time study.Social mobility academics say mass higher education has, if anything, slowed mobility because universities are monopolised by the middle and upper-middle classes. And because of our mainly residential system, many of the brightest kids from declining areas leave home and never return. This graduatenon-graduate schism contributed to Brexit.What has been called “elite over-production” produces two sets of losers: those who didn’t go to university in the first place who see all the prizes reserved for graduates, and the bottom part of the graduate class who aren’t getting the high-status jobs they expected. Educated people tend to be more extreme and more ideological in their thinking: mass higher education plus social media equals a more intolerant political culture.Turning the tanker will take time. Record numbers are still heading to university and government sanctions will be easy to avoid. But many of the newer universities are likely to revert to something like their old polytechnic status, offering vocational and technical courses (as they already do) on a more flexible basis, to a broader age cohort of students. I would also like to see a sharp reduction in the 40 per cent of jobs that are advertised as graduate-only, which artificially sustains many courses. There are plenty of capable people who didn’t do well at exams and who, in recent years, have found themselves squeezed out of professional careers in which they could have flourished.Going to university was always partly a copy-cat status game. Rising pay levels for skilled trades and technical occupations is now shifting ideas of status, as is the rise of what James Kirkup has called the posh apprenticeship. When, for all but the most academically inclined, not going to university is cooler than going, rebalancing will be unstoppable.More from NewsWhat war in Ukraine could mean for you on the home frontRussia-Ukraine latest news: Kyiv under attack in ‘horrific rocket strikes not seen since 1941’What Nato is doing now in response to the Russia invasion of UkraineWhy have Russia invaded Ukraine?Russia seizes Chernobyl as forces advance on KyivNew laws will give everyone the power to take down online trollsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"russia has triggered return existential dread","story":"If the BBC was fuelling the sense of foreboding that, once again, seems to permeate modern life, it was compounded by the man of the hour himself. Vladimir Putin’s blood-curdling rhetoric belied the assessment some had of the Russian leader as a pragmatic master-strategist. Here, it seemed, was a barking-mad demagogue intent on conquest.As the T-64 battle tanks rumbled forwards and SU-27 fighters screamed over the port of Odesa, he said: “Whoever would try to stop us and further create threats to our country, to our people, should know that Russia’s response will be immediate and lead you to such consequences that you have never faced in your history. We are ready for any outcome.”Watching this tragedy unfold were our poor children. They have spent the past two years terrified that their parents or grandparents will be killed by a virus they are blamed for spreading, even if does not affect them much. They are assailed daily by predictions of imminent climate disaster. And now they are faced with wild talk of a Third World War.We must hope such predictions are wide of the mark, and they surely are, but the fear is real enough. Helen, a 56-year-old mother of four from north London, recounted how her daughter, 16, had called down from her upstairs bedroom about the Russian threat. “She had been reading a website that recommended building a fireproof shelter in the event of a nuclear strike and was wondering if we should get some materials. She was quite serious. We didn’t know what to say.”Helen says: “Like many of her friends, she became terribly anxious during Covid, fearful that she might infect us or her gran – and now this. You want to say everything will be fine, but they are not daft.”Others fear this will end with their sons conscripted to fight the third full-scale European war in just over 100 years. One mother said: “It brought to life all those documentaries they watch about the Second World War. They were also listening to the sirens and wondering whether there are sirens set up around London – Kyiv doesn’t look that dissimilar to them, so it all feels very real. And hopeless: they can see it’s a David vs Goliath situation, so listening to people in Kyiv talking about defending themselves and their families feels heartbreaking.”To be fair to our political leaders, they had been predicting this eventuality for weeks, even being accused by Putin apologists of “war-mongering”, despite 150,000 troops amassed on the frontier rather giving the game away.Because so many in the West do not trust what their governments say about anything, the invasion warnings issued by Joe Biden and Boris Johnson were given short shrift. But for once, our intelligence was on the money.That the invasion came as such a shock is partly down to a sense, developed over years of peace, that such things just don’t happen in Europe anymore, even though they did relatively recently in the Balkans.When Moscow was the centre of the Soviet Union, things were simpler, if just as scary. The Cold War was as much an ideological as a territorial conflict. The communists wanted to spread their creed around the globe the free, capitalist West wanted to stop them. We won.During the Cold War, we lived under the constant threat of nuclear obliteration as the two sides built up an ever greater capacity to wipe out humanity 10 times over. Terms such as “nuclear winter” and “Mutually Assured Destruction” (or MAD) were part of everyday conversations. Films like Dr Strangelove told of deranged generals taking over nuclear bases, sending bombers to drop their payloads on Moscow and triggering a response that wiped out life on Earth.The Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 came close to pushing the world over this precipice and has parallels with today. The US objected to the presence of Soviet missile bases on an island a few hundred miles from Florida, just as Putin has long resented Nato pushing up to the threshold of Russia.President Kennedy threatened a nuclear war, forcing Nikita Khrushchev to back down. In 1983, Soviet radar picked up the launch of American intercontinental ballistic missiles against Russia and, had it not been for the scepticism of a Red Army general, could have led to a retaliation, plunging the world into war. The Soviet early warning system had malfunctioned and we came close to Armageddon.Throughout the Sixties and Seventies, nuclear war, not climate change or pandemics, was what kept most of us awake at night – but it never seemed a real threat because the price was terminal for everyone. We were told we had four minutes to prepare for oblivion if an attack was launched. One public information film suggested taping brown paper to the windows, though why was never made clear.Fear of a nuclear holocaust abated with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1990. Although the stockpiles were retained, no one seriously thought we would end up using them. There has never been anyone insane enough to contemplate it. We can only hope there still isn’t.Previous generations had their own nightmares. When the Second World War began in September 1939, nothing much happened in the west while Germany and Russia carved up Poland between them and the Wehrmacht moved towards Ukraine. The months of so-called Phoney War offered hope that Hitler’s ambitions lay elsewhere, until May 1940 shattered that illusion. In August 1914, on the cusp of the Great War, the threat was hardly mentioned in British newspapers that were more preoccupied with goings-on in Ireland.Surely by now we had learned our lessons.Yet rather than seeking to incorporate Russia into the comity of nations, there was an element of western triumphalism that rankled with nationalists like Putin, and a loss of land they were determined to reclaim at some point. That point has come.For the greatest part of man’s existence war, famine, privation, plague and misery have been ever present. Covid notwithstanding, none of these has been visited on us in the West for two or three generations. We have forgotten the fear and alarm they can generate.But we should also acknowledge that we are still the lucky ones. The real war is more than 2,000 miles away, and its victims are the 44 million people who live in a vast and fertile country long known as the “breadbasket of Europe”.The shock there is palpable. Many had thought Russia was bluffing. As the reality dawned, people who were able to fled westwards, jamming the highways, while those who stayed queued for food and drained the banks of cash. A few tried to carry on as normal and went to work. One resident moaned: “The only unusual thing is that you can’t find a taxi.” Such stoical resistance may yet give the Russians a bloody nose, as the Afghans 40 years ago.Ukrainians will fight for their land so if people here feel dread and apprehension, think of them. The wail of air raid sirens, a sound that once chilled the blood of millions of Europeans, is once more echoing in the streets of Kyiv and Kharkiv. Not for the first time, the forward march of history has slammed on the brakes and gone into reverse.Somehow we must find the words to address and soothe the very real fears of our children.More from NewsWhat war in Ukraine could mean for you on the home frontRussia-Ukraine latest news: Kyiv under attack in ‘horrific rocket strikes not seen since 1941’What Nato is doing now in response to the Russia invasion of UkraineWhy have Russia invaded Ukraine?Russia seizes Chernobyl as forces advance on KyivNew laws will give everyone the power to take down online trollsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"small patch desert could came","story":"It is an unassuming patch of desert, about 250 miles north of Khartoum in Sudan, but it may be the ancestral homeland of everyone alive today.Scientists at the University of Oxford have applied computer modelling to thousands of ancient and modern genomes to create a vast family tree showing how iniduals across the world are related to each other, and from where they originated.It suggests that everyone is partially related to a group of hominids who lived in north-east Africa more than a million years ago. It even points to a grid reference: 19.4N, 33.7E, a small area of Sudan.“The very earliest ancestors we identify do indeed trace back in time to a geographic location that is in modern Sudan,” said Dr Anthony Wilder Wohns, the study’s lead author, who undertook the research as part of his PhD in Oxford and is now at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard University.“These ancestors lived up to and over one million years ago – which is much older than current estimates for the age of modern humans – so bits of our genome have been inherited from iniduals that we wouldn’t recognise as modern humans, but who most likely lived in north-east Africa.“Essentially, we are reconstructing the genomes of our ancestors and using them to form a vast network of relationships. We can then estimate when and where these ancestors lived.”Network of nearly 27 million predecessorsResearchers said there is some uncertainty about the exact location because of sampling bias, which means that certain areas are not represented. However, they said the findings are compatible with early modern human fossils from eastern and northern Africa.“At any point in the past we would have had very large numbers of genetic ancestors,” added Dr Yan Wong, an evolutionary geneticist at Oxford’s Big Data Institute.“The ones that our method locates at the oldest times happen to primarily live in NE Africa, but there are likely to have been others scattered over that continent, which our approach is not powerful enough to pinpoint.”The earliest evidence of ancient hominids comes from South Africa. However, Kenya’s Rift Valley and Botswana have all been suggested as locations for the birthplace of humans.Researchers plan to add more genomes to the database as they become available, which will help to give a more accurate location of where the ancestors of humans originated.“It is likely that if we had more comprehensive sampling of modern and ancient genomes within Africa, the estimated locations of our earliest genetic ancestors would change,” added Dr Wilder Wohns.‘A genealogy for all of humanity’To create the family tree, researchers took 6,500 modern and ancient genomes from more than 215 different human populations and used computer power to work out how they were linked, and the timing of genetic changes.The algorithms predicted where common ancestors must have been present in evolutionary trees, eventually leading to a network which contained almost 27 million predecessors.After adding location data on these sample genomes, the authors were able to estimate where the ancestors had lived.The results successfully recaptured key events in human evolutionary history, including the migration out of Africa and when the Americas were first inhabited. However, the team hopes that when more genomes are added, it will start to show ancient human movements which have been lost in time.Dr Wong said: “We have basically built a huge family tree, a genealogy for all of humanity that models as exactly as we can the history that generated all the genetic variation we find in humans today.“This genealogy allows us to see how every person’s genetic sequence relates to every other. This study is laying the groundwork for the next generation of DNA sequencing. “As the quality of genome sequences from modern and ancient DNA samples improves, the trees will become even more accurate and we will eventually be able to generate a single, unified map that explains the descent of all the human genetic variation we see today.”The research has been published in the journal Science.More from NewsWhat war in Ukraine could mean for you on the home frontRussia-Ukraine latest news: Kyiv under attack in ‘horrific rocket strikes not seen since 1941’What Nato is doing now in response to the Russia invasion of UkraineWhy have Russia invaded Ukraine?Russia seizes Chernobyl as forces advance on KyivNew laws will give everyone the power to take down online trollsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"vegan craving jackfruit sends prices soaring ridiculous 160","story":"Even at London’s Borough Market, infamous for pricey produce, eyebrows were raised at the sight of a single jackfruit, yours for… £160.Tweeted by Ricardo Senra, a Brazilian journalist, the image went viral in his home country, where the large fruit is ubiquitous, often left to rot on the ground and can sell for as little as 81p.Brazilians joked about moving to the UK to become multi-millionaires.The jackfruit is able to command such prices because of its recent rise in popularity with vegans, who use it as a trendy meat substitute.Unlike many highly processed competitors, it is seen as a natural alternative to steaks or burgers. Its fleshy strands - technically petals - have a texture similar to pulled pork and are an excellent conduit of flavour.Borough Market is not the only UK stockist of the whole, fresh fruit. On londongrocery.net “whole Mexican jackfruit” at 10-14kg can be yours for £109.99 – and that is on sale. A disclaimer hints at the fruit’s highly perishable nature: “It’s not possible to assess the ripeness of the fruit. Buyers should buy this product at their own risk.”Kate Howell, director of communications for Borough Market, said: “Borough Market is London’s world-class food destination and, as such, offers shoppers a whole range of produce. The fresh jackfruit is one of our more unique items and is creating lots of interest from food lovers looking for something not usually available in the UK.”Sejal Sukhadwala, an Indian-born, London-based food writer who wrote the upcoming The Philosophy of Curry, has a different take. “It’s ridiculous,” she said. “It’s the gentrifying of an ordinary ingredient which people in Asia, the Caribbean and African countries use on a daily basis.”In her local Sri Lankan greengrocers in north west London, Ms Sukhadwala can find packets of pre-prepared bulbs or seeds for around £2 to £3. “Who would buy one for £160?” she said. “It’s making it exclusive, most people can’t afford it.” Not to mention that the thick skin and extremely sticky insides make it difficult to prepare at home.Another more affordable option is to buy it tinned. Health-food shops and supermarkets sell it in cans, usually marketed as “young green jackfruit”, for up to £4 for 400g.The jackfruit, related to figs and mulberries, is native to south east Asia and south India, where it has been cultivated for thousands of years. The Portuguese took the fruit to Africa and South America. It now grows wild across the tropics. With a yellowy-green colour and a thick, spiky skin, the world’s biggest fruit can weigh up to 55kg.When unripe, the flavour is subtle, somewhat similar to artichoke hearts, maturing into a deeply distinctive, nutty taste with notes of banana, pineapple and mango. To the uninitiated, the aroma can overwhelm, with a hint of rotting onion. High in dietary fibre, vitamins A and C and potassium, the seeds are full of protein and the fruit is low in calories. It has been consumed in south and south east Asia for millennia, and it is even the national fruit of Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.According to consultancy IndustryARC, the international jackfruit market is set to grow by 3.3 per cent annually until 2026, when it is predicted to reach £52.75 million.More from NewsWhat war in Ukraine could mean for you on the home frontRussia-Ukraine latest news: Kyiv under attack in ‘horrific rocket strikes not seen since 1941’What Nato is doing now in response to the Russia invasion of UkraineWhy have Russia invaded Ukraine?Russia seizes Chernobyl as forces advance on KyivNew laws will give everyone the power to take down online trollsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"another oil price shock would defeat west","story":"We seem to stand impotent in the midst of another watershed moment in world affairs. The tectonic plates are shifting in a way not seen in more than 30 years. But unlike the spirit of hope and optimism that characterised the last such moment – the fall of the Berlin Wall – a much darker prospect now looms.Either we just accept whatever Putin plans for Ukraine, and after much huffing and puffing simply learn to live with it, as we have with all his other land grabs. Or we make the deep sacrifices needed properly to address the threat that Russia now poses to the Western order of things.Are Western electorates even remotely prepared for the economic deprivations that this latter course of action – a war with Russia in all but name – is likely to entail? The already near hysterical political reaction to the current cost of living squeeze, with real incomes forecast by the Bank of England to fall by 2 per cent this year, suggests strongly that they are not. Without wishing to trivialise today’s hardships, they are as nothing compared with what would come.“Welcome to the brave new world where Europeans are very soon going to pay €2,000 for 1,000 cubic metres of natural gas,” said Putin’s sidekick, Dmitry Medvedev, rubbing it in over Europe’s unfortunate dependence on Russian gas. Putin’s thinly disguised threat to use nuclear weapons if the West retaliates – what else could he have meant by a response “never seen in history”? – further ups the ante.Condemnation from Western political leaders has been almost universal, but it is not at all clear that the public would be behind them if it came to making a credible stand. European sanctions thus far have notably stopped a long way short of curtailing Russian natural gas supplies.A poll this week found little support among Americans for major US involvement in the RussianUkrainian conflict. Former president Donald Trump has meanwhile gone so far as to express virtually unqualified admiration for Putin’s assault.There have been conflicts aplenty involving Western nations in the eight decades since the Second World War, but they have tended to be both relatively small in nature andor in faraway places, with little direct impact on livelihoods and comforts back home.We have grown so complacent and lazy on the fruits of globalisation that the idea of anything more than a temporary interruption in the onward march of economic progress is so far beyond any recent experience as to be thought almost impossible.Yet at the very least, we seem to be facing the possibility of something similar to the 1973 oil price shock, an event that presaged a decade of political, social and economic upheaval. If the West cuts itself off from Russian oil and gas, there would be a similar ratcheting up in energy costs.Alternative sources of energy supply are admittedly far more erse than they were back then our economies are less energy intensive, and they adapt quickly to changed circumstances. But natural gas, in particular, is not an easily exportable commodity Europe is tied at the waist to the Russian supplies it receives through Ukraine. Already punishingly high fuel bills would go into orbit if that supply were seriously jeopardised. A combination of nukes and energy give Putin the whip hand.The impact on other commodity prices of taking him on would scarcely be any less punishing. Famously known as Europe’s bread basket – which is one reason why, historically, Ukraine has been so bitterly fought over – the region is one of the world’s major producers of wheat and other foodstuffs.An inflationary surge similar to that which followed the oil embargo of 1973 therefore becomes a distinct possibility. In America and large parts of Europe there was rationing at the pumps, and in the UK, where the oil price shock combined with an economically devastating coal miners’ strike, there were price and wage controls – largely futile, as it turned out. Society seemed on the brink of collapse. Governments fell like ninepins before the inflationary tsunami.There is little monetary policy can do when confronted with cost-push inflation of this sort, for the trouble with rising energy prices is that they are both inflationary and deflationary at the same time. They add to costs, but by reducing the amount of income in people’s pockets for discretionary spending, they also stifle demand. Pretty soon “stagflation” – a destructive combination of high inflation and economic stagnation – sets in.So forgive my scepticism when the West promises to put up a meaningful fight against Putin’s power play. Even ignoring the threat of nuclear annihilation, the price of defiance will be high. It is not clear that mollycoddled Western voters have the stomach for it. By all means, Europe must scramble to wean itself off dependence on Russian gas, but exactly the same thing was said in 2014 after Putin annexed Crimea. Instead we got Nord Stream 2 and the closure of Germany’s remaining nuclear power stations. Small wonder Putin thinks he can get away with it.More from NewsWhat war in Ukraine could mean for you on the home frontRussia-Ukraine latest news: Kyiv under attack in ‘horrific rocket strikes not seen since 1941’What Nato is doing now in response to the Russia invasion of UkraineWhy have Russia invaded Ukraine?Russia seizes Chernobyl as forces advance on KyivNew laws will give everyone the power to take down online trollsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"11 labour mps face suspension","story":" Labour MPs threatened with suspension for signing Stop The War letter attacking NATOOne Labour source warned the left wingers they “can be a mouthpiece for the Kremlin or a Labour MP, but not both”this.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video sir-keir-starmer-responds-russian-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:pJdmzu,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,pubmaticVideoPrebidEnabled:true,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,blackFridayWidget.linkUrl:https:www.mirror all-about black-friday,prebidUseTestRuntime:true,blackFridayWidget:,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,justpremiumDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,nonIframeMantisRecommender:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,amp.trackonomics.enabled:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,mantisRecommender.useIntTracking:true,blackFridayWidget.Link:https:get-latest.dev.convrse.media black-fridayblack-friday-widget-v.,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,mantisRecommender.hbEnabled:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,openxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,nobidDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,publicationName:Mirror,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,trackonomics.id:reachplc_cDEYX_mirror,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],video.ctpFloatAndPark:true,felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,breakingNewsPull:true,nobidVideoPrebidEnabled:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Some  Labour MPs signed the open letter by the left-wing campaign group, which questioned NATOaposs legitimacy and accused the defensive alliance of eastward expansion.It also claimed the UK Government of having no proposals for a diplomatic solution to the crisis and says Britain needs to change its policy, and start working for peace, not confrontation. The partyaposs chief whip Sir Alan Campbell has contacted the  MPs warning them they faced losing the party whipthey do not back down. It is understood all  asked for their signatures to be removed as a result. It comes as Russian troops advance towards Ukraineaposs capital of Kiev and news that Moscow forces had taken the former nuclear plant of Chernobyl.A Labour source told the Mirror: “You can be a mouthpiece for the Kremlin or a Labour MP. But not both.”The letter was signed by former frontbenchers Diane Abbott, John McDonnell, Richard Burgon and Ian Lavery, as well as Beth Winter, Zarah Sultana, Bell Ribeiro-Addy, Apsana Begum, Mick Whitley, Tahir Ali, and Ian Mearns.Two independent MPs - former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and Claudia Webbe - also signed the letter.It comes as more than  have been killed after Moscow launched a brutal invasion of Ukraine by land, sea and air. NATO general-secretary Jens Stoltenberg described the assault as a deliberate, cold-blooded and long-planned invasion” by Putin.  Several Western governments, including the UKaposs, have spent days urging the Russian President not to launch an assault on its neighbour, as Putin spread disinformation and amassed , troops at the border. Despite Putinaposs assault on Ukraine, the letter calls for a diplomatic solution, and adds STW believes NATO should call a halt to its eastward expansion and commit to a new security deal for Europe which meets the needs of all states and peoples.  The letter says: We refute the idea that NATO is a defensive alliance, and believe its record in Afghanistan, Yugoslavia and Libya over the last generation, not to mention the US-British attack on Iraq, clearly proves otherwise.  Boris Johnson told the Commons the UK was bringing forward the largest and most severe package of sanctions that Russia has ever seen. The Prime Minister told MPs “this hideous and barbarous venture of Vladimir Putin must end in failure” as he revealed London will now target all major Russian banks, five oligarchs and more than  companies and iniduals. Labour Leader Sir Keir Starmer said in a TV address on Thursday that Vladimir Putin’s “bandit rule” must fail.He said it “must be a turning point in our history, adding: We must look back and say that this terrible day was actually when Putin doomed himself to defeat. “He seeks ision, so we must stay united. He hopes for inaction, so we must take a stand. He believes that we are too corrupted to do the right thing, so we must prove him wrong. I believe we can, but onlywe stand together.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Jeremy Corbyn MPIan Mearns MPIan Lavery MPDiane Abbott MPJohn McDonnell MPEastern EuropeNatoPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Prime Minister is expected to scrap all self-isolation, even for people who have the virus, from around Thursday. He is also likely to confirm the date free lateral flow and PCR tests will be axed - although is not expected to actually happen this week. The £ self-isolation payment for low-income workers and legal powers for councils both face being scrapped. And the Mirror understands he was weighing up whether to axe sick pay from day one of Covid isolation, despite fury from unions and Labour. Scroll down for the full guide to the changes - or join the debate in the commentsFor holidaymakers, Passenger Locator Forms could be simplied further, or even scrapped completelyTransport Secretary Grant Shapps gets his way.Travel testing, however, is likely to stay for unvaccinated people entering the UK for the foreseeable future. Mr Johnson is likely to give a statement to Parliament at around .pm on Monday. He could also give a press conference. Facing pressure from Tory MPs over his leadership, the PM has decided Britain has had all the restrictions it can tolerate. Speaking before his announcement on Monday, the Prime Minister said: Today will mark a moment of pride after one of the most dficult periods in our countryaposs history as we begin to learn to live with Covid. It would not be possible without the efforts of so many - the NHS who delivered the le-saving vaccine rollout at phenomenal speed, our world-leading scientists and experts, and the general public for their commitment to protecting themselves and their loved ones. The pandemic is not over but thanks to the incredible vaccine rollout we are now one step closer towards ato normality and finally giving people back their freedoms while continuing to protect ourselves and others.It comes after ministers confirmed all children over five will be able to get the Covid vaccine from April. But charities worry millions of vulnerable or immunocompromised Brits will be thrown to the wolves with little support.And the governmentaposs own scientic advisors have warned ending testing and isolation could trigger a rapid rise in cases. Here’s everything we know about what is likely to be announced.Self-isolation laws scrappedLegal Covid self-isolation is due to be scrapped - evenyou currently have the virus - from as soon as Thursday  February. The decision will end almost exactly two years of legally-enforced isolation for people who test positive. But it raises ethical dilemmas about whether to go to work and put others at risk, especiallyyou can no longer claim a £ isolation payment or sick pay from day one . Despite scrapping legal isolation, No said: “We’re not saying isolation is pointless. We’d expect anyone with an infectious disease to take steps not to spread that disease further - a colleague at work with flu, for example. Currently people who test positive must go into self-isolation for at least five full days in England, a period that has been repeatedly cut from  days and seven days. Fears Statutory Sick Pay will be stripped back Boris Johnson has been weighing up whether to scrap sick pay from day one of Covid illness, the Mirror understands.£.-a-week Statutory Sick Payis usually only available from the fourth day of any illness, after three ‘waiting days’ are complete. This was cut to the first day in  for people isolating due to Covid. Ministers said the move was “vital” to ensure people get help and follow the rules.But the power is contained in the Coronavirus Act, which is currently due to expire on March .That means it could be removed, even though No has advised people who are sick with the virus to stay away from work. TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said: “It’s vital that sick pay remains a day one right and is made available to all. Workers who are laid low by Covid must be able to make ends meet – not pushed into financial hardship.”A date for scrapping free lateral flow testsBoris Johnson’s plan is expected to set a timetable for the end of free lateral flow tests, with people having to pay instead.The government warned last summer it would eventually stop paying for these rapid tests due to the huge cost of the NHS.Sources told the Mirror that claims the tests themselves will end this week are wide of the mark. However, the Living with Covid plan could set a date in the future for when they are cut off. It’s not known how much lateral flow tests will cost, but estimates have put it at £ for a pack of seven. A date for scrapping free PCR tests and Test and TraceIt’s thought the plan may contain a date for ending free ‘gold standard’ PCR tests as England’s Covid infrastructure is wound down. Whitehall sources told thethe Treasury is trying to cut the £bn-a-year cost, which will mean having to phase out free testing and all but ending the contact-tracing system. Scientists have raised the alarm about ending these free tests, with reports suggesting they could cost £ each privately. According to reports, only health and social care workers and .million vulnerable people will continue to get free PCRs. Prof Lawrence Young of Warwick University said: “Living with Covid doesn’t mean letting our guard down”. Covid travel Passenger Locator Form could be simplied or axed Fully-vaccinated people entering the UK do not need to take any Covid tests, under changes that happened on February . But they still need to fill in a Passenger Locator Form - albeit a ‘simplied’ one - and further changes to this are possible in this week’s Covid plan. It’s understood the Department for Transport was pressing to further simply the Passenger Locator Form - or get rid of it completely. It is thought there was only a slim chance of the form being axed altogether, as health officials were still worried about needing to track new iants coming in to the UK. Meanwhile, unvaccinated people still need to take one pre-departure test and one post-arrival test before entering the UK. It’s understood this rule will stay for the foreseeable future and no changes to it are due this week. £ self-isolation payment could be scrappedThe £ self-isolation payment for poor workers with Covid could end as the legal requirement to quarantine is scrapped. The Test and Trace Support Payment was introduced in September  to help low-wage workers afford to self-isolate for up to  days. No final decisions have been announced yet over the future of the £ payment, and its status was being considered by the government last week.  Legal powers for councils will goLegal changes will end remaining powers councils had under the  Coronavirus Act in England to close some venues. However, these powers were barely ever used, because powers for lockdowns flow from a separate law passed in . And the vast majority of Coronavirus Act powers - including on detention, events, gatherings, shops and restaurants and schools - already expired in September . Only a few of the more draconian powers - including the power to suspend port operations - remained in the Act. Vaccines for all children over five All children over five will be able to get vaccinated against Covid- from April. The “non-urgent offer” to the parents of nearly six million - year olds was confirmed by the Government moments after advice issued by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation . Two smaller doses of the Pfizer jab,  weeks apart, will be available to this age group to help control future Covid waves after Covid curbs have been lted. It is understood there are no plans for a major publicity drive to encourage this age group to be vaccinated and it will be left very much up to parents to decide. Itaposs understood a rollout for over-s will be less urgent than previous vaccine drives, due to the very low risk Covid poses to younger kids. The idea is that ordinary NHS care shouldn’t be interrupted to give kids the jab, like it was for adults. All children over  have been able to get the Pfizer Covid jab since September last year. Currently, only the most vulnerable kids aged  to  are eligible. They are offered two jabs but at a lower dose than for adults -  micrograms instead of .

The Prime Minister unveiled a -point financial plan which has been on the drawing board for months as war ed to Europe.London will target all major Russian banks and firms, ban Aeroflot from landing flights in Britain, and target exports and five super-rich oligarchs with links to Putin. A diplomatic source said: “They come to Harrods to shop, they stay in our best hotels when they like, they send their children to our best public schools, and that is whataposs being stopped. “So that these people are essentially persona non grata in every major Western European capital in the world. That really bites.” Boris Johnson also wants to limit the amount Russians can hold in UK bank accounts, and shut them off from SWIFT bank payments. UK officials believe the measures will knock whole percentage points off Russia’s GDP. Vowing “a remorseless mission to squeeze Russia from the global economy”, the PM said Russian stocks are down % or bn and the rouble at record lows against the dollar. Many of today’s measures were agreed by the G, which issued a joint statement blasting Russia’s “serious violation of international law”. Some are immediate with others in the coming days. But despite the PM pledging sanctions “the moment the first Russian toecap crosses further into Ukrainian territory”, not all the measures today are agreed yet. And they come days after Mr Johnson already announced sanctions against five banks and three oligarchs, only for Russia to invade anyway. He admitted: “We’ve learned a bitter lesson about to deal with Vladimir Putin”. The sanctions are enforced with fines and enforcement through the Treasury, Home Office and National Crime Agency. Mr Johnson pledged a new ‘Kleptocracy Cell’ to “target sanctions evasion and corrupt Russian assets hidden in the UK”.  But others raise questions about how often sanctions are enforced. And there are fears within government that wealthy Russians could mount legal challenges. The Henry Jackson Society branded the action regrettably paltry and tantamount to fiddling while Kiev burns. So what has actually been announced  Here is the -point plan in full. - Asset freeze against Russian banksBoris Johnson announced an immediate asset freeze from today against Russia’s second-largest bank VTB, with assets of £bn. He said the measure will “stop them from accessing Sterling and clearing payments through the UK.” However, this will only “match the power the US already has”, the Foreign Office said. Banks subject to this measure will be unable to process any payments through the UK or have access to UK financial markets. The UK’s intention is to impose a similar asset freeze against all major Russian banks, after five were sanctioned earlier this week.  - Targeting Russian media, energy and other firmsLegislation will be introduced on Tuesday banning all major Russian firms from raising finance on UK markets. It is understood eight sectors will be in scope, including media - suggesting Russian broadcaster Russia Today could be hit. It will also prevent major Russian firms raising finance in the UK energy market. Though it was not immediately clear how far the sanctions would, for example, restrict state-owned gas giant Gazprom. Boris Johnson claimed: “These powers will enable us to ban Russian state and private companies from raising funds in the UK, banning dealing with their securities and making loans to them.” This is in addition to banning the Russian state itself from raising funds in the UK, the Foreign Office said.  - Asset freezes on firms and five oligarchsToday’s announcement targets five major defence firms and five new oligarchs with links to Vladimir Putin, on top of three hit earlier this week. The elite iniduals are:Kirill Shamalov, Russia’s youngest billionaire, who was married to Putinaposs second daughter, Katerina Tikhonova, and a former economic adviser to the Kremlin. Petr Fradkov, CEO of Promsvyazbank, and son of the former boss of the FSB. Denis Bortnikov, deputy president of the state-owned VTB Bank. Yury Slyusar, director of United Aircraft Corporation. Elena Aleksandrovna Georgieva, the chairwoman of the board of Novicom bank, which bankrolls Rostec . They do NOT include Cha FC owner Roman Abramovich after Boris Johnson wrongly said he was being targeted.No sanctioned Russian can travel to Britain, no UK inidual or firm can transact with them, and their assets in the UK are frozen. However, their children can still attend UK schools - eventheir parents can’t meet in the holidays - as family members aren’t hit.  More oligarchs will be sanctioned in the coming weeks. Boris Johnson said: “Overall we will be imposing asset freezes on over more  new entities and iniduals on top of the hundreds we’ve already announced. This includes all the major manufacturers that support Putin’s war machine.” Around  of the ‘’ are Rostec, Russia’s biggest defence firm with over million employees and annual arms exports over £bn, and its dozens of subsidiaries. There are four other major defence firms on the list:Tactical Missile Corporation, described as Russia’s leading supplier of air and sea missiles which played a leading role in its build up of forces against Ukraine. Uralvagonzavod, one of the world’s largest tank manufacturers. United Shipbuilding Corporation: The largest shipbuilding company in Russia. It constructed a number of the key Russian warships, including three Ivan Gren-Class Landing Ships that redeployed to the Black Sea earlier in February . United Aircraft Corporation: A holding company that includes all major Russian aircraft manufacturers, including MiG  Sukhoi. It supplies key Russian military aircraft used as part of Russia’s military build-up.  - Russian airlines banned from landing in the UKBoris Johnson announced plans to ban state-owned Russian flag carrier Aeroflot from landing in the UK. Russia’s national airline Aeroflot has also been banned from UK airspace entirely.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps later confirmed: “Iaposve signed restrictions prohibiting all scheduled Russian airlines from entering UK airspace or touching down on British soil.“Putinaposs heinous actions will not be ignored, and we will never tolerate those who put people’s lives in danger.”  - Bans on exports of ‘dual-use items’ to RussiaThe UK will suspend and ban all dual-use export licences to Russia. This includes electrical components that could be used in military computers, or parts that could be used in military trucks. Boris Johnson said they include a “range of high-end and critical technological equipment and components in sectors including electronics, telecommunications, and aerospace.” The trade sanctions were intended to be imminent but Boris Johnson said laws to implement them will be laid “early next week”. - Ban on range of high-tech exports to RussiaSimilarly, within days the UK will publish laws that ban exports in high-tech sectors and minerals, metals, natural gas and oil. These will be aligned closely to the approach taken by the White House. Boris Johnson claimed: “These trade sanctions will constrain Russia’s military-industrial and technological capabilities for years to come.”  - Limit on Russians’ UK bank balances - but it’s not agreed yetThe PM announced: “We will limit the amount of money that Russian nationals will be able to deposit in their UK bank accounts.” But it’s understood officials are only looking at introducing this legislation and a full timescale is not yet pinned down. It will cover all Russians but be aimed at the wealthiest. That is because there’ll be a set limit on how much these people can hold in a UK bank account - but that limit isn’t decided. It’s also not yet knownit will hit dual British-Russian nationals, after headlines about wealthy donors to the Tory party. - Hope to shut off Russia’s access to SWIFT - but world might not agreeBoris Johnson intends to shut off Russian access to the SWIFT system that enables global payments between banks. This would be a huge blow to the Moscow elite’s ability to move their money around the world. But this can only be down with the G and NATO members’ agreement, with No admitting we recognise it is a challenge”. It is also not clearany ban would involve all Russian people and entities or just the most wealthy.  - The same sanctions will be imposed on Belarus“Sanctions will also be applied to Belarus for its role in the assault on Ukraine,” Boris Johnson said. It’s understood the full range of sanctions listed above will be also extended to Belarus. UK officials took the decision based on the country’s integration with the Russian military, and on top of existing Belarus sanctions. - A U-turn on the Economic Crime BillBoris Johnson will finally speed up measures in his long-awaited Economic Crime Bill after months of protest from MPs. It had only been due in the next session of Parliament, but now some measures will be brought forward before the Easter recess. The PM’s official spokesman said: “Before Easter recess we will bring forward legislation previously intended for the Economic Crime Bill to strengthen unexplained wealth orders, to take action against kleptocrats who launder funds in the UK.” Agencies will have “longer to act in targeting iniduals and reduce their exposure to some of the legal costs” of going after these iniduals, he added. Labour had condemned the failure to bring forward the Bill and it was a factor in the resignation of Tory minister ordered Agnew.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Boris JohnsonVladimir PutinForeign OfficeHome OfficePoliticsBillionairesRussia Ukraine war\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Boris Johnson announced sanctions against three billionaire oligarchs and five banks in retaliation for Kremlin forces launching action in the breakaway regions of Luhansk and Donetsk.The Prime Minister told the Commons: “Any assets they hold in the UK will be frozen, the iniduals concerned will be banned from travelling here, and we will prohibit all UK iniduals and entities from having any dealings with them. “This is the first tranche, the first barrage, of what we are prepared to do.“We will hold further sanctions at readiness, to be deployed alongside the United States and the European Unionthe situation escalates still further.” Critics blasted the move after it emerged the oligarch trio have been on a US sanctions list since  - meaning it is unlikely many UK businesses have dealings with them. Mr Johnson insisted the Government would “be bringing forward further measures to hit Russian iniduals and Russian companies of strategic importance to Russia, stopping Russian companies from raising money on London markets and stopping them even trading in pounds and dollars”. Keir Starmer said: “We have failed to stop the flow of illicit Russian finance into Britain.” Calling for the invasion to be “a turning point”, the Labour leader added: “We need an end to oligarch impunity, we need to draw a line under Companies House providing easy cover for shell companies, we need to ensure that our anti-money-laundering laws are enforced.” Former Treasury Minister Dame Angela Eagle questioned whether the sanctions would “close down the so-called London laundromat which is laundering dirty Russian money straight through the City”. MPs have become increasingly frustrated at the failure to crackdown Russia on cash swirling around the capital. Mega-rich, Kremlin-linked tycoons have bought multi-million-pound mansions in London and country estates in Surrey, sending their children to elite boarding schools. Ministers have repeatedly been accused of turning a blind eye or even encouraging them because of the funds they pump into the UK economy.  MPs on Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee published a damning report in July  accusing successive governments of paving the way for Russian funds to infiltrate Britain. “It would appear that the UK has been viewed as a particularly favourable destination for Russian oligarchs and their money,” the -page study said. “The UK welcomed Russian money, and few questions –any – were asked about the provenance of this considerable wealth.” Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper tonight said Britain had become a “centre for illicit finance that reality discredits us in the eyes of the world”.  She demanded “much stronger action against illicit finance in the City of London, and the way in which - not just Russian money and illegal money, including money from organised crime in other countries - it’s possible to launder that money in the UK because there just aren’t strong enough checks in place”. Former Foreign Office Minister Chris Bryant, who chairs the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Russia, fumed: “We have to close the dirty Russian money down.” Exeter University academic Tena Prelec, part of a research team investigating international kleptocracy, said: “Our research shows elite iniduals from post-Soviet states are laundering their wealth and reputations in the UK, knowingly and willingly supported by a network of British professionals.  “The UK remains a safe haven for dirty money, a great deal of which comes from Russia and Eurasia. “Failure to tackle this thriving billion-dollar industry is damaging for the UK’s rule of law and to the UK’s professed role as an opponent of international corruption.” Campaigner Bill Browder, the head of Global Magnitsky Justice campaign, branded the Government’s sanctions “pretty tepid”. He added: “We should be going after the  oligarchs who look after Putin’s money.”  He said: “We don’t have a beef with the Russian people, we have a beef with Vladimir Putin and the oligarchs who support him and the oligarchs who look after his money. “We don’t have to punish the entire Russian population at this stage of the game - we should be going after the  oligarchs who look after Putin’s money. “Putin is one of the richest men in the world, he’s stolen an enormous amount of money over the last  years, and he doesn’t hold that money in his own name, he has other people holding it for him - his oligarch trustees. “It’s pretty straightforward,we were to sanction the  oligarch trustees who hold Putin’s money and their family members in the UK, he wouldn’t invade Ukraine.“We know exactly who they are, Boris Johnson knows who they are, the Foreign Office knows who they are, the Home Office knows who they are, I know who they are. “It’s all just a question of political will - does the Government want to actually stop a war  Or do they just want to seem to be reacting to this ” Royal United Services Institute think-tank financial and security expert Tom Keatinge said of the UK sanctions: Weaposve taken a peashooter to a gunfight. “It doesnapost make any sense to me at all, the whole point of the sanctions has been to deter Putin andat the first chance you get to use these sanctions you only tickle his feet, whataposs the point  “If we ever had the upper hand, weaposve lost it today. Meanwhile, calls mounted for Russia to be stripped of the UEFA Champions League final.St Petersburg is due to host the European club game’s showpiece event in May. But Mr Johnson told MPs it was “inconceivable” Russia could now stage major sporting fixtures. There was “no chance” of holding football tournaments in a Russia that “invades sovereign countries”, he told MPs.

The Tory Chancellor has joined the list of more than  people to receive a questionnaire from the Met Police to explain any involvement in gatherings at Downing Street. It’s understood the Chancellor has received the form, and it will be ed within seven days as requested by Scotland Yard. The Met is looking into  alleged gatherings held across Whitehall and Downing Street during lockdown rules under Operation Hillman.Mr Sunak previously confirmed he was at Boris Johnson ’s birthday do, held by No staff and the PM’s we Carrie on June , .But he insisted he had been present at the Cabinet Room for a routine meeting to discuss Covid.  Earlier this month, he appeared to suggest he was not expecting to receive a form to complete. Asked on Sky News earlier this monthhe expected to receive a form, he replied: No... well, I donapost know. He said at the time he did not believe he had broken any Covid rules. When previously asked about the allegations, Mr Sunak said he went to the Cabinet Room as he had for , , God knows how many other Covid meetings. Boris Johnson has already filled out the same questionnaire and police are considering whether to issue him a fixed penalty notice for breaking lockdown laws. A leaked version of the form revealed this week that the PM was asked basic questions which lawyers believe could easily be batted away.The forms asked respondents to provide a lawful exception or reasonable excuse for their lockdown-busting behaviour. They added those accused can provide a written statement under caution - making Mr Johnson the first Prime Minister to face answering police questions in this way.Labouraposs deputy leader Angela Rayner said: This is an embarrassment that for the first time in UK history we have a PM interviewed under police caution.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON CabinetLabour PartyScotland Yardpolitan PoliceBoris JohnsonPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

That means it won’t just affect students, but millions of graduates who face paying back loans almost until they retire. Shadow Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said: The Tories are delivering another stealth tax for new graduates starting out on their working lives which will hit those on low incomes hardest.  “Instead of fixing the broken system these changes simply store up problems for the future. Ministers are kicking the can down the road while seeking to limit young people’s aspirations to study at university.” So what is actually being announced today  We take you through the main features and how they will affect your wallet. Graduates will have to pay back £ a year more University graduates starting their courses from next September will pay off % of what they earn above £,-a-year. That is down from a £, threshold now, meaning more of your earnings get caught by the student loan repayments trap.Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert, said: “Everyone who earns above the threshold will repay more each year than under the current scheme, typically by £ year – reducing disposable incomes.”The existing threshold will be maintained for current students until April . But there are not any guarantees it will rise after that. With every year that it’s frozen, the threshold effectively gets lower because wages and costs rise with inflation and you put more of your disposable income to repaying your student loan. Just weeks ago Tory ministers scrapped a plan to raise the threshold by .% in April, leaving students £ worse off per year.  Graduates could be repaying their debts into their s In a further blow, theof time graduates have to pay off their loan will be extended to  years. That means the majority will be repaying their student debt into their s. Outstanding debt is currently written off after  years. But student loans are so high, only % of students ever repay their loan in full before the  years are up. Changes to the plans will mean % of borrowers pay off their loans, according to the Department for Education. Mr Lewis added: “The majority of lower and mid earners will keep paying for many more years, increasing their costs by £,s. “Yet the highest earners who would clear within the current  years won’t be impacted.” Pupils who fail their GCSE Maths and English could be barred from student loans A consultation will be published whether to impose minimum entry requirements of Level  GCSE passes in English and Maths - or two Es at A-Level. This means pupils who fail their Maths and English GCSEs - or get lower A-Level grades - could be barred from getting student loans. Around , people went to university last year who didn’t get these passes in their GCSEs. Another consultation will look at creating a Lelong Loan Entitlement , worth around £, or the equivalent of four years of post- education, to support students to study, train, retrain or upskill at any stage.  Sir Peter Lampl, executive chair of social mobility charity the Sutton Trust, raised concerns about plans to shut out those with lower grades. He said: The introduction of any minimum grade requirement is always going to have the biggest impact on the poorest young people, as they are more likely to have lower grades because of the disadvantages they have faced in their schooling. Demand for maintenance grant quietly ditched The reforms are based on the Augar review of student loan financing in . Some of what the review promised would have helped students. For example, it demanded theof maintenance grants for poorer students, which were axed in . But these have been ignored, despite Tory ministers happily taking some of the less appetising dishes on the Augar menu. Paul Blomfield MP, Chair of the All-Party Group for Students, said: “Future students will be paying more for less. “Philip Augar’s important proposal for the reintroduction of maintenance grants for the poorest students has been quietly dropped and there’s nothing to address rising living costs, which affect those without family support the most.”Tuition fees to remain at £, - despite demand for them to be slashed Tory ministers have announced the tuition fee cap will be frozen at £, for a further two years - up to and including  . This will, at least, mean students don’t pay more for their tuition than they currently do. But the Tories have quietly rejected the Augar reportaposs key call to slash tuition fees to £,-a-year - instead keeping the annual cap at £, until  . Cutting tuition fees was the top line from the Augar report - and the reason suggested extending the repayment window. NUS UK President Larissa Kennedy said: “These changes will cost new graduates on lower and middle incomes tens of thousands of pounds over the course of their careers. “At a time where the cost of living is soaring and grad salaries crashing, for many, these changes could be the dference between heating and eating. “The Minister is saddling young people with unimaginable debt for the next  years of their lives.

Its p spaghetti is, like the proleration of food banks in the UK, a treatment of the symptom of poverty.We need to address the cause. The responsibility for the welfare and wellbeing of our most vulnerable citizens should not rest on the shoulders of charities, nor supermarkets. It’s easy to paint the large ­corporations as the villains, but questions need to be asked as to why people need p spaghetti and p pasta to survive in one of the richest economies in the world.  And the answers lie squarely at the well-heeled feet of those who have held the purse strings and policies of the country for the last  long and dismal years. Those years of austerity cuts to social care and health services mean the safety net of a decent and supportive society is less than threadbare. The triple threat of rocketing food prices, unmanageable energy bills, and an underfunded National Health Service is going to cause long-term damage to families, communities, and ­iniduals in almost every ­neighbourhood in the country. Every area now has at least one foodbank we live in a society where people need the ad-hoc macro philanthropy of neighbours and strangers to not starve to death.  Over the last two years of the pandemic, the Chancellor has proven time and again that he can magic up a whole orchard of flourishing and evergreen money trees when it comes to propping up his pet projects. Writing off £.billion of furlough fraud, £.billion “lost” down the back of the Downing Street couch, supposedly spent on PPE nobody has any record of, not even the company that received the payment. That money alone could have paid for TWO YEARS of the continuation of the £ uplt to Universal Credit. Somehow there is always money for crony contracts, Parliamentary p*ss-ups, weaponry and warfare, and DWP cover-ups, because it comes at the expense of social care, school dinners, and starving pensioners. So while I welcome the ­reappearance of budget groceries on the supermarket shelves as an ­immediate-term relief for millions of people struggling to make ends meet, and while I will continue to write recipes for p a head and publish them for free on my website, I’m determined that we work towards building a world where neither of those things are essential any more.

Labour analysis suggests that tax on iniduals and businesses is going up £. billion a year under the Conservatives.But the Chancellor will say he firmly believes in low taxes in a major speech on Thursday setting out his economic vision. This is despite the Government raising taxes to their highest level since the Second World War and abandoning two flagship manesto pledges on tax and pensions in doing so. Mr Sunak will disappoint Tory right-wingers by dismissing tax cuts where they would leave public spending unfunded. In his Mais lecture at the Bayes Business School, he will say: “I am going to deliver a lower tax economy but I am going to do so in a responsible way, and in a way that tackles our long term challenges”. But the Chancellor, who wants to build up a war-chest to cut taxes before the next election, will add: “I am disheartened when I hear the flippant claim that ‘tax cuts always pay for themselves’. They do not. “Cutting tax sustainably requires hard work, prioritisation, and the willingness to make dficult and often unpopular arguments where.”  Ministers claim the UK has the fastest growing economy in the G but this is only true because they compare  with , the worst year for the economy in a century as a result of the pandemic. The latest data on quarterly GDP growth, referring to Q , has the UK coming in with slower growth at % than .% in Japan, .% in Canada and .% in United States. Keir Starmer will on Thursday commit the next Labour government to turning around the low growth of the last decade.In a speech in Huddersfield, he will blame the Conservativeaposs  years in power for faltering growth for tax rise after tax rise. He will say: “If the Tories had matched Labour’s record on growth, people would have had higher incomes. We could have spent £ billion more on public services without having to raise a single tax. The Chancellor has already introduced  tax rises, increasing taxes more than any other Chancellor in half a century.  The Labour leader will set out six areas where the party would boost long-term growth including driving up productivity and wages. He will wade into controversial waters for his party discussing the role the Government plays as a partner to the private sector. Mr Starmer will also set out Labouraposs own version of aposlevelling upapos - restoring and revitalising the places that once powered Britain. Echoing the words of Labour former PM Harold Wilson - a son of the town - he is expected to say: “Our country and our economy are entirely dferent now, but we too are going through the white heat. We face our own revolutions in technology and industry, and it will fall to the next Labour government to shape that change so it works for all.” He will also stress Labouraposs unequivocal backing for British business as the party tried to bolster its economic credibility.

He said today: “What we see now is a full fledged invasion of Ukraine from many, multiple directions, we see air, land and naval forces taking part…This is extremely serious.”UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson slammed Russia’s tidal wave of violence which he described as an attack on democracyapos, saying the UK will always defend Ukraineaposs rights to sovereignty. Mr Johnson said: Our mission is clear. Diplomatically, politically, economically – and eventually, militarily – this hideous and barbaric venture of Vladimir Putin must end in failure.  But there is no suggestion that NATO troops will actually put boots on the ground in Ukraine, despite the invasion. Meanwhile, the unfolding war has prompted fresh questions about the size of the British Army and ongoing cuts to troop numbers. Here are some common questions answered on troop numbers in Britain, Russia and the NATO forward groups.What is the size of the UK Army and Armed Forces As of  October , the “trained strength” of the British Army is , personnel, , in the Royal Navy and Royal Marines, and , in the Royal Air Force. That gives a total of , in the UK Armed Forces.This total will however be cut by around , to achieve a smaller Army as envisaged in ‘Defence in a Competitive Age’ command paper.The target is to cut the Army, which has already been slashed back, by nearly , to ,. The Navy and RAF would increase in size slightly, to , and , respectively. Infantry, the “close combat” troops at the “core of the Army” - some of whom are stationed in Estonia to protect NATO allies, are falling by a fth. Tory ministers admit their numbers will drop from , in  to , in  . Why are British troop numbers being cut Overall Army numbers are being cut as part of a long-term plan by the UK government to ‘modernise’ the military.Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has claimed: “We will have a modernised fleet, it will have a modern soldier and I think it will be really quite exciting.”He added with investments in new technology, including to counter cyber-attacks, the Armed Forces can do “what it says on the side of the tin rather than boasts about having lots of people and actually equipment that is  years out of date”.But General Sir Richard Sherrf, a former deputy supreme commander of NATO Europe, told the BBC : “We in this country must recognise that our security starts not on the White clfs of Dover but it starts in the forest of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania.“That means we must really man the ramparts in Eastern Europe as an alliance. We should mobilise our forces such as we’ve got. I’m afraid the cupboard is pretty bare after the cumulative defence cuts over the last decade plus.” Shadow Defence Secretary John Healey told the Commons: “By the time of the next election we will have the smallest Army in  years.” How many troops does Russia have Russiaaposs army has about , personnel and its combined armed forces total about ,, according to Reuters. Its , battle tanks outnumber Ukraineaposs by more than three to one, according to the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies . A US intelligence assessment in December suggested Russia was amassing a force of up to , troops near Ukraine. UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said on Monday that , Russian combat troops are on the edge of Ukraine, spread between more than  battalion tactical groups. What will Russia do in Ukraine  Western officials believe Russia intends to seize and control a very large section of Ukraine - including the capital Kiev - and will need ground troops to do so. They fear this will lead to large numbers of civilian injuries and deaths with fighting in the built-up urban area. But they are unclear whether that will mean occupying the whole country, for which Russian forces do not yet appear to be ready. Likewise, Western officials are unclear whether Vladimir Putin intends Russia to rule Ukraine directly, or to replace the government in Kiev with a more favourable puppet regime. Western intelligence suggests Russian forces spilled over Ukraine’s border from multiple directions including from Russia to Donbas, from Belarus and from occupied Crimea. There was a cyber-attack on Ukrainian financial institutions last night, and a large number of missile strikes on Mariupol port this morning but no amphibious attack in the opening hours. Not all of the estimated , Russian troops that were amassed near the borders have yet invaded. But Russian special forces are thought to be flooding into Ukraine to soften up resistance, officials believe. How many British troops are near Ukraine The UK contributes troops to NATO battlegroups, which as of last March stationed around , personnel at bases in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland . Britain leads the battlegroup in Estonia and was due soon to have around , troops there, after it promised to double the number of UK forces in the country. As of March  the UK had  troops in Estonia - including one armoured infantry battalion with main battle tanks and armoured fighting vehicles. The UK also had  troops in Poland - a Light Cavalry Squadron from the Royal Dragoon Guards, as part of a US-led force. Latvia’s battlegroup is led by Canada while Lithuania’s is led by Germany. These figures are likely out of date. US president Joe Biden said tonight: “Over the past few weeks I ordered thousands of additional forces to Germany and Poland as part of our commitment to Nato. On Tuesday, in response to Russia’s aggressive action… I authorised the deployment of ground and air forces already stationed in Europe to NATO’s Eastern flank allies - Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania.” He added: “Now I’m authorising additional US force capabilities to deploy to Germany as part of NATO’s response, including US base forces… put on standby weeks ago.” Will NATO defend Ukraine NATO’s ‘forward presence’ troops have been stationed in member countries Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. NATO allies are also co-ordinating financial sanctions against Russia, while the UK and other allies are sending defensive lethal weapons and military support to Ukraine. However, Ukraine is not a NATO member - despite Putin’s claims that the alliance is expanding - and therefore is unlikely to have Western troops on the ground. This is a crucial distinction, because Article  of NATO’s charter - that all  member countries must respond to an attack on one member - only applies to member states. Speaking to the BBC on January , NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg ruled out sending NATO boots on the ground in Ukraine. Again today he said there were no plans to do so.  Asked on January we could see a scenario where NATO troops fight Russian troops in Ukraine, he replied: No. We are focusing on providing support to Ukraine. He added: We have to distinguish between NATO allies and Ukraine. Ukraine is a partner. We provide support. We help them with modernising their defensive security institutions, NATO allies as the United Kingdom, United States, Canada are providing training. Thousands of Ukraine soldiers have been trained. UK Defence Committee member Tobias Ellwood has said NATO forces should have been placed in Ukraine but “we blinked” and failed to do so.

If today, you were constructing the best model for a European trade organisation, would it resemble the bloated, bureaucratic, monolith run by unelected, mediocre, pro-German civil servants called the EU  And more than half the country, predominantly older people staunchly proud of Britain’s history and its ­constitutional monarchy, thought not. Well, I’d like to ask them,they were constructing a model British state today, would they have a Windsor at the head of it  Park this year’s fairy-tale narrative about the past seven decades being one long, glorious reign, and focus on the past few days. The heir to the throne faces a police investigation over claims his advisers fixed a CBE for a Saudi tycoon who had given a fortune to one of his charities. Charles denies any knowledge of a deal but can’t deny secretly meeting the tycoon in Saudi Arabia, welcoming him to Clarence House, and giving him the CBE at Buckingham Palace.  The Queen’s second oldest son has just agreed a reported £million payoff to a woman who claimed he raped her when she was , as a minor under US law, which he denies. In fact he denies ever meeting her. So we’re expected to believe he’s just given £million to a complete stranger. And the royals won’t denysome of his hush money comes from the Queen’s Duchy of Lancaster tax-deductible fund. Which would effectively mean taxpayers crowdfunding the Duke of York’s escape route from a child sex scandal. He still retains that title, despite York MP Rachael Maskell demanding it be removed after a poll claimed % of York citizens don’t want him shaming their city. He will also remain a Queen’s ­Counsellor of State. I can’t wait to hear how he counsels her on legislation about sex trafficking. The views of York’s citizens are deemed irrelevantbecause in our monarchical system, subjects cannot question royals. I would love to hear MPs debate the issues around Charles and Andrew, and how much, and for how long, the Queen knew of her son’s connections to his convicted paedophile friend. And the morality behind Buckingham Palace finally ordering Andrew to settle the allegations against him to save the precious Platinum Jubilee. But our elected representatives cannot mention such issues in the Commons, just as we can’t see how much royals leave in their wills, because as Parliamentary bible Erskine May states: “No question can be put which brings the name of the Sovereign or the ­influence of the Crown directly before Parliament, or which casts reflections upon the ­Sovereign or the Royal Family.” Hence why MPs are forced to take an oath of allegiance to the monarch and all their heirs. What a ludicrous, humiliating stitch-up. All to keep these accidents of birth ruling over us. And to think, most Brits believe the EU is an anti-democratic gravy train which keeps charlatans in clover, while our “democracy” is the envy of the world. I’d love to think this week will convince royalists that this family they idolise is not only not better than theirs, some of its members are far worse. And we should bin the whole feudal farce once the Queen dies. But I’d be kidding myself.

If you sell goods to the EU, or buy goods from the EU and bring them into the UK, you need to be able to prove that they meet the new rules of origin requirements to access preferential tarfs. It’s vital you understand the new rules to keep your business moving. To benefit from the preferential tarfs, you must have proof that any goods you import from the EU originate there, or any goods you export to the EU originate in the UK. Proof of origin can either be a statement of origin completed by the exporter, or evidence of the importer’s knowledge of where products originate. If you cannot prove the origin, you or your EU customer may be liable to pay the full rate of customs duty and could face penalties. Andrew Macleod, founder of London-based restaurant brand Emilia’s Crafted Pasta, explains that imports from the EU are vital to his brand: “We import ingredients directly from Italy, including special cured meats, cheeses, drinks and alcohol. Each of our suppliers is hand-picked.”  Has he had to make any changes to his business now that there are new import rules in place  “Yes – of course we already knew the origin of all the goods we import as we source everything carefully. But we’ve trained two of our managers on the rules around importing, so we know that we have staff in house who are well versed in the process.”  And having successfully navigated the changes, what advice would Andrew offer other businesses that import  “We found using a customs agent really helps the process run smoothly, but it’s equally important that you understand the rules yourself,” he says. “It’s not too late, and the gov.uk site has lots of valuable information.”  You must be able to prove the origin of any product you import You can choose to work with a freight forwarder or courier To benefit from preferential tarfs, you must be able to prove that any goods you import originated in the EU Note:you’re moving goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, rules of origin work dferently.

It may also help medical research by identying genetic predictors of diseasePrincipal author Dr Yan WongByMark Waghorn:,  Feb |commentsScientists have created the biggest ever family tree – linking around  million people.It goes back tens of thousands of years and sheds new light on the evolution of our species. The British team’s breakthrough is a major step towards mapping the ancestry of every single one of us. It may also help medical research by identying genetic predictors of disease.Principal author Dr Yan Wong said: “We have basically built a huge family tree.“It is a genealogy for all of humanity that models as exactly as we can the history that generated all the genetic iation we find in humans today. [It] allows us to see how every person’s genetic sequence relates to every other.” The Oxford University study, which combines modern and ancient genomes, reveals in unprecedented detail how people across the world are related. Recent decades have generated genomes from hundreds of thousands of people – some from tens of thousands of years ago. Variable quality and limitations in analyses made painting an accurate picture impossible, until now. The new technique, described in journal Science, allows for missing data. Dr Wong said: “This study is laying the groundwork for the next generation of DNA sequencing.” The scientists were able to reconstruct the genomes of our ancestors, with computer algorithms being used to predict when and where they lived. The team trawled eight databases containing , genome sequences. Some samples were , years old. The resulting network contained almost  million ancestors.

Krishna Singh, , faces a list of alleged crimes said to have occurred between  and , at medical practices in North Lanarkshire, Scotland. One accusation allegedly took place in the accident and emergency department of a hospital. The charges include indecent and sexual assault as well as acting in a lewd and libidinous manner. Among the claims, it is alleged that Singh had women stand on scales before he molested them. He is also accused of kissing females and making inappropriate comments.

His lawyer Janice Green told the court he pleads not guilty to all  charges. Jurors then were read the charges by judge Lord Armstrong, who advised them it would be a “y” trial that was likely to last around eight weeks. “There are  charges and a woman will speak to each of those charges,” he said.  Agreed evidence - known as a joint minute - was read to the jury by prosecutor Angela Gray. It was stated that Singh obtained his medical degree in Patna, India in  before being registered as a doctor in London in November .

Oil prices typically quickly flow through to what drivers pay at the forecourt.Prime Minister Boris Johnson has already warned that one of the risks of Putinaposs venture is that there could be a spike in... oil prices. However, there is no indication that people in the UK need to panic buy fuel. The nationwide average for unleaded is already a shade under £. a litre, and diesel above that. Experts warn petrol could hit £., over even more,oil keeps rising. This threat of a further increase in price has forced many into queuing at pumps, trying to get the cheapest price per litre in the chance it may rise more in the coming days.  Joe Michalczuk spotted long queues at his local Sainsburyaposs in Winchester today.They had staff directing traffic he told The Mirror.And the queue had built from pm to pm where it snaked around the majority of the car park.It was identical to the petrol panic. But rather smugly today, I have an electric car.According to HullLive, large queues have been spotted in Hull and parts of Lincolnshire.  Drivers were spotted waiting for longer periods to get their petrol at Morrisonaposs, Holderness Road, on Thursday afternoon.In London, one person wrote on Twitter: Long queues at every petrol station this lunchtime on the outskirts of London.Reminds me of the recent petrol crisis. Iaposm guessing many believe the war in Ukraine will increase the cost of petrol signicantly, so they are filling up their cars now   A picture was posted by another driver, who wrote: Queue at Costco for petrol half an hour ago… Looks like the conflict is gonna drive prices up.. I’d shop around.. PREMIUM diesel at Costco, £., at the BP garage near me, £., Morrisons are £. for standard diesel. One driver, who went to fill up at an Asda in Kingswood, said that the scene was “hectic”. People are being urged to consider ways in which they can use less fuel as prices rise, rather than engaging in panic-buying over the coming weeks.

Mark Holling, from Edinburgh, was initially frustrated that his family had lost two days of their dream holiday in Madeira and had gotten apostrappedapos in Tenere amid the travel chaos.But this wasn’t the end of the complications. Mark and his family, along with their fellow passengers, wound up being flown back to Edinburgh from Tenere due to “ weather conditions in Funchal” - following more than two days of travel. The family had been due to fly from Edinburgh to Madeira on Monday morning, but an initial delay of one day was placed on his flight, meaning it was rescheduled on Tuesday, Edinburgh Live reported. After arriving at the airport on Tuesday morning for the flight, the passengers onboard were greeted with another issue, as the plane could not land at its destination in Madeira, Portugal, due to weather-related issues.  Instead, the flight landed in Tenere on Tuesday afternoon and passengers are still awaiting instructions and an update on when they will eventually make it to their destination, a day later.Mark took to Twitter to complain about the situation to Jet, saying: Ok itaposs time to take us home.In a second tweet, Mark said: So it’s been two and a half days since we left home and two full days of our seven day holiday spent travelling. Hardly worth trying now! Perhaps we should be given the option of flying back to Edinburgh now! Mark also added a photo of the amount of people on the same flight that were awaiting news. Speaking to Edinburgh Live, he added: On Sunday evening they told us the flight was delayed by one day. That left Tuesday morning but couldnapost land in Madeira due to weather problems. After holding we were erted to Tenere, sat there for two and a half hours then into the airport where we queued to be allocated to hotels To be fair, that was the only time we had unpleasant Jet staff. We left the hotel at am to come to the airport for am flight. Started boarding and some of the groups went through, goodness knows where they are now, then postponed again and awaiting update. Still waiting, quite a few folk are thinking we should give up and be taken home. John is travelling with his we and daughter and they only booked a weekaposs holiday in Madeira, meaning two days have already been consumed by delays and travelling. John also noted that his daughter is due back at university on Tuesday, so any extension to the holiday wouldapost be a viable option. He added: Itaposs more than two days lost, we should have had Monday afternoon, all of yesterday and all of today in Madeira. Evenwe do try again weaposre unlikely to be at our hotel before it gets dark and Iaposm not optimistic that weaposll be able to leave here today. Jet have commented on the issue and given an update, saying that due to reasons that were out of their control, passengers on the flight were eventually flown back to the UK last night, on February . A spokesperson said: Due to adverse weather conditions that have been affecting Funchal and the surrounding area since Monday, flight LS from Edinburgh to Funchal was erted to Tenere Airport. Our teams have been working hard to arrange accommodation and refreshments for customers affected by this unforeseen delay, as well as trying everything possible to get everyone to their intended destination as soon as possible. Unfortunately, as weather conditions in Funchal showed no sign of improving, we made the dficult decision to fly customers back to the UK yesterday evening, and all affected customers will receive a full refund. We would like to apologise for any inconvenience caused by these extraordinary circumstances, which were completely beyond our control.

Neighbour Hannah Toumazou had reported hearing screaming” shortly after pm and the couple had regularly been heard “fighting” in the lead-up to Azariaaposs death, a jury was told.  In a statement made to the police, Ms Toumazou described hearing a “loud female scream” which led her to turn off the TV she was watching with a friend Patricia Labella and listen.She recalled: “Seconds after pausing the TV, I heard a female scream, it was loud and constant and she sounded distressed.  Patricia went to the front door, she said, ‘Hannah you need to call the police as he’s going to kill her’. I called  immediately.” In her call to the emergency services at .pm, neighbour Ms Toumazu said: “Hi, my neighbour is really screaming, she lives above me and lives with her partner.  She’s screaming, really screaming, constantly screaming. She lives on the top floor, she keeps screaming, she’s not stopping. It sounds bloody bad. I’m really sorry but this has been going on for a few weeks.” She continued: “We could hear the woman screaming, as soon as I heard the screaming, I said ‘that’s not normal, call the police’.  I could hear the man shouting at the woman but she was screaming so loudly, it was impossible to hear any words. I could hear her crying and moaning and that was quieter and much more subtle. “We could also hear other noises like banging, not like doors but assomeone was throwing something on the floor. Jurors were shown bodycam footage of two police officers who arrived at the scene, seven minutes after the  call was made.  After pushing open the door, they immediately found Azaria, who was lying unresponsive in a pool of her own blood. Alexander was arrested and remanded into custody, before being charged with her murder after three days of questioning.  He was remanded into custody after an appearance at Croydon Magistratesapos Court on December , but was subsequently transferred to a mental health facility. Alexander has pleaded guilty to manslaughter by diminished responsibility.

The -year-old had always struggled with his weight, saying when he was a child he comfort ate and in adolescence he began to smoke and did not exercise. Knowing he had to do something, over the years David gradually stopped eating red meat, gorging on sweets and gave up alcohol and also took up swimming.But after not seeing any results his GP referred him to the Low Carb Program, the Liverpool Echo reports.Have your say on this story in the comment section After joining a  Week Bootcamp, David saw remarkable results and was clinically diagnosed as being in type  diabetes remission. When he took on the challenge, David weighed roughly  stone. Just a few months later, he weighed nearer  and a half stone. He said: I began to get into the habit in my twenties of excessive drinking, leaving the pub at night and getting a takeaway, to munch watching the TV before bedtime. As a chubby, friendly type I had lots of friends but no serious girlfriends, as my overweight appearance and attitude led to being not taken too seriously, by myself and others. I have also been on umpteen weight management programmes that have had some impact but never enough to bring me below the aposobese threshold. Make dieting easy – look up the calorie count on more than , food and drinks at nhs.uk live-well healthy-weight calorie-checker He added: For the first time, through the Low Carb Program, a paradigm change has occurred, I am no longer aposobeseapos, and I feel that, for me, permanent change is possible. I eat a great iety of food, including lots of leafy vegetables, chicken, cheese, berries and cream and fish that I do enjoy. I have learnt to cut down carbs to a low level and, remarkably, this works. In conclusion,you do recognise any of my traits and le journey within your own experience, please do look for the signposts and follow them before you become diabetic, need major surgery or have to live with huge bags of medication or daily injections.

Rachel Curtis, , is a full-time carer for her daughter Betsy, four, who has Downaposs syndrome.Rachel is also at higher risk of serious illness due to having Myalgic Encephalomyelitis , while Betsy is too young for a Covid vaccine, reports Chronicle Live.From today, anyone who tests positive for the virus will not be required by law to isolate and the government has also removed financial support for those who opt to stay home. Free testing is set to be removed in April. Some clinically vulnerable people and their carers say the rule-changes mean going back to living a more restricted le and taking bigger risks every time they leave the house. Rachel has decided to reduce contact with others as much as she can, as she believes the government is failing to protect her and her family. Rachel said: I am very, very worried about the removal of all restrictions... the thought that I could come into contact with someone who has Covid, but is out and about spreading it is terrying. I donapost know what to do.  I canapost stay in the house and shield myself as my daughter wouldnapost be able to go to school or have any sort of a le.It speaks volumes that the government are happy to provide £million for a new flagship Yacht, but providing free Lateral Flow Tests that ensure some protection for disabled people is too expensive for them.Our lives, my le, is worth nothing to them. Rachel said sheaposs heard the argument that Covid restrictions canapost stay in place forever - but she believes that minor restrictions to protect the most vulnerable arenapost the same as full-scale lockdowns, and could continue. She said: Iaposve been told that apossadly, some people will always be vulnerable and that everyone has made enough sacrices to protect usapos. Except their sacrices are having to stay in the house for a week, having to do the odd test and wear a bit of cloth over their faces occasionally. Apparently these minor inconveniences are just too much and those of us with preexisting conditions should just sacrice our lives instead. Rachelaposs anger is echoed by Katy Styles, of the We Care campaign group, which is pushing for a u-turn on the policy. The group says being forced to pay for testing will place a huge burden on carers, many of whom are reliant on the governmentaposs carers allowance, which is rising by just £. to £. a week this year. Many will need frequent tests to ensure theyaposre keeping a vulnerable loved one safe.  Katy said the end to mandatory self-isolation would also be devastating for unpaid family carers, many of whom have already struggled hugely through the pandemic. She said: The changes to the rules are removing any confidence that we might have had coming out of our homes. When you are looking after people who are extremely clinically vulnerable you canapost be too careful, so this has essentially forced us back into some form of permanent lockdown. Iaposm sure some people think that we are being over-cautious butyou are looking after somebody for whom Covid is not just a cold, itaposs a very serious illness, thataposs a bit galling. I totally get it, I donapost want people locked down for any longer either, but any freedom for one should be freedom for everyone, and just having to wear masks and isolateyou are ill isnapost taking too much of a liberty. We will now end up just not being able to do anything.Richard Boggie, of Dference North East, a campaign group led by disabled people, agreed that the change would leave many feeling far more restricted - including those who had only recently begun to feel able to start going out.He said: It is a concern for some, particularly people whoaposve been effectively shielding for the last couple of years and I think it does feel like theyaposve been forgotten. Most people will completely be able to get on with their lives, and they may be carrying Covid but not be particularly affected by it, but they risk passing it to people who are extremely clinically vulnerable. For a lot of people this increases their anxiety about going out because the environment just feels unsafe for them when there are no regulations, many people do feel itaposs too early for this. People have got used to wearing masks and isolating when they need too, there has already been a lot of relaxation of the rules, so it is disappointing to now just abandon them altogether. The government wants to rely on peopleaposs judgement and sense of responsibility, but we know that not all people apply that judgement or think about other people who are at risk.Announcing the change in rules, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that vaccines and treatments must now been seen as our first line of defence and that the justication for ending restrictions was amply there in the scientic evidence.Asked about the impact on the most vulnerable, he said: What everybody needs to do is treat people who are vulnerable in any way with the utmost consideration. If we’re symptomatic with any disease you should treat vulnerable people with courtesy and avoid spreading it.

After Storm Eunice and Franklin, starfish were seen in their hundreds on a beach in Pembrokeshire, Wales, while there has been other reports of marine le found dead. Jellyfish such as Portuguese man oapos wars were also seen washed up in Swansea. Wildle guides for SeaMor Dolphin Watching Boat Trips were astonished to find two find two octopus wandering on the beach in New Quay.  The curled octopusare not an unusual in seawater but it is surprising to see them on the shore. Wandering down the beach, the creatures were seen on Monday shortly before low tide. Josh Pedley, one of the guides was waiking with fellow guide Fran Fitzpatrick when they saw the unusual sight.Josh told WalesOnline : Itaposs not something you see everyday... rock pool and coastal wildle is fascinating to look at, but itaposs important to remember not to touch or remove the wildle. We ended up escorting one of the octopi back to the sea but that was under an exceptional circumstance. I know in recent storms some octopi have been found washed up dead recently, this was the first time I had ever seen any alive still. The wildle guides said they wanted to encourage more caution from people visiting Welsh coasts. We get so many tourists here who arenapost in tune with the natural world, that had this happened in summer, it probably would have ended up in someoneaposs bucket to no end of prodding and poking.  We want to encourage people to enjoy nature responsibly Fran ended up carrying one of the trapped creatures to safety after discovering it in an exposed spot along the beach. The--year-old said: Josh and I both worry quite a lot about how much wildle and shells get disturbed and removed from the shores. New Quay receives a huge number of tourists each year and many do not follow the aposlook but donapost touchapos rule, she said. We have even had incidents of seal pups being abandoned by mothers when too many people took selfies with them or walked their dogs off lead too close and scared the parents away. It is important to helpan animal needs it, but people need to do so intelligently and not interfere without thinking through the consequences first. Responsible and informed approaches when deciding whether to touch or approach a wild animal are important.

Weaposre proud to support the NAACPaposs work and to also partner with the organisation on the newly created annual NAACP-Archewell Digital Civil Rights Award, which will be bestowed to Dr Safiya Noble as part of the rd NAACP Image Awards. The Sussexes have been vocal on matters of race, contributing to the national debate in the US. Meghan told of her absolute devastation at racial isions in a speech to her old high school in June  following the murder of George Floyd. Marking Black History Month later that year, the Sussexes said there was a lost generation of people of colour whose contribution to UK society will remain untapped as long as structural racism exists. In October , Harry admitted his privileged upbringing as a member of the royal family meant he had no understanding of unconscious racial bias. Harry said it took him many years - and the experience of living in we Meghanaposs shoes - to recognise the issue, during a conversation with Black Lives Matter supporter Patrick Hutchinson. Meghan, the first mixed race person to marry a senior British royal in centuries, said in their bombshell Oprah interview that an unnamed royal raised concerns with Harry about how dark their son Archieaposs skin tone might be before he was born.The pair has campaigned on the need for global vaccine equity, with Meghan also addressing gender equality and paid leave for new parents.

Eagle-eyed internet users spotted a cylinder-shaped piece of debris in one of the photos taken by Nasaaposs Perseverance rover - and it was all systems go to discuss what it could be.One person on Twitter said it looked articially created, and suggested it could be an artefact of ancient civilisation on the Red Planet, or a chunk of a crashed UFO.But while theories spiralled, space fans were brought firmly down to Earth after discovering the item in fact belongs to Nasa, and was dropped intentionally.  The piece is a so-called launch abrasion bit which was apparently dumped on the ground back in July. However, it appears to have fallen over since that time. The perseverance team previously tweeted: This particular drill bit was installed before launch, to close out the drill and keep the inside protected. To keep my science clean and clear, Iaposm leaving it aside before I start to collect samples with new, pristine drill bits. Others were quick to slam the space agency for littering on the planet. While I very much appreciate the science behind all of this and what we are learning, , are we keeping track of where we are leaving all of our stuff  Someone at some point needs to clean this all up. one person wrote.  Havenapost even stepped foot on the planet yet and weaposre already littering, another person said. Another pointed out that Mars is a robot graveyard because of all old mission gadgets that have been left behind over the years.

She said: Would going on my aposbacheloretteapos party by myself be weird  Like, I would ask the girls to pitch the amount of money they would have paid for their flight to get to where I am for me to just spend a weekend pampering myself. I just have girls that live all over and they have kids, so I just feel like this would be easier and less stressful for me to do it this way. Commenters on Reddit were baffled by the brideaposs request, with many of them pointing out it was greedy to ask for money from her bridesmaids for her own gain. One said: Lordy, lordy, lordy. She could also ask her bridal party to give her the money they would have spent on their gowns, hair, and make-up, and just have them sit in a pew like everyone . As another added: This woman is so out of touch she is orbital. I hope no one pays for her vacation. But others sided with the bride, suggesting they would be happy to pitch in for the spa dayit meant they wouldnapost have to attend a party they werenapost interested in. Someone said: Iaposd totally pitch in for thatit cost me  th of what the party would otherwise. And I wouldnapost have to go to a bachelorette party. Sounds amazing.

Along with a candid selfie, Karina posted some screenshots of the aposabusiveapos comments which include: You’re a proper bush pig that profits off overweight women’s insecurities. Another user had written: Just puked after seeing this atrocious despicable piece of skin. That’s enough to put me off red meat. Sometimes people just should keep those tuckshop cheeks to themselves. And, she was even told by one troll that they wanted to watch her die. They said: I want to unfollow you so bad but I want to watch you get sick and die more.”  Karina then shared a y caption addressing the torment she goes through.

However, just last week I heard of yet another person taking their own le due to receiving endless harassment and bullying online. Knowing that people hide behind fake accounts to send comments like this is just gutless and coward like behaviour.  Not only would they never say these things to your face but they won’t even comment from their ‘main’ account. It says a lot more about them than you. As much as I hate to say this…I want to almost normalise receiving this kind of behaviour online. She continued: It shouldn’t happen. But it does, all the time to thousands of people. If you find yourself on the receiving end of someoneaposs online bullying please speak up, reach out and try to not hold onto their words. Sometimes this can be easier said than done. But no matter what you’re never alone and I’m so sorry you’re going through this.  Karina attempted to reach out to her fans to urge them to seek helpthey are going through similar online abuse. She added: You don’t deserve it. I’ll keep naming and shaming these cowards to not only stand up for myself but to hopefully show others you can take the control back. Bullying is NEVER ok. Appalled at the nasty remarks Karina receives, many fans fled to the comments to condemn the trolls and praise the influencer for taking a stand. One person commented: People are mean. But you’re NOT! Love the message you send and I’ll keep following to watch you THRIVE! Another user added: How can anyone ever wish death upon anybody  ! Itaposs sad. We live in a sad, sad world. Whilst a third person voiced: If only more people were like you and used their time to spread positivity instead of hate.

And while things like morning sickness and cravings are well-documented side effects, there are also many that most people are completely unaware of which can take mums-to-be by surprise. One mum on TikTok facing a particularly bizarre pregnancy side-effect is Carla, who has discovered a strange issue with her skin - as she claims it has become so squishy it now resembles aposuncooked doughapos. In a video showing off her unusual condition, Carla got her husband to push his finger into the skin just above her ankle, and the man was left looking completely baffled when he removed his finger to find the dent heaposd made in her skin had stayed in place.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.Carla, who posts under the username @carlaincarolina, captioned the video: Being pregnant is fun.The mumaposs video has been viewed more than  million times - and commenters canapost get enough of her squidgy skin which many have said looks like dough. One person wrote: I heard many things, but the body turning into clay [is new]. As another commented: Just like dough.  She became memory foam, a third joked.While Carlaaposs side effects may look bizarre, it is actually a fairly common condition faced by pregnant women and is known as pitting oedema, which is a iation of swelling caused by oedema. According to the NHS, oedema is a build-up of fluid in areas including the ankles, feet, and legs, and can often be seen in pregnant women as well as those who are overweight, have been standing or sitting in the same position for too long, or have eaten too much salty food.Oedema can also be caused by some medications, an insect bite, a blood clot, or problems with your kidneys, liver or heart. The NHS recommends those with oedema try to raise their legs on a chair or pillows and improve their blood flow with gentle exercise such as walking. Many causes of oedema are not serious, but itaposs recommended that you see your GPyour swelling has not improved after treating it at home for a few days, orthe swelling gets worse. When should you call   If your swelling is paired with shortness of breath, a tight feeling in your chest, oryouaposre coughing up blood, you should call  immediately - as this could be a sign of a blood clot in your lungs, which needs immediate treatment in hospital.

But one woman on Reddit has been left completely baffled by her best friendaposs actions after she banned the woman from using a particular name she liked because thereaposs a chance the friend might want to use it in the future.Sharing her story anonymously, the woman explained sheaposs currently pregnant with her first child, and when she told her best friend about the name she was going to give her baby boy, her friend said she couldnapost use it because she has it in reserve for her future child.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. The woman said her friend already has two sons, but is calling dibs on the name on the off-chance that she has a third child who is also a boy. She wrote: I’m three months pregnant with my first child. I mentioned to a good friend a particular name that I liked, and she said aposOh. You can’t really use that. We want to use that for our last babyit’s a boy and that would be awkward.apos For some background, she already has a four-year-old boy and a baby boy born last month.

She added: And then when she also just had a baby boy last month she could have used this name on, when I am presently expecting a child who I’d like to name this  I feel very irrational and petty for still considering the name but it’s the only one I really liked. Commenters on Reddit were equally baffled by the predicament, with many insisting there are no dibs to be called on baby names. One person said: There arenapost dibs for possible babies. To which another replied: There arenapost even dibs for names for babies who are born. As someone with a common name, Iaposve never understood this whole idea of, aposOh Iaposm naming my baby that so you canapost use that name.apos And someone  wrote: In my opinion, itaposs your friend that is wrong.

I like to take Silvio on walks around our neighbourhood with me, she wrote. We were out on one of our walks and it started getting darker, I didnapost really think much about it and started heading towards home.to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.  Up ahead I can see a man on the other side of the street walking in the other direction getting closer to us. He gets closer and notices us, but passes us. He circled back around and walked up to us and started telling me what a pretty dog I have and petting him. I didnapost think any danger was happening. People have often stopped to pet him or comment.Then he stepped back and just stood there weirdly. I started to get uncomfortable and turned to walk away. As soon as the woman tried to remove herself from the situation, she said the man pulled out a pocket kne ashe was able to attack her.She added: I didnapost have time to think about what was happening before Silvio immediately sensed the danger and got in front of me as close as he could get. He planted himself in what I recognised as the stance he takes when he sees another dog. He was ready to attack. He growled for the first time Iaposve ever heard in his le. He barked, which is another thing he rarely does, and started to lunge at this dude.  After seeing the dogaposs reaction, the man quickly stepped back and ran away in the opposite direction from what she was walking. Still guarding his owner, Silvio stayed firmly in front of the woman until her husband arrived - constantly looking up at her to see whether she was OK. When we got back home, I was obviously still a bit shaken up, and Silvio just rested his big old head in my lap giving me the sweetest look ever and calming me down, she added. He got so many treats and hugs and big kisses. I just canapost even thank him enough. I knew he is protective of me but way closer and more protective of my husband, but I never really thought much about what he would dowe were legit in danger. He usually loves everyone and demands to be petted by any person he meets, which is probably why he let that man pet him since I didnapost sense any danger at first. I assume the guy was doing this to test outSilvio was dangerous or not. The womanaposs husband took Silvio home from a friendaposs house when he was just one year old. The dog was super skinny and covered in ticks when he rescued him. She said:The friend lived close to the lake, and Silvio showed up with a frayed rope around his neck and a huge scar on his neck. He thought it looked like someone slit his throat and dumped him at the lake, or tied something heavy to the rope and dumped him and Silvio was able to get free. Theyaposve been best friends ever since. I will love and protect that dog like heaposs my child. Despite being illegal in the UK without exemption, experts say pitbulls can make great pets when raised with care and compassion.Animal welfare charities including Dogs Trust, the RSPCA and The Kennel Club have issued calls for the law on banned breeds to be changed, saying the government should instead impose new measures that would put more responsibility on owners of dogs who show aggressive behaviours.Do you have a dog story to sell  Email paige.freshwater@reachplc.

Oana, Gabriel, Adrian and Alexandra are on a mission to stop low-income families from being forced to abandon their dogs at the kennels. Savaaposs Safe Haven is now asking for donations and volunteers to help provide food for the animals in rural areas of southeastern Romania, for owners who are struggling to feed their animals. Le before the pandemic was dficult for communities - now it has become an attempt at survival, Alexandra Sava, , told The Mirror. to ourTeamDogs newsletterfor your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Like many animal shelters, Savaaposs Safe Haven has seen a rise in the number of family pets turning up at the gates since Covid hit. Theyaposve also noticed a signicant drop in donations - making it harder to take every stray and injured animal in. The Pet Food Bank is for people who donapost have the money to feed their animals. We will also be feeding dogs and cats on the streets and in the villages, Alexandra said. Savaaposs Safe Haven has run multiple projects over the last few years, from educating children in schools to providing free veterinary care for pets and campaigning for animal welfare.  Now, the Pet Food Bank will be their biggest project to date. We will need a large number of volunteers and financial support to make it work, Alexandra explained. The family currently houses  animals - exceeding their  limit at the shelter - meaning they cannot take in any more pets, but they can help feed them. The shelter is entirely run by donations from supporters and friends overseas and works with volunteers in England and Germany to rehome dogs abroad. Alexandra and her family are now asking for contributions towards their latest mission, to help continue their work and feed more animals.If you would like to donate towards their cause, you can visit their website for PayPal and bank details.

The tyrant added that all Ukrainian servicemen who lay down arms will be able to safely leave the zone of combat. In a stark warning the West, he said: “To anyone who would consider interfering from the outside -you do, you will face consequences greater than any you have faced in history”. Western governments reacted with alarm to Putin’s words given his irrational approach to date and the scale of Russia ’s nuclear stockpile.Ukrainian ambassador Vadym Prystaik said his countrymen believed they would have been better prepared for the attacksit hadn’t given up its nuclear weapons in . Putin claimed Russia did not plan to occupy Ukraine - but Western officials said it was not yet clear whether he would install a puppet government in Kyev.  He has long wished to revive the Soviet Union with retired Nato supreme commander General Sir Richard Shirreff saying it was “entirely plausible” that was Putin’s aim. He added thatRussia puts “one bootstep” into Nato territory - which includes the Baltic states and Poland - the entire alliance including the UK will be at war. Russia’s nuclear capability: facts and figures Russia possesses approximately , nuclear weapons. These can be launched from missiles, submarines, and aircraft. In , Russia spent an estimated US billion to build and maintain its nuclear forces. The former Soviet Union tested  nuclear weapons between  and  Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons between in  under the Budapest Security agreement. Kiev had previously had the third largest stockpile in the world, but they were under Moscow’s control.

This is particularly good advice for anyone with a veg plot.A sowing plan of what seeds and how many to sow each month is key to successful growing and means you won#t be throwing out unwanted seedlings and that your flower and veg beds will be full all year round.A word of warning about sowing direct into the ground at this time of year there may be a few sunny days to enjoy outside but the soil can still be chilly, making germination and survival hard.Sowing indoors is a better option. Not only does it provide a warm environment for germination, but seeds and seedlings are easier to protect from pests. If you can find some environmentally sound sowing trays and containers, rather than using plastic, that#s even better. Paper and cardboard pots can be packed snugly in a tray which avoids over handling and makes them easy to water.Small seeds should be scattered sparingly on the surface of compost filled seed trays then covered with a sprinkling of sieved compost. If the seeds are big enough to handle, you can sow them inidually into cm pots. The quantity should be according to the instructions specied on the seed packet, but usually for small seeds between five and  seeds per pot. For plants that grow long roots, such as peas or beans, you can put them into a compost filled cardboard toilet roll tube and, once ready, they can be planted outside, tube and all.Most seeds will germinate and grow in a warm setting such as a greenhouse, cold frame or on a sunny windowsill. You should keep them damp by using a mist spray to start with before moving onto a watering can with a fine rose nozzle.Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. Simply ease out a clump of seedlings with an old cutlery fork or dibber and # handling only the leaves to avoid damaging delicate stems and roots # gently tease them apart. Drop inidual seedlings into a five-centimetre compost filled newspaper pot ensuring the lower leaves are above the compost level. Once you see roots appearing from the bottom of the pot, it’s time to pot on to a bigger pot before planting outside once the weather and soil warms up.If you are growing your own veg, now is a good time to sow first early potatoes. These can be planted from mid-March, however planting times will y across the country according to temperature and risk of frost. Early potatoes grow well in the ground and in containers such as potato grow bags or old compost bags.

did Nicola Sturgeon say today Free PCR testing to continue in ScotlandNicola Sturgeon expressed frustration over Boris Johnsons approach to Covid testing that he outlined on Monday.The Scottish Government is \"determined to retain\" free Covid testing, in contrast to England.Nicola Sturgeon criticised the decision by Boris Johnson to end universally free testing and said that the Scottish Government was looking for clarity on funding for the testing programme for devolved countries.Ms Sturgeon said: “Current funding arrangements mean that though taxpayers in all four UK nations contribute to the costs, it is decisions taken for England that determine the resources available to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland for testing and other Covid measures.“As of now, we have no clarity on how much of the Covid testing infrastructure the UK government intends to retain no clarity on how much investment will support it in future and no clarity on whether the Treasury will provide additional resources to pay for it or demand instead that funding is taken from where in the healthbudget.“I hope we get this clarity soon so that we can out in more detail our longer-term approach to testing.“However, and I will say more later, I want to give an assurance that the Scottish Government is determined to retain a robust testing system capable of providing Scotland with strong resilience against future Covid threats, and firmly aligned with public health advice and the principles underpinning our National Health Service.”.remove: Nicola Sturgeon update LIVE as Covid roadmap published: Covid Scotland: Vaccine passports scrapped and changes to face mask rulesNew Covid Strategic FrameworkThis weeks announcement coincides with the publication of the Scottish Governments Covid strategic framework.Nicola Sturgeon said the Scottish Government’s strategy was now to “manage Covid effectively, primarily through adaptations and health measures that strengthen our resilience and recovery”.In her statement to MSPs, the First Minister said: “Widespread vaccination coverage and better treatments have reduced the direct harms of the virus.“As a result, using restrictions to suppress infection is no longer as necessary as it once was.“And, given the wider harms caused by protective measures, it is no longer as justiable either.“The strategic framework therefore makes clear that in future we will rely less on legally imposed measures to control the virus – and more on vaccines, treatments, and sensible adaptations and good public health behaviours.”The framework sets out three broad levels on how the Government may respond to potential iants that could see restrictions reimposed, Nicola Sturgeon had said.Setting out the contingency strategy for low, medium and high risks, the First Minister told MSPs: “If a new iant emerged that was more transmissible and more severe, perhaps with the ability to evade vaccine or natural immunity, this would likely be classied as high risk.\"In those circumstances, we might advise people to limit social contacts for a period and to work from home where possible and we may introduce some temporary protections for high-risk settings.“If a new iant was either more transmissible or more severe, but not both, as is the case with Omicron, the initial threat assessment would likely be medium.\"In these circumstances, there may be a legal requirement to wear face coverings in some settings and we might issue guidance for businesses and service providers on reasonable measures to

homes warm and the lights on.Forthcoming increases to the interest rate and rises in National Insurance payments will exacerbate the situation.It is heart-breaking. I have had food bank helpers in tears saying we can#t wait another year for the Right to Food to kick in.

Avoid plantingthe ground is frozen or extremely waterlogged.Your planting hole should be no deeper than the roots, but at least three times the diameter of the root ball.It#s a good idea to soak bare-rooted trees for about  minutes before planting.Place the tree in the planting hole so the first flare of roots on the stem are level with the soil surface. If you plant the tree too deep, it can result in rot and disease.You may need to insert a stake for top heavy or larger trees. Refill the planting hole, firm gently and water in.Drought stress is common in newly-planted trees so make sure you keep watering throughout the growing season. The quantity required will y with soil type, but  to  litres per square metre – four to six watering cans – each week in dry weather will do the trick.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to sow lettuce seeds – both under cover and outside.If you start now, it will give you a continuous supply that can be harvested throughout the year.Sow in modules or fibre pots under cover to have lettuces ready to plant outside in four to six weeks.

Bute Council, and Michael Forsyth MP, Secretary of State for Scotland.The future of the band is in jeopardy because Argyll and Bute Council has a shortfall of funding this year of more than £ million.As part of an enormous package of cuts aimed at saving money, the council plans to axe music tuition in all schools which would mean the end of the school band.In a support letter, Sir Paul describes the proposals to axe music tuition as #catastrophic# and urged the council to re-consider.He wrote: #I feel it would be disastrous for the area to lose this essential musical training, not only to the local people whose lives are enriched by music, but also for the tourism on which so much of the local economy depends.#Campbeltown and the surrounding district is famed throughout the world for its traditional music and it would be very unwise even to consider implementing measures which would effectively bring this reputation to an end.#He added: #I am lending my strongest support to the local people who are fighting to protect the teaching of music in their schools and I will urge the council to reconsider any plans they may have to implement these catastrophic and far reaching measures.#FIFTY YEARS AGOCampbeltown#s coal situation is worsening and now merchants have only one week#s supply left.The local firm of D McNair and Son announced earlier this week that it had only seven days# supply left, and it is rationing its regular customers to cwt per week.#Although,# said the company#s owner, Mr Donald Shaw, #we have also got a good supply of dross and coke and a fair supply of peat.#The SCWS is in exactly the same position it too will run out of coal in one week.The Scottish Gas Board has barely two-and-a-half weeks# coal supply, despite the fact that it has been using propane gas with the coal to stretch its supplies.#Unless more supplies are received after this period, all the gas will be off,# said a spokesman.As a result of the national strike, electricity cuts hit Campbeltown on Monday, bringing work at the Andrew Douglas clothing factory to a halt.The factory manager, Mr Harry Moffat, anticipating an early Monday morning power cut, called his employees to work on Saturday.#These cuts will definitely affect factory production, although I hope to get as many hours# work as possible between the cuts,# said Mr Moffat.A director of the local Golden Grain Bakery said that its production will also suffer because of the strike.#Every effort will be made to produce a full range of bakery products by switching daysht workers to night workcuts prevent day work,# he added.Campbeltown#s householders have also suffered great inconvenience due to the power cuts and this has resulted in a steady demand for candles in local shops.One of the most disappointing aspects of the power cut from the local teenagers# point of view was the cancellation of a dance on Monday evening.The dance was arranged specially for Valentine#s Day.SEVENTY

If you are sure you know something to be the case beyond contradiction, you don#t need faith.Doubt, on the other hand, is strongly linked with faith because, while you may have faith strong enough to move mountains, there is always the possibility your faith is misplaced.I would argue the existence of God is proven by large amounts of evidence, but in the end that is a matter of faith.The Bible recognises this right at the start where Adam and Eve leave the Garden of Eden and do not see God face-to-face anymore.From now on, they, and we who come after them, must live by faith.This is what it is to be human – and faith is always open to challenge.When suffering occurs, when disaster looms, people ask, #Where was God # and use what has happened to deny God exists.Yet the faithful keep believing. Why There have been many attempts by faithful people to explain unbearable tragedies with faith in a loving God. Few are convincing – at least at the time.For me, the love that people give to one another is God reflected in human goodness.Living by faith is not easy. Sometimes it means being assailed by doubts and I believe we must be honest about our questions.After all, did not Jesus say: #The truth will set you free.# When those most bitter and painful tragedies strike us down, faith can be a consolation – sometimes the only consolation – even as at the time it is tested to breaking point."},{"url":null,"title":"town causes to land co op cash","story":"Thanks to Co-op members choosing the supermarket#s own-branded products and services, over £ million has been raised for more than , causes since .Each year, members are encouraged to pick a local cause in their community that supports access to food, mental wellbeing support or opportunities for young people, helping to build stronger, more resilient communities across the UK.In Tarbert, Fèis an Tairbeirt, Tarbert Soccer Centre and Tarbert After School Care are to receive grants and, in Mid Argyll, Argyll and Bute Befrienders, Mid-Argyll Transport Volunteers and Mid Argyll Multiple Sclerosis Centre will benefit.#We know that this year is going to be another incredibly challenging year for local causes and communities,# said Rebecca Birkbeck, director of community and membership at the Co-op.#With the cost of living rising dramatically already this year, charities are likely to bear the brunt of people being more conscious about their spending.#At the Co-op, we work hard to bring people together to ‘co-operate for a fairer world’.

decided to highlight five of their favourites that definitely cheer them up!PrimrosesFor a quick splash of colour, you can’t go wrong with primroses.There’s a vast selection available at this time of year and, with an almost infinite palette of colour, it can be dficult to choose your favourites.These low-growing plants are very robust and tolerant of the typically challenging weather we get at this time of year.Although mainly sold for immediate colour, it’s entirely possible that you’ll be able to enjoy their flowers again next year.Their close relative, the polyanthus, is also very striking at this time of year, with a main stem bearing its flowers a few inches off the ground and,you need some height, these could be the answer.HelleboresSometimes known as the Christmas rose, these native woodland perennial plants are ideal for shady corners and under trees.Depending on the iety, they’ll flower from November to February and come back bigger and better year after year.They’re available in a wide range of colours, from the original white to the more modern deep purples and speckled flowers that are so popular today.As always, the key to getting the best from your plant is to consider its native conditions and replicate that where possible. As hellebores are native to woodland, they’ll enjoy plenty of organic matter, so make sure you add some when planting and add mulch from time to time to help retain the moisture in the soil. If you’re planting under trees, they will have to compete for water so you may need to provide water until it is well established. Once it’s well-rooted, the organic matter in the soil, the mulch and its broad leaves will generally maintain adequate moisture levels, although you may need to water occasionallythere’s a particularly dry spell.The real bonus with the hellebore is that, as a perennial, it will continue to grow bigger over time and after a few years you’ll be able to ide it into several plants – and all gardeners just love free plants!Garrya ellipticaSometimes known as the ‘silk tassel’ bush, this medium-sized evergreen shrub is native to coastal areas of America and so it’s quite happy in East Lothian gardens, where salty winds from the North Sea can be testing for our plants.This easy-to-grow shrub is a great addition to the garden, providing a backdrop to the vibrant colours in the summer garden. However, it really comes into its own in the winter garden, when the glossy green leaves provide welcome foliage and an abundance of beautul silk-like tassels at this time of year.Jasminum nudlorumMore commonly known as the winter-flowering jasmine, this deciduous shrub is unusual in that it flowers before producing its foliage.A robust, medium-sized shrub, it’s often trained against a wall or used as ground cover. It is happy in coastal areas and so ideal for our East Lothian gardens.The bright yellow flowers give a wonderful show at this time of year and are a sure sign that spring is on its way! It’s very easy to grow and tolerant of a wide range of conditions.CamelliaSometimes called the Japanese rose, camellias have been cultivated in Chinese and Japanese gardens for many centuries. When the tea trade expanded in the late s, Camellias were imported by the British East India Company for the wealthy British owners and by the s they were considered to be the luxury flower and the height of fashion.With its glossy green leaves and stunning flowers, the evergreen camellia is one of the first shrubs to flower each year.One of our most popular garden plants, it can be grown as a shrub or small tree, and comes in a huge range of dferent shapes, sizes and flower colours. It grows well in both containers and borders, but don’t forget that they prefer acidic soil. If your soil isn’t naturally acidic, add plenty of ericaceous compost around the roots when planting and maintain the pH level by feeding with fertiliser for acid-loving plants.Just one interesting fact – did you know that the most widely grown camellia on earth is the commercial crop, Camellia sinensis  Grown for its leaves, Camellia sinensis is none other than the tea plant, whose leaves are harvested for tea drinkers around the world!Hopefully we’ve given you some ideas that’ll help you add interest to your garden in February. If you’d like more information, please do call in and have a chat with our knowledgeable and experienced plant team – we just love to talk gardening!"},{"url":null,"title":"m-s-pancake-day-2022-range-including-percy-pig-frying-pan-mixes-sauces-spreads","story":"The Percy Pig Pancake Pan is £ and comes with a pancake batter squeezy bottle for precise batter application.MS is also selling a Pancake Party Gt Bag for £ which includes two pancake mixes, maple syrup and recipe cards.In the offer you will get: class\"instagram-media\"data-instgrm-captioneddata-instgrm-permalink\"https:www.instagram p CaFpVBuqJbd  utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading\"data-instgrm-version\"\"style\"background: #fffborder: border-radius: pxbox-shadow:   px  rgba,  px px  rgbamargin: pxmax-width: pxmin-width: pxpadding: width: .%width: -webkit-calcwidth: calc\"href\"https:www.instagram p CaFpVBuqJbd  utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading\"style\"background: #ffffffline-height: padding:  text-align: centertext-decoration: nonewidth: %\"target\"_blank\"style\"background-color: #fffborder-radius: %flex-grow: height: pxmargin-right: pxwidth: px\"style\"display: flexflex-direction: columnflex-grow: justy-content: center\"style\"background-color: #fffborder-radius: pxflex-grow: height: pxmargin-bottom: pxwidth: px\"style\"background-color: #fffborder-radius: pxflex-grow: height: pxwidth: px\"style\"display: block height: px margin:  auto px width: px\"width\"px\"\"px\"viewBox\"   \"version\".\"xmlns\"https:www.w.org  svg\"xmlns:xlink\"https:www.w.org  xlink\"\" fill\"#\"d\"M.,.

Stephen is passionate about pet nutrition.He said: “Traditional syrup-filled human pancakes would not be suitable for dogs as they contain salts, sugars and carbohydrates.“A dog can’t break down the fats and carbs like a human does. If eaten regularly, the result would generally be rapid weight gain which of course can lead to chronic conditions such as diabetes.“Also, more immediate issues may be seen in dogs with allergies, intolerances and particularly sensitive stomachs.”This year pancake day falls on March . Otherwise known as Shrove Tuesday, it is the day before the start of Lent fasting practiced by Christians in the run up to the Easter festival.Pancakes are supposed to use up things like eggs, milk and sugar before the fasting begins.Stephen has designed a recipe especially for dogs to enjoy this Pancake Day, replacing common allergens like wheat flour and cow’s milk with dog-appropriate alternatives.The recipe can be found on the Ocado website, where you can also purchase the necessary ingredients.Ingredients:Step Sieve the flour into a mixing bowl. Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the egg and ml of lukewarm water before whisking until the ingredients are fully combined.Step Heat a non-stick frying pan to a medium temperature then add a ladle of the pancake mixture to the pan.Step Cook the pancakes for  seconds on each side before removing from the heat and leaving to cool fully.

address Boris Johnsons Living with Covid policy and the scrapping of all Coronavirus restrictions in England as of Thursday.This week, Nicola Sturgeon announced her Covid strategic framework also known as a roadmap out of Coronavirus restrictions.Heres what Ms Sturgeon said during her Covid briefing today.Today First Minister @NicolaSturgeon will give an update to @ScotParl on #coronavirus.Watch live ➡️ https:t.co zWDxpMyAe from :pm. pic LKTccbDImNicola Sturgeon expressed frustration over Boris Johnsons approach to Covid testing that he outlined on Monday.The Scottish Government is \"determined to retain\" free Covid testing, in contrast to England.Nicola Sturgeon criticised the decision by Boris Johnson to end universally free testing and said that the Scottish Government was looking for clarity on funding for the testing programme for devolved countries.Ms Sturgeon said: “Current funding arrangements mean that though taxpayers in all four UK nations contribute to the costs, it is decisions taken for England that determine the resources available to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland for testing and other Covid measures.“As of now, we have no clarity on how much of the Covid testing infrastructure the UK government intends to retain no clarity on how much investment will support it in future and no clarity on whether the Treasury will provide additional resources to pay for it or demand instead that funding is taken from where in the health budget.“I hope we get this clarity soon so that we can out in more detail our longer-term approach to testing.“However, and I will say more later, I want to give an assurance that the Scottish Government is determined to retain a robust testing system capable of providing Scotland with strong resilience against future Covid threats, and firmly aligned with public health advice and the principles underpinning our National Health Service.”                                                                                                              : Nicola Sturgeon update LIVE as Covid roadmap published: Covid Scotland: Vaccine passports scrapped and changes to face mask rules                                                                                                              This weeks announcement coincides with the publication of the Scottish Governments Covid strategic framework.Nicola Sturgeon said the Scottish Government’s strategy was now to “manage Covid effectively, primarily through adaptations and health measures that strengthen our resilience and recovery”.In her statement to MSPs, the First Minister said: “Widespread vaccination coverage and better treatments have reduced the direct harms of the virus.“As a result, using restrictions to suppress infection is no longer as necessary as it once was.“And, given the wider harms caused by protective measures, it is no longer as justiable either.“The strategic framework therefore makes clear that in future we will rely less on legally imposed measures to control the virus – and more on vaccines, treatments, and sensible adaptations and good public health behaviours.”The framework sets out three broad levels on how the Government may respond to potential iants that could see restrictions reimposed, Nicola Sturgeon had said.Setting out the contingency strategy for low, medium and high risks, the First Minister told MSPs: “If a new iant emerged that was more transmissible and more severe, perhaps with the ability to evade vaccine or natural immunity, this would likely be classied as high risk.\"In those circumstances, we might advise people to limit social contacts for a period and to work from home where possible and we may introduce some temporary protections for high-risk settings.“If a new iant was either more transmissible or more severe, but not both, as is the case with Omicron, the initial threat assessment would likely be medium.\"In these circumstances, there may be a legal requirement to wear face coverings in some settings and we might issue guidance for businesses and service providers on reasonable measures to reduce the spread of Covid on their premises.“Lastly, in the absence of a new iant, ora new iant was neither more transmissible nor more severe, andvaccines continue to be effective, the threat classication would likely remain low. Obviously, this is the level we hope to reach and stay at on a sustainable basis.“In these circumstances, there would be no legally imposed protective measures. Instead, we would continue to advise iniduals and organisations to adopt sensible public health behaviours.”People who test positive for Covid- should continue to isolate in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed.The legal requirement for infected people to self-isolate in England will be lted from Thursday, Boris Johnson announced on Monday.Although there has never been a legal requirement in Scotland, Ms Sturgeon said the guidance to isolate would remain.In her update to the Scottish Parliament, Ms Sturgeon said: “This new approach will see us resort much less, hopefully not at all, to legally imposed protective measures.“Instead, we will rely predominantly on vaccines, treatments and sensible public health behaviours and adaptations.“However much as we might wish it was not the case, Covid is still a public health risk here and globally and likely to remain so for the foreseeable future so we must also remain vigilant and prepared.”Vaccination appointments for the vulnerable - age group will begin in mid-March.--year-olds with an underlying health condition or who lives with those who with underlying conditions should come forward for their vaccine.Eligible children are being invited for their vaccination by NHS Scotland via letter or phone call.These appointments will be concentrated for evenings and weekends so that parents and s can attend.Visit the NHS Inform website for more information.The First Minister has been under pressure from hospitality bosses to scrap Scotlands vaccine passport scheme for late-night bars and clubs.Leaders in the hospitality industry have been demanding an end to the legal requirement for customers and staff to wear face masks in licensed premises.In her update today, Nicola Sturgeon confirmed that the vaccine passport scheme will end on February .The face-covering legal requirement in shops and on public transport will end on March , Nicola Sturgeon has announced.Ms Sturgeon said: “As of March , assuming no signicant adverse developments in the course of the virus, we expect that the legal requirement to wear face coverings in certain indoor settings and on public transport will be converted to guidance.“However, we will continue to strongly recommend the wearing of face coverings in shops and other indoor public places, and on public transport.”She added: “Even though certain measures, for example face coverings, may not be legal requirements in future, we will still recommend voluntary compliance as part of the range of behaviours that will help keep us safe as we manage Covid in a more sustainable and less restrictive way.”Today, , more people have tested positive for #coronavirus, people were in hospital yesterday which is  more than the day before.Sadly  more people who tested positive have died Latest update ➡️ https:t.co YnREdCegv pic WCZTIZVjwThe First Minister also updated MSPs on the latest Covid figures., more people have tested positive for Coronavirus today, Nicola Sturgeon said.There were , people in hospital yesterday which is  more than the day before and  people were in intensive care yesterday with recently confirmed COVID-. more people who tested positive have sadly died which brings the total to , in total.Looking towards vaccination, ,, people have received their first dose of a COVID- vaccination, ,, have received their second dose, and ,, have received a third dose or booster.For more information, visit the Scottish Government website."},{"url":null,"title":"calvin-harris-announces-mystery-scottish-gig---get-tickets","story":"The musician will be coming to Scotland in summer , but as of yet the location has been kept secret.Those interested in attending can sign up for an exclusive pre-sale on the Ticketmaster website.Harris has not given any hint to the performance on his own social media.The show is part of a number of gigs he will be performing this year, including  exclusive shows in Ibiza.class\"instagram-media\"data-instgrm-captioneddata-instgrm-permalink\"https:www.instagram p CaT_TVTsE_  utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading\"data-instgrm-version\"\"style\"background: #fffborder: border-radius: pxbox-shadow:   px  rgba,  px px  rgbamargin: pxmax-width: pxmin-width: pxpadding: width: .%width: -webkit-calcwidth: calc\"href\"https:www.instagram p CaT_TVTsE_  utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading\"style\"background: #ffffffline-height: padding:  text-align: centertext-decoration: nonewidth: %\"target\"_blank\"style\"background-color: #fffborder-radius: %flex-grow: height: pxmargin-right: pxwidth: px\"style\"display: flexflex-direction: columnflex-grow: justy-content: center\"style\"background-color: #fffborder-radius: pxflex-grow: height: pxmargin-bottom: pxwidth: px\"style\"background-color: #fffborder-radius: pxflex-grow: height: pxwidth: px\"style\"display: block height: px margin:  auto px width: px\"width\"px\"\"px\"viewBox\"   \"version\".\"xmlns\"https:www.w.org  svg\"xmlns:xlink\"https:www.w.org  xlink\"\" fill\"#\"d\"M.,.

We must hope that the BBC’s assessment is wrong, but for once I will take it at its word.First, Professor John Mearsheimer, of the University of Chicago, a leading proponent of the realist school of international relations, said on Wednesday in an online seminar with the student politics society of King College, Cambridge, that absorption of the Ukraine into Nato is a red line for Russia, end of.Secondly, Russia, with a GDP of that of Italy or Spain, take your pick, has a nuclear doctrine that incorporates its nuclear arsenal into its operational, possibly tactical, thinking. That is, its threshold of use is lower than that of say, the UK. We do have warheads that can dial down yields to levels similar to that of what passes for Russian battlefield-use levels.Thirdly, as Prof Mearsheimer goes on to say, there is a potential end point to this, other than Armageddon, Ukraine becoming a neutral country. If its good enough for Finland, which used to be part of the Imperial Russian Empire, its good enough for Ukraine I agree with him.Fourthly, only % of the American public are prepared to condone military action by the United States and thankfully we have the US Congressional elections in nine months time.Bill Ramsay, Glasgow.WHAT PRICE A NUCLEAR DETERRENT AN argument for nuclear weapons has been that it will prevent war on European soil.However, here we have a Russian dictator who is waging war on a sovereign country in Europe. We have to stand by and watch and rely on ineffectual sanctions to bring Vladimir Putin to heel.Why only this  Becausewe meet force with force, who knows how Mr Putin might react, including using nuclear weapons.Yet, had Mr Putin access only to conventional weapons, we could have met his aggression with appropriate military force. Might that have been deterrent enough to prevent this invasion  Who knows. But what we do know is, we are hamstrung.So much for the nuclear deterrent.William Thomson, Denny.IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN NO SURPRISEI FIND it incredible that Western leaders have expressed such surprise at the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine. The massive build-up of Russian troops and military hardware on the Ukraine borders taking place over the last several weeks was always a signal of their intentions to invade. The so-called exercises in Belarus in the north, the eastern fringes and the Black Sea to the south were clearly a smokescreen and for the West to watch this build-up of ,-plus troops and expect a diplomatic solution was naivety in the extreme.Now is the time for signicant, punitive and long-lasting sanctions against the Putin regime by Nato members and other western powers.

I also look at the French news, Turkish, Al-Jazeera and the like and Bloomberg for financial news. I have been retired for many years and so can indulge myself by sitting in the morning and absorbing a wide iety of views. Is our Government going to stop me  I have given up watching BBC and STV in the morning because of the quality of the presentation and content.Now we are moving into a new phase where we are going to get all the propaganda about how good Ukraine is and how bad Russia is. Whether we agree or not, Russia feels threatened by Nato.I remember well when the boot was on the other foot. I was on a Thor missile base when the Cuban crisis took place and we were minutes away from a nuclear war because of how the US felt threatened. The USSR backed down . This time there was no backing down. We had no leaders with the ability to find a way out of the situation. They only threatened Russia. Let us hope that someone emerges who can find some way to stop the escalation of conflict. That will not come by selling more arms to Ukraine.Jim McAdam, Maidens.KREMLIN WOULD LOVE UK BREAK-UPWITH Russia invading Ukraine and war unleashed on European soil once more, Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP need to make clear whether they seriously wish to proceed with a second referendum to break up the United Kingdom in .The economic and social consequences of the SNP succeeding were always going to be severe, and to this can be added the geopolitical danger of destabilising a major Nato power at a time of war in Europe.One thing is for sure:the SNP succeeded in breaking up Britain, removing nuclear weapons from Scotland and casting the United Kingdom into the history books then Vladimir Putin, for one, would be delighted and dancing a jig in the Kremlin. No need for tanks in the UK when you have the SNP to do your work.Dr Bruce Halliday, Dumfries.PUTIN IS NOT LIKE HITLERBEING of a certain age, I can clearly recall the days and weeks preceding the declaration of the Second World War, the conversations, press comments and general atmosphere. There are many points of similarity but, equally, there are several signicant dferences which are patently obvious to an observer of history.For some years leading up to  Hitler and the Nazis had demonstrated beyond question the overwhelming national support for his regime. Quite apart from Hitler’s well-remembered political rallies where the audience was always immense and supportive, his other achievements in Germany had gathered him and his party huge popularity. Think of the VW Beetle, the autobahns, the Hitler Youth and other similar organisations. As well as having a nation totally behind him, Hitler was surrounded by his many loyal henchmen all bedecked in spectacular military unorms.In contrast, however, in Russia at present we have a solitary little man sitting alone in a huge room with unknown support and the few obvious lieutenants backing his ideas out of sight as he announces his plans to the world: apparently, all his own ideas created with many distortions and hoods.

I think with social media it is much easier to get those messages out there – terminology and everything , and I am very happy to use it.“My advice [to parents] would be talk to your children, make sure you are listening to them and that you are not imposing your views on them all the time.\"Also talk to other parents who may be going through the same thing. Just accept it\"Ro said their parents had been very supportive of their le-changing decision.They said: “When I was really young, I didn’t think about gender or sexuality. “I always played with the boys and didn’t like girly things. It was hard hearing people call me ‘her’ and ‘girl’ all the time.“I started using the name Ro in school first of all, with my friends. I was around .“And then when I was used to it I asked my family to call me Ro. It took them a while to get used to it, but then it was good.“Language is always evolving. People are making new words for people like me. And we have to start using those words.”“If I say I’m non-binary you should just accept it.”It comes as a last-ditch effort to stop Scots from being able to self-identy their gender in this year’s census, regardless of their legal status, failed. Campaign group Fair Play for Women lost its appeal yesterday against a decision made by Lord Sandison, who ruled transgender people can give a dferent answer from the sex on their birth certicate without the need for a gender recognition certicate . : Trans people can self-identy on census after campaign group loses final court appeal Eòrpa reporter Annabel Maclennan also spoke to Melvin, a student and trans man who is originally from the Netherlands and fluent despite only starting to learn Gaelic two years ago.He said: “I’ve seen people who are much older than me who are open about being trans – that’s important too. Seeing that there is a future for you, that you can live your whole le as yourself.\"It would have been good to have had that when I was at school.“The waiting list for an initial consultation to begin the process of transitioning is three years. I’m quite fortunate that I can go to a private clinic but it’s not easy for many people and not good for their mental health, because you feel uncomfortable in your body.“I don’t like using the toiletthere aren’t any gender-neutral ones. When toilets are gendered, I don’t know which one to use.”The documentary also heard from supporters and opponents of reform of the Gender Recognition Act, which will also cut the period in which applicants need to have lived in their acquired gender before it is officially recognised, to three months.Melvin said: “Some people know they are trans when they are eight years old, so I don’t think it’s fair that they should have to wait so long.”Sarah, an American who has lived in the Highlands for  years, didnt come out as a trans woman until she was in her s and told of her apprehension about telling work colleagues.: Stornoway Gaelic cafe should be welcomed, so why arent the locals more positive She said: \"It got to the point where I was Sarah everywhere apart from at work.\"When she did come out she said the company, a building firm, were really supportive and had a going away party for her former self.\"Even with the rougher around the edges people in the company, they were accepting,\" she said.\"When it comes to the bigotry and the hatred that is directed against us, it makes it hard and thats what the people who are against us want.\"With the increased visibility of people like me, the people who do not want us to exist are also more visible and they are loud.

I don’t knowthat’s quite weird but I actually quite like that.“PyeongChang was a dream, I tried my hardest, almost made it.

If the power to cooling pumps is disrupted or fuel-storage tanks are damaged, the results could be catastrophic, he said.Reactor Number Four at the power plant exploded and caught fire deep in the night on April , , shattering the building and spewing radioactive material high into the sky.Soviet authorities made the catastrophe even worse by failing to tell the public what had happened, angering European governments and the Soviet people.The two million residents of Kyiv were not informed despite the fallout danger, and the world learned of the disaster only after heightened radiation was detected in Sweden.The building containing the exploded reactor was covered in  by an enormous shelter aimed at containing radiation still leaking from the accident. Robots inside the shelter work to dismantle the destroyed reactor and gather up the radioactive waste.It is expected to take until  to finish dismantling the reactors. Ukraine decided to use the deserted zone as the site for its centralised storage facility for spent fuel from the country’s other remaining nuclear power plants.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Fighting probably continues on the outskirts of the city.“It is unlikely that Russia has achieved its planned Day  military objectives. Ukrainian forces have presented fierce resistance across all axes of Russia’s advance.”Earlier, the country’s President Volodymyr Zelensky ordered a full military mobilisation lasting  days.Mr Johnson told his Cabinet on Thursday night that the UK could be proud of its role in supporting Ukraine, after the Prime Minister announced the “largest and most severe” package of sanctions Russia has ever faced to punish Mr Putin, whom he labelled a “blood-stained aggressor”.Among the new UK sanctions introduced were measures to hit five further oligarchs, including the Russian president’s former son-in-law, and to target more than  businesses and iniduals.Mr Johnson said he was sanctioning “all the major manufacturers that support Putin’s war machine”, will ban Aeroflot from touching down planes in the UK and will freeze the assets of all major Russian banks, including immediately against VTB. vw,vw,px, px\"Prime Minister Boris Johnson updating MPs in the House of Commons on the latest situation regarding Ukraine Writing in The Daily , Ms Truss said the UK is “proud to lead by example” in terms of its sanctions against Russia.She said: “We warned repeatedly alongside our allies that any further invasion would incur massive consequences with severe costs.“We have been working in lockstep to show Moscow that we mean what we say. Our unprecedented package of economic sanctions will leave no part of the Putin regime unscathed.”In the US, Mr Biden also announced extra sanctions to target Russian banks, oligarchs and high-tech sectors, with more troops deployed to Germany to bolster Nato.“Putin is the aggressor,” Mr Biden said. “Putin chose this war, and now he and his country will bear the consequences.”He said: “Tomorrow, Nato will convene a summit – we’ll be there – to bring together the leaders of  allied nations and close partners to affirm our solidarity and to map out the next steps we will take to further strengthen all aspects of our Nato alliance.”A package of further EU sanctions was announced by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen early on Friday following a special meeting of the EU Council.She wrote on Twitter: “First, this package includes financial sanctions, targeting % of the Russian banking market and key state owned companies, including in defence.“Second, we target the energy sector, a key economic area which especially benefits the Russian state. Our export ban will hit the oil sector by making it impossible for Russia to upgrade its refineries.“Third: we ban the sale of aircrafts and equipment to Russian airlines.“Fourth, we are limiting Russia’s access to crucial technology, such as semiconductors or cutting-edge software.“Finally: visas.

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645089617694.jpg--1_700_people_apply_for_a_life_less_ordinary_with_stena_line.jpg?1645089617000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220217news1 700 people apply for a life less ordinary with stena line","story":"Ferry company Stena Line has been overwhelmed with the positive response from the public to its recent recruitment campaign ‘A Le Less Ordinary’, which aims to fill  vacant positions onboard its Irish Sea ferries. , applications were received from people across the UK and Republic of Ireland.

Mr Roddy said he is an advocate of an all-island soccer league which would bring people from dferent communities together.“I believe that an all-island league would encourage young people to visit all the stadiums throughout the country,” the Derry man added.That proposal was backed by an audience member who argued that clubs from Northern Ireland could bring thousands of fans across the border and vice versa which would be a boost for local economies. He asserted that opposition to proposals are nonsensical. Another audience member spoke of the need to include minority ethnic communities, such as the large Polish community, who have made Ireland their home.He referenced the many Ukranian people who will now been displaced, a portion of whom will come to Ireland.Panel members said that conversation is moving at pace but meaningful progress towards inclusivity will take time.Minister for Sport Jack Chambers TD concluded: “Sport is an important source of civic pride, but is so much more than that.It improves our health, helps us meet new and erse people and is the foundation for communities right across this island.“We have a long and vibrant tradition of collaboration in sport across the island.Many of our sporting bodies are organised at an all-island level our international teams in sports as erse as rugby, cricket and hockey draw on the talent of people from all parts of this island for their success and, our Olympic heroes come from all backgrounds, cultures and traditions, representing the full ersity of communities and traditions on the island of Ireland.”Most ReadDUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson ‘was in discussions’ to quit the partySnow arrives in Northern Ireland: Ice warning to continue into Friday morningSuzanne BreenOpinionHe may never admit it, but Sir Jeffrey Donaldson may rue the day he didn’t say ‘I do’ to Doug BeattieWhat Russian attack on Ukraine could mean for Northern IrelandBelfast’s oldest swim club disbands after  yearsTop VideosPlayVideo: North Belfast man in Ukraine records his experience on the morning Russia launched attacksPlayResident of eastern Ukraine city films shellingPlayBelfast wakes up to a blanket of snowLatest Northern IrelandSnow and ice hit parts of UK overnight as unsettled weather set to lastNewtownabbey man shares his experience from quiet streets of KyivDonaldson met with UUP leader ‘at an Army barracks’ in attempt to keep talks top secretDonaldson says he makes no apologies for engaging with other unionists following claims he contemplated rejoining UUPDUP and Sinn Fein in war of words over critical state of Northern Ireland’s health serviceLatestPropaganda and fake videos of Ukraine invasion bombard usersNato allies to prepare next steps after ‘horric’ rocket strikes in KyivSean Penn currently in Ukraine working on documentary about Russian invasionUkraine warns of ‘subversive groups’ in Kyiv as US flags potential siege of cityWhat the papers say – February ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

So large was the crowd wishing to attend, that the doors had to be closed and hundreds were unable to attend, a report reads.By this time the club was renamed the Victoria Amateur Swimming Club and Le-Saving Society and, in , the Victoria-Ormeau Ladies Club amalgamated with the club, as mixed bathing was becoming the norm.The Belfastmet up with club members June McKee, who is in her early s, Brigid Blackand Dorcas Peshkin who — despite being  years young — only retired from being a swimming instructor at the onset of the pandemic.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Brigid#s mother, Mary Cummings, who passed away in , was the club#s treasurer for many years, while Dorcas and June served tenures as secretaries.I first started with the club in , when I was knee-high to a daisy, with my brother, who would have been friends with Dorcas, June said.Dorcas and the older ladies were great swimmers and I was a bit of a fill-in, I tortured them! Over the years the numbers of members went down. Kids these days aren#t as interesting in swimming, it#s all football, football, football. I think swimming is better for kids — football is not going to save their le.My fondest memories of the club are back in the s with Dorcas and my brother and everyone, going to galas every weekend. It was such a great time. It#s a shame we couldn#t keep it going, because so many people like us were raised through the club.Dorcas joined the club with her brothers in the s and says she loved training and the competitive era of the club.I made le-long friends and a lot of champions came out of Victoria. I was a breast stroke and butterfly swimmer and swam in the Irish Championships and was an Ulster Champion — I always seemed to come second in the Irish! she said.I was club secretary for ten years and you do make great friendships in swimming. Although I don#t come much these days, I have other interests, Dorcas said with a smile, It is the end of an era.There was so much of a social le to it. We would go to Dublin or Cork or wherever for the championships and there were always dances afterwards — or we would run the championships over again in the sea for packets of crisps. The one thing about swimming clubs was they were always very mixed.”The club later moved to the old Grove Baths on the Shore Road, which was later demolished to make way for the current Grove Wellbeing Centre.In recent years, however, logistical problems and dwindling numbers has resulted in Victoria Swimming Club making the sad decision to disband.Brigid’s family ran a grocery and bakery on the Antrim Road and her mother first heard about the club from a customer.It was very turbulent times on the Antrim Road so we loved coming down to the Grove.”Most ReadDUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson ‘was in discussions’ to quit the partySnow arrives in Northern Ireland: Ice warning to continue into Friday morningSuzanne BreenOpinionHe may never admit it, but Sir Jeffrey Donaldson may rue the day he didn’t say ‘I do’ to Doug BeattieWhat Russian attack on Ukraine could mean for Northern IrelandBelfast’s oldest swim club disbands after  yearsTop VideosPlayVideo: North Belfast man in Ukraine records his experience on the morning Russia launched attacksPlayResident of eastern Ukraine city films shellingPlayBelfast wakes up to a blanket of snowLatest Northern IrelandSnow and ice hit parts of UK overnight as unsettled weather set to lastNewtownabbey man shares his experience from quiet streets of KyivDonaldson met with UUP leader ‘at an Army barracks’ in attempt to keep talks top secretDonaldson says he makes no apologies for engaging with other unionists following claims he contemplated rejoining UUPDUP and Sinn Fein in war of words over critical state of Northern Ireland’s health serviceLatestPropaganda and fake videos of Ukraine invasion bombard usersNato allies to prepare next steps after ‘horric’ rocket strikes in KyivSean Penn currently in Ukraine working on documentary about Russian invasionUkraine warns of ‘subversive groups’ in Kyiv as US flags potential siege of cityWhat the papers say – February ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Fighting probably continues on the outskirts of the city.“It is unlikely that Russia has achieved its planned Day  military objectives. Ukrainian forces have presented fierce resistance across all axes of Russia’s advance.”Earlier, the country’s President Volodymyr Zelensky ordered a full military mobilisation lasting  days.Mr Johnson told his Cabinet on Thursday night that the UK could be proud of its role in supporting Ukraine, after the Prime Minister announced the “largest and most severe” package of sanctions Russia has ever faced to punish Mr Putin, whom he labelled a “blood-stained aggressor”.Among the new UK sanctions introduced were measures to hit five further oligarchs, including the Russian president’s former son-in-law, and to target more than  businesses and iniduals.Mr Johnson said he was sanctioning “all the major manufacturers that support Putin’s war machine”, will ban Aeroflot from touching down planes in the UK and will freeze the assets of all major Russian banks, including immediately against VTB.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk dcc .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_dfcfb-d--ae-bbface_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk dcc .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_dfcfb-d--ae-bbface_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk dcc .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_dfcfb-d--ae-bbface_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk dcc .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_dfcfb-d--ae-bbface_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Prime Minister Boris Johnson updating MPs in the House of Commons on the latest situation regarding Ukraine PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":truePrime Minister Boris Johnson updating MPs in the House of Commons on the latest situation regarding Ukraine Writing in The Daily , Ms Truss said the UK is “proud to lead by example” in terms of its sanctions against Russia.She said: “We warned repeatedly alongside our allies that any further invasion would incur massive consequences with severe costs.“We have been working in lockstep to show Moscow that we mean what we say. Our unprecedented package of economic sanctions will leave no part of the Putin regime unscathed.”In the US, Mr Biden also announced extra sanctions to target Russian banks, oligarchs and high-tech sectors, with more troops deployed to Germany to bolster Nato.“Putin is the aggressor,” Mr Biden said. “Putin chose this war, and now he and his country will bear the consequences.”He said: “Tomorrow, Nato will convene a summit – we’ll be there – to bring together the leaders of  allied nations and close partners to affirm our solidarity and to map out the next steps we will take to further strengthen all aspects of our Nato alliance.”A package of further EU sanctions was announced by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen early on Friday following a special meeting of the EU Council.She wrote on Twitter: “First, this package includes financial sanctions, targeting % of the Russian banking market and key state owned companies, including in defence.“Second, we target the energy sector, a key economic area which especially benefits the Russian state. Our export ban will hit the oil sector by making it impossible for Russia to upgrade its refineries.“Third: we ban the sale of aircrafts and equipment to Russian airlines.“Fourth, we are limiting Russia’s access to crucial technology, such as semiconductors or cutting-edge software.“Finally: visas.

This was a warning sign of things to come as just moments later McCoubrey managed to put the ball into the net courtesy of the outside of his right boot after a scramble in the box.Again, Carryduff showed their resilience and still relied on their counterattacks, the latest coming from captain Conway, although his misjudged pass denied team-mate David Quigley a chance at goal.The pressure would continue to mount on the Carryduff back line and soon it was - as McCoubrey registered his second of the match mdash albeit through an unorthodox but neat finish.Celtic defender Blaine Connolly saw his effort fantastically thwarted by Carryduff lsquokeeper Leggett, who pounced to the bottom right corner of his net with a strong outstretched arm to deny further punishment.The weather began to give its input into the game as temperatures ped bitterly and the wind began to blow harshly at intervals.Although this cannot be cited as the determining factor in this contest by any stretch of the imagination, it certainly played its part when Carryduffrsquos Emmet Curran saw his through ball carried beyond its intended target.Carryduff did manufacture a rare breakaway and it looked asstriker Jonathan Wilkinson would open the away sidersquos account when a pass from midfield left him with just lsquokeeper Curran to beat.However, an impressive last-ditch tackle from defender Gary Carberry allowed the Celtic number five to hook the ball to safety, thus further frustrating the opposition.Celticrsquos Shaun Megahey saw his left-footed effort saved before Carryduffrsquos Joseph McBrien swept up the loose ball and in the last notable action of the half, Conway witnessed his lowly struck effort palmed away from danger by the Hoopsrsquo number one.As the second half kicked off, the home side showed no signs of relenting as they pushed for more goals.Conaill Kerr saw his point-blank effort superbly saved from six yards by lsquokeeper Leggett, who, despite the score line, made numerous contributions to prevent his side conceding into double figures.This over-eagerness from the hosts would cost them as they were caught short at the back, leaving Raymond Grant unmarked  yards from goal.The striker quickly picked his spot and unleashed a lovely curled effort into the top right hand corner to get his side off the mark.Unfortunately for Carryduff, this was as good as it got as Celtic replied almost immediately with McMahon grabbing his second of the matchafter rounding the lsquokeeper for an easy tap in.Things went from bad to worse for the away team when Stephen Galbraith slipped a pass into the path of team-mate Conaill Kerr, who made no mistake with his finish in the one-on-one scenario.At this point Carryduff were aiming for damage limitation but Celtic smelt blood. McMahon completed his hat-trick with an eye-catching acrobatic effort before McCoubrey, tapped in his third of the day.Hoops defender Carberry picked up a yellow card after some unsavoury words with the official and captain Michael Rice was left red-faced after midfielder Curran knocked the ball between his legs, but the home outfit didnrsquot let that deter them from their onslaught.Carberry atoned for his booking in the form of a late header from a Galbraith corner delivery to round off the scoring at -.After the match, hat-trick hero Sean McMahon gave his thoughts on his sidersquos resounding victory.ldquoIt was a good performance, he said. ldquoWe knew they only had  players so we had a good chance of winning but you have to play the  minutes and make sure you get the victory at the end of the day.ldquoWersquove put pressure on the league leaders, itrsquos good to score three goals but the main thing is to get the three points.He added: ldquoI donrsquot usually score headers so thatrsquos my pick of the goals for me.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey, B Connolly, R Fitzpatrick, G Carberry, M Rice , B Treacy, C McCartan, S McMahon, J McCoubrey, C Kerr.

The Gill brothers, Gareth and Kyle, were among the replacements.Ballynahinch used the conditions superbly to burst into a lead they would not surrender.Playing with the wind, they pinned the students back with excellent tactical kicking and after missing an early long range penalty they went for the corner following a UCC offence at the breakdown and Kyle McCall burst from the edge of the maul to score.A great kick and chase moments later led to another penalty and another maul try for McCall. Greg Hutleyrsquos superb conversion took Ballynahinch  points clear after  minutes.The second quarter yielded only a single UCC penalty. Ballynahinch were not quite as accurate as they had been earlier in the game and small errors and indiscipline allowed UCC plenty of possession. However, excellent defence and long clearing kicks meant that the Ballynahinch line was never threatened.The second half was a scrappy affair and Ballynahinch began to fall foul of the referee at the breakdown.UCC kicked a long range penalty to close the gap to six points and missed another moments later as Ballynahinch struggled to put phases together into the wind. However, they sprung to le on  minutes and battled upfield where McCall was denied another maul try for a double movement.Following this disappointment UCC won a big scrum penalty and had the chance to kick to the corner to really turn the screw but misjudged the wind and kicked the ball dead. From the resulting scrum it was the away side who were celebrating as they won a penalty to relieve the pressure and settle the nerves.As the game entered the final quarter it was an error-strewn, stop-start affair, with injury stoppages and errors denying either side the chance to stamp any authority on proceedings.A mistimed Ryan Wilson tackle earned him a yellow card on  minutes and when UCC kicked the resulting penalty to close the gap to three points UCC were probably favourites.However, Ballynahinch produced an excellent spell of forward play with their maul continuing to be a very powerful weapon.They won a penalty from a maul on halfway and went for the corner, using up vital time on the sinbin and subjecting UCC to huge pressure deep in their .A solid scrum allowed Rory Butler the chance to go for the line where UCC gave away a penalty at the breakdown. Ballynahinch piled on the pressure, carrying hard at the line and desperate UCC defence led to another penalty and a yellow card for their replacement prop.The game was now there for the taking and following another big scrum on the UCC line Ballynahinch tried to put Conor Rankin over on the blind side.Multiple phases later UCC looked to have weathered the storm when they stole the ball and kicked clear. A superb chase saw Ballynahinch caught in possession but Cairns made an excellent arcing run to scythe through the cover and head for the line.He was tackled just short but the supporting Hutley was on hand to barge over, taking a knock in the process.He recovered to slot the conversion, sending Ballynahinch  points clear going intothe last five minutes and they saw out the game in relative comfort.Celebrations lasted long into the night and Ballynahinch have now put daylight between themselves and UCC.Third from bottom UCD arrive at Ballymacarn Park on Saturday to take on a rejuvenated local outfit who now have a snf of avoiding the relegation play-off.

One sat down while the other went up to the counter and asked for a bag of coins to be changed.As the men waited in the bank a Securicor delivery van arrived and a guard began leaving money bags into the bank.As the guard left a second bag into the bank one of the robbers produced a handgun and pushed him to the floor while the other vaulted the bank counter and grabbed the bags.Both men then left the bank and raced down the alleyway beside Irwinrsquos Superfoods to the red Sierra which was waiting, with a driver, at the entrance to the supermarket car park.The car sped off and was found on Sunday abandoned in a cul-de-sac off Hillfoot Crescent.CASTLEWELLAN ndash Mill bosses this week denied they plan to close the doors on a Castlewellan factory ndash less than three years after the plant was reopened.Speculation has intensied that Castlewellan Yarns, which is based in the former Moss Lane factory on the townrsquos Dublin road, is to be shut.The company is a ision of Linfield Group of textile-companies but a spokesman when asked about possible closure said this week: ldquoThat is not the situation at the moment. The Castlewellan plant was set up to do a specic job. It is having to compete head-on in a dficult world market at this time of depression.ldquoThere has been short-time working and we have operated at  per cent of capacity. Castlewellan is totally dependent on an upturn in the general linen market.The Linfield Group announced in  that it intended to commence production in Castlewellan. It said then it hoped to create up to  jobs in a poundm investment. However, employment levels have failed to reach this mark and the Ulster linen trade generally is currently experiencing one of it biggest slumps for a number of years.ARDGLASS ndash An assurance has been given that the long-awaited improvement package for Ardglass harbour will go ahead, despite a sizeable increase in cost projections.The chief executive of the Northern Ireland Fishery Authority, Mr Ronan Fitzsimons, has said he is confident the work on the scheme will proceed, even though it is expected to cost substantially more than the Governmentrsquos pound.m budget.Work on the project, which involves extending the main pier by  metres and providing rock armouring at the back of the harbour wall, was expected to begin next month.But trawlermen, who have been campaigning more than  years for the scheme, were startled when it emerged late last week that tenders received were vastly above original estimations.It has been claimed that some of the tenders are up to pound, over the initial budget.Mr Fitzsimons said yesterday there would be a delay in the start date but denied rumours that the scheme is being put on ice indefinitely.ldquoThe start will have to be put back but there is no question of the project being ped, he remarked.STRANGFORD ndash The proposal to build a tidal barrage across Strangford Lough has been killed off ldquoonce and for all.Stormont Minister Richard Needham axed the plan because of the damage such a barrage would have caused to the sensitive environment of Strangford Lough.The announcement has been welcomed by environmentalists who described the Ministerrsquos attitude to the Lough as ldquovery positive and encouraging.Mr Needham made his announcement at the annual conference of the Royal Society for the Protection of birds and the Irish Wildbird Conservancy in Newcastle on Saturday.Opening the conference in the Slieve Donard Hotel, Mr Needham said the barrage proposal would no longer be merely shelved but would be dropped completely.ldquoIn the early rsquos there was a proposal to construct a barrage across the Narrows to allow the generation of electricity using tidal power, explained Mr Needham. ldquoAt that time, the proposal was examined from many viewpoints. On economic grounds it just did not measure up, and so it was shelved.ldquoThere is no doubt that the creation of a barrage would severely and irretrievably damaged the superb wildle of the Lough, altering the tidal regime, ruining feeding grounds, and in the process reducing muchthe scenic quality, said the Minister.KILLYLEAGH ndash A government minister is to be asked by Down councillors tomorrow to lt the embargo on marina development at Killyleagh.A deputation of councillors is hoping to persuade Economy Minister, Mr Richard Needham, to allow a marina development on the shores of Strangford Lough.The Minister will be told of the fears that Killyleagh is being turned into a ghost town because of substantial job losses in its industrial base ndash and the belief that a marina could hold out hope of a revival.The townrsquos Ulster Unionist councillor. Mr Sam Osbourne, said ldquowhile we are meeting the Minister about the decision last August to refuse three separate applications for a marina, it goes much wider than that. There is a need for an overall plan for this town.ldquoThe whole place is badly run down and has probably never been at a lower ebb. Killyleagh is a ghost town now. We need some new source of employment and a marina linked to a hotel would be a big boost.DOWNPATRICK ndash Councillors targeting Downpatrickrsquos arts centre for closure may be prevented from carrying out their plans by the terms of the buildingrsquos lease.The -year lease on the building, which was agreed when the council took over the former Town Hall from Lord Dunleath, does not enable the council to sell the property andit is closed for more than  months the building will revert to its original owner.Under the terms agreed, the council took over the building on the basis it would be used solely for the purpose outlined in Article  of the Recreation and Youth Services Order.ldquoThis paragraph specically empowers councils to provide facilities for ldquorecreational, social, physical and cultural activities.The lease on the arts centre states that the owner, Lord Dunleath, would enforce his right to take back the building within  monthsits uses were outside the terms of that clause.This means that several years of council investment, eighteen months worth of running costs, and a pound, grant from the Department of Education would be wasted.DUNDRUM ndash Crisis-threatened Dundrum Regatta has been saved from collapse after villagers rallied to a special meeting last week.The Regatta, one of the oldest summer festivals in Northern Ireland, looked doomed earlier this month but an appeal by organisers has attracted increased community support and ensure the eventrsquos future.The special meeting was called after just five people attended the organising committeersquos annual meeting earlier this month.It was immediately adjourned and an appeal issued to villages to support the reconvened meeting, held in St Donardrsquos hall on Tuesday night.Committee chairman, Mr Paddy Cunningham said: ldquoI was very pleased to see the turnout had increased signicantly and we were able to proceed with the business of organising this yearrsquos Regatta..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Jimmy\u0027s 10k back  ","story":"ONE of the most prestigious races in the local running calendar is ing to the streets of Downpatrick after an absence of three years.Jimmyrsquos K, organised by East Down Athletic Club and supported by MB McGrady  Co, Chartered Accountants, will take place on Sunday, March .Given that it will be the opening race of the  K Grand Prix, and one of the first road running fixtures of the Athletics NI calendar, organisers are expecting a packed entry list.Jimmyrsquos K was last raced in Downpatrick in .

Improved disabled access is also part of the investment plan which will result in a number of paths being widened.Council officials say the planned improvements are essential for local people who are increasingly using the trails as part of their daily routine and commute.Since the start of the Covid pandemic, there has been a major increase in the number of people walking along the banks of the Quoile with this set to increase over the spring and summer.Council chairwoman Cathy Mason and Downpatrick councillors Oonagh Hanlon and Gareth Sharvin are delighted with the master plan and the benefit that it will provide for the town, its residents and visitors.Cllr Mason said due to Covid- restrictions, many areas across the district have experienced an increased use of outdoor spaces.ldquoThis has been so important for the health and wellbeing of residents and visitors to our area, she continued.ldquoThe Quoile in particular has been extremely busy with families and friends using the location for running, walking, cycling or simply meeting up with each other. The need for good quality outdoor space has never been as important.Cllr Hanlon said she was ldquoexcited to see the first phase of the local authorityrsquos Covid recovery scheme being rolled out.ldquoI am pleased the work will include enhancing boardwalks and paths at Jane Shore with improved disability access in particular at the gates which will be of particular interest to local anglers who have lobbied for better access, she said.ldquoThis work is vital in enhancing the tourist and heritage offerings we have locally and create better linkages to the town centre.Cllr Sharvin said the joint local authority and government department investment will signicantly improve access along the Janes Shore area and help disabled anglers in particular who have highlighted with him the challenges they face of accessing the walkway.ldquoThe planned improvements will enable everyone to enjoy the uniqueness of the Quoile area as a recreational and tourism asset, he said.Cllr Sharvin said work to resurface the footpath, replace wooden fencing and walking boards, in tandem with the provision of new accessibility gates and cutting back trees and hedging will make a major dference.He said the foliage will be cut back next month and when that is completed, it is hoped that work on the other planned improvements will get underway.The Quoile Angling Club is holding its annual meeting in Murphyrsquos bar, Downpatrick, on March  at pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Preservation order put on hold pending planning application  ","story":"A DECISION to make a preservation order to protect trees at the centre of the Exploris Ropebridge car park project in Portaferry has been put on hold.The Department of Infrastructureconfirmed this week that it will wait for the outcome of a planning application before it decides what to do with the trees that local people are campaigning to save.Ards and North Down Borough Council lodged a planning application with its own planning department last December  to gain permission to build an extended car and coach on its own land near the popular visitor venue.The project has been controversial since local conservationists discovered last year that in order to build the car-park, nine mature protected trees would need to be removed.It was later confirmed that the council did not have the authority to remove the trees under a permitted development and needed to apply for planning permission for the car-park which should have been competed by next month.The Portaferry Stop The Trees campaign gathered more than , names in opposition to the trees cull and even offered the council an alternative design which would have saved the trees but resulted in less parking spaces. The design was rejected by the council.The campaign started last May when contractors turned up with equipment and portacabins and marked the trees for felling.Local resident Lily Devlin noticed the development and started the campaign, first rallying support via her Facebook page, and then starting an online petition.Speaking on behalf of the Save the Trees Campaign group, Cathie McKimm said: ldquoThe council got this wrong from the beginning.ldquoWe now have a situation where the council are applying for planning permission for a project they have already appointed contractors for and the project has increased by almost % in cost.ldquoIn bringing in experts to late at a huge cost to the ratepayer to fix the many mistakes theyrsquove made, including failing to include a drainage system in a flood risk area, the council are now having to contribute more than pound, to this scheme and growing, whereas before they were only contributing approximately pound, for the same scheme. ldquoGiven all the conflicts of interest that the council now have we do not believe they can assess this planning application objectively, and believe that the Department of Infrastructure needs to call it in and conduct a full investigation about how this has been handled.A council spokesman confirmed that a planning application for the project would follow regulations which apply to all councils throughout Northern Ireland in making its decision.He said: ldquoThe council will let matters follow due process, mindful of the procedures put in place by the Department for such planning applications.He also confirmed that the project, which was planned as a local tourism boost, had increased in costs.ldquoThe council has applied for and obtained funding of pound, towards the project. At the start of the regeneration scheme, the proposed costs were circa pound,, he said.ldquoHowever, with the passage of time, increased construction costs and refinement of the scheme , the costs were last estimated at circa pound, which was agreed by council in October .A DfI spokesperson confirmed it had initially considered making a preservation order on the trees.He added: ldquoHowever, on January  , the council confirmed that it had instead opted to submit a planning application. This was lodged on December  to the Planning Service of the council.

Daffodils are peaking out of the ground, the weather is softening, and the feast of St Brigidrsquos Day , February , has passed.This can mean only one thing ndash lambs! In fact, lambs have been born in our practice since before Christmas. But the majority will be coming to a field near you over the next few weeks.Now, modern flocks have a lot of sheep in them. Indeed, there are about five million sheep in Ireland overall. Thatrsquos one for every man, woman and child.Our domestic sheepis descended from a primitive European ancestor, today found mainly in Corsica. In the past it was common for sheep to havejust one lamb. But today, thanks to better feeding, shelter and shepherding, it is possible for sheep to have twins, triplets and even quads!This abundance can come with problems though. Whata sheep doesnrsquot have enough milk to feed this many lambs  Well, farmers have come up with a number of solutions.The first is lsquopet lambsrsquo. These lambs are hand reared. They are fed with a bottle using condensed milk from commercial suppliers. Or the milk can be taken from another ewe who is producing a lot.As anyone with a baby will tell you, this solution is labour intensive and will keep the shepherd working around the clock. But they are dedicated, and they do it! It is not always sustainable in the long run. Another solution is fostering.Lamb fostering is where a ewe adopts the lamb from another ewe. The reasons for fostering can be manold. A lack of milk is one of the major reasons. The ewe may not want to take on another lamb, not recognising it as her own, but shepherds have adapted one of naturersquos many wonders to encourage it to happen.They use a technique called olfactory imprinting. Have you ever wondered how a ewe can recognise her own lamb in a flock of hundreds  One reason is that, just after birth, the ewe learns the smell of her newborn. This is what olfactory imprinting means.Shepherds can take advantage of this amazing process by rubbing some of the birthing fluid of the newborn lamb into the wool of the lamb to be fostered. The ewe will then accept the lamb as one of her own, and feed and care for it. The lives of many lambs are saved in this way.So when you next look at the fields of Lecale, check out the sheep and seeyou can tell them apart. Evenyou canrsquot, their mums can!.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Ulster Aviation Society left ‘dismayed’ over council at Festival of Flight decision  ","story":"THE decision by Newry, Mourne and Down Council to cancel this summerrsquos international Festival of Flight in Newcastle was taken without consulting one of its key partners, it has emerged.Last weekrsquos decision to pull the plug on the event mdash which was last held in  mdash was taken in secret during a meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Tourist and Regeneration Committee.It is understood that no contact was made with the Ulster Aviation Society which has played a major role since the inaugural festival and described its disappointment at the cancellation decision.Regularly attracting in the region of , people to the resort in the summer, the flagship tourist event has been a major success for over a decade.Council officials say that due to the challenges in planning such a major festival, securing commitments from participants and with the uncertainty caused to date by the pandemic, organising this yearrsquos event would not be possible.Some councillors believe that given the local authorityrsquos St Patrickrsquos Day parades in Downpatrick and Newry are set to go ahead next month and with the further easing of Covid regulations, some form of airshow could have been organised for Newcastle this summer.This week, Slieve Croob councillor Alan Lewis urging the council to confirm that next yearrsquos festival will go ahead.The Ulster Aviation Society said it was ldquodisappointed and dismayed about the cancellation of the airshow and the fact that the organisation had not been consulted.Society chairman Ray Burrows said it was ldquoastonishing that the event had been ldquoshot down in secret, with no reasonable explanation.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke has urged the local council to ldquograsp the opportunity and organise an alternative event, suggesting a large scale festival that incorporates and builds on the most popular elements of the Festival of Flight.He is keen to see an event showcasing the regionrsquos ldquooutstanding food and drink offering with Newcastle a designated venue for arts, culture and music events to create opportunities showcasing the entrepreneurial spirit and pioneering innovation of the district.Mr Burrows said while these were ldquoall excellent suggestions, he said as elements in addition to, or within, the Festival of Flight, surely not as a replacement for it.He continued: ldquoThat said, we would be pleased indeed to meet with the council or the mayor to discuss the matter. We want to help Newcastle demonstrate in a powerful, popular way how important our aviation future and heritage are to Northern Ireland.ldquoThatrsquos exactly what did in recent years, before Covid.ldquoWe [the UAS] had probably the most popular exhibition within the ground-based event and thousands of parents have brought their children for photographs in our Spitfire and our Alouette helicopter, at no charge.Mr Burrows suggested that unless the councilrsquos decision is reversed, or at least re-assessed, he expects there will be tremendous disappointment from the public.The international festival was cancelled in  because of bad weather and in  and last year because of the Covid- pandemic it was also grounded.Urging the local authority to confirm that it will be chocks away for next summerrsquos Festival of Flight, Cllr Lewis said that for the past two years, the organisation has been unable to deliver a tourism events programme due to the impact of Covid-.ldquoAlthough the possible impact of future Covid iants is dficult to predict, it is hoped that larger scale events can resume this summer. This will be a welcome boost to residents and the local trade and hospitality sectors, he continued.ldquoCouncil research indicates that almost poundm was generated in  for the district as a direct result of tourism events. Therefore, it is bitterly disappointing that this yearrsquos Festival of Flight will not be going ahead.Cllr Lewis said the income that it would have generated would be a welcome boost to traders in the town and benefit the collective tourism industry across South Down.He continued: ldquoWe must not underestimate the huge draw of this annual festival. I note that council officers have said that throughout this past  months they had continued to engage with key stakeholders including the RAF.ldquoIt was advised that due to challenges planning the festival, securing air assets and the uncertainty of the pandemic that it has not been possible to host the festival of flight this year.Cllr Lewis revealed that he has been contacted by many aviation enthusiasts who are bitterly disappointed that the festival wonrsquot go ahead.He added: ldquoI fail to see how the event couldnrsquot have at least been planned for later in the year, now that we know the majority of restrictions are to be lted.

Photo: Stefan Rousseau PA WireThe invasion of Ukraine is a violation of a sovereign European democracy and a tragedy for millions of people who have been plunged into a maelstrom of suffering and oppressive uncertainty. Parents in Kyiv and Kharkiv put their children to bed on Wednesday night with hopeful promises that they would be safe. They have wakened on Thursday morning to the horror of Putin’s airstrikes and exchanges of gunfire. These are the people who will lose the most as the European continent stands on the precipice of a terrible conflict.What has happened in Ukraine demands the strongest possible response from the international community but particularly from our European partners. This is the greatest test of European Solidarity since the end of the second world war, but more than that, it is a test of our common humanity.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

He is at war, not just over territory ly claimed, but with the European values of coexistence and respect for dference and ersity. The political situation in the Donbas may be complex but the simple truth is that the tyranny of one is about to bring misery and suffering to millions.The sanctions brought to bear against Putin’s regime must go further than a small handful of oligarchs — it must be severe it must hurt Moscow and it must threaten his position. That also means dismantling the influence and power of money and political donations in London from iniduals close to the Russian state. The natural consequence of such action is that it will cause economic pain for us and other European states as well. This will not be easy but we must be prepared to shoulder some of the pain to ease the burden on the people of Ukraine. Every political party in Ireland should stand visibly and vocally in solidarity with them today. We must all be prepared to take the action necessary to end this invasion.Colum Eastwood, Foyle MP, SDLP leader ——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.The PAC report comes after the NI Audit Office last year raised concerns about how the fund was administered.Auditors criticised the failure to take applicants’ bank balances and reserves into account when allocating money.Auditor General Kieran Donnelly’s report last June highlighted how the largest grant of £. million was paid to Royal County Down Golf Club, which had a “very signicant bank balance and a high level of reserves”.The SSF was one of a number of schemes delivered by Stormont departments to help ious sectors deal with the financial implications of the pandemic.Of the £ million allocated, £. million was distributed across  sport governing bodies, including £. million to Ulster GAA, £. million to the IFA, £. million to the IRFU and £, to  other sporting governing bodies.Some £. million was distributed across  sports clubs.The grant awards were calculated by comparing the income and expenditure for the Covid- year with the average income and expenditure for the previous three years.However, there was no requirement in the scheme to consider the reserves or bank balances held by applicants and whether the losses incurred by the organisations would lead to the imminent risk of closure.The PAC has made  recommendations aimed at preventing a repeat of the errors.Chairman of the committee William Humphrey said: “As a committee, we were surprised that the department and Sport NI appeared to hand out monies to organisations that could have survived without funding or with much less funding.”The PAC report found that, due to the need to devise the scheme quickly, several flaws went unchallenged.It said the scheme allowed organisations to quanty their losses during Covid- without signicant investigation or challenge.“We found that the objectives of the SSF, to ensure that organisations across a range of sports would survive, were certainly admirable,” Mr Humphrey said.“However, the department and Sport NI did not devise a set of assessment criteria that they could apply to the applications they received.“This flawed approach meant that some large and very profitable organisations, such as golf clubs, were awarded monies that might have been better spent on smaller, more financially precarious groups.”He added: “We were surprised that the department and Sport NI believed that it was acceptable and value for money to award public funds to clubs and organisations that ensured they achieved the same profit as they had in previous years.“In a year where many organisations were struggling financially, providing taxpayers’ money to support the profits of sports clubs is something that should not have happened.“What is even more concerning is that neither the department nor Sport NI appeared to realise that this underwriting of profit would be the result of the way in which the scheme was designed.“In our evidence session, large grants to financially secure golf clubs were justied by helping to maintain the region’s position as a world number one golf destination.“We were alarmed at this interpretation of the scheme, since it was not designed as a tourism support scheme but rather a scheme to enable sporting organisations to weather the pandemic.“The committee understands that the SSF was developed quickly in response to the problems created by the pandemic and the scheme, as instituted, had signicant flaws.“We believe that it is crucial that all government departments learn from this and,such programme is required in the future, that more attention is paid to ensuring a fairer distribution of funds.”  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularWATCH: Jamie Bryson draws applause as he demands unionist workers ‘down tools’ at NI portsWhat is NATO  What does NATO stand for, are Ukraine and Russia in NATO -

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

This piece is a genuine and authentic step in the trials process and as such of great numismatic signicance. Its appeal will be just as great to the hardcore numismatist as it will to the ‘investor collector’. “I can easily imagine a collector who has spent several hundreds of thousands of pounds on an original  Una and the Lion quite happily spending the same to have this piece sit next to the original in their collection.”The trial pieces are not official UK coins and are ‘one of one’ items – meaning they are not included in the mintage figures.To register for the auction, visit The Royal Mint website here.Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Picture: WSPThe first option would see a segregated cycle and pedestrian path through an old railway line, from Cosmeston Drive in Sully to Railway Walk in Penarth. This would involve clearing out a lot of overgrown vegetation on the railway line, and could be an expensive option.The second option would see the existing pavement on Lavernock Road widened, for shared use between pedestrians and cyclists. The speed limit would be reduced from mph to mph along this part of Lavernock Road. This option would be the cheapest.The third option would combine parts of the first two. It would use the old railway line halfway, from Cosmeston Drive to St Mary’s Well Bay Road, before then crossing Lavernock Road and continuing on the pavement until Sully.The consultation website said: “There is a growing need to reform the way people travel between destinations using private vehicles. Providing good quality active travel infrastructure is an important component in negating the need for people to own vehicles.“Active travel infrastructure may also be used as a tool to improve physical and mental well being and mitigate the impact of private vehicles on the environment.“By providing one of these proposed route options, we can facilitate a modal sht from the private car to active modes for short distances to either Sully, Cosmeston and Penarth.”.removePeople interested in responding to the consultation have until March  to do so, by visiting the website: sullyactivetravelmonplace.is Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityA dog is seen by many as another member of the family but it’s important to remember they do require a dferent diet to humans and some ingredients in pancakes could lead to tummy troubles of even health problems like diabetes.Not wanting pups to miss out, Ocado have partnered with an expert in pet nutrition to create a recipe which is safe for dogs – even those with particularly sensitive tums.Stephen Ward is the Founder of Heights Farm Premium Pet Foods – a high-quality, independent pet food manufacturer designed for animals with allergies and intolerances. Stephen is passionate about pet nutritionHe said: “Traditional syrup-filled human pancakes would not be suitable for dogs as they contain salts, sugars and carbohydrates.“A dog can’t break down the fats and carbs like a human does. If eaten regularly, the result would generally be rapid weight gain which of course can lead to chronic conditions such as diabetes.“Also, more immediate issues may be seen in dogs with allergies, intolerances and particularly sensitive stomachs.”When is Pancake day This year pancake day falls on March . Otherwise known as Shrove Tuesday, it is the day before the start of Lent fasting practiced by Christians in the run up to the Easter festival.Pancakes are supposed to use up things like eggs, milk and sugar before the fasting begins.Dog-friendly pancake recipeStephen has designed a recipe especially for dogs to enjoy this Pancake Day, replacing common allergens like wheat flour and cow’s milk with dog-appropriate alternatives.The recipe can be found on the Ocado website, where you can also purchase the necessary ingredients.Ingredients:Step Sieve the flour into a mixing bowl. Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the egg and ml of lukewarm water before whisking until the ingredients are fully combined.Step Heat a non-stick frying pan to a medium temperature then add a ladle of the pancake mixture to the pan.Step Cook the pancakes for  seconds on each side before removing from the heat and leaving to cool fully. Add your dog’s favourite toppings and serve.Tips for a healthy pancake day with your dogIf you’re going to celebrate Pancake Day with your dog, Stephen has three more top tips to ensure you’re prioritising your dog’s health:As always, make sure your dog has access to plenty of fresh clean drinking water.Adjust your dog’s daily feeds to account for the extra calorie intake.As with all treats, remember to serve these pancakes in moderation. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

If the power to cooling pumps is disrupted or fuel-storage tanks are damaged, the results could be catastrophic, he said.Reactor Number Four at the power plant exploded and caught fire deep in the night on April , , shattering the building and spewing radioactive material high into the sky.Soviet authorities made the catastrophe even worse by failing to tell the public what had happened, angering European governments and the Soviet people.The two million residents of Kyiv were not informed despite the fallout danger, and the world learned of the disaster only after heightened radiation was detected in Sweden.The building containing the exploded reactor was covered in  by an enormous shelter aimed at containing radiation still leaking from the accident. Robots inside the shelter work to dismantle the destroyed reactor and gather up the radioactive waste.It is expected to take until  to finish dismantling the reactors.

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_faaefdcdecee   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dcffbfbfd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645089617694.jpg--1_700_people_apply_for_a_life_less_ordinary_with_stena_line.jpg?164508961700","title":"  people apply for a life less ordinary with stena line ","story":"Ferry company Stena Line has been overwhelmed with the positive response from the public to its recent recruitment campaign ‘A Le Less Ordinary’, which aims to fill  vacant positions onboard its Irish Sea ferries. , applications were received from people across the UK and Republic of Ireland. The campaign promoted the unique nature of le onboard, with % time-off providing the perfect work-le balance for people wanting to live and work onboard for either a one or two-week sht and then spend equal time off. The positions available are part of the Onboard Sales and Servicesteam, with vacancies for service assistants and chefs. With January being the traditional time of the year when many people look for a new career, Stena Line had hoped for a favourable response but even the most optimistic of predictions could not have expected it to be so over-subscribed. Stena Line has now undertaken the initial stage of the selection process and, for the first-time, is hosting two Open Days for prospective candidates on Monday th February, where they will get a chance to meet members of Stena Line’s crews. The Open Days are taking place in Belfast and Birkenhead with the latter being held onboard one of Stena Line’s newest ferries, Stena Edda, giving candidates a chance to get a first-hand taste of le onboard on the Irish Sea. Stephen Bryden, Stena Line’s Head of Onboard Sales and Services, commented on the success of the campaign: “I am astonished by the public’s response to the A Le Less Ordinary recruitment campaign. We have never received so many applications. It really goes to show how many people are attracted to a le at sea with a company like Stena Line. Now our HR team has the challenge of how to sort and interview so many applicants, but that is a nice challenge to have.
