[{"url":null,"title":"MP accuses Foreign Office stalling asylum Christian mother","story":"    Asia Bibi, pictured, is under threat of death after she was accused of blasphemy in her native PakistanMinisters were accused of bowing to the mob last night by refusing to grant asylum to Pakistani Christian Asia Bibi.Tom Tugendhat, who chairs the Commons foreign affairs select committee, claimed the mother-of-five was not offered refuge in the UK because British officials feared reprisal attacks.He claimed Home Secretary Sajid Javid had suggested allowing her into the country but had met resistance from Foreign Office diplomats in Pakistan.Mrs Bibi was freed from death row last month after eight years in jail on blasphemy charges, but she now faces being lynched by extremists. Tens of thousands have taken to the streets in Pakistan to demand that the Roman Catholic farm worker – who is in hiding under police protection – is put to death.Former Tory chairman Baroness Sayeeda Warsi, the daughter of Pakistani immigrants, said that if Pakistan could not keep Mrs Bibi safe, the UK should take her in, adding: ‘We cannot tolerate mob rule.’The claims emerged as pressure mounted on Theresa May to intervene.More than 70 MPs and peers signed a letter to the PM calling for a grant of asylum and asking her to take account of the ‘exceptional circumstances’ of the case.Row over a cup of water that led to murder, riots and global...Making a splash for the wrong reasons! Show-off standing on...Share this articleThe letter, which was organised by Tory MP Rehman Chishti, warned of the ‘clear threat to life’ to a woman who had been ‘persecuted for her faith’.It said such a move would be ‘in line with the Government’s clear moral commitment to standing up for justice, human rights and respect for religious freedom’.Last night, Mr Chishti said: ‘It is morally and ethically the right thing to do.’A separate letter, signed by Muslim and Christian leaders including Paul Butler, the Bishop of Durham, was addressed to Mr Javid. It said: ‘Britain’s commitment to freedom of religious expression is one of our most important values. We call on you to make a clear and proactive statement that Britain would welcome a request for sanctuary here.’          Mrs Bibi, pictured with two of her five children, was jailed for nine years after a row over a cup of water. Now she is in hiding after a bounty was placed on her head by religious leaders           Some Pakistani Muslims have threatened to kill Mrs Bibi if she is spotted on the street          Pakistan\u0027s Christian minority has stood up against the threat to Ms Bibi, although those But its origins lie in an innocuous pastoral scene that would not have seemed out of place in the western Punjab at any time over the past two millennia.It was June 2009, and a group of women were picking falsa berries outside the village of Ittan Wali, on the dusty, hardscrabble agricultural plain west of the city of Lahore.Among them was Asia, who is thought to be 53, an illiterate mother of five married to a labourer called Ashiq Masih.The heat of the Punjab summer is intense, and like most rural villages there was no running water in Ittan Wali. So Asia was sent by her co-workers to draw from the local well. After she drank using a utensil from which everyone was to quench their thirst, some of the women refused to drink from it.They were Muslims and she was Christian, an infidel. Therefore the cup was now haram – unclean to them. It has been reported they even claimed the well was defiled because Asia had drunk from it.That is when her real troubles began troubles that would put her in jail for nine years under the threat of death and now, on release, to fear for her life.The approximately 2.5million Christians in Pakistan are largely descended from low-caste Hindus who were converted by British missionaries during the Raj. Many did so to escape the prejudices and oppressions of the Hindu caste system. Now their descendants find themselves trapped in poverty and fear by a different kind of strict religious hegemony.In recent years, their vulnerability has only increased thanks to the rise of militant Islam.Blasphemy laws introduced by Islamist President Mohammad Zia-ul-Haq in the Eighties, have been used as a stick to subjugate non-Muslim minorities. The most significant in this instance is Section 295c of the Penal Code, passed in 1986. Anyone found guilty of defiling the name of the Prophet Mohammed would face a mandatory death sentence.Asia and her family were the only Christian household in her village, and therefore already vulnerable. Previously she had been harassed to convert to Islam. But the day she drank from the well there was an argument with three other women during which it was alleged religious insults were swapped. A ‘fight’ took place.Five days later the local imam, Mohammed Qari Salim, became involved – and not as a peacemaker. He used his position – and the loudspeakers of his mosque – to whip up hatred against Asia, who was beaten by a mob chanting: ‘Death to the Christian.’ He also filed a blasphemy complaint to police.‘They tried to put a noose around my neck so they could kill me,’ Asia later said of her assailants. But before she could be lynched she was arrested under Section 295c.Her husband and children went into hiding, having received anonymous death threats. He told the BBC: ‘They say, “We’ll deal with you if we get our hands on you”. Now everyone knows about us, so I am hiding my kids here and there. I don’t allow them to go out. Anyone can harm them.’Asia was charged with insulting the Holy Prophet and the Koran, allegations she has always denied. She then spent 18 months in jail on remand.She said the allegations were made up by one village woman who had a long-standing grudge against her. Such score-settling is a common abuse of the blasphemy laws, according to human rights campaigners.In November 2010, at a district court, Asia became the first woman in Pakistan to be sentenced to death under blasphemy laws, and was told to pay a fine equivalent to £2,180. A female farm worker in Punjab earns around £2 a day. At the court, a mob chanted: ‘Kill her, kill her.’ Asia was put on death row under 24-hour surveillance – for her own protection.The death sentence caused outrage outside Pakistan – Pope Benedict called for clemency – but delight among the country’s religious hardliners. Imam Salim, who helped bring the case against her, said: ‘Any Muslim, if given the chance, would kill such a person. You would be rewarded in heaven.’ He said he burst into tears of joy when the sentence was passed.Meanwhile, a cleric in the city of Peshawar offered a reward of £4,000 to anyone who killed Asia if she escaped execution.Some official voices spoke out on her behalf. One of the most important and impressive was the Governor of Punjab, Salmaan Taseer, a long-time critic of abuses of his country’s blasphemy laws.He visited Asia in jail and said he would ask the then president, Asif Ali Zardari, to pardon her. The governor said Asia told him she had not disrespected the Holy Prophet and claimed she was sexually assaulted and dragged through her village by a mob.That sealed his fate.A few days into the January of 2011, he was gunned down by his own bodyguard, shot 27 times in central Islamabad. The killer was hailed a religious hero by many in Pakistan, and when in 2016 he was hanged for the murder, Islamist mobs went on the rampage in towns across the country. His funeral was attended by an estimated 100,000 mourners.Shahbaz Bhatti, Pakistan’s minister for minorities and himself a Roman Catholic, also protested against Asia’s conviction and sentence. He had been receiving death threats from Islamist groups including the Taliban and Al Qaeda for years. His outspoken support for Asia only served to precipitate the inevitable.Less than two months after Governor Taseer’s death, Mr Bhatti, 42, was driving through Islamabad when his car was riddled with bullets. He died in hospital.            Ms Bibi has been banned from leaving Pakistan by the government, which has placed her life at considerable risk as some religious leaders have placed a large bounty on her headHe had foretold the manner of his death in a video that was released after the assassination. Speaking to the camera he said: ‘I believe in Jesus Christ who has given his own life for us, and I am ready to die for a cause. I’m living for my community... and I will die to defend their rights.’With Asia behind bars, attacks on her fellow Christians increased in frequency and ferocity.In 2013, a twin suicide bomb attack on a church in Peshawar killed around 80 people. The following year in Lahore, bomb attacks on churches killed 14 and wounded 70. Christians celebrating Easter in Lahore in 2016 were hit by a suicide bombing that killed 70 and injured 340, while a church attack in Quetta last year caused dozens more casualties.A new hard-Right Islamist party called Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) was established, calling for blasphemers to be killed and their murderers celebrated.Meanwhile, despite the grave threat to their safety, Asia’s supporters fought on. In October 2014, her appeal to the Lahore High Court against her conviction was dismissed and the sentence upheld. The following summer, the Supreme Court suspended her death sentence while the appeals process ran its course.Then, on October 31 this year, three Supreme Court judges, led by the Chief Justice, quashed the blasphemy convictions and death sentence. One said: ‘Blasphemy is a serious offence, but... a conclusion is inescapable and irresistible that the prosecution failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt.’While Asia expressed her delight from her cell, Islamists took to the streets, bringing towns and cities to a halt. The TLP party called for the judges to be killed.Having praised the Supreme Court decision and the ‘rule of law’, Imran Khan caved in to the extremists and reportedly agreed to bar Asia from leaving Pakistan, and even have the verdict examined by another court.This caused international outrage, not least from his ex-wife Miss Goldsmith (the mother of his children). She tweeted: ‘Three days after a defiant \u0026amp brave speech defending the judiciary, Pakistan’s gov caves in to extremist demands to bar #AsiaBibi from leaving Pak, after she was acquitted of blasphemy – effectively signing her death warrant.’Asia’s lawyer, Saif ul-Malook, had already fled the country, fearing for his life. His client is now in limbo, having been flown from her jail to the capital. ‘Asia Bibi is completely secure at a safe place in Pakistan,’ a foreign ministry spokesman said. ‘She can go anywhere she wants to, she is a free national ... if she wants to go abroad, no harm in it.’But it is clear that if she is allowed to leave there will be further fury from Islamist protesters – which means the moral credibility of Mr Khan is now in question as her fate is decided.Will he let Asia go, or will he pander to those who would keep her in Pakistan where it is likely she will be hunted down and killed?    "},{"url":null,"title":"Boy 15 caught high speeds electric SCOOTER","story":"The boy appeared in court after being caught at what police have described as \u0027high speeds\u0027 on his scooter.

They have increased pilot awareness, they have reminded them of the proper procedure to disable (the automatic nose-down action), which stops the problem.\u0027Indonesian investigators say that the Lion Air Boeing 737 MAX 8 experienced malfunctions with sensors that indicate the angle of the nose on four recent flights, including the fatal one.The Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. and Indonesian investigators are increasingly focusing on the way that the plane\u0027s automated control systems interact. They are also questioning whether the FAA and Boeing adequately analyzed potential hazards if the systems malfunction and send faulty data to the plane\u0027s computers, according to the newspaper."},{"url":null,"title":"Prince Charles marks 70th birthday milestone family photograph","story":"Pick polka dots like the Duchess of Cambridge in Alessandra RichSold out!

Tens of thousands have taken to the streets in Pakistan to demand that the Roman Catholic farm worker – who is in hiding under police protection – is put to death.Former Tory chairman Baroness Sayeeda Warsi, the daughter of Pakistani immigrants, said that if Pakistan could not keep Mrs Bibi safe, the UK should take her in, adding: ‘We cannot tolerate mob rule.’The claims emerged as pressure mounted on Theresa May to intervene.More than 70 MPs and peers signed a letter to the PM calling for a grant of asylum and asking her to take account of the ‘exceptional circumstances’ of the case.Row over a cup of water that led to murder, riots and global...Making a splash for the wrong reasons! Show-off standing on...Share this articleThe letter, which was organised by Tory MP Rehman Chishti, warned of the ‘clear threat to life’ to a woman who had been ‘persecuted for her faith’.It said such a move would be ‘in line with the Government’s clear moral commitment to standing up for justice, human rights and respect for religious freedom’.Last night, Mr Chishti said: ‘It is morally and ethically the right thing to do.’A separate letter, signed by Muslim and Christian leaders including Paul Butler, the Bishop of Durham, was addressed to Mr Javid. It said: ‘Britain’s commitment to freedom of religious expression is one of our most important values. We call on you to make a clear and proactive statement that Britain would welcome a request for sanctuary here.’          Mrs Bibi, pictured with two of her five children, was jailed for nine years after a row over a cup of water. Now she is in hiding after a bounty was placed on her head by religious leaders           Some Pakistani Muslims have threatened to kill Mrs Bibi if she is spotted on the street          Pakistan\u0027s Christian minority has stood up against the threat to Ms Bibi, although those But its origins lie in an innocuous pastoral scene that would not have seemed out of place in the western Punjab at any time over the past two millennia.It was June 2009, and a group of women were picking falsa berries outside the village of Ittan Wali, on the dusty, hardscrabble agricultural plain west of the city of Lahore.Among them was Asia, who is thought to be 53, an illiterate mother of five married to a labourer called Ashiq Masih.The heat of the Punjab summer is intense, and like most rural villages there was no running water in Ittan Wali. So Asia was sent by her co-workers to draw from the local well. After she drank using a utensil from which everyone was to quench their thirst, some of the women refused to drink from it.They were Muslims and she was Christian, an infidel. Therefore the cup was now haram – unclean to them. It has been reported they even claimed the well was defiled because Asia had drunk from it.That is when her real troubles began troubles that would put her in jail for nine years under the threat of death and now, on release, to fear for her life.The approximately 2.5million Christians in Pakistan are largely descended from low-caste Hindus who were converted by British missionaries during the Raj. Many did so to escape the prejudices and oppressions of the Hindu caste system. Now their descendants find themselves trapped in poverty and fear by a different kind of strict religious hegemony.In recent years, their vulnerability has only increased thanks to the rise of militant Islam.Blasphemy laws introduced by Islamist President Mohammad Zia-ul-Haq in the Eighties, have been used as a stick to subjugate non-Muslim minorities. The most significant in this instance is Section 295c of the Penal Code, passed in 1986. Anyone found guilty of defiling the name of the Prophet Mohammed would face a mandatory death sentence.Asia and her family were the only Christian household in her village, and therefore already vulnerable. Previously she had been harassed to convert to Islam. But the day she drank from the well there was an argument with three other women during which it was alleged religious insults were swapped. A ‘fight’ took place.Five days later the local imam, Mohammed Qari Salim, became involved – and not as a peacemaker. He used his position – and the loudspeakers of his mosque – to whip up hatred against Asia, who was beaten by a mob chanting: ‘Death to the Christian.’ He also filed a blasphemy complaint to police.‘They tried to put a noose around my neck so they could kill me,’ Asia later said of her assailants. But before she could be lynched she was arrested under Section 295c.Her husband and children went into hiding, having received anonymous death threats. He told the BBC: ‘They say, “We’ll deal with you if we get our hands on you”. Now everyone knows about us, so I am hiding my kids here and there. I don’t allow them to go out. Anyone can harm them.’Asia was charged with insulting the Holy Prophet and the Koran, allegations she has always denied. She then spent 18 months in jail on remand.She said the allegations were made up by one village woman who had a long-standing grudge against her. Such score-settling is a common abuse of the blasphemy laws, according to human rights campaigners.In November 2010, at a district court, Asia became the first woman in Pakistan to be sentenced to death under blasphemy laws, and was told to pay a fine equivalent to £2,180. A female farm worker in Punjab earns around £2 a day. At the court, a mob chanted: ‘Kill her, kill her.’ Asia was put on death row under 24-hour surveillance – for her own protection.The death sentence caused outrage outside Pakistan – Pope Benedict called for clemency – but delight among the country’s religious hardliners. Imam Salim, who helped bring the case against her, said: ‘Any Muslim, if given the chance, would kill such a person. You would be rewarded in heaven.’ He said he burst into tears of joy when the sentence was passed.Meanwhile, a cleric in the city of Peshawar offered a reward of £4,000 to anyone who killed Asia if she escaped execution.Some official voices spoke out on her behalf. One of the most important and impressive was the Governor of Punjab, Salmaan Taseer, a long-time critic of abuses of his country’s blasphemy laws.He visited Asia in jail and said he would ask the then president, Asif Ali Zardari, to pardon her. The governor said Asia told him she had not disrespected the Holy Prophet and claimed she was sexually assaulted and dragged through her village by a mob.That sealed his fate.A few days into the January of 2011, he was gunned down by his own bodyguard, shot 27 times in central Islamabad. The killer was hailed a religious hero by many in Pakistan, and when in 2016 he was hanged for the murder, Islamist mobs went on the rampage in towns across the country. His funeral was attended by an estimated 100,000 mourners.Shahbaz Bhatti, Pakistan’s minister for minorities and himself a Roman Catholic, also protested against Asia’s conviction and sentence. He had been receiving death threats from Islamist groups including the Taliban and Al Qaeda for years. His outspoken support for Asia only served to precipitate the inevitable.Less than two months after Governor Taseer’s death, Mr Bhatti, 42, was driving through Islamabad when his car was riddled with bullets. He died in hospital.            Ms Bibi has been banned from leaving Pakistan by the government, which has placed her life at considerable risk as some religious leaders have placed a large bounty on her headHe had foretold the manner of his death in a video that was released after the assassination. Speaking to the camera he said: ‘I believe in Jesus Christ who has given his own life for us, and I am ready to die for a cause. I’m living for my community... and I will die to defend their rights.’With Asia behind bars, attacks on her fellow Christians increased in frequency and ferocity.In 2013, a twin suicide bomb attack on a church in Peshawar killed around 80 people. The following year in Lahore, bomb attacks on churches killed 14 and wounded 70. Christians celebrating Easter in Lahore in 2016 were hit by a suicide bombing that killed 70 and injured 340, while a church attack in Quetta last year caused dozens more casualties.A new hard-Right Islamist party called Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) was established, calling for blasphemers to be killed and their murderers celebrated.Meanwhile, despite the grave threat to their safety, Asia’s supporters fought on. In October 2014, her appeal to the Lahore High Court against her conviction was dismissed and the sentence upheld. The following summer, the Supreme Court suspended her death sentence while the appeals process ran its course.Then, on October 31 this year, three Supreme Court judges, led by the Chief Justice, quashed the blasphemy convictions and death sentence. One said: ‘Blasphemy is a serious offence, but... a conclusion is inescapable and irresistible that the prosecution failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt.’While Asia expressed her delight from her cell, Islamists took to the streets, bringing towns and cities to a halt. The TLP party called for the judges to be killed.Having praised the Supreme Court decision and the ‘rule of law’, Imran Khan caved in to the extremists and reportedly agreed to bar Asia from leaving Pakistan, and even have the verdict examined by another court.This caused international outrage, not least from his ex-wife Miss Goldsmith (the mother of his children). She tweeted: ‘Three days after a defiant \u0026amp brave speech defending the judiciary, Pakistan’s gov caves in to extremist demands to bar #AsiaBibi from leaving Pak, after she was acquitted of blasphemy – effectively signing her death warrant.’Asia’s lawyer, Saif ul-Malook, had already fled the country, fearing for his life. His client is now in limbo, having been flown from her jail to the capital. ‘Asia Bibi is completely secure at a safe place in Pakistan,’ a foreign ministry spokesman said. ‘She can go anywhere she wants to, she is a free national ... if she wants to go abroad, no harm in it.’But it is clear that if she is allowed to leave there will be further fury from Islamist protesters – which means the moral credibility of Mr Khan is now in question as her fate is decided.Will he let Asia go, or will he pander to those who would keep her in Pakistan where it is likely she will be hunted down and killed?    "},{"url":null,"title":"Mexican presidents accused defense opens El Chapo trial","story":"     Guzman, surrounded by US Marshals, waves to his wife as he enters the courtroom at Brooklyn Federal Court on Tuesday          Emma Coronel, center, El Chapo\u0027s beauty queen wife, leaves Brooklyn Federal court after opening arguments in the trial on Tuesday          Guzman\u0027s weapons of choice were a diamond-encrusted pistol branded with his initials (pictured) and a gold-plated AK-47\u0027He\u0027s blamed for being the leader while the real leaders are living freely and openly in Mexico,\u0027 attorney Jeffrey Lichtman said.\u0027In truth he controlled nothing.

Because they\u0027re making too much money being bribed by the leaders of drug cartels.\u0027Lichtman\u0027s statement came after Fels laid out the US government\u0027s case, describing how prosecutors would prove that Guzman rose from a low-level marijuana trafficker in the 1970s to lead the powerful Sinaloa Cartel.Fels said that Guzman, 61, eventually established relationships with Colombian cartels that allowed him to make billions of dollars moving cocaine.He said jurors would see evidence of seized cocaine shipments adding up to \u0027more than a line of cocaine for every single person in the United States.\u0027Prosecutors contend that Guzman spent a quarter of a century smuggling cocaine into the United States.

That is what this trial is about and that is what the evidence in this case will prove,\u0027 Fels told the court.Guzman, he alleged in his opening statements, had his \u0027own private army\u0027 of hundreds of men armed with assault rifles, as well as his own diamond-encrusted pistol branded with his initials and a gold-plated AK-47. The prosecutors\u0027 witnesses are expected to include former Guzman associates who are now cooperating with the U.S. government in exchange for more favorable treatment, likely including Zambada\u0027s brother Jesus \u0027El Rey\u0027 Zambada and son Vicente Zambada.

He faces 11 trafficking, firearms and money laundering charges in what is expected to be a more than four-month trial. The Brooklyn Federal Courthouse is pictured on Tuesday\u0027He was indeed the boss of his organization,\u0027 the prosecutor added, saying Guzman \u0027used planes, trains, automobiles, fishing vessels, trucks, even submarines,\u0027 to traffic drugs to the United States.Lichtman did not finish his statement and is expected to resume Wednesday.In addition to Lichtman, Guzman\u0027s lawyers at the trial include Eduardo Balarezo and William Purpura, who previously defended Mexican drug lord Alfredo Beltran Leyva, once a partner and later a rival of Guzman. Beltran Leyva pleaded guilty to U.S. drug charges and was sentenced to life in prison by a federal judge in Washington last year.Opening statements in Guzman\u0027s trial finally got underway after two jurors were dismissed from the lineup, forcing lawyers and the judge to re-interview potential candidates before the full panel could be sworn in.

He was later convicted of dangerous driving and aggravated vehicle taking for this  Legge has posted a number of images on social media, including of himself larking about with friends and posing with champagne and vodkaProsecuting Huw Edwards, said: \u0027They followed him and, shortly afterwards, the Ford made off and a chase began.\u0027A tyre deflation device was laid out during the chase and his tyres were damaged - but he continued anyway. He was travelling as fast as 90mph on 30mph limit roads, albeit before the tyres were damaged.\u0027The defendant, during the chase, contravened red traffic signals and drove on the wrong side of the road. Eventually, the police managed to pin his Ford car in.          Legge (pictured) served two years in jail for a burglary spree which saw him target around 30 homes.

He makes no excuses whatsoever.\u0027From the start, he pleaded guilty to these offences. For the first time in his life, as a 24 year old man, he is making progress. He said to me that he has had enough of this.\u0027Also for the first time in his life, he is in stable accommodation and he says that he has disassociated himself from the people he used to hang around with when he got in trouble.\u0027He is not in full time employment, but he has casual work, working for somebody who hires out bouncy castles. He is described as being immature and having a chaotic lifestyle, but he is showing signs of thinking, stepping back and showing maturity.\u0027Although the report says he is at a high risk of reoffending, I think with community work that risk could be reduced. So I ask your honour if you could give him a further suspension hanging over his head and one last chance.\u0027Legge was also banned from driving for a further two years which will start following his release from jail and he will have to take an extending driving test.

You went at 90mph in residential, drive through red lights and hit a police car.\u0027The police hit your car with a stinger but you continued. You were constantly on the other side of the road and it\u0027s only because of luck that nobody was coming the other way, otherwise you or somebody else could have been killed. \u0027You had been put on a suspended sentence and that is a seriously aggravating feature that you committed this offence so close to the last one.\u0027 At Minshull Street Crown, Legge admitted dangerous driving, driving whilst disqualified and having no insurance and was locked up for a further two years. He also admitted an unrelated offence of shoplifting. "},{"url":null,"title":"Man spots dog drinking pint outside Belfast pub Errigle Inn","story":"Jake Pulford, 26, caught this dog checking the coast was clear before taking a sip of its owner\u0027s pint outside the Errigle Inn in Belfast           Jake Pulford (pictured) says the cheeky dog made his day as he passed by on the bus \u0027It went in more than once - he was doing it a few times so he seemed to enjoy it.\u0027I like funny animal pictures and videos online but I\u0027d never actually seen something like that in person.

Estimates vary on how many members it has. It secured 62 signatures on a letter to the PM in February while Mr Baker has claimed the group has a bloc of 80 Tory MPs willing to vote against May\u0027s plans.The group\u0027s deputy leader Mark Francois said today there were at least 40 hard liners who would vote against the deal in all circumstances. What do they want?  The ERG has said Mrs May should abandon her plans for a unique trade deal and instead negotiate a \u0027Canada plus plus plus\u0027 deal.This is based on a trade deal signed between the EU and Canada in August 2014 that eliminated 98 per cent of tariffs and taxes charged on goods shipped across the Atlantic.The EU has long said it would be happy to do a deal based on Canada - but warn it would only work for Great Britain and not Northern Ireland.The ERG say the model can be adapted to work for the whole UK. They say Northern Ireland can be included by using technology on the Irish border to track goods and make sure products which don\u0027t meet EU rules do not enter the single market.They also say it would give complete freedom for Britain to sign new trade deals around the world to replace any losses in trade with the EU.  The group is content to leave the EU without a deal if Brussels will not give in.  How will they vote:  Against the Prime Minister.          Led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, the ERG counts Boris Johnson, David Davis and other former ministers including Steve Baker and Iain Duncan SmithModerates in the Brexit Delivery Group (BDG) and other LoyalistsWho are they? A newer group, the BDG counts members from across the Brexit ide inside the Tory Party. It includes former minister Nick Boles and MPs including Remainer Simon Hart and Brexiteer Andrew Percy. There are also many unaligned Tory MPs who are desperate to talk about anything else. How many of them are there? There are thought to be around 50 members in the BDG, with a few dozen other MPs loyal to the Prime Minister   What do they want? The BDG prioritises delivering on Brexit and getting to exit day on March 29, 2019, without destroying the Tory Party or the Government. If the PM gets a deal the group will probably vote for it.It is less interested in the exact form of the deal but many in it have said Mrs May\u0027s Chequers plan will not work.Mr Boles has set out a proposal for Britain to stay in the European Economic Area (EEA) until a free trade deal be negotiated - effectively to leave the EU but stay in close orbit as a member of the single market. How will they vote?  With the Prime Minister.           Tory Simon Hart leads a group of Tory MPs committed to getting a pragmatic Brexit deal without pandering to ideological interests Unrepentant Remainers in the People\u0027s Vote Who are they? A handful of about five Tory MPs - mostly former ministers - who never supported Brexit and think the failure of politicians to get a deal means Parliament should hand it back to the people. The group includes Anna Soubry, Dominic Grieve and Justine Greening. What do they want instead? A so-called People\u0027s Vote. The exact timing still needs to be sorted out but broadly, the group wants the Article 50 process postponed and a second referendum scheduled.This would take about six months from start to finish and they group wants Remain as an option on the ballot paper, probably with Mrs May\u0027s deal as the alternative. There are established pro-Remain campaigns born out of the losing Britain Stronger in Europe campaign from 2016. It is supported by Tony Blair, the Liberal Democrats and assorted pro-EU politicians outside the Tory party. How will they vote? Hard to say for sure. Probably with the Prime Minister if the only other option was no deal.            Anna Soubry is in a small group of unrepentant Remainer Tory MPs who want a second referendum on Brexit The DUP Who are they? The Northern Ireland Party signed up to a \u0027confidence and supply\u0027 agreement with the Conservative Party to prop up the Government.They are Unionist and say Brexit is good but must not carve Northern Ireland out of the Union. How many of them are there? 10. What do they want? A Brexit deal that protects Northern Ireland inside the UK. How will they vote? Against the Prime Minister if the deal breaches the red line, with the Prime Minister if she can persuade them it does not. The group currently says No.      The DUP, led in Westminster by Nigel Dodds (right), have a deal with Theresa May but could still vote agianst her Brexit deal Labour LoyalistsWho are they? Labour MPs who are loyal to Jeremy Corbyn and willing to follow his whipping orders. How many of them are there? Between 210 and 240 MPs depending on exactly what Mr Corbyn orders them to do. What do they want? Labour policy is to demand a general election and if the Government refuses, \u0027all options are on the table\u0027, including a second referendum.Labour insists it wants a \u0027jobs first Brexit\u0027 that includes a permanent customs union with the EU.

Up to 45 but possibly no more than 20 MPs.What do they want? An orderly Brexit and to spite Mr Corbyn.How will they vote? With the Prime Minister. Other Opposition partiesWho are they? The SNP, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, Green Caroline Lucas and assorted independents.How many of them are there? About 60 MPs.How will they vote?

But once the celebrities got to know you, they realised you weren’t such a bad old fruit’ I can barely remember when this was taken, one of those glam parties at Annabel’s in the late 1980s, when men had to wear black tie and women had to look absolutely scrumptious to get in. That period was a bit of a blur and Annabel’s was just a vortex.From 1973 to 1980, I worked outside Annabel’s, the London club on Berkeley Square. Everyone went there back then: Elizabeth Taylor, Jack Nicholson, Joan Collins, even Princess Diana. I would stand with Nando the doorman, a great guy with this big moustache, and wait for people to leave. Nando and I used to keep each other company, though he never told me who was in there. He was discreet like that.My nights started at 10.30pm and finished at 2am. I was young enough to handle the hours. I didn’t get inside until the 1980s: it was a big moment and you had to earn your stripes. Once the celebrities got to know you, they realised you weren’t such a bad old fruit. You just had to put your best suit on, smile and blend in. It wasn’t that difficult to approach people. They knew I’d be there and they would be friendly.My big break came in 1975. Liz Taylor was throwing a 50th birthday party for Richard Burton, whom she had just remarried. It was at the Dorchester and I was sent by the Evening Standard to get a picture. Every photographer had been turned away but I hid behind an assistant and slid in through some glass doors.The room was empty except for the DJ. I told him who I was, he handed me some records and showed me how the DJ booth worked, so I could pass unnoticed. Suddenly the room filled up with Richard’s friends, who had all come from Wales. Then the cake got rolled in. I got some pictures of the pair of them blowing out candles and I suppose I got confident, because I followed them to the dancefloor.I never asked if I could take some pictures, I just shot them. Liz turned to me and, in this soft tone, said: “I don’t know who you are – get out.” That was the beginning of a lovely friendship. I sent her the birthday pictures and, after that, she invited me to all sorts of events, from the Chelsea flower show to when she became a dame in 2000.I shot on black and white until the mid-1990s and kept using film until the end of the decade. Most of my early pictures were with a Leica M4. Even after the advent of digital, I continued shooting with Leicas. I preferred what you got and the way they handled: they’re small and unobtrusive, fitting easily into my pocket.It’s difficult doing this job for a long time. Some of my dearest friends have gone: Freddie Mercury, George Harrison, and of course Liz. It’s got to the point where I’m running out of people. My heyday ran from 1970 until 1995. That was when there was money in the industry and people took us seriously – we weren’t out on the streets being paparazzi.The whole industry has changed now. Everyone has a cameraphone and the way celebrities are photographed is intrusive. Today, I only go somewhere if I’m commissioned. Otherwise I stay at home and watch Tottenham on TV. I’d rather become a cab driver than start doing this now. I’ve had breakfast with Nelson Mandela, lunch with the Dalai Lama, but I’d still like to have dinner with Bob Dylan – if only to find out where he gets his suits from.• This photograph will be auctioned for charity at Christie’s on 20 November with other shots from Annabel’s, 1963-2018.

Here’s what some of you saidI was blessed to meet him a few years ago, when I was costuming as Wolverine. At that time, multiple sclerosis had really taken a grip on me, and Stan took the time to step away from his photo shoots, sit me down and have a lovely chat. I’ll never forget, when thanking him for filling my childhood and beyond with tales of such amazing superheroes, he told me that people like me in his words, who put disability aside to help others and push through adversity, “were the true superheroes”. Those words stay with me every day. Bless you Stan for being such inspiration. tachikomaI had reading difficulties when I was in primary school back in the early 60s, but over time managed to understand the text and speech bubbles in comics more easily than pages in text in books. Thanks, Stan, for being one of the people who taught me how to read when my school couldn’t and for being one of the creators who gave me a world of amazing characters to engage with at a time when I was a pretty lonely little girl. I still read comics, but also became a voracious reader of books because of them. Madeleine WolfeStan Lee saved my life. Possibly. When I was six, a car hit me as I crossed a road (the man was on green, so I ran. Look both ways, kids!). Just before it did, I tried to jump, as Spider-Man had done in the comic colouring book I had just read. He got a bit higher than I did, having recently been bitten by a radioactive spider, but my tiny leap might have been the difference between flying over, as I did, and going under. Or it could have made no difference at all. But my point is RIP Stan, thanks for the magic. guyfmI was lucky enough to meet Stan a few years ago at a convention in London. He was clearly frail and needed help to walk and steady himself, but seemed overjoyed that so many people had come out to see him and support his work. His enthusiasm for his fans made him appear much younger than the 90+ years he was at the time. Although the meeting was brief and consisted little more of a few words, a handshake and a photograph it was an unforgettable experience. It was a rare opportunity to meet a man whose work had a profound impact on my early life and must be considered among the 20th century’s most influential writers and creators. Marc Casson, college lecturer, north WalesGrowing up in war-torn Belfast, I was lucky for two reason: the local library at the bottom of my street, and my father as a merchant seaman, bringing home a suitcase filled with American comic books, from New York, every trip to sea. I rarely attended school, for numerous reasons, but learned the love of words through Stan’s writing. I always wanted to be a writer, even though I knew I could never become one because of my working-class background. Then I listened to Stan’s advice: “The only advice anybody can give is, if you wanna be a writer, keep writing. And read all you can, read everything.” So I did, and I am! Thank you Stan, warts and all. Sam Millar, writer, BelfastMy favourite recent cameo of his was from the Spider-Man game that came out a few months ago. You tend to expect cameos in all Marvel movies but for some reason the cameo in the game took me by surprise. Even though it was an animated version rather than his actual likeness, it captured all his charm and I was grinning like an idiot when i saw it. Turns out it’ll be the last one released before his death. Fitting that it was Spider-Man. RIP Stan. dsk84A huge escapist part of my otherwise anxious and sometimes fear-driven childhood. I know he sometimes blurred the details of who created what, with Kirby and Ditko especially, but even if he just mostly left him and the others to get on with it, to later become the brash salesmanfront man, he must have been doing something right. Though he didn’t always make the best business decisions. But thank you Stan, for brightening up my young world. PP100I thought it would be nice to share my father’s memories of Stan Lee with you along with a photo of the A1 size drawing of the superhero Stan and Herb Trimpe created during a 1975 BBC Pebble Mill at One interview. Personally I am a life long Marvel fan, as are “Seymour-Man’s” grandchildren so the fact that their grandpa is not only their real life superhero but also a Stan Lee created Marvel one is priceless. The following is my dad, David Seymour’s, fond recollection of Stan’s visit to the Pebble Mill studios:“In 1975, I was a BBC reporter and television presenter working on a daily network magazinetalk show on BBC One called Pebble Mill, named after the the broadcasting centre in Birmingham. I vividly remember interviewing Stan Lee during his visit to the UK, promoting the Son of Origins, which described the creation of several Marvel Comic superheroes. Stan was a great guest both on and off the set. He was helpful, charming, talkative and inventive. It was an extended interview and Stan decided to transform me into a new type of superhero.“I was young, British, black-haired and, Stan claimed, clearly suitable for transformation. It’s 43 years ago, and I forget now what superpowers Stan endowed me with, but as we talked live on British TV, the Marvel artist Herb Timpe sketched out the the new creation: he was called Seymour-Man. I have the sketch to this day, signed by its creators, Stan and Herb. It graces one of our guest bedrooms at home in Northumberland and has always intrigued our grandchildren. Sadly, I never developed the super powers that Stan had described. But now, silver-haired, I’m still Seymour-Man.” Ben Seymour, 42, Newcastle"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fdb48ed2cbe5e9b95bc2f6243a236b90e155d6ff/0_2_2555_1533/master/2555.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa3d9753def26cca69a034d7f7267edf","title":"stan lee marvel spider man black panther","story":"The comics legend behind such characters as Spider-Man and Black Panther has died at the age of 95.

But the Dutch are big on what they call meedoen, to participate, and with this in mind, instead of inidually complaining to the local authority or putting up with issues, the residents of Spoorwijk have found an active way to resolve neighbourhood gripes together.Every three months, locals gather to take a wijkwandeling – a neighbourhood walk. Together, they visit problematic areas and discuss what action should be taken. Any resident can turn up and take part, and about ten to fifteen participants of all ages and social groups usually come along.“Engaged citizens take care of their neighbourhood and their neighbours. They don’t feel indifferent, because they experience positive change as soon as they are asked for their ideas, suggestions and opinions,” explains alderman Rachid Guernaoui, a member of the The Hague’s city hall.I joined Spoorwijk’s June wijkwandeling. The route differs each time, and is determined by residents, who can email organisers their complaints and requests in advance or mention issues along the way.If a problem can be fixed on the spot – like straightening a crooked sign – it is. If not, a request for action is sent to the municipality via a community action list. While a single citizen may not have the time to make sure their complaint has been considered, Spoorwijk’s community group sends a follow-up after six months if their request has gone unanswered.But the walk is not all about problems. It’s also a chance to exhchange ideas, joke, laugh and discuss the neighbourhood. On my walk, as well as local residents there are two men from the nearby Laak Centraal neighbourhood who want to introduce the concept of wijkwandeling into their own district. There are people from the municipality who want to find a better connection to the community they serve, and from organisations such as Stichting MOOI, which helps people in need but also runs various cultural events. Representative Meysur Bijl talks about her organisation’s new projects, including a food festival. Spotting grapevines growing in front of one of the houses, she explains how to make sarma: vine leaves stuffed with rice, then demonstrates how to fold the leaves.After the walk, everyone’s invited for refreshments, providing another opportunity for residents to get to know each other. There are positive words as well issues raised. “Thank you so much for the new park, thank you to everyone who made it happen,” says community organiser Carlien Nijbroek.Koot takes the opportunity to pass on information about a new renovation project which will affect a nearby street. There is talk of other improvements: new benches here, a water fountain and an additional rubbish bin there. Larger projects, such as the need to lay new pipes, are being tackled as well.Although inidual wijkwandelingen are hyperlocal events, they take place in neighbourhoods in cities all over the country, making them an effective motor for change. For example, as a result of a small-scale citizen initiative, Kraayensteen, another Hague district, has been granted almost €1.9m euro for opknapping (beautifying) the local area, and Spoorwijk itself has been granted around €50,000 euro to spend on local projects.One of the most important things a city’s governing body can do is to promote “genuine dialogue, transparent city management and open communication with citizens always and everywhere,” says Guernaoui. And key to this is “taking both big and small topics as important” – an approach that the wijkwandeling movement exemplifies.Back on the wijkwandeling, a new generation of Spoorwijk citizens is already learning that speaking up can make a difference.“What are the things you don’t like in your neighbourhood?” one Spoorwijk mother asks her five-year old son. “The geese poop,” he replies.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c00c89ac15b85af216c67fc01644a7b6fe3e435/0_410_3577_2146/master/3577.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd5bde6d0d971523cb1147fabcec6fa7","title":"70 prince charles queen step aside","story":"He has at least four magnificent homes. He has 134,000 acres. He’s a duke. He’s an earl. He’s a lord. He has a lovely wife, who cheers him up. He has two handsome sons, each of whom has a beautiful wife. He has three grandchildren who adore him. He has an awful lot, this mild-mannered Englishman who turns 70 on Wednesday. Oh, and he has a rich mum. He has a really, really rich mum. I wonder what she’ll give him for his birthday?Since 1976, Prince Charles Philip Arthur George, Prince of Wales, Earl of Chester, Duke of Cornwall, Duke of Rothesay, Earl of Carrick, Baron of Renfrew, Lord of the Isles and Prince and Great Steward of Scotland, has been helping young people into work. The charity he founded, the Prince’s Trust, has helped more than 900,000 young people into education or employment. But his own apprenticeship has gone on for a very, very, very long time.Charles was four when he watched a man put a gold object on his mother’s head, in a ceremony watched by more than 270 million people. Almost everything that has followed in his life has been shaped by that object, studded with 40 rubies, 40 sapphires and 63 pearls, an object so heavy, as his mother said in a TV programme earlier this year, that it could “break your neck”. It was the reason he married a young girl he didn’t love. It was the reason he didn’t marry the girl he did love, or not until he was 56 and she was 57 and so, so much water had passed under the bridge.He didn’t ask for a crown. His mother didn’t ask for a crown. His grandfather certainly didn’t ask for a crown. None of them asked for it, but if you’re born in a country that has the relics of a feudal system, to someone who has been unfortunate enough to have been born, or married, into the family that has to pretend they run it, you don’t get to choose. You can give it up, as Charles’s great uncle did to marry the woman he loved, but it doesn’t usually go down all that well.From the moment the prince learned that not everyone’s mum is called “your majesty”, he has known that he will one day have to wear that crown. What he didn’t know was that he would be waiting through his 40s, 50s and 60s. He didn’t know that he would be collecting his bus pass, and his pension (which he gives to an old people’s charity) that he would, in fact, spend his full three score and 10 waiting for something he didn’t particularly want and may not even get. He has spent his entire life being judged in the light of that thing he hasn’t yet got. Surely it’s now time to put that wait to an end.When the Queen promised, on her 21st birthday, to devote her “whole life, whether it be long or short” to the service of her country and her Commonwealth, she meant what she said. Day after boring day, for hours every day, she has shaken hands with people she will never see again. She has smiled and asked them if they have travelled far, and known that her boring day is a highlight of their lives. She has had to be polite to David Cameron. She has had to be polite to Donald Trump. She spends her mornings answering letters. She reads her “red boxes” late into the night. Last year she carried out 292 royal engagements. And she has done all this with dignity and grace.Last Sunday, at the armistice centenary, she looked tired. For the second time, she didn’t lay a wreath. Aged 92, she is still going relatively strong, but she can’t go on as strong as this for ever. She will get more tired and she will get more frail. We might see her shuffle. We might see her stoop. We might even see her memory fail. There are no signs of this yet, but more than a third of women over 90, according to some studies, show symptoms of dementia. For 66 years, the Queen has done a magnificent job in a terrible job. It’s hard to imagine a single human being in the world who could have done it better. It would be a terrible shame to see her do it badly now.Charles Philip Arthur George may not do such a good job. He has said he won’t send his famous “black spider” letters to ministers when he is king, and he shouldn’t have sent them before. But he does work hard. Last year, he undertook 546 royal engagements. He is patron of more than 350 charities. He supports the arts. He was an environmentalist long before it became fashionable. He is thoughtful. He is dutiful. And he is, according to many people who know him well, kind.That’s fine. That’s plenty. That’s more than enough. We have a man waiting to do the job he has been trained for all his life.

Now MPs get a glimpse of where Mrs May wants to go for the next two yearsFor years, Eurosceptics complained that EU membership depleted national sovereignty by imposing alien rules without parliament’s consent. That was always a misrepresentation, ignoring the influence that UK politicians and officials exercised in Brussels. But leaving the EU guarantees Britain loses its voice in the room where the rules are written, while still having to implement those rules to gain market access. Brexit engineers the very subordination that was cited as a reason for leaving the club. From what is known of the deal that Theresa May has agreed, it seems the UK will spend at least two years in rule-taking orbit around Brussels. This problem of “vassalage” is not Mrs May’s fault. There was nothing she could have done about an imbalance of power in a negotiation between one country and a continental bloc of 27.During the referendum campaign, Brexiters predicted that continental capitals would yield to pressure from their own exporters, eager to retain access to UK consumers. Pro-leave propagandists never understood the European project. The integrity of the single market and the principle of solidarity between states was more valuable to every member of the union than the bilateral trade with any “third country”. By surrendering its privileges as a member, the UK was never going to “take back control”. On the contrary, Brexit guaranteed that control would bleed away from Westminster, as has been the case since the moment article 50 was triggered.While there is much detail to be absorbed in several hundred pages of a draft withdrawal agreement, covering the two-year transition to an undefined future relationship, the compromises have been visible for months. To satisfy the prime minister’s determination to end free movement of people, the UK has excluded itself from the single market and so opted for an inferior trade relationship with the EU. In deference to the Good Friday agreement and the need for a frictionless Irish border, the UK will be in a “temporary” customs union. But that requires adherence to a common external tariff, which Brexiters see as an unacceptable curtailment of trading sovereignty. An escape clause has been included, the legal enforceability of which will be hotly debated in the coming weeks.Border control has been bought at great cost in every other sphere of control. Satisfying anti-immigration sentiment has trumped economic judgment. Mrs May believes that transaction was explicitly mandated by the referendum result and many MPs agree – perhaps enough to ratify the withdrawal agreement, although the numbers look tight. The government’s capitulation to rebels in a dispute over maximum stakes in fixed-odds betting terminals on Wednesday is a reminder that Mrs May has scant room for legislative manoeuvre. In that instance a cross-party alliance applied sufficient pressure to impose a sensible change of course on the government. There is no reason why the same mechanism should not also be available with a Brexit deal. Before “Brexit” was even a word, Euroscepticism was framed in terms of parliamentary sovereignty. Only in the aftermath of the referendum did anti-Brussels sentiment attach itself to the “will of the people” as a higher authority. That rhetorical shift allowed the prime minister to ignore parliament when defining Brexit priorities. But, 28 months later, it is unclear how Mrs May can justify her proposals on the basis of national will.The referendum result demanded the government negotiate an exit from the EU, but MPs must not allow the prime minister to aggrandise her deal as a sacred extension of that mandate. It is the culmination of a set of political choices built around the Eurosceptic tradition of misrepresenting the European project. While the negotiations have been ongoing, many of those hoary old myths have lingered. The advent of a concrete deal presents an opportunity for a more informed debate. MPs have a duty to measure Mrs May’s text not just in terms of whether it clears the bar of getting Britain out of the EU, but on a fuller test of service to the national interest. That means acknowledging damage that will be done by the prime minister’s plan – and admitting that many of those flaws are intrinsic to the very idea of Brexit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75ad34ad7cd06de4a805e1e02928bf711701f62b/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75cbcf0b1a5ba13dd8e799efa3101a0a","title":"theresa may brexit deal solves nothing polly toynbee","story":"As rumours flew that her Brexiter enemies were calling for her head in no-confidence letters, out she stepped alone. After five gruelling hours convincing her cabinet, a beleaguered prime minister stuck to her friendless deal: sticking is what she does best.Now the arm-twisting, the bribery and the for-the-good-of-the-country cajoling of every last MP begins in earnest. Pinned to the wall, each must finally reveal their true colours some will be principled, some not: Tories must reckon if the future is with Theresa May and her deal, or with Brextremists in their constituencies. Any Labour would-be defector must reckon whether their local party could ever forgive them for voting to keep this government in power.Meanwhile, Brexit mis-selling continues unabated. In her statement this evening, May said that her deal would give us back “control of our money, laws and borders”, while protecting business and jobs. None of that is true. Nowhere is there any evidence to be found in the lengthy withdrawal deal.For the foreseeable, we are in a customs union we cannot leave without EU permission and our borders are open to EU citizens. We are paying £39bn, business has no certainty for future investment and as for jobs – well, let’s just cross our fingers and hope. May pretends that some distant sunlit trade deal, hazily sketched, will one day emerge from the political declaration that accompanies the deal. Will it be in two years, 10 years, sometime, never? No one knows.All the devilish dilemmas remain. All the impossibilities are as impossible as they were on referendum day – but now they are solemnly written down on paper. We can’t have frictionless EU trade without a customs union, but that stops us buccaneering the globe for those exclusive deals with Mauritania or wherever else Liam Fox chooses to turn to. Ireland stands where it did: preserving an open border, made possible by the Good Friday agreement, means the UK must stay close to the EU forever. Scotland is righteously rebelling: David Mundell, with his crucial 13 Scottish Tory votes in parliament, will not countenance continued EU rights to fish in our waters Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, protests at Scotland being denied Northern Ireland’s competitive advantage of effectively staying in the single market – a special status the DUP also objects to. Today takes us closer to fracturing the union.Remarkably, the deal has united arch-enemies of remain and leave: the European Research Group, Labour, SNP, DUP and the two Johnson brothers are all roaring the same song: give us back control. Good to hear Jeremy Corbyn at last voice full-throated opposition to the deal in PMQs today. That reminds us how powerful Labour’s voice can be once it seriously joins the Brexit battle. What opposition would not relish this chance to topple the government?Corbyn gave his best Brexit performance so far, with withering mockery of Dominic Raab’s discovery that Dover is rather important for 10,000 trade-bearing lorries a day. He reprised Jo Johnson’s deadly Brexit Exocet comparing the chaos to the Suez crisis, and he denounced May’s false choice between “a botched deal or no deal”. As a taster of what’s to come in the parliamentary vote, the theme is Britain is losing control.This is not the beginning of the end nor the end of the beginning. For those yearning to escape the nightmare of obsessive Brexitology, this will be the never-ending story. If parliament does vote this through, if we do depart on 29 March, then trade talks begin, churning over all the same old turf. The elastic transition will stretch into the far horizon, while the Brexilunatics bay at the moon still claiming a sudden-death clean break would magically solve all problems. If the economy falters, they will blame vassalage to Brussels, while remainers blame Brexit. In the battle for “I told you so”, the defining ide of a generation will never end.If, on the other hand, May fails to scrape a majority, Labour will push for a confidence vote. Such a monumental policy collapse should surely bring down a government and cause a general election? But unless the Tory schism drives them mad (which it might), their MPs will rally round: whatever the fate of their hapless leader, there will be no election. Instead factions will put up every other option – Canada, Norway, Switzerland and no-deal – but none commands a majority.Public patience may be stretched beyond endurance, but at least everyone will know the long-ago referendum promises were, well, let’s say economical with the actualité. What happened to “Take back control?” Yes, David Davis really did promise a Brexit with “the exact same benefits” with “no downside”. Liam Fox really did promise a free trade agreement would be “one of the easiest in history” and John Redwood and Michael Gove both said “the UK holds most of the cards”. In the cold light of day, the actual deal has blown away the fantasies.What then? As every option is beaten to a pulp, polls show people already think asking them is the right solution. Sardonic old Ken Clarke had the best last line today: “I wish the prime minister well in obtaining a majority for some course of action that is in the national interest.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84f58c41ee15f2598593230025a1c01ed19a589e/0_4_4365_2619/master/4365.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c35de2c6c523ff55ad8b2a704551d73","title":"tell us what impact is private tuition having on education","story":"We’d like to find out from parents, teachers, students – and tutors about why private tuition is on the rise.

Her Mallory is stern and commanding – Bullock’s in drill sergeant mode, not America’s sweetheart – and she doesn’t care about sounding kind. Outside, there are creatures who will kill you with a gaze. The audience never sees them ourselves, but we catch glimpses of their presence: the leaves rustle, the birds squawk and the unlucky victim’s pupils glaze over, turning red and watery as the viewers instantly kill themselves with the closest weapon: a window, a car, a desk – whatever’s handy, bloody and smash-y.“If you look, you will die,” Mallory orders. Two small children stare back in silent fear. She’s spent five years surviving this plague-beast-Armageddon-whatsit, most of them trapped in this house. She’s outlasted the rest of her random roommates, a grab-bag of people who, like her, blundered into the first open door the morning most of the planet got massacred, a baby carriage rolling down the street as though Bird Box wants Battleship Potemkin to make room. Now, she has to shepherd these kids out of their home, into a rowboat, and down a dangerous river – blindfolded. For days. Sighs Mallory: “It’s going to feel like it’s going on for a long time.”Boy, does it. Bier and her Netflix producers have made an algorithmic chiller that includes every trend from the sensory deprivation horror of Don’t Breathe and A Quiet Place to JJ Abrams’ mysterious monsters to thunderingly thematic sci-fi like Arrival, which screenwriter Eric Heisserer also penned. Bird Box’s pieces feel forcibly screwed together, a movie marionetted by strings of data code. There’s good scenes and smart ideas, but overall, the movie mostly clomps. Tense sequences, like an early attempt to head out for food, are capped by clunky punchlines while the climax is almost guaranteed to get giggles, as though the puppeteers in charge accidentally screwed on that scene in The Wicker Man where Nicolas Cage screams about the bees.The ensemble, too, feels as curated as a box of donuts. There’s the classic crowd-pleasers such as Bullock and John Malkovich as an alcoholic crank who blames Mallory for the death of his third wife. (His second, he admits, said hell “couldn’t be worse than being married to me”.) There’s the cult favorites such as Sarah Paulson and Jacki Weaver. And then there’s the exciting flavors, all upcoming actors seized while hot: Moonlight’s Trevante Rhodes, Patti Cake$’s Danielle MacDonald, The Maze Runner’s Rosa Salazar, Get Out’s Lil Rel Howery as a grocery store worker who never strips off his polyester vest, and Machine Gun Kelly, poised to slither onto every hitlist after playing Tommy Lee in the Mötley Crüe biopic The Dirt.These characters feel so crammed together and underwritten that they add up to almost nothing. When we meet them all, the camera bobs around like it’s just trying to count off that everyone’s in the room. Within minutes, the strangers solve the basic concept of what’s killing the globe, voices overlapping like this horror film could, with one butler tuxedo, suddenly spin into a British farce with people barging in and out of the kitchen in high-pitched crisis announcing things such as: “We need toilet paper!” and “Don’t answer the door!” No one gets a backstory. They simply arrive with one personality trait – Paulson’s character really likes horses, McDonald is a wannabe Disney princess – or in Kelly’s case, ominous camerawork that shoots him like a slasher villain for no reason at all. At the end of the film, you don’t feel moved to hoot for any of the inidual performances – but you’re tempted to applaud the casting director.Kicking off with Mallory’s brutal river babysitter mission is bold and bone-headed. That opening lecture lets Bier establish Bird Box’s rules, not that the two tykes listening are any more obedient than puppies. But when the film then jumps back five years to the first day of the attack, where most of the film takes place, there’s zero suspense in watching the rest of the cast get picked off. The what, why and how of the crisis never gets answered. Bird Box only grapples with the question of when – when will each person be stricken with the vicious Visine? – but even the film’s sense of time feels scrambled. The major scenes in the house could take place over days or weeks, it’s impossible to tell.And the script is only moderately interested in logistics. There’s a quick lesson in echolocation, a dozen shots in blindfold-o-vision, sidewalks strung like Theseus outsmarting the Minotaur, and an entire sequence that’s a sales pitch for cars with proximity sensors. However, the back of the audience’s brain is stuck trying to figure out things like: Are the monsters hunting their prey, or is it just impersonal? How do the roommates get rid of the corpses? And how offended will the American Psychiatric Association be that Bird Box’s secondary fiends are mental patients who, according to the film, can’t be driven crazy by the creatures because they’re already insane?Bier is a lauded film-maker in her native Denmark, and recently directed the stellar first season of The Night Manager with Tom Hiddleston and Hugh Laurie. How odd that in Hollywood, she’s made a career of helming can’t-miss films that somehow fizzle, be they the Oscar-striving pedigreed nonsense of Halle Berry’s Things We Lost in the Fire, or her more recent romance Serena, which paired Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper right after Silver Linings Playbook and American Hustle and still flopped. Whatever’s going wrong with her American choices must feel as hazy and treacherous as whatever’s making Bird Box’s leaves rustle. Perhaps she, too, feels like Mallory, her competence going ignored by capricious children. As for the audience, as the film staggers on in its quest to give us entertainment satisfaction or death, we’re tempted to identity with the movie’s first victim, a woman in a tracksuit banging her head against the glass, ready to get this painful sight over with."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75107e8deba517ebc500050f918d2a3c385d1f8a/265_170_1641_984/master/1641.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c382a292d9ae310832a1bba13b589265","title":"three days in quiberon review romy schneider biopic emily atef marie baumer","story":"Marie Bäumer eerily impersonates the Austrian-born film star in an intense drama charting an episode in her real-life declineEmily Atef’s film is a kind of filmic biopic-footnote, an episode from the real-life decline of troubled Austrian-born movie star Romy Schneider, famed for her collaborations with Tavernier, Welles and Chabrol and her tempestuous personal life. It is a curious movie: ruminative, lugubrious and theatrical – intense at some moments at others low-key and almost inconsequential. The black-and-white cinematography gives it the look of a 70s picture by Wim Wenders.In 1981, Schneider retreated to a rehab resort in Quiberon in Brittany, where she conducted her final, recklessly indiscreet interview with Stern magazine’s star writer Michael Jürgs, who was accompanied by photographer Robert Lebeck – chiefly because she already knew and trusted Lebeck. The results laid bare her emotional agony and money worries, and this has here been translated into fictional form by Atef, who intersperses the stages of their interview with boozy, off-the-record encounters, in a FrostNixon style. Schneider is eerily impersonated by Marie Bäumer. Robert Gwisdek plays Jürgs, Charly Hübner is Lebeck, and Atef invents a fictional best friend for Schneider: Hilde (Birgit Minichmayr), whose job is to warn her about how manipulative and destructive the whole thing is. Their confrontations are explosive and yet cathartic, and Schneider is perhaps more in control of this journalistic encounter than anyone realises. There are some interesting comments on her mother, a movie star from the Third Reich era. “Not everyone can claim that Hitler had a crush on their mother …” remarks Schneider drily. Denis Levant contributes a rumbustious cameo as a wild-eyed poet whose bohemianism entrances Schneider one night in a restaurant. Yet the ending to all this is strange. We conclude on a note of calm, and even happiness. However, the awful truth is that within a year of this event, her beloved 14-year-old son was killed in an accident, sending Schneider back into the spiral of depression and substance abuse that was to kill her. This is what gives this “final interview” its awful tragic context and it makes the upbeat ending here seem weirdly obtuse. Well: a wonderful performance from Bäumer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18f152e86a868370c6a3744cd72ebe55b2c057ff/65_101_4290_2574/master/4290.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43e2d5166882969d60dcba1158bdb0d7","title":"claudio ranieri premier league fulham","story":"Hi Claudio. Welcome back to a place you loved, and where you were loved. The Ranieri of the Premier League, regarded in different moments as a gentleman, a tinkerman, a caricature joker, a miracle worker, an expert at somehow maintaining composure when form has faltered and the axe has lurked, returns with the words “risk free” ringing around him. Ranieri has seen enough in 32 years of management across five countries to smile wryly at such notions before he gets to work.Preconceptions have followed Ranieri around for long enough – way longer than the infamous reaction to his supposedly left-field appointment at Leicester City (and we all know how that turned out). A certain amount of optimism from the Fulham hierarchy, who chose Ranieri to follow Slavisa Jokanovic, is understandable. But there is no sense jumping to the question of whether Ranieri can recreate something resembling the phenomenon he oversaw at Leicester in his new role at Craven Cottage.Almost 18 months ago Ranieri joined Nantes in France among considerable fanfare. The president, the Poland-born tycoon Waldemar Kita, championed the idea that he masterminded a coup by recruiting a head coach associated with magic dust. Nantes had impressed under their previous coach, Sérgio Conceição, and when he left to join Porto Kita craved a big name. Ranieri more than ticked that box, so soon after Leicester’s Premier League heroics made them a touchstone for any modest club with giant dreams.Everyone in Nantes was excited. Everything started awash with promise. Ranieri was instantly popular with the public and inspired the team to climb as high as third in the table. They were settled in the top five for a while after the winter break. But by February the honeymoon picture began to crack. Neither party seemed in it for the long haul. Ranieri was linked with the Italian national team. Results started to slip. Over the course of the season Nantes scored only 36 goals from 38 Ligue 1 games and the initial spark of excitement fizzled out as bland football took hold.Freedom to work under an involved president became an issue. Kita is an extrovert face in French football, the type of owner who is full of grand statements, likes to befriend the players, doesn’t hide the fact he has favourites and relishes the kind of interest in team affairs that can border on interference. Ranieri never complained in public but it was obvious these were not his ideal conditions to coach. Three wins in the second half of the season meant that Ranieri’s departure after one season at Nantes was not unexpected. He remained elegant and liked but left without sensational memories. “The first part of the season was fantastic,” he said. “Then we were inevitably disappointed: me, president, players, supporters.”Expectations that he could do a Leicester with Nantes were always on the fanciful side. Partly because the law of averages that has a team succeed at odds of 5,000-1 suggests it is not likely to happen again in a hurry. And partly because Ligue 1 is not easy for those outside the establishment to crash through. Outside the usual suspects (the superpower Paris Saint-Germain, with Monaco and Lyon normally leading the sub-elite) the top three has seldom been gatecrashed in the past five years. Nice pushed their way to third in 2017 and Lille did the same in 2014.And so to Fulham. Even during that unforgettable adventure with Leicester, when his team were top a third of the way into that extraordinary season, he was fixated with reaching 40 points before he would even consider thinking about anything else. “Our goal right now is to maintain the Premier League. Be solid with two feet firmly on the floor,” he said then.Those sentiments echo along the banks of Thames as he begins his 18th job in management with his team in a parlous state. Rock bottom, haemorrhaging goals, having almost forgotten how to win, this is a job that requires that Ranieri characteristic of shaking things up quickly. He is a specialist at bringing a new manager bounce – that spurt of improvement – by sharply analysing his resources and making adjustments while trying to motivate. “I like a project,” he says. Just as well.Fulham represents a homecoming of sorts. Not only does it bring him professionally back to the Premier League, personally it also takes him back to a part of the world he enjoyed. He was very happy living in west London during his spell with Chelsea in the period that just preceded the arrival of Roman Abramovich.The variety of experience he has packed into his managerial career, having to cope with the twin imposters of triumph and disaster along the way, means he is under no illusions. “We have to play like we are desperate – not every match, every second,” Ranieri once said of his philosophy. “The day my players relax I get crazy. They know that. I think I am a nice man but also I am demanding.” Fulham’s chances of recovery this season depend on the extent to which his players will be able to respond to that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e8d6f92eaebb769a9f4b51ab9eb36bb12ead7c8/0_95_3205_1924/master/3205.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70b7681e40eca3f14d92ae771ee28e49","title":"wayne rooney england captain no10 shirt usa gareth southgate","story":"• Rooney will be given armband when he comes on as substitute• Fabian Delph due to captain team in friendly until that pointWayne Rooney will wear the No 10 shirt and be given the armband by the captain Fabian Delph when he comes on for his farewell England appearance against the USA on Thursday.Delph, who is due to captain England for the first time, confirmed the plan to hand that duty to Rooney and said the team would give the striker a guard of honour.Gareth Southgate said England’s players had been keen for Rooney to wear the No 10 shirt.

I briefly considered not having them in my mid-20s after my older sister had her first child. I have a close relationship with my mum and she says the years when we were young are some of the best of her life. I feel this way too about my children: the relationship, the feelings of love, closeness and trust. Experiencing that has changed me and how I see the world.The mental and physical exhaustion is sometimes too much. I fantasise about holidays and travelling, and regular trips to the theatre and the pub. Realistically, though, I am happier now than before I had kids. If I didn’t have kids at the age I am now I would be a bit desperate to get pregnant.Annie, 37: ‘I feel I needed the human contact, noise and busyness parenthood brings’There was never any doubt that I wanted children. Even to the point that I wanted to have two, maybe three. We had three in the end. I’m glad and feel fulfilled. I feel I needed that human contact and the noise and the feeling of being busy that parenthood brings.The relentlessness is hard. There is no opportunity to pause, take a breath, or reevaluate your priorities. I try to be really conscious of living in the moment. The best thing about being a parent is watching your children grow and change, as well as their inquisitiveness and curiosity. It doesn’t tend to be the big things that make you proud or make your heart ache with love. It can be little things like seeing an interaction with a friend, or the way they open their lunch box. It really is magical.Jack, 33: ‘The idea of being childless was the hardest part of accepting my sexual identity’As a gay man, I grew up assuming I’d never have kids, and only discovered there were options for me as an adult. I always wanted to be a parent and the idea that I’d be childless for life was the hardest part of accepting my sexual identity. I wasn’t prepared for the change having children would have on my other relationships, particularly with my husband’s family.The emotional bond I’ve formed with our kids, and the bond they’ve formed with me, transcends genetics and justified my pre-child assertions that love, not lineage, is the thing that matters most.You lose a lot of personal agency – at least for us, things need to be planned and we can’t just change our schedule at the drop of a hat. For us, cooking a lunch for people is a big deal. If friends show up two hours late, everything gets thrown out of whack, but that’s increasingly seen as socially acceptable, even though to us it’s a massive disincentive to be sociable. I love to socialise but my kids take precedence, so there’s always a trade-off.Ruth, 64: ‘My family had problems and I believed I could give my children unconditional love’I never thought of being child-free, I was always certain that I wanted to have children. My original family had its problems, and I wanted children because I believed I could give them unconditional love and that they would know they were loved no matter what they did. For me, a future without children seemed impossibly bleak. Maybe it’s selfish to have children, given the state of the world, at least people often say so, but I wanted to give a childchildren a good life and produce good people.Without a doubt, the worst thing about being a parent is the worry. My children drive and they go out socially. One lives in London, one in Manchester and one in Sheffield. All cities, all with violent crime. The worry also extends to their lives in general. Broken hearts, alcohol dependency, illness, job loss, a sense of unfulfillment – all these anxieties plague me as a parent.Natalie, 32: ‘When I was a teenager I dreamed of having my first child’I always wanted to have children. When I was a teenager, I dreamed of having my first child and had romanticised the idea of finding the perfect husband, marrying early and then having children. The best thing about being a parent is simply being a parent. I guess I didn’t imagine that it would impact my life so profoundly as it did. In our case, we had just moved to another city when our daughter was born, and we had no family or friends here, which made the social isolation worse.I love both of my daughters more than my own life – the oldest one is three and a half and the younger one was born not long ago. I absolutely love spending time with them, watching them smile and laugh and having a good time. Simply enjoying life through the perspective of a small child is magical. I love watching them grow up and witnessing their ups and downs. They truly are my biggest blessings.Lilith, 25: ‘I didn’t want to face the possibility of another miscarriage’Growing up, I was taught that having kids was a milestone in life, until my girlfriend at the time miscarried. After the grieving, I decided to put some thought into whether I wanted to face the possibility of another miscarriage by choosing to have kids. I didn’t want anyone I was involved with to go through that ever again. I’m a transgender woman and I became sterilised in 2017.I love when people are curious about my decision to be child-free. When that’s the case, we can have a proper conversation about the merits of not having children versus being a parent, because I do think that parents can be happy too. I’m not out to change their mind and I hope they’re not hoping to change mine in kind. But if I show them that my life is pretty normal and fulfilling and not dependent on raising children, and if they see there’s another valid way of living outside of being a parent, then I’m happy.Celine: ‘I’m happy that my decision to be child-free is better for the environment’I decided when I was 16 that I never wanted to have children. There was no part of me that ever wanted a child and I was terrified of getting pregnant and then having to get an abortion. I had tubal ligation surgery at 21. After the operation, I felt enormous relief and I have never regretted my decision. I’m also happy that my decision to be child-free is better for the environment, as I care deeply about the planet.Sometimes I’ll tell people my age and about the surgery and they’re often shocked but also often very supportive, asking me about the process or saying that they should get a vasectomy. This makes me happy to give support to other people who want to be child-free. I also like to show people that a woman can make a decision very early on in her life not to have a child and that this decision is valid and should be respected.Rachel, 31: ‘I come from a great family, I have a fantastic marriage and I love my husband but I don’t want kids’People who choose to be child-free need more visibility because it can feel very isolating in a world where having children is the norm. On a planet with dwindling resources, I think we need to chip away at the idea of parenthood as a life pathway by default. It’s just not true anymore. There was a time when most people who didn’t have children were those who couldn’t have them for biological reasons, which I can imagine in that society must have been really difficult, and I feel for them. It’s not that world anymore – men and women now have real choices about their future and I think we need to start talking and remove the stigma.We live in a very child-centric society and we are constantly being fed a romanticised image of family that just doesn’t exist. We’re taught that we’re incomplete without children and I think that’s hugely emotionally damaging and also bullshit. Having a child won’t fix your self-worth, your marriage or your personal issues. I’m not a wretched husk of a woman, I have no emotional damage. I come from a great family, I have a fantastic marriage and I love my husband but I don’t want kids. I love my life and I’m thankful for the choices I’ve made. I am happy.Anne, 27: ‘I want to be a mother to my dreams’Travelling makes me feel alive in a way that nothing else does. Having the freedom and money to travel was one of the biggest factors in my choice to remain child-free. When I think about having children, I feel trapped. I feel like my time, money, emotional energy and creativity would just be sucked away from me. Nothing about motherhood even remotely appeals to me and I’m sick of women having to act as if it’s the be all and end all. It’s not for everyone and I know it’s not for me. I want to be a mother to my dreams, not a child.The internet is a gift for the minority of any kind. A singular word for the reception I received was ‘cruel’. As I got older, I met some wiser people, grew a backbone, and found that when you learn how to defend yourself with reason, you find some pretty good answers and some pretty good people. I’ve known I didn’t want children since I was eight years old. I had been working to get sterilised ever since and finally found relief at the age of 20."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2018/10/01/HEADER_V2.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0e3bd63d2e72ba9feb2b727b1d428c0","title":"the auto innovations driving one of todays most technologically advanced cars","story":"Volkswagen’s new Touareg is packed with futuristic driving aids, including everything from night vision to an infotainment system controlled by gestures – and some models can even give you a massageGreat road trips are all about the drive – but the music you listen to is almost as important. And we all know that there’s nothing worse than a song you just can’t stand blasting through the speakers at the wrong moment, sticking with you for the rest of the day.Forget reaching for the car stereo control, fiddly buttons and complex menus though the new Volkswagen Touareg has a simpler solution to changing track – just wave your hand.The third-generation Touareg’s Gesture Control, which allows you to change audio tracks while using Spotify or to change preset radio stations, is just one of Volkswagen’s technological innovations that is making road trips – long or short – safer and more enjoyable.It’s this ethos to use technology that has driven the design of the Touareg to a “new time and dimension” of automotive advancement, according to Klaus Bischoff, Volkswagen’s Head of Design and the man responsible for putting Volkswagen’s latest technological innovations on the road.The new Touareg, he says, offers an alternative to the establishment with its pioneering and innovative technologies, versatility, and its excellent comfort and dynamic properties.He adds: “The design of the new Touareg makes it unmistakably clear that it is the dominant flagship of the brand. The power of this Volkswagen resides in its amiability and elegance – this car does not need to force anything.”Safety is key to that dominance, says Volkswagen. So the new Touareg boasts a string of class-leading developments that bring the future to the road today. These include a Night Vision system and IQ Light LED Matrix headlights that, when linked to the infrared system, illuminate, by a brief flash, any pedestrians in possible danger zones to make them even more visible to the driver. Perfect for when road trips go into the night.In fact, the new Touareg is “flying the flag” for all the latest technology flowing from Volkswagen’s labs and design studios in Wolfsburg, Germany, according to Brian Luckie, Product Manager for the car in the UK. “From its vast panoramic sunroof to its LED Matrix headlights with 128 LEDs per headlight, the new Touareg is one of the most technologically advanced Volkswagen vehicles to date,” he says.Inside, with its thoroughly modern Innovision Cockpit – which combines a 12-inch digital instrument cluster with a 15-inch touchscreen display on the dashboard – Volkswagen has completely redesigned the new Touareg cabin and infotainment offering. The two screens form a uniform digital landscape in “one-screen design” along a “single visual and operating axis”, while it also includes controls for the car’s four-zone air conditioning system and the operation of seat heating, ventilation and massage – available as optional extras – for comfort.All of this technology comes with a challenge, though. The rise of new technologies and autonomous cars, plus the heralded arrival of the mass-market electric car, is seeing the automotive industry undergo a period of profound change. Vehicles are becoming sensor-rich consumer devices, bristling with “intelligence” and connected to the world around then.But, as they become smart and more sophisticated, what does this mean for their drivers? And how will we safely make use of these technologies, rather than be plunged into a thick data-fog of distractions?Part of Volkswagen’s response is the Innovision Cockpit, which radically reduces the button count on the dashboard. It is also compatible with Android Auto, Apple CarPlay and MirrorLink as standard, making using your favourite apps easier and safer on the go. A driver’s head-up display can also be added as an option to project safety-critical information on the windscreen.Volkswagen has loaded the new-generation Touareg with one of the most advanced safety systems on the road today, trailblazing a future of safer motoring. For example, its optional Night Vision system detects humans and animals in the darkness, using a thermal imaging camera to see beyond the reach of the naked eye. And as with the mapping system, the result can be displayed in the instrument cluster. There’s also Roadwork Lane Assist, to help steer, brake and accelerate. This takes the new Touareg to a new level of automated safety and convenience, making it one of the world’s safest and most convenient cars.It is added to by the new optional extra of Front Cross Traffic Assist, which warns of vehicles approaching at a 90-degree angle – incredibly useful when pulling out at a tight junction or in a supermarket car park. The system will even intervene by engaging emergency braking if you don’t respond to an audible and visual warning on the Touareg’s dashboard.The combination of this futuristic technology, says Bischoff, means the new Touareg is “one of the most concise SUVs on the global market. Tailormade for freedom. That was our objective – no more and no less.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a295125e6f1afe6e4e547fbe5d945a68d56f6ca/0_0_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4cd2d8d98bfad386143e6392637729e5","title":"from the human eye to hubble a brief history of our quest for better vision","story":"Technology today enables us to ‘look’ millions of light years across the universe, but up until 400 years ago we didn’t even have telescopes. The scientific search for ways to improve our sense of sight is truly inspiringPretty much as soon as humans stopped battling to stay alive 24 hours a day, the first thing they did was look up into the sky and wonder about the sun. The earliest religions made the sun into a god. In August, Nasa launched its Parker Solar Probe to take a closer look. And if you want to define what it is to be human – and to explain how we got from baffled apes to space explorers – it’s pretty much all in there. We want to take a look.In psychology, this is called the drive theory of curiosity. It defines curiosity as an internal drive that’s as important to us as hunger or thirst. It’s a naturally occurring urge that has to be satisfied. So, when we’d done inventing fire and shelter and took a look at our five senses, it’s only natural that we’d work on technology to improve sight above all the others. We’re always trying to find new ways of taking a better look.One of the first recorded mentions of improved eyesight was around 400BC – a tossed aside joke in a play called The Clouds by Aristophanes. It’s a comedy, and jokes only work if the audience shares the reference, so using a glass globe filled with water to magnify letters was commonplace enough to get a laugh in ancient Greece.It was almost 1,500 years before the Arab mathematician and astronomer Abu Ali al-Hassan Ibn al-Haitham published the first book on geometrical optics – showing how oval glass could magnify objects. The Venetians used his theories to make “reading stones” and the first European eyeglasses essentially bolted two reading stones together with a hinge around 1300AD. At which point we could finally – in theory – help everyone to see.But we’re human. Once we can see something, we want to see more. It took another few hundred years and some squabbling Dutchmen in the town of Middleburg to exploit nature’s laws and allow us to see things we were never designed to see. These days, Middelburg is a small, quiet town of some 50,000 inhabitants. At the turn of the 16th century, it was the Silicon Valley of improved vision – Hans Lippershey filed the first ever patent for a telescope there in 1608, while his next-door neighbour Zacharias Janssen claimed the first microscope around the same time. Lippershey then claimed the microscope himself proving we’ve never been able to keep our eyes on our own work.Since then sight tech has fell into two camps – improving our vision and augmenting our vision. From the 1800s people had been working on contact lenses with limited success. It wasn’t until 1936 that Brooklyn born optometrist William Feinbloom worked out that plastic, not glass, was the key to contacts.It was a shower of broken glass in a myopic boy’s eye – who found his sight improved after the wounds healed – that helped the Soviet scientist Svyatoslov Fyodorov develop radial keratotomy – eye surgery – to tweak the shape of the cornea and cure the short sighted, eventually developing laser eye surgery.Today there’s retinal implants – attached to the retina that trigger the optic nerve corneal inlays – small, ring-like devices implanted under the eye’s outer surface to correct both near and far-sightedness and augmented reality glasses such as those developed by Stephen Hicks, research fellow in neuroscience at the University of Oxford and founder of start-up OxSight.The company’s lenses overcome tunnel vision and glaucoma, using image-interpretation algorithms and cameras to increase image contrast, highlight specific visual features or create representations of reality on the lenses, according to Hicks – who raised £2m from angel investor Jiangong Zhang in 2016 and plans a launch later this year. The EU’s Retina project, meanwhile, aims to combine synthetic vision with images beamed directly on to the retina to help air traffic controllers see air traffic far beyond normal human perception, even in low-visibility conditions.And here’s where augmentation really kicks in. From the moment we could see the small stuff and the far away stuff we’ve wanted to see smaller and farther. As time progressed, the telescope was improved, notably by Sir Isaac Newton and Léon Foucault, but it wasn’t until the 1930s that we realised we could “see” without using our eyes – or even light. First up, the infrared – or thermographic – camera, developed in the UK by Hungarian physicist Kálmán Tihanyi to spot night-time air raids. It’s the same technology – albeit spruced up a little – that’s deployed as Night Vision in the new Volkswagen Touareg. This infrared camera spots pedestrians, cyclists and larger wild animals at a range of 10 to 130 metres and alerts the driver.The 1930s also saw Robert Watson-Watt deploy the first radiolocation technology – later known as radar – to help the UK’s Met Office track thunderstorms. Also at that time, Bell Labs engineer Karl Jansky discovered that astronomical objects gave off radio emissions, inspiring the radio telescope that could observe everything from gamma-ray to infrared radiation. German physicist Hans Busch pioneered the study of electron opticsthroughout the decade, which led to Ernst Ruska inventing the electron microscope.With this tech, we no longer had to be in eye contact with our visual aids now, we even bury microscopes underground – like the particle accelerators at Cern that hurl particles into each other and analyse the results of the collisions to understand the fundamental building blocks of matter. Or we throw observing tech into space – such as the Hubble Space Telescope and Fermi’s Gamma-ray Burst Monitor. In April, Nasa launched the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite – or the Tess probe – to look for planets outside our solar system, using lenses and cameras that might blow Lippershey’s mind, but which he’d completely understand.And if we didn’t have to be there, couldn’t something else do the actual looking for us? In the 1960s, computer scientists took inspiration from the Perceptron machine developed by psychologist Frank Rosenblatt to pioneer artificial neural networks and work started on designing robots that could see. Indeed, one major goal of artificial intelligence at the time was to recreate the human visual system.This was, at best, a partial success – it gave us 3D modelling and digital-image processing, but it wasn’t until the 1990s that computers could handle the vast data sets involved in understanding and modelling real-time images. It’s worth pausing to realise how amazing your eye is – when a Google AI learned to identify cat faces in YouTube videos they needed 16,000 computers working together. You picked that up before you could talk.Things have improved for our mechanical friends – in 2016, UK based AI pioneers DeepMind began data-crunching retinal scans at Moorfields eye hospital in London after Pearse Keane, a consultant ophthalmologist, asked if it could help with a knotty NHS problem.There are currently more than 600,000 people with age-related macular degeneration – it creates shadowy areas in the central part of vision – in the UK and 200 people are diagnosed with the condition every day. Over the past 10 years, optical coherence tomography (OCT) has revolutionised diagnosis. This uses light waves to take cross-section pictures of the retina. A number of UK opticians already offer OCT scans on the high street but, according to Keane, “they don’t always have the necessary training to read the scans. The NHS is currently getting false positives from high street OCT scans asking us to see the patient urgently. Imagine every GP having an MRI but not being trained to use it.” DeepMind’s AI algorithm helps by checking scans for a telltale sign of the condition, sending an alert to a doctor if it finds one.Autonomous vehicle machine vision uses a similar technique – known as Histogram of Oriented Gradients, which ides images up into tiny pixels and essentially spots the difference in light intensity on different pixels. It’s not quite the system deployed by Knight Industries Two Thousand car Kitt in the 1982 TV series Knight Rider – although David Hasselhoff’s ride did sport collision-avoidance technology that inspired many of today’s vehicle collision safety features.Kitt had one feature we’ve never managed to reproduce in the real world – enough personality to understand the Hoff’s emotional needs. It urged him to trust his instincts or played wingman as he chatted up the ladies. In other words, it could look into his heart and his soul. Perhaps that’s somewhere we’d prefer to look into all by ourselves. There are some adventures where we don’t need better technology – we just need to be more human."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29154973f074960f0af69cc6dd7f29cd56de0967/0_50_2016_1210/master/2016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09e9e989b476cafc49db8d6d0e45625a","title":"guardian passes 1m mark in reader donations katharine viner","story":"Business model showing way for journalism to ‘regain its relevance’, says editor-in-chiefMore than a million people worldwide have contributed to the  in the last three years, with 500,000 paying to support the publication on an ongoing basis, according to  News and Media’s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner.She said the business model was showing a new way for journalism to “regain its relevance, meaning and trusted place in society”.Viner told the Society of Editors’ annual conference in Salford that many contributors donated specifically because they wanted the  to stay free and outside a paywall, so “progressive journalism can have the widest possible impact”.“Many readers didn’t understand the challenging commercial reality facing all news organisations, but once we told them more, they expressed real interest in wanting to support the ,” she said. “This was helped by the fact that any money made by the  has to be spent on journalism, because of our ownership structure with no shareholders or owner.“This entirely new revenue stream of monthly and one-off contributions is now a crucial part of our plan to get the  to break even by next April.

The former Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre criticised Rusbridger in his lecture on Sunday night.“His record on investigations in the public interest was exceptional, a model for how to hold the powerful to account,” Viner said."},{"url":null,"title":"support the guardian how to make the most","story":"Over one million of our readers have supported us financially, and there are a number of advantages to doing so – including getting closer to our journalists and reducing the number of requests you see on our articles supporters help us keep our journalism open for everyone through regular financial contributions, or single payments.

That’s what all of us, as writers, actors and comedians, set out to do – shine a light on new perspectives. So it was fascinating this year to find that one of these stories challenged my own set of stereotypes about classical music.Over the past few months I have been enthralled and captivated by the story of a man from Croydon in south London who died more than 100 years ago and who wrote one of the biggest musical hits of the 20th century. He was a total genius – a bit like Prince, but for late 19th-century London rather than 1980s California – and his name was Samuel Coleridge-Taylor.Until this year, the only time I’d previously heard of him was in a meeting for a programme pitch for a biopic on the composer back in the 90s. I’m sad that we didn’t go ahead and make it.Young Samuel was brought up by his mother and her extended family in Croydon. He never met his doctor father, Daniel Peter Hughes Taylor, who was originally from Sierra Leone and had come here to study medicine in London. You may be wondering about his name. Samuel’s mother, Alice Hare Martin, named her son after Samuel Taylor Coleridge, the poet. Oh, those Victorians!The family clubbed together to pay Samuel’s fees at the Royal College of Music, which he entered at 15 as a violin scholar. But the violin was set to one side and composition took centre stage and he was taken under the wing of the composer and conductor Charles Villiers Stanford, who also mentored a generation of big-name composers, including Gustav Holst, Ralph Vaughan Williams and Frank Bridge. For two years running, Coleridge-Taylor won the RCM’s Lesley Alexander composition prize and was championed by Edward Elgar, who recommended the talented young composer for a major commission – an orchestral work for the Three Choirs festival, his Ballade in A Minor, opus 33.The thing I like about Coleridge-Taylor is that he fought adversity to reach the top. He suffered racial abuse at school – apparently he even had his hair set on fire – but remained dignified. His compositions are dynamic, bold, incredibly melodic and immediately accessible. I was blown away. And I wasn’t the only one. He was known as the “African Mahler” and his success stretched far and wide.In the US, he was a household name in his lifetime, and travelled there by invitation of the Samuel Coleridge-Taylor Choral Society of Washington DC in 1904, and again in 1906 and 1910. The US marines band were engaged for his first performance and 2,700 people were in the audience, two-thirds of whom were black. He went on to compose Twenty Four Negro Melodies and Five Choral Ballads after that visit. He became interested in interpreting African American melodies, writing: “What Brahms has done for the Hungarian folk music, Dvořák for the Bohemian, and Grieg for the Norwegian, I have tried to do for these Negro melodies.” When success hit, he used it to tell stories about his racial origins in a musical way that might uplift others.His best known work, Hiawatha’s Wedding Feast, part of the cantata trilogy The Song of Hiawatha, premiered in 1898 to huge acclaim, and went on to play, with the other two parts in a semi-staged version, at the Royal Albert Hall for a fortnight in June every year for almost 30 years in the interwar years. (The first RAH performance was conducted by his son, who he named Hiawatha, in 1924.) “Hiawatha season” became part of the national culture – families would come to see it in fancy dress with feather headdresses, embroidered tunics, and their hair in plaits. But Coleridge-Taylor never got to enjoy his success – he died tragically young, aged 37, of pneumonia in 1912 – illness said to have been brought on by overwork. Nor did his family enjoy the financial fruits of Hiawatha’s success – the composer had sold the publishing rights to it to Ivor Novello’s company for a low flat fee.I’d always listened to a bit of Mahler or Mozart back in the day, in my car on the ghetto blaster I kept on the passenger seat. I’d throw in a bit of classical between Stevie Wonder and Kool and the Gang. Why not? However, beyond the confines of my car, I suppose somewhere there was an idea of who this music was for, and who wrote it. At times, listening and absorbing the strictly European nature of pieces by Mozart, Beethoven, Mahler – although extraordinary – did feel a bit dutiful, as if being made to eat one’s veggies.At school, though, I had a brilliant teacher who played classical records to us in the classroom. I remember most particularly Holst’s The Planets – that piece had a big impact on me. But we never went to a concert hall, and I didn’t see any black musicians. When I finally heard a live orchestra as an adult, it hit me like lightning. I’m pretty sure that if I’d experienced that at six years old I’d have had a different view of classical music, and I’m sad about that. What a gift it would be if every child in the country could hear a professional orchestra at least once.Perhaps it’s time for everyone to take a fresh look at classical music and put aside the stereotypes. Samuel Coleridge-Taylor has opened my eyes in many ways. His story is a fascinating and surprising one – and I really hope his music does start to reach a new audience. This is our music – it’s music for everyone.• Our Classical Century, presented by Lenny Henry and Suzy Klein, is on BBC4 on 15 November at 9pm and then on iPlayer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e53b1c88d5aabdb6b331c2cf97d549abca78df79/0_365_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e323fa0386fedfbf78cc5a26dac477bf","title":"skydiving from a dream review scottish ensemble add interest if not coherence to bach","story":"Tramway, GlasgowThe string orchestra reunite with Andersson Dance to delve into the subconscious, via the music of Bach, Beethoven and LutosławskiHaving long been known for virtuoso, dynamic music making, in recent years the Scottish Ensemble has begun delving into the adventurous territory of cross-genre collaboration. Last year there was Tabula Rasa, a meditation on death and dying created with Vanishing Point theatre company. Before that, Goldberg Variations saw the ensemble working with Andersson Dance on the music of Bach.It is Andersson Dance and the music of JS Bach to which the ensemble has returned for this latest project. Extracts from the Art of Fugue are juxtaposed with Lutosławski’s Preludes for solo strings and Beethoven’s Grosse Fuge in expanded version for string orchestra. Where Tabula Rasa was based in the concrete reality of the experience of dying, this latest project is decidedly more enigmatic. According to the note from the creators, the work “delves into the contradictions of the subconscious mind, from the absurd to the logical, from the irrational to the soothingly clear”.In practice, this appears to mean three dancers engaged in frenzied, tortuous activity in stark juxtaposition to the ensemble’s elegantly austere delivery of Bach from various groupings on the stage. Much has been made of choreographer Orjan Andersson’s use of non-professional dancers, but in truth more participation from the members of the Scottish Ensemble would have been welcome. The one section where the players writhe and gyrate around the stage, like a groovy 1970s party set to the music of Bach is one of the highlights. Elsewhere, the ensemble is largely confined to walking around a bit, sometimes barefoot, which doesn’t appear to cast the music in particularly new light. As for the complex choreography of the trio of professional dancers, there often seems to be a mismatch between the stillness of the music and the energy of the movement. Or maybe that’s the point. Yet whatever its shortcomings, this is an interesting, if not entirely coherent experiment.• At Eden Court, Inverness, on 15 November."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc241bb51b853fdeae543aae75efc7a2df8baa75/0_121_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=113021f0460e1fc77df5f7e0c2f77bd5","title":"can theresa may deliver brexit","story":"Once Theresa May brings her Brexit deal to parliament it will face a crucial vote. ’s political editor Heather Stewart looks across the House of Commons at the warring groups the prime minister will need to win over to seal a deal before the deadline of 29 March 2019.

Theresa May exists on a different time scale to most ordinary people. While the rest of us try to plan weeks, months – sometimes even years – ahead, the prime minister has a much narrower focus. Minutes, hours and days. Just getting to the end of any given 24-hour period with her job still intact is cause enough for celebration. Even if the cold sweats are sure to begin again at dawn the next day.No wonder then that May seemed relieved – if mentally drained – when she eventually appeared outside Downing Street to give a brief statement. Her Brexit deal, which even she wasn’t sure she fully understood – other than it was better than no deal, worse than what the UK already had and nothing like what she had promised – had survived its first contact with her cabinet. She was still just about in the game.Not that it had been easy. Cabinet had overrun by several hours. Even Alun Cairns – who was he again? – had insisted on droning on. At length. Like all the others, pretending he knew what he was talking about. When it was clear no one did. Then Karen Bradley had needed to check on which bit was Northern Ireland and which was the republic. At which point the government cancelled the press statement only for the government to reinstate the press statement when it emerged that the government didn’t know it hadn’t cancelled the press statement. ITV had live broadcast pictures of the front door for more than five hours. Who knew chaos took quite this long? A metaphor for Brexit itself.“There had been impassioned debate,” May said, looking tight-lipped. As in severe reservations. Penny Mordaunt and Esther McVey might still resign, but she could live with that. Both fell under the heading of acceptable collateral damage. Come to think of it, their departures might even be an unexpected bonus as she couldn’t remember them ever having done anything useful. If only Chris Grayling would do the decent thing as well, it would be a red-letter day.All the big hitters had stayed on board, though. Dominic Raab had become a pushover ever since his geography lesson and the rest had surrendered to her logic. Her deal was every bit as bad as she had always led them to believe it would be, so if they were to storm out in a strop it would rather imply they had never grasped the details.To make it a full house, the Four Pot Plants had more or less succumbed to her argument that the best way of showing you were taking back control was to hand it all back to the EU. After all, it was consensus of a sort if Remainers and Leavers both disliked her deal. Unity through disunity. Best of all, Tony Blair had even spent the afternoon calling her draft deal ‘a capitulation’. Nobody believed a word he said these days. Not even when he was telling the truth.Prime minister’s questions had also passed off without too much damage being inflicted. It could have been better, mind. It was just typical that Jeremy Corbyn had chosen this day of all days to ask about Brexit. Normally the Labour leader could be relied upon to use his six questions to cross-examine her about bus timetables at a moment of national crisis.But though Corbyn had managed to land a couple of glancing blows on the backstop agreement and the red ink that she had put through her red lines, here had nothing to cause her much grief. Certainly nothing that her uncanny ability to find different ways of failing to answer a question directly couldn’t handle. “Let me be clear,” she had said, as she went on to explain why everyone had always known that what they were voting for in the referendum was any deal she just happened to manage to agree with the EU. Her default denial algorithm was in perfect working order.There had been one minor alarm when Iain Duncan Smith had got to his feet, but it soon turned out that all he wanted was a complete reversal of government policy on the timing of the new £2 top rates for fixed odds betting terminals. That was no bother. Throwing Philip Hammond and Jeremy Wright to the wolves was an unexpected pleasure. All that mattered was the here and now. Just breathe. She’d got all her life to live. She’d got all her love to give. She had survived. She would survive.

But it certainly soured relations with the British. “They won’t be happy until Barnier’s publicly flogged,” one senior EU diplomat in the Austrian city said at the time.The European commission decided to use the moment.At a meeting in the European council’s Europa building on Friday 5 October, the EU’s German deputy chief negotiator, Sabine Weyand, regarded as the brains of the EU’s negotiating team, sought to cash in on Barnier’s popularity with the member states.Barnier had delivered on the £39bn orce bill, and on citizens’ rights earlier in the year. The talks were getting bogged down on the all-weather or backstop solution for avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland, she said. The UK could not accept a plan that could keep Northern Ireland in the customs union while Britain withdrew at the end of the 21-month transition period.“We need to give it a chance,” Weyand, a Cambridge-educated student of Shakespeare, said of the talks.Weyand told the room of diplomats that she wanted to take the negotiations out of the public eye, and talk intensely with the British, without the usual consultation with the member states laid down in a hefty book of rules of procedures.The small core group of negotiating teams would set up home on the fifth floor of the European council’s Berlaymont building to throw around new ideas, some of which were potentially highly controversial, to try to break the deadlock.“What we need is for you to trust us,” Weyand told them. “We don’t know where we will land but it is worth exploring, we don’t know how it will work but trust us.”“If we fail to plan for success, we plan to fail,” she added. “What we would really like to do is go into a tunnel and then come back to brief you about what happened just before the next European council.”The logic of the tunnel had been to play with ideas in a “safe space”, working long hours, and having salads in the Berlaymont canteen for nutrition.The best lawyers and customs experts from the commission and Whitehall were brought in on demand in order to draft legal text, the substance of which had been hammered out among a small coterie of civil servants led by Weyand on the EU side and Olly Robbins, Downing Street’s Brexit point-man, a mediaphobe who revelled in the tightness of the teams.Weyand offered specific ambassadors among key member states, notably France and Germany, irregular briefings as the secretive talks developed.When pressed for more information Weyand had a ready response.“I can’t say much, it is all very sensitive,” she told concerned diplomats. “It is like a jigsaw. I can’t brief on a specific piece because it doesn’t make sense. It is only if you start putting them together that they start making sense. What I want to do is preserve those pieces so I can use them in the future. If I start to brief them now they will deteriorate. This is how we can explore what is possible”.But the first phase of the tunnel talks ended in dramatic failure.Robbins had returned to London on the Eurostar with his team, including Sarah Healey, the director general at the Department for Exiting the European Union, at about 6pm on the evening of Friday 12 October with some hope that there might be a workable deal there.By the Sunday, with the Democratic Unionist party and members of the cabinet making obvious their unhappiness at what had been achieved, the Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, was sent to Brussels to break the news to Barnier that there was not enough in the package to sell to parliament.Theresa May spoke to the Commons that Monday to explain the proposal so far would have introduced a new commitment to negotiate, during the transition period after Brexit day, a temporary UK-wide customs union with the EU in order to avoid the “dislocation” of the country by creating a customs border in the Irish sea between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.She confirmed the offer from the EU, first revealed by the , for an extension clause on the transition period to allow such negotiations to come to fruition if the 21 months was too short.The EU had also insisted, however, on keeping in the withdrawal agreement their original “backstop” solution in which Northern Ireland alone would in effect stay in the customs union and single market just in case the negotiations on that mooted all-UK deal fail, she said.May told MPs: “As I have said many times, I could never accept that, no matter how unlikely such a scenario may be.”The question now was whether Weyand and Robbins could find some new jigsaw pieces in the tunnel.“There is an evolution in the commission thinking,”, said one EU official ahead of the latest tunnel talks. “From what they originally proposed there is a shift towards the UK in agreeing to a UK customs-wide thing so, yes, flexible. But whether that flexibility will lead to agreement is something else.”What has emerged in recent days is more than evolution, but a major leap by the commission that has many member states concerned and may yet be a source of trouble in the weeks to come.By essentially including a fully operational UK-wide customs union in the withdrawal agreement, major issues that would have been negotiated in the transition period have been thrust into the last hectic few weeks left in the talks, EU sources said.A customs union provides quota and tariff-free trade on goods. The EU has had to demand a huge array of “level playing field” commitments on state aid, to environmental, labour and social regulations to ensure that UK businesses cannot undercut European ones.The EU had also wanted to use its leverage in the trade talks during the transition period to ensure continuity of fishing rights for European fleets in British waters after Brexit. But by giving away a customs union, including free trade in fish, that leverage would be lost.Last Friday, in comments that sources say have been inaccurately seized upon by some as evidence of the EU rubbing its hands at the prospect of ensnaring the UK into a permanent customs arrangement, Weyand tried to persuade ambassadors that the British had not won out in the tunnel.“Take a step back. What are we trying to achieve?” Weyand had asked the ambassadors, before answering: “What we are trying to achieve is to get the withdrawal agreement for citizens, financial settlement and transition and we are trying to get in the best possible position for the future negotiation.”Agreement now on the difficult issues on state aid and environment regulations, among others, should be regarded as a “blessing in disguise”, Weyand said. A base-line had been set for the talks over the future relationship when it came to that after 29 March 2019. But it was a hard sell, sources said. Not triumphant. All eyes have been on the cabinet on Wednesday. On Monday, EU diplomats suggest, the member states, particularly France, might send the commission back to demand harder commitments from the UK. There may be more drama yet to come."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/312fb1993edbb6fbaf916c21ea811cf94a05a1ca/0_0_3006_1803/master/3006.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82e41c94d5bf7e545c05ed6cac4239f4","title":"theresa mays brexit deal everything you need to know","story":"What does the agreement say? Which bits are controversial? And will it get now get through parliament?After a mammoth meeting, Theresa May’s cabinet has backed the text of the draft withdrawal agreement drawn up this week in Brussels by EU and UK negotiators, two-and-a-half years after Britain voted to leave the bloc.Here is a brief guide to what the agreement says, which parts of it may prove controversial (and why), how likely the prime minister now is to get it through parliament, and what could happen next. Think of it as the separation agreement between the UK and the EU. Running to a rumoured 400-600 pages, it covers three main areas:The agreement also includes a much shorter (and non-binding) seven page political declaration outlining what the two sides see as their desired future trading relationship, which remains to be negotiated.While some of the detail took longer, the UK and EU agreed reasonably quickly on the so-called orce bill and citizens’ rights (although not to the satisfaction of many of the citizens concerned).The sticking point has been the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, which after Brexit will also become the border between the UK and the EU. Because of the island’s troubled history, both sides want to avoid a hard border with customs checks that could become a source of friction.The problem has been that because the prime minister promised in her Lancaster House speech to take Britain out of both the EU’s single market (to cease being an EU “rule-taker”) and the customs union (to allow it to strike its own trade deals around the world), customs and regulatory checks at the border are difficult to dodge.Ultimately, the border is supposed to become a non-issue under the terms of the comprehensive free trade agreement the two sides are expected to sign at some stage after Britain’s departure on 29 March next year.But because this agreement may well not be negotiated by the end of the transition period in December 2020, the EU insisted on a “backstop” arrangement to avoid a hard border until a free trade agreement came into effect. The row over the form this backstop should take is what has prevented the withdrawal agreement from being signed until now.For months, Britain rejected the EU’s proposed backstop – in effect, keeping Northern Ireland in the customs union and single market – because it would require customs checks in the Irish Sea and other arrangements meaning Northern Ireland was treated differently to the rest of the UK.But the EU also rejected Britain’s suggestion that the whole of the UK should stay in a de facto customs union with the EU, mainly because the government wanted to be able to withdraw from such an arrangement unilaterally and at a time of its choosing (which, for the EU, meant it could not be considered a proper backstop).The solution involves concessions on both sides. On the EU side, the chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has accepted the idea of a whole-UK customs union with the EU, satisfying the UK’s demands that its territorial integrity must be preserved.But in return, Britain must agree that it will not be allowed to exit the backstop unless and until the EU agrees there is no prospect of a return to a hard border. In addition, it will have to accept special “deeper” customs arrangements for Northern Ireland, and the EU’s so-called “level playing field” conditions for the whole of the UK.These address member states’ concerns that de facto customs union membership without the obligations of the single market could give the UK an unfair advantage, so will require Britain to observe EU rules on, for example, state aid, competition, the environment, tax and labour market rules.Hardly. Conservative Brexiters are aghast at the prospect of Britain potentially being “trapped” forever in a customs union with the EU – so prevented from striking independent trade deals – and appalled at having to continue to accept EU regulations to boot (hence Boris Johnson’s dismissal of the deal as “vassal state stuff”).The Northern Ireland unionists of the DUP – on whose votes in Westminster the government relies for its majority – fear those “deeper” customs arrangements and additional checks on livestock and food crossing the Irish Sea breach the party’s red lines on identical treatment for Northern Ireland.Labour has said the agreement looks unlikely to support jobs and the economy or guarantee standards and protections, and if that’s the case it will vote against it. Tory remainers – heartened by Jo Johnson’s resignation last week – may also be encouraged to rebel.Now that she has successfully sold the agreement to her cabinet, whose leave-supporting members ultimately decided not to put their money where their mouths had been, an emergency EU summit can be held, most likely on 25 November, to seal the deal.Then it has to be passed through parliament earlier rather than later in December. Many observers believe it could fall at this hurdle, resulting either in a challenge to May’s leadership, a general election or even a second referendum (with staying in the EU still theoretically an option, although that would mean extending article 50).But even if May and her agreement survive, the government will still have to decide before June 2020 whether it wants to extend the transition period, fall into the Northern Ireland backstop arrangement or enter a permanent customs union – and after that, seal a future trade deal, on which the two sides remain far apart.Britain’s Brexit battle is a long way – a very long way – from over."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b5dce17f8bb5dffb8c90af657c1592304c94ad4/0_285_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=abccbcb632512359c6c1a431639108e6","title":"brexit deal theresa may conservatives meet decide cabinet politics live","story":"PM announces she has secured backing for plan after ‘long, detailed and impassioned debate’My colleague Dan Sabbagh has found the section of the document explaining how, under the Irish backstop, Northern Ireland would have to comply with single market rules on regulation.Here is the Times’ Raphael Howarth on what the deal says about the backstop.UPDATE: And this is from Politico Europe’s Tom McTague on the backstop.More on what happened at cabinet.From the ’s Christopher HopeAnd this is from ITV’s Robert PestonHere are some key features of the draft withdrawal agreement flagged up by Alex Barker, the FT’s Brussels bureau chief.Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, is giving a briefing in Brussels now about the deal.And here is the second document out tonight - a seven-page outline of the political declaration on the framework for the future relationship (pdf).Jacob Rees-Mogg, chair of the European Research Group, which represents Tory MPs pushing for a harder Brexit, must be a speed reader. He has just released the text of a letter he is sending to all Conservative MPs urging them to reject the draft Brexit deal. He gives four reasons why.First, he says it will involve giving the EU £39bn and getting “little or nothing in return”.Second, he says the agreement would treat Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK.Third, he says it would lock the UK into an EU customs union and EU laws.And, fourth he says that keeping the UK bound by the rules of the customs union would contradict what was in the 2017 Conservative manifesto and that this would be “profoundly undemocratic”.UDPATE: Here is the text.And here are the main points from May’s statement.Here is the text of the draft withdrawal agreement (pdf). It runs to 585 pages.Here is the full text of Theresa May’s statement.The cabinet has just had a long, detailed and impassioned debate on the draft withdrawl agreement and on the outline political declaration on our future relationship with the European Union.These documents were the result of thousands of hours of hard negotiation by UK officials and many, many meetings which I and other ministers held with our EU counterparts. I firmly believe that the draft withdrawal agreement was the best that could be negotiated and it was for the cabinet to decide whether to move on in the talks. The choices before us were difficult, particularly in relation to the Northern Ireland backstop, but the collective decision of cabinet was that the government should agree the draft withdrawal agreement and the outline political declaration.This is a decisive step which enables us to move on and finalise the deal in the days ahead.These decisions were not taken lightly but I believe it is a decision that is firmly in the national interest.When you strip away the detail the choice before us is clear. This deal, which delivers on the vote of the referendum, which brings us back control of our money, laws and borders, ends free movement, protects jobs, security and our union, or leave with no deal, or no Brexit at all.I know that there will be difficult days ahead. This is a decision which will come under intense scrutiny, and that is entirely as it should be, and entirely understandable.But the choice was this deal, which enables us to take back control and build a brighter future for our country, or going back to square one, with more ision, more uncertainty, and the failure to deliver on the referendum. It’s my job as prime minister to explain the decisions that the government has taken, and I stand ready to do that, beginning tomorrow with a statement in parliament.Let me end by just saying this I believe that what I owe to this country is to take decisions that are in the national interest and I firmly believe, with my head and my heart, that this is a decision that is in the best interests of our entire United Kingdom."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/551e5453a5ca370f67b65bb7d0a01c6a25fb64f0/0_200_5197_3118/master/5197.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3bddddeb49ed70e3902050a3f5a7221c","title":"former naturopath and scientist share john maddox prize","story":" Scientist documenting coral reef decline and whistleblower on alternative therapy industry share awardA scientist who is documenting the devastating decline of the world’s coral reefs and a former naturopath turned whistleblower on the alternative therapy industry have been jointly awarded a prestigious prize for championing science in the face of hostility and legal threats.Prof Terry Hughes, the director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies in Australia and a world expert on the Great Barrier Reef, was awarded the John Maddox prize for bringing to the world’s attention the catastrophic coral reef bleaching that has occurred as the world’s oceans have warmed.Hughes has faced criticism from public figures and the Australian tourist industry.He shares the award with Britt Hermes, an American former naturopath who is researching a PhD in evolutionary biology at Kiel University, Germany. Hermes has been recognised for her advocacy of evidence-based medicine through her blog, Naturopathic Diaries, in which she exposes bogus claims made by alternative medicine practitioners, which she says could place patients in danger.Hermes said her own professional journey had come at a personal cost and she was being sued for defamation by an American naturopath in a case due to be heard in a German court.“I was a naturopath, until I looked at the evidence and decided to speak up about the dangerous therapies used in naturopathy, especially those to treat cancer,” she said. “Walking away cost me my friends. I am harassed and being sued for defamation. I am honoured to be recognised by the scientific community for changing my mind.”Hughes is a world-leading coral expert, who led efforts to survey the Great Barrier Reef during an El Niño warming pattern in tropics that occurred in 2016-17. He said he and his students wept when the extent of the damage to the corals was revealed by an eight-day aerial survey.“The emotion we all have as scientists is a mix of sadness but also frustration at not being listened to and anger at the inaction of governments like Australia’s to this unfolding tragedy,” he said.Abnormally high water temperatures trigger the coral to expel the symbiotic algae living inside that provide them with much of their food as well as their colour. When this happens, the corals gradually turn white. Corals can recover after bleaching but need years to return to full health and some die off altogether.Hughes has faced criticism for his work, including from the tourism industry. Earlier this year, the head of a group that represents more than 100 businesses in the Great Barrier Reef called for the government to withdraw his funding, saying he was to blame for a slump in tourism.“Most scientists who work in the climate change space are subject to hostility from vested interests. It comes with the territory,” said Hughes, who has repeatedly criticised the Australian government’s failure to cut fossil fuel emissions.“The Australian government, and the Murdoch media, downplay or ignore the risks of climate change and they are still promoting new developments of coal mines and fracking for gas,” he said. “If we want to save the Great Barrier Reef, and meet Australia’s commitments to the Paris agreement, these outdated ambitions need to be abandoned. Yet Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions are rising, not falling. It’s a national disgrace.”The John Maddox prize is a joint initiative of the charity Sense about Science and the journal Nature, and is awarded to one or two people each year.Tracey Brown, the director of Sense about Science, said the winners had gone to extraordinary lengths to bring scientific research into public discussions despite public spaces not always being supportive of these efforts. “It is profoundly against the public interest to have research driven from the public domain by fears of personal attack, legal action or institutional hostility,” she said. “This prize gives strength to the elbow of those who push forward in difficult circumstances, but we need to see more action to stop it getting that far.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38f756c4a4d5040c7f47766576ede694c962c7b4/84_0_2536_1522/master/2536.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f2285b27a5fd36c2d2042da1664baa77","title":"impact crater 19 miles wide found beneath greenland glacier","story":"Crater appears to be result of mile-wide iron meteorite just 12,000 years agoThe enormous bowl-shaped dent appears to be the result of a mile-wide iron meteorite slamming into the island at a speed of 12 miles per second as recently as 12,000 years ago.The impact of the 10bn-tonne space rock would have unleashed 47m times the energy of the Little Boy nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945. It would have melted vast amounts of ice, sending freshwater rushing into the oceans, and blasted rocky debris high into the atmosphere.At 19.3 miles wide, the crater ranks among the 25 largest known on Earth and is the first to be found beneath an ice sheet.“You have to go back 40 million years to find a crater of the same size, so this is a rare, rare occurrence in Earth’s history,” said Kurt Kjær, of the Natural History Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen.Scientists first suspected a crater in 2015 when they spotted a huge depression in Nasa radar images of the bedrock beneath the Hiawatha glacier in north-west Greenland. Kjær, who passes a 20-tonne meteorite to reach his office every day, wondered if such a space rock might be the culprit. “It all snowballed from there,” said Joseph MacGregor, a senior scientist on the team at Nasa’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland.It so happened that researchers at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany were about to test a powerful new ice-penetrating radar system that was operated from the air. In May 2016 the scientists flew over the Hiawatha glacier and used the radar to map the underlying rock in unparalleled detail.The images revealed all the hallmarks of an impact crater. “It became very clear that this was a circular feature with a rim around it and an elevated central region,” said Kjær. The basin itself was more than 300 metres deep, according to a report in the journal Science Advances.To search for solid proof of an impact, the researchers flew out to the glacier and collected sediments that had washed from the crater on to a nearby floodplain. Among the gathered grains, the scientists found particles of shocked quartz and other materials that are typically produced by the violence of a extraterrestrial impact. Geochemical tests of the grains suggest the meteorite was made of iron.So far it has been impossible to put a firm age on the crater, but its condition suggests it formed after ice began to cover Greenland about 3 million years ago. But the crater may have formed much more recently. The radar images show that while the surface layers of the glacier immediately above the crater look normal, deeper layers that are older than 12,000 years are badly deformed and strewn with rocks, with some lumps as big as trucks.“When it happened is the $64,000 question,” said MacGregor. For a final answer, the researchers will need to drill through half a mile of ice and collect crater material for dating, or wait for rocks from the impact basin to be brought to the surface as the glacier flows to the sea. Either way, the scientists have a wait on their hands.“We live on a planet where you can survey anything and you think you know everything,” said Kjær. “But when you see such a big thing as this hiding in plain sight, you realise that the age of discovery is not over yet.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4dbd5d0e6a7b224f4e416a23b22d35c19648d51c/0_167_6016_3608/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b12edcde4ccd77fab0d799d9e320eab","title":"hip hop hull young people poverty city of culture","story":"A new documentary shows one man’s battle with poverty as he tries to bring rap – and hope – to the city’s most deprived areasTen-year-old Jess Baker (not her real name) stands at a microphone in a tiny recording studio behind a hip-hop clothing shop near Hull city centre. “My brain is all messed up,” she raps, “Music is my passion, it makes me not give up”.Running the sound desk and encouraging her as she raps is Steve Arnott, director of Beats Bus, a project running music and arts workshops for young people in the city, which tackle issues including mental health, bullying and political engagement. “The idea of the Beats Bus first came to me about five years ago,” says Arnott. “There were hip-hop workshops already happening across the city, and I’d started doing workshops for young people. But if you come from a family with no money, parents can’t afford to give their children bus fares every day to come into town.”Arnott is the focus of a new documentary following his attempts to bring creativity and self-expression to young people in Hull’s marginalised communities. The film, A Northern Soul, by Hull-born documentary-maker Sean McAllister, is set against the backdrop of 2017, when Hull was city of culture.Established in 2013 by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, the UK city of culture, awarded every four years, aims to bring the kind of social and economic benefits that Liverpool got from being the European capital of culture in 2008, when it welcomed 9.7 million and its economy got a boost of more than £750m.Hull beat competition from Leicester, Dundee and Swansea to become the second city of culture, after Derry in Northern Ireland won the inaugural bid for 2013. Civic leaders in Derry say that five years on, the effects of its year of culture are still being felt. It was an economic success and has transformed the image of the city, although an audit revealed it did not deliver as many jobs as had been predicted.And last December, Coventry was chosen to be the next city of culture – and was handed £8.5m in last month’s budget to help it prepare heritage and cultural buildings ahead of 2021. The team putting together Coventry’s programme is working with grassroots organisations to ensure events are inclusive. “Austerity is still biting hard,” says Martin Sutherland, chief executive of Coventry City of Culture Trust. “The year cannot just be about a big celebratory arts festival.” As well as tracking the economic impact of the year, Coventry’s team will be analysing the social impact, including on wellbeing, isolation, loneliness and mental health.Hull’s winning bid focused on “a city coming out of the shadows”. Hopes were high for its year as a cultural hub and the potential to transform lives – more than one in three children in the city live in poverty and it is one of England’s 20 most deprived areas. Although the city of culture title does not automatically confer any monetary gain, as a result of becoming city of culture, Hull received £8.5m from the government, £3m from Arts Council England and more than £10m in lottery funding including £3m from the Heritage Lottery Fund to support its programme of events.On the face of it, Hull has reaped the benefits: its year as city of culture attracted more than 5 million people to its events and led to 800 new jobs and almost £220m investment in culture and tourism. “I knew that the city of culture would make Hull really proud,” says Arnott. “The first week was amazing, with thousands of people on the streets crying, cheering, laughing. It raised the pride in our people.”Katy Fuller, an executive producer who helped organise Hull UK City of Culture 2017, now creative director and chief executive of Absolutely Cultured, the organisation running the city’s legacy events, says nine out of 10 residents had been involved in an event during the year – either attending, participating or volunteering.Audiences from the city’s most deprived areas were included in a number of different ways, and performances did not just take place in the city centre. The city of culture organisers, Fuller says, worked with schools, shopping centres and social clubs to put performances in the heart of communities – and one of the year’s showpiece events, the Land of Green Ginger, was presented in six neighbourhoods beyond the city centre. One of the city of culture legacy programmes is supporting theatre companies and artists living and working in Hull, she adds.Yet while Arnott’s Beats Bus colleague Dave Okwesia agrees that the events raised Hull’s profile and brought in both visitors and new businesses to the city centre, he says that the benefits were not felt so much in outlying areas or among grassroots artists. While A Northern Soul is a story about Hull’s year in the cultural spotlight, it’s also a powerful counterblast to the “poverty porn” of TV programmes such as Channel 4’s Benefits Street. Arnott is shown juggling his efforts to get his Beats Bus project on the road with an arduous job in a warehouse, struggling to make ends meet as his debts mount. “In the media, political and national discourse there has been an increase in negative depictions of poverty,” says Campbell Robb, chief executive of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, which part-funded the film. “It became obvious to us that we could not change laws and policies without addressing those attitudes.”Although the film focuses on Arnott, the story it tells of in-work poverty is one faced by growing numbers of people, with one in eight of the UK workforce (3.7 million people) living in poverty. “This film will resonate with everybody who watches it because this is the reality of lots of people’s lives,” says Robb. “While it tells the story of one man, it tells the story of a generation of people.”McAllister says his film is having a zeitgeist moment. Since its premiere at Sheffield documentary festival in June, Arnott and McAllister have travelled nationwide, speaking at dozens of screenings – often the film has been shown alongside Ken Loach’s drama I, Daniel Blake. The documentary will be shown to MPs this month and it is being aired on BBC2 on 18 November.Back in Hull, Arnott has secured £11,500 from crowdfunding to run the Beats Bus as a social enterprise, enabling him to give up his warehouse job and to focus full-time, with four colleagues, on running music, performance and art workshops for young people around the city.“The original idea, which we want to go back to, is approaching communities and estates where kids are knocking about on the streets because they’ve got nothing better to do,” he says. “We want to give them something better to do, give them a bit of advice and maybe stop them getting in trouble, messing about and maybe breaking the law. Youth clubs have been cut – we can be a travelling youth club.”And his ultimate aim is to take the Beats Bus project beyond Hull. “We want to branch out to take it wherever people want it,” he says. “If it works well, it can work well anywhere.”A Northern Soul will be shown on BBC2 at 10pm on 18 November"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63d71215f13931b7855e62de2ff725769a0ffda3/0_353_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea3003b9f015584ab303041cf6dc8d16","title":"shut out society young londoners un poverty envoy philip alston","story":"Philip Alston hears about overcrowded housing and the lure of crime on his austerity tourA tide of gentrification is rising around the Bollo Brook youth centre in Acton, an area of west London troubled by gang problems and poverty. New flats costing up to £675,000 ring the centre’s temporary cabins, which more new homes will soon sweep away.Unlike at least 81 other youth projects doomed by council cuts in the capital since 2012, the Bollo is not closing for good but will squeeze into a smaller space at the base of one of the new builds.Being squeezed is a familiar theme for the young people who come here. They squeeze into overcrowded housing, their finances are squeezed through welfare cuts and their will to do the right thing is squeezed by peer pressure to get rich by any means necessary, including criminality.The Bollo’s users – some homeless, others escaping from gang life – look up at the new flats knowing they have no hope of affording one. It is yet another sign to them they are being shut out of British society before they are even fully into adulthood.A dozen of these people spent two hours this week at an event organised by the Equality Trust, spelling out the reality of their lives in one of the richest cities in the world to the United Nations rapporteur on extreme poverty, Philip Alston, who will on Friday deliver his verdict on what he found during a two-week mission to Britain.Their analysis drew connections between the pressure of consumer culture (“I know people whose families are using food banks and they are wearing Balenciaga caps”), the lure of criminality (“it’s hard to stay focused”), and the prohibitive cost of university (“how are we supposed to be able to afford that?”). Add to that collapsing mental health and suspicion of institutional racism and it was an instructive session for Alston’s inquiry into the impact of austerity in the UK.They described for Alston a glass ceiling – toughened by class attitudes and sometimes race – through which they feel they cannot break. But the standout issue was clear when Alston asked what they wanted from a youth centre.Several answered straight back: “Space.” Domestic overcrowding – a function of London’s budget-busting rents and chronic shortage of social housing – is often the first domino to fall when the chaos of poverty begins.“If people don’t have enough space at home, you need to be outside and you are exposed to the big world and all sorts of people and pick up bad habits,” said Sahra Roble, 19, from south Acton. “Anyone offering them a way of making money, they will take it. That’s why I think drugs and crime are on the increase. The way the system is set up continuously allows the gap between rich and poor to constantly keep getting bigger.”Hashim Mohamed, 16, from Harrow, told Alston that overcrowding led him eventually to gang life. He was one of five members of his family living in a two-bedroom flat, with no internet connection.“Home was crowded and wasn’t a good place to be,” he said. If he was not sleeping he went out and was in the neighbourhood and on the streets and eventually became involved in criminality.Tayah, 19, told Alston: “Housing is the main source of stability for humans and when it is taken away or disrupted it affects your mental health, your social life, your education.”Zahra Alipour, 18, from Ealing, said: “We want to be able to afford things but how do you go about that? You can’t go to university. The courses that were £1k are now £9k a year. How are we supposed to be able to afford that?” Poverty, she agreed, was not only keeping people out of housing, it was fostering crime.Ibrahim, 16, described gang culture as “a trap”. Resisting its embrace gets harder “as you get older and you see your family with no money, and you’ve got bailiffs coming to your house and you see your parents stressed.” A life of crime often starts, he said, simply because “you need to buy a meal”. He has been offered a place at a London university, but faces £40,000 in debt if he goes. He is watching his peers “looking for their ways”.The search for better housing brings people into contact with a welfare system that seems to incentivise giving up on trying to build up education or a career, Tayah explained.“During the 12 months I was made homeless. I was 18 and the council said I was not a priority. I was struggling with depression and anxiety and juggling work,” she said. “I was told that if I stop work and have a baby I would be more likely to get housing.”A friend added: “The system makes you dependent. The more you make, the more they take.” She was referring to the system at a YMCA hostel where rent is linked to how much they earned in previous months.They cannot afford to buy a home, or even consider saving for one, so splashing out on designer clothes is another way of achieving status. It means people in £150 Nike tracksuits might still be relying on food banks. Getting the money to pay for the clothes can encourage crime.“There’s that sort of expectation that you’re wearing the same things and look a certain way,” Ziya, 17, said. “If you’re wearing old things that’s not on the latest trend, people really do look down on you. It’s almost as if other people’s opinions are more important than anything else. It’s about self-esteem.”“If there wasn’t constant pressure to keep up, there would be less crime,” said Aiysha, 16.This group had not experienced a powerful person listening to them before. As Alston wound up the meeting, with a half-joking apology that it had to be an old white man who would carry their message to government, the group agreed to seek a meeting at parliament to tell someone, anyone in power what is happening in their lives."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/343691235bd1e2d5746468eec068c623cf82d68a/506_5_4894_2937/master/4894.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=147a44f413f4f2091273a18abb9ce03e","title":"european tour keith pelley rory mcilroy golf","story":"It seemed especially cruel that such a sharp blow to the morale of the European Tour was delivered in Dubai. It was at this venue two years ago that Keith Pelley launched the Rolex Series, a set of lucrative events heralded as “one of the most significant advancements in the tour’s 44 years”.The chief executive’s underlying concept was simple: to keep Europe’s best players in Europe, thereby away from the bright lights of the PGA Tour. That Pelley’s pipe dream was illustrated at the Ryder Cup, as a European team united by PGA Tour membership trounced the Americans.It is to Pelley’s credit that Rory McIlroy has not completely ruled out retaining European Tour status in 2019 but the decision of the Northern Irishman, by far his native tour’s most valuable asset, to focus on the United States is still noteworthy. McIlroy owes the European Tour nothing which will not prevent the business feeling the pinch from the removal of a participant who moves the needle in this continent like no other.If McIlroy is unhappy at the payment of huge appearance sums – by sponsors, not the tour – to leading American players for the European Tour’s visit to Abu Dhabi in January, he would not be alone. The notion of showcasing the best of European golf appears undermined by such a commercial scenario, not least with Abu Dhabi now a Rolex Series event.Justin Rose’s unwillingness to break from equipment testing to participate in this week’s DP World Tour Championship is another headache Pelley can do without. Paul Casey has joined his fellow-Englishman in skipping the European Tour’s season finale. A comparable situation is unthinkable as the PGA Tour’s FedEx play-offs conclude each year in Atlanta.“This year on the schedule, I think there are 4,382 playing opportunities, which is a little up from last year but it’s five or six hundred more playing opportunities than a couple of years ago. And as a members’ organisation, that’s key, providing opportunities for people. We’re thrilled with the media value and we’re thrilled with what the Rolex Series has brought to the tour.”There are noteworthy sub-plots. The European Tour’s decision to hold an event in Saudi Arabia in 2019 raised eyebrows over human rights issues, but the matter became even more controversial after the death of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Perhaps golf should not be moral arbiters when deciding where to host competitions but this appears an extreme case of following money against an unsatisfactory backdrop.Dustin Johnson and Patrick Reed have accepted huge appearance fees to play in the Saudi Arabia tournament, which Pelley insists will remain on the schedule. “There are so many other places they could play,” bemoaned one high-profile European Tour player this week.But perhaps there aren’t. The lack of support for mainstream events in Europe was emphasised again as the British Masters recently found itself without a title sponsor. Tommy Fleetwood duly stepped forward to host the tournament next year, a wonderful gesture but one which says little for the European Tour’s broader appeal.The turbulent backdrop matters little to Francesco Molinari. The Italian need only keep Fleetwood at bay - Molinari holds an advantage of more than €1m as things stand - over four days at the Earth Course to win the European order of merit for the first time.“I would have never guessed that I would be here in this position if you told me in April or May this year, but it’s been an incredible summer topped by an unbelievable Ryder Cup,” said Molinari. “Really, it’s a dream season for me, and it’s nice to be here in this position. Hopefully I’ll be able to close it out. I know it’s not going to be easy, and I’m not making any assumptions, but I’ll do my best on the course to do the job.“I’m not the kind of guy that shows up for an event and thinks, ‘I want to win this week.’ My mental process is more about showing up to the event, I need to do this and this and this to play well, I need to go and play shot by shot and round by round. I usually don’t get too far ahead of myself.“I’ll go out Sunday morning and do my best and if Tommy wins, fair play to him. He’s had a great season so far, and to win here, it would make him the deserving winner of the Race to Dubai.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c59e6f018d37006a65340f64d2abf6a6d18947e5/0_46_5584_3350/master/5584.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1fb7863743c23e58f07ed5a6c3a6325","title":"rugby enron ben ryan fiji","story":"Fiji’s gold-medal winning sevens coach is unhappy with the direction he believes the game is moving in – from the treatment of tier-two nations to laws being overlooked by refereesIf you love rugby union what follows will be a tough read. According to one of the world’s leading coaches, however, the time has come for the sport to get real. “If rugby were a company people would be comparing it to an Enron,” says Ben Ryan, Fiji’s Olympic gold-medal winning sevens mastermind. “It’s completely dysfunctional.”Ryan’s charge sheet is long and chilling. With Japan set to visit Twickenham this weekend he says tier-two nations continue to be treated with almost feudal disregard, that the sport’s law-book is being wilfully ignored and that skilful players are becoming disillusioned with where 15-a-side rugby is heading. Central to it all, he believes, is the selfish decision-making of certain stakeholders which is steering the global game into deeply worrying territory.Take smaller nations like Fiji, forever close to Ryan’s heart, and Japan. The latter’s amateur players are being paid just £13.64 (2,000 yen) per day this week to represent their country and will receive not a penny of the vast Twickenham gate receipts. “It’s not far off slave labour,” insists Ryan, who had to dig into his own pocket early in his Fiji tenure to fill the team bus with petrol and buy bottled water for his squad. “If you are playing somewhere where the crowd is over a certain figure you should get some of the money. At the moment it’s a case of ‘We’ll fly you over and give you a nice few days in the Lensbury Club but that’s where it stops.’”The imminent announcement of a new Test structure – potentially a world league which would see the top-10 nations all play against each other, a grand final between the top-two sides plus promotion and relegation – will not solve everything. As well as more money, Ryan argues better quality preparation is critical. “Quite a few people were critical of Fiji in Scotland on Saturday but they’ve had no time together. They and Samoa have players playing on almost every continent. You can’t prepare in four or five days having played a club game the previous week.”Short of a Pacific island-based team being admitted to Super Rugby, World Rugby transforming their funding models or the Test window for tier-two nations being widened, the gulf will remain. Ryan is even angrier about the dangerous ruck clear-outs he says referees are being told to overlook. “There’s so much grey in the lawbook. There are at least three laws – collapsing rucks, not staying on your feet wilfully and shoulders below your hips – we just ignore. I think it’s incredibly dangerous. Almost every weekend now there’s something. How do we expect teams, players and supporters to understand our game when we’ve got all this going on?”Without a wholesale rethink, Ryan can see huge icebergs ahead. “I am genuinely concerned. I’m seeing these boys getting bigger and more physical and they’re getting smashed up on a more regular basis. Even kids at under-14 level are getting smashed at breakdowns. Never mind Brexit, we’ll just get the tackle-shield manufacturers to up production. I went to one county age-group finals day and there were yellow pads everywhere. I didn’t see any long passing skills, it was just boom, boom, boom.“The school kids are looking at what the top players are doing. At the moment the perception is that the way to win professional games is through blunt-force trauma, winning ruck after ruck and going through 20 or 30 phases. In every single ruck there’s something going on. In the Top 14 the referees are being told: ‘Don’t even bother refereeing the breakdown, just see what happens.’ At the moment it’s just a mess. They’ve let it run away with itself.“We need people to start saying: ‘What is this going to look like in 20 years’ time?’ Do we want a more skill-based game that involves being on our feet more and requires tactics and technique over brawn and brute strength? If that’s our end goal, let’s look at our laws. Players who are just finishing their careers are already saying: ‘This isn’t fun.’ I’m thinking: ‘These guys are twice the size of me 20 years ago.’ What happens if that happens again in the next 20 years? Will they be wearing helmets? Or will something else have to happen?”If only there were more prominent figures up on the barricades with the sharply-intelligent Ryan. He is in increasing demand, involved with, among others, UK Sport, the French Rugby Federation and a charity currently doing research into knife crime, but the 47-year-old’s deep concern for rugby’s future still burns. “I don’t think people are looking at the full picture. You can’t put a number on everything but we know the game is going in the wrong direction. There are still too many stakeholders and too many invested decisions. They need some independent consultants to say: ‘This is what is best for the game.’”If not, let us pray it does not take a fatality in a high-profile Test to bring everyone to their senses. “I don’t mind being militant about this,” concludes Ryan. “We’re not thinking brightly enough. We’re very reactive and short-termist and people are just protecting themselves. The whole process of trying to make the product better is a broken one.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ff8bba8c500347faf78fbf9dbde2c72a31597c0/0_307_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14e4bc68f35fbeb2e4d31a87677e7670","title":"share your caribbean highlights for the chance to win a 200 hotel voucher","story":"Send us a tip on affordable experiences in the Caribbean, be they places to stay, activities and attractions, or bars and restaurantsPalm-fringed beaches, rum punch and infectious reggae beats … Carnivals, rainforest and a laid-back vibe … The Caribbean is one of the world’s most alluring holiday destinations, and we want to hear your highlights – especially for those not on an A-lister budget.

Donald Trump’s decision to send US troops to the Mexico border came ahead of US midterm congressional elections last week, and critics dismissed the move as a political stunt to drive Republican voters to the polls.But Mattis rejected criticism, saying the mission was justified and “absolutely legal”.“It’s very clear that support to border police or border patrol is necessary right now,” said Mattis, standing alongside the secretary of homeland security, Kirstjen Nielsen.“We determined that the mission was absolutely legal and this was also reviewed by Department of Justice lawyers. It’s obviously a moral and ethical mission to support our border patrolmen,” Mattis said.The visit took Mattis near the Texas town of Donna, where US troops have set up a base camp near a border crossing point with Mexico.Most members of the first migrant caravan are heading towards Tijuana, some 1,200 miles to the north-west of Donna. The first group arrived at the border on Tuesday.Mattis said soldiers were making rapid progress erecting barriers along the border.Mattis said the US military was also rehearsing helicopter operations to help support US border personnel, potentially flying them to new locations if the caravans of migrants shift direction.The deployed US troops are not expected to directly interact with migrants, most are unarmed, and they are only assigned tasks that support US border personnel, including building temporary lodging.Trump’s Democratic opponents have threatened to investigate the matter once they take control of the House of Representatives early next year after gaining a majority in the House in the midterm elections.Representative Bennie Thompson, the top Democrat on the House Committee on Homeland Security, told Reuters that Trump had used the military “as a prop to stoke fear and score political points”.“We will soon be finally able to conduct oversight of this gross abuse and the president’s many failed border security policies,” said Thompson, who is expected to lead the committee when the Democrats take control of the House.Mattis estimated about 5,900 troops were participating in the border mission. The US military has offered a breakdown accounting for 5,600 of them, estimating about 2,800 troops in Texas, 1,500 in Arizona and another 1,300 in California.Asked whether troops’ families should expect their loved ones to remain deployed through Thanksgiving or even Christmas, Mattis declined to speculate.“We are a 365-day-a-year military.

He said he would instruct the jury to focus on the evidence.“Your opening statement handed out a promissory note that your case is not going to cash,” the judge said, calling Lichtman’s opening misleading.In his opening statement on Tuesday, Lichtman told jurors that US prosecutors had dreamed “for decades” of convicting Guzmán, adding: “The world is focusing on this mythical El Chapo figure.”Lichtman told the court his client was not the real leader of a cartel that sent tons of cocaine into the US, and sought to shift blame to Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, another alleged drug trafficker in the cartel’s leadership.Zambada remains on the loose in Mexico, Lichtman claimed, because of bribes that “go up to the very top”, including hundreds of millions of dollars paid to the current and former presidents of Mexico.“This is a case that will require you to throw out much of what you were taught to believe in about the way governments work and how they behave, governments in South and Central America and Mexico and even the United States,” Lichtman told the jurors. “This is a case which will require you to open your minds to the possibility that government officials at the very highest level can be bribed, can conspire to commit horrible crimes – that American law enforcement agents can also be crooked.”A spokesman for the Mexican president, Enrique Peña Nieto, called the allegations “completely false and defamatory”. Former president Felipe Calderón dismissed them as “absolutely false and reckless”.Guzmán, who has been held in solitary confinement since his extradition to the United States early last year, has pleaded not guilty to charges that he amassed a multibillion-dollar fortune smuggling tons of cocaine and other drugs in a vast supply chain that reached well north of the border.Lichtman resumed his opening statement on Wednesday, describing “the myth of El Chapo” as “very strong”. He said law enforcement agents had his client autograph $100 bills for them upon his arrest.“Mr Guzmán was somebody who enjoyed the publicity,” Lichtman told the jury. “He enjoyed the notoriety.”The defense attorney also described the government’s witnesses as liars seeking to mitigate their own jail sentences.“These are people who have lied every day,” he said. “They’re here because they want to get out of jail by any means necessary.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2681aed65968dea793f68990a1141e90fcf9f580/0_537_3712_2227/master/3712.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2cda6dcc6ec58d3f34a957be439af03b","title":"woman on trial over child found in squalid car boot in france","story":"Partner and sister of accused say they had no idea she had given birth to fourth childRelatives of a woman who hid her baby in the maggot-infested boot of a car have said they had no idea of her secret, during a trial that has drawn horror in France.Rosa-Maria Da Cruz, 50, is accused of keeping her daughter Séréna hidden away until she was nearly two, leaving her with serious learning disabilities.Séréna was discovered in 2013 in the filthy boot of a Peugeot 307 and had also been kept in an unused room at the family home in the Corrèze region of central France.It was a mechanic who found her in the boot after Da Cruz, who is originally from Portugal, had taken the car to be repaired. Hearing a noise, he opened the boot to discover the baby in a car seat, naked, filthy and dehydrated. She was surrounded by maggots and excrement.The trial, which opened on Monday, has heard testimony from relatives about how Da Cruz was, to all appearances, a model mother to her three other children.Her partner, Domingos Sampaio Alves, has said he had no idea she had given birth to another child and she had kept it a secret. By way of explanation, he said he went only about once a month to the small ground-floor room, under renovation, where Da Cruz kept the baby much of the time. He also did not visit the car often as he does not have a driving licence.“I don’t know why she did this,” he told the court in Portuguese through a translator.The unemployed bricklayer was originally charged, but investigators concluded there was no reason to doubt his account. Da Cruz was released pending trial, and the couple have stayed together. “I continue to live with her because she is a good mother to the children,” Alves told the court.They have kept their three older children – aged nine, 14 and 15 – but authorities have refused to let them have contact with Serena, who is now aged seven and living with foster parents.In her opening testimony on Monday, Da Cruz fought back tears and told the court: “It’s very hard to be confronted with reality, with the damage I have done.”Séréna now suffers from severe mental impairments including irreversible autism, which medical experts have linked to sensory deprivation during her early months.A paediatrician who examined Séréna and her siblings after the discovery said her team had been “stupefied” by “the gulf between Séréna’s situation and those of her brothers and sisters”, who appeared to have been “perfectly raised”.“You could see she had been a good mother, and we could not understand why Séréna had not received the same quality of care at home,” the doctor said.The judge Gilles Fonrouge said that while the child was now in good physical health, she was “closed off to interactions around her”.Marie-Pierre Peis-Hitier, a lawyer for the social services, said the child could say only a handful of words, and it had taken a full afternoon to win the child’s trust.Da Cruz’s sister and nieces also said they had no idea of Séréna’s existence, and said Da Cruz was a “loving” mother to the other children.“Inside I think she is suffering. She knows what she has done,” her niece Elodie told the court.The court heard that Da Cruz had initially hidden the pregnancies of two of her other children from her partner, not wanting to face reality.Da Cruz is charged with violence against a minor and could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted. The trial continues."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Schoolchildren admit to seeing parents using mobile phones while drivingPrime minister says agreement will give UK \u0026lsquocontrol of our money, laws and borders\u0026rsquoProperties could lose up to 2m of front gardens to clear the way for first high-speed bus routeGarda\u0026iacute are investigating after a container reportedly fell on a worker in RingsendCold weather strategy includes 203 permanent and 130 \u0026lsquotemporary contingency\u0026rsquo bedsNorth Wicklow Educate Together Secondary School says students are being affected by uncertain futureD\u0026aacuteil hears crime warning amid discussion of the escalating violence in DroghedaLutyens\u0026rsquos design as part of his Irish National War Memorial Gardens has March deadlineShirley O\u0026rsquoConnell told garda\u0026iacute there was no excuse for what she had done to house bound womanHealth body says it needed to act because of low consent rate to review by UK collegeYoung people, environmental organisations, and others address TDs and SenatorsF\u0026oacutersa union warns other health staff will seek more money if wishes of nurses grantedCiaran MacAirt claimed appointment was unlawful because he was not, it was alleged, an appropriate person to serve as Garda CommissionerHalf a million patients do not attend their appointment each year, committee hearsLaw Reform Commission conference hears of challenges and opportunities from BrexitNational Disability Authority should get powers to monitor and enforce access for people with disabilities, report saysZambian-native Kashimbo Musonda denies allegations of poor professional performanceAccused threatened to report victim to garda\u0026iacute for sending texts to a fictitious underage relative unless he handed over moneyDesmond Duffy (70) has pleaded not guilty to murdering Desmond Sullivan in RathminesJohn McClean (73) accused of carrying out assaults at the school between 1973 and 1989"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3697738.1542216581!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"radiographer treated as if she had just come out of the bush","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tKashimbo Musonda told a fitness to practise hearing on Wednesday that  she would never expose a patient to unnecessary radiation. File photograph: iStockA radiographer has described how she was shocked at suggestions that she could not identify an elbow from a knee on a X-ray scan.Zambian-native Kashimbo Musonda said she was treated as somebody “who had just come out of the bush” and had just decided to read X-ray scans.Ms Musonda was dismissed from her post as a radiographer at University Hospital Waterford on March 10th last year after just two and a half weeks in the post.She is facing five separate allegations of poor professional performance and professional misconduct including a failure to display the skills or knowledge to practice safely. It is the first such fitness to practise inquiry conducted by Coru, the body regulating health and social care professionals.Speaking for the first time at the inquiry, an emotional Ms Musonda said the allegation that she did not know a knee from an elbow had appeared in the Irish media.It had caused her distress, brought a lot of sadness, her friends were surprised and her family was affected by the suggestion.Ms Musonda said if she did not know the different parts of the body, she would have failed first year anatomy at college.“Some of the allegations that were brought against me was that I had zero knowledge of basic radiography like somebody who just came out of the bush and pretended to be a radiographer,” she said.“That’s how it sounds to me. It’s like I knew nothing about radiography.”She said the allegation was “demeaning” to her and she had been a radiographer of good standing for many years.Ms Musonda said she studied radiography in Zambia for three years and qualified in 2005. In 2006 she applied for a job in Ireland and got a letter of validation to work in Ireland in September of that year.She began work in Waterford on February 20th, 2017 and was relieved of her duties on March 10th.She described suggestions that she had over-exposed some X-rays as “very wrong and false”. She also denied not positioning patients properly for scans and said she always triple checked the identification of patients as per the protocols before proceeding.Ms Musonda faced criticism at a previous hearing for allowing the mother of a young child to be exposed to radiation without lead protection three times during one screening episode.The incident occurred on March 8th, 2017 on the last day that she worked at the hospital. She described it as the “worst day ever” for her.Ms Musonda said she would never expose a patient to unnecessary radiation. She had placed the mother behind a control panel out of harm’s way while she was scanning the woman’s 12-year-old child, but the mother had entered the room while she was carrying out her work.“I don’t recall at what point she left the control panel because I was busy doing my X-rays. I was not happy at all,” she told the Coru fitness-to-practise hearing.Ms Musonda said she spoke to a colleague Fiona Phelan who told her that “these things happen” and she should fill out an incident report.She criticised the manner in which she was dismissed saying that she got a two line statement from the hospital’s human relations (HR) department which was short on detail.The hearing continues on Thursday."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3697705.1542213704!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the brexit deal what we know so far","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t A demonstrator holds a sign outside the Houses of Parliament in  London on Tuesday. Photograph: Daniel Leal-OlivasAFPGetty ImagesThe draft EU-UK withdrawal agreement, running to 400 pages, is the text of a legally binding treaty that seals the terms under which the UK leaves the EU. Its provisions, defining outstanding obligations and establishing a transition period in which both sides can adjust, range from iding up common property, securing the rights of each others’ citizens “left behind” and agreeing a departure bill or alimony for the UK. And, crucially, a special protocol on Northern Ireland provides a backstop guarantee that will safeguard Ireland’s soft border, guarantees continued security co-operation, protects the Common Travel Area and safeguards both human rights and the 50-odd cross-Border programmes that have come out of the Belfast Agreement. Safeguarding the Belfast Agreement is explicitly provided for.The agreement will now have to be ratified by member states, the European Council, the European Parliament and the UK parliament before Britain leaves the EU on March 29th.In the months ahead the two sides will start to negotiate a treaty on their future relationship, focusing largely trade relations, a relationship that has beeb sketched out in a draft common political declaration that will be approved, but without binding force, at the same time as the withdrawal agreement.The withdrawal agreement provides that Britain will honour all its financial commitments to Brussels under an agreed formula which is widely but conservatively estimated to put the bill at some €40 billion. London will continue to pay into the EU budget during transition until the end of 2020 as if still a member.The agreement maintains the existing EU residence and social security rights of more than three million EU citizens in the UK, and about one million UK nationals living on the continent.The settlement allows an EU national to claim permanent residence in the UK, retain most family reunion rights enjoyed today and, if eligible, to claim UK benefits even if they or their children move overseas. Protecting those rights, the UK promises to pay “due regard” to the jurisprudence and rulings of the Court of Justice of the European Union. But the UK will not be bound by it.The treaty provides for a transition period for the UK until the end of 2020, which can be extended for an unspecified one-off period, set by mutual agreement. During this period Britain would leave the political institutions of the EU, losing its say over rules and decisions. But it would continue to apply EU law in full. Little will change for businesses and citizens during that period.And during that time the future relationship agreement will be negotiated.In the Northern Ireland protocol the backstop is safeguarded by agreement that the UK will remain in a temporary all-UK customs union while also applying extra regulatory controls between it and Northern Ireland. The UK also makes unilateral promises to minimise ergence with Northern Ireland by adhering to EU single market rules for goods, so keeping open the flow of trade to the UK.While Northern Ireland will apply the full “union customs code”, which sets the border for the free movement of goods within the EU, the UK would apply a more basic customs union model. This would avoid the need for tariffs, quotas and rules of origin in UK-EU trade.To ensure a “level playing field” for business, the UK commits to follow EU competition rules and promises to keep some existing laws on labour, environment and taxation. A joint committee will agree when the conditions permit the backstop to lapse. Trade in fish is excluded from the customs union."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

Even if you don’t have to go to work (on Sunday ), with people of working age holding down a job, people just want a rest. “Which is why some churches are moving to have more activities mid-week. I think we need to be more flexible around that.”Another way the Church is trying to reach its increasingly fragmented flock is via social media. For instance the Church’s Royal Wedding prayer and videos for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were watched more than five million times online.The figures also showed that Christmas services were enjoying a resurgence as last year more people attended than in any year since 2007. Festive worshipers grew further to their largest number in a decade to 2.68 million in 2017, a yearly increase of 3.4 percent.Combined with figures for special services in churches during the Advent period, including carol services, there were nearly eight million attendances over the festive season.Rt Rev Walker said he felt Christmas’s rising popular was partly due to people feeling they could connect with their faith without the pressure of having to attend weekly.He said: “One of the big things with Christmas is it doesn’t have to have a long sermon, it can be about the hymns, the traditional readings, the lights.“My mother-in-law was always scared to go to church in her village as she thought she would be expected to go the next week. At Christmas you can go with a lot of other people and the vicar won’t be banging on your door the next Sunday.”Church of EnglandPlease review our commenting policyBrexit deal latest news: Theresa May wins Cabinet backing for plan and warns it\u0026#39s her deal, \u0026#39no deal or no Brexit at all\u0026#39Libya to extradite brother of Manchester bomber \u0026#39by end of year\u0026#39Comment: The PM\u0026#39s deal is a stitch-up that doesn\u0026#39t have a hope in hell of getting through ParliamentKosovo president says no ethnic land swap as Serbia peace deal stallsBrexit deal: What is it and what happens next? X-ray images show tools Khahoggi killers brought to Istanbul, Turkish paper claimsIrish protests cry \u0026#39underwear is not consent\u0026#39 after teenager\u0026#39s thong used in rape trial Comment: Beware Prime Minister, letting the EU fracture the United Kingdom is bad for us allDonald Trump argues in court he can ban CNN\u0026#39s Jim Acosta from the White House The 10 groups of MPs in the House of Commons Theresa May must deal with to get her plan passedPrivate school pupils are being recruited by county lines drug gangs, official report warnsTheresa May leads tributes to Prince Charles on his 70th BirthdayComment: Animal-sourced foods vital to combating malnutrition and stunting in the developing worldEU countries will press home their advantage in Brexit talks and demand even more concessionsOne in 10 countries have adequate protection against a \u0026#39catastrophic\u0026#39 biological eventLow-carb dieters can lose more than 1.5 stone over three years, study claimsComment: Businesspeople must shun Mrs May\u0026#39s disastrous Brexit deal - we can do much better without itHundreds of migrants from caravan group reach US borderWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/11/14/TELEMMGLPICT000164963196_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqMNXAjrQuC5hshkZY4lLDITLc2RSN87h2tEpyeVqDDtY.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"italys populist coalition defiant big spending budget plans","story":"Italy and the EU are at loggerheads over Rome\u0026#39s extravagant 2019 budget plans Italy’s populist government defiantly refused to bow to EU demands to change its big-spending budget for next year, with interior minister Matteo Salvini declaring on Wednesday: “We won’t budge a millimetre.”Rome now faces the threat of financial penalties being applied by the European Commission as the stand-off with Brussels intensifies, amid fears that Italy that could spark a eurozone crisis that would dwarf the one that engulfed Greece.In a first for the EU, the Commission rejected the budget last month, saying that it represented an “unprecedented deviation” from the bloc’s spending rules.Italy was told to go back to the drawing board and come up with a revised budget, but the text sent to Brussels late on Tuesday was little different from the original.The coalition, made up of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement and the populist, nationalist League, is in no mood to compromise and knows that bashing Brussels goes down well with many voters, as European Parliament elections loom in May.“We’re working on a budget that will guarantee jobs, greater rights to pensions and less taxes for many Italians. If Europe likes it, we’ll be happy, but if not we’ll plough on regardless,” said Mr Salvini, who is also deputy prime minister. “I can assure you, we will not budge a millimetre.”Projecting an image of resolution and vigour, he was photographed going for a run around central Rome on Tuesday evening, before a meeting of the cabinet.A staunch supporter of the armed forces and the security services, he wore an Italian police polo shirt for his jog.The coalition wants to spend billions on rolling back pension reforms, introducing lower tax rates and guaranteeing a minimum monthly income for poor and unemployed Italians.The government also said it is having to deal with the cost of recent disasters, including storms and flooding that killed more than 30 people last month and the collapse of a motorway bridge in Genoa in August.Brussels says that with a debt pile of €2.3 trillion, or 131 per cent of its GDP, the country cannot afford such extravagance, and spending must be drastically reduced.The EU disagrees with the figures provided by the Italian coalition, forecasting that the deficit will exceed three percent in 2020, which would breach the bloc’s spending limits.Brussels is also skeptical of the coalition’s economic growth forecasts, saying that growth is likely to be 1.2 per cent rather than the 1.5 per cent confidently predicted by the government.Luigi Di Maio, the head of the Five Star Movement, said that spending big was the only way to drag Italy – the third largest economy in the euro-zone - out of the doldrums.The budget will not change, neither in its balance sheet nor in its growth forecast. We have the conviction that this is the budget needed for the country to get going again,” he said.The Commission has warned that Italy’s refusal to amend its budget could result in the activation of an excessive deficit procedure which may result in financial penalties that could add up to 0.2 per cent of Italy’s GDP, rising to 0.7 per cent if Italy still fails to comply.The procedure could start as early as next week. Brussels has never before fined a country for flouting spending rules.The Commission should be tough with Italy, said Markus Ferber, a German conservative on the European Parliament\u0027s economic and monetary affairs committee.Italy is going for escalation, Mr Ferber said. If the integrity of the EU fiscal rules matter at all for the European Commission, it has to take a tough stance on this provocation.Italy’s deepening rift with Brussels and its refusal to compromise have spooked the markets and alarmed investors.“The conflict between Italy and EU institutions is likely to drag on through early to mid-2019, raising market pressure on the Italian administration,” said Agnese Ortolani, an analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit.“Owing to the €2.3 trillion public debt stock and the weakness of its banking sector, Italy would be too large to rescue without massive ECB support in the event of a large-scale financial crisis.”  Italy\u0026#39s sky-high spending plans are opposed by the European Commission and many EU governments, who fear a new euro-zone crisisAndrus Ansip, European Commission vice-president, said Italy had an obligation to abide by the rules it had signed up to as an EU member state.When you\u0027re in the eurozone family, you have to respect the rules we have given ourselves. Running up debt with taxpayers\u0027 money is not an intelligent idea.”Massimo Franco, an Italian political commentator, said it was “not just the government that has chosen the path of conflict. The EU seems to be determined to accept the challenge and is convinced that it can win with the support of the majority of other countries.”The battle between Rome and Brussels is “destined to worsen,” he wrote in Corriere della Sera newspaper.The coalition’s spending plans were heavily criticised on Tuesday by the International Monetary Fund, which said that adding to the country’s debt could provoke an economic downturn that would hit the most vulnerable people the hardest.Servicing a huge debt “could transform a slowdown into a recession,” the IMF warned.Please review our commenting policyBrexit deal latest news: Theresa May wins Cabinet backing for plan and warns it\u0026#39s her deal, \u0026#39no deal or no Brexit at all\u0026#39Libya to extradite brother of Manchester bomber \u0026#39by end of year\u0026#39Comment: The PM\u0026#39s deal is a stitch-up that doesn\u0026#39t have a hope in hell of getting through ParliamentKosovo president says no ethnic land swap as Serbia peace deal stallsBrexit deal: What is it and what happens next? X-ray images show tools Khahoggi killers brought to Istanbul, Turkish paper claimsIrish protests cry \u0026#39underwear is not consent\u0026#39 after teenager\u0026#39s thong used in rape trial Church of England sees regular attendance rise but churchgoers struggle to make traditional Sunday servicesComment: Beware Prime Minister, letting the EU fracture the United Kingdom is bad for us allDonald Trump argues in court he can ban CNN\u0026#39s Jim Acosta from the White House The 10 groups of MPs in the House of Commons Theresa May must deal with to get her plan passedPrivate school pupils are being recruited by county lines drug gangs, official report warnsTheresa May leads tributes to Prince Charles on his 70th BirthdayComment: Animal-sourced foods vital to combating malnutrition and stunting in the developing worldEU countries will press home their advantage in Brexit talks and demand even more concessionsOne in 10 countries have adequate protection against a \u0026#39catastrophic\u0026#39 biological eventLow-carb dieters can lose more than 1.5 stone over three years, study claimsComment: Businesspeople must shun Mrs May\u0026#39s disastrous Brexit deal -

By mid-December, one bitcoin was worth close to $20,000 (£15,000), but that was the high water mark before the tide turned.A year later, bitcoin is trading at around a third of its peak value but some cryptocurrency analysts believe the market might be on the verge of mirroring the gains it experienced in late 2017. The only caveat is that it might not be bitcoin that leads the charge this time.Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, who was behind the online retail giant becoming\u0026nbspone of the first places to accept bitcoin back in 2014, said\u0026nbspthat he still expects\u0026nbspthe mass adoption of cryptocurrency, without specifying\u0026nbspwhich one.Speaking to bitcoin enthusiast Naomi Brockwell on her YouTube channel, Mr Byrne said he remained highly sceptical of the traditional financial system. When asked if he saw bitcoin becoming a worldwide currency, he pointed to countries like Venezuela that have experienced significant financial turmoil in recent years.When people start getting into it is when their own financial systems collapse, he said. Whether bitcoin is the one, whether bitcoin has solved its speed problem, or it\u0027s another cryptocurrency, only time will tell.Created with Sketch.Bitcoin\u0027s volatile history in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Satoshi Nakamoto creates the first bitcoin block in 2009On 3 January, 2009, the genesis block of bitcoin appeared.

So at this stage, it’s difficult to predict exactly what will happen.Looking longer term, Mr Ostler said bitcoin is expected to experience steady growth over the next year, with the panel of experts predicting an average\u0026nbspvalue of $16,732 by the end of 2019. “With bitcoin being very stable and within a range between $6,800 and $6,100, it is hard to suggest anything will change until it breaks this range, said cryptocurrency trader Craig Cobb, who forms part of the panel.leveled out in recent months (CoinMarketCap)But if it\u0027s not bitcoin, a\u0026nbsphint at what this next break-out cryptocurrency might be was given earlier this week by Blockchain, the world\u0027s most popular bitcoin wallet.

Nomos was established in Glashütte in 1990 by Roland\u0026nbspSchwertner, a fashion photographer and computer scientist from West Germany, and now employs 300 people from 20 nations.Italy far-right government offers land to parents who have third childFar-right parties overtake Macron for first time in France pollMI5 agents to take lead in fight against far-right extremism“Glashütte as we know it today would simply not have been possible without the reunification of Germany, and without the freedom and democracy that brought,” says Uwe Ahrendt, chief executive. “Furthermore, we have employees that need our protection those that the far right would claim \u0027don’t belong here\u0027. But we know that they do.”Ahrendt became the chief executive of\u0026nbspNomos in 2000. The company was shocked to discover\u0026nbspthat in the 2017 federal elections, over a third of Glashütte residents had voted for the far right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.\u0026nbspSince spring 2018, Nomos has worked with Open Saxony, a Government-funded programme, to provide free workshops and training to its employees where they\u0026nbspcheck the accuracy of right-wing views and provide emotional support to staff. Ahrendt says: “We realised that we need to position ourselves clearly and publicly in support of our democratic political system.”Glashütte in East Germany is known as mini-Switzerland for its thriving watchmaking industry (Courtesy Photo)German businesses have another good reason embrace ersity: the country will be short of 3 million workers by 2020, according to a 2017 report by Prognos, an economic research institute, worsening to a shortage of 3.3 million by 2040 as the native population ages.\u0026nbspSkilled migrants are being seen as a way to plug the gaps. A new immigration law, introduced on October 2, aims to attract more workers from countries outside the EU. Steffen Kampeter, chief executive of the Confederation of German Employers\u0027 Associations has said Germany’s international competitiveness depends upon “qualified workers from abroad”.The state is funding efforts to improve ersity in German businesses who may not have considered hiring migrants in the past. At a recent meeting organised by Netzwerk Courage, a network that promotes democracy, business leaders, trade union representatives and groups working with migrants came together to discuss how they can improve ersity in East German businesses.Petra Köpping, the minister for integration in Saxony, said that for years, East Germany has not worked towards making the workforce more erse. Over time, it has fallen behind. Now it needs to work even harder to catch up. Petra Köpping herself employs 45 staff – 18 of which come from overseas.Marlis Straessner-Lacroix\u0026nbspis from the organisation Willkommon in Lobtau, which has been helping asylum seekers in the Lobtau district of Dresden since 2014. She said that in many cases, businesses show a lack of interest in employing migrants, even when approached by organisations who have the resources to help.Nomos employs 300 people from 20 nations (Courtesy Photo)Glashütte is not your average East German town. It exports tens of thousands of luxury watches every year from 10 high-end watchmakers, some of which sell timepieces for millions of pounds. The industry started in the mid-1800s, when Ferdinand Adolph Lange enlisted financial support from local nobility to start manufacturing watches as means to employ impoverished local people.Like all East Germany industries, Glashütte\u0027s watch factories were taken over by\u0026nbspthe Soviet-supported East German state after the Second World War. When this regime collapsed, many workers fled to the West. Whole towns were hollowed out. Glashütte was revived in part by incomers like Walter Lange, the great-grandson of Ferdinand, who returned from the West to revive old brands alongside new ones, like Nomos.Many other East German towns never experienced the same renaissance. Even today, East Germans are still paid less than West Germans and work longer hours. The average annual gross wage in the former East German states is €30,172, almost €5,000 less than in states in the former West Germany, according to official data provided to\u0026nbspthe socialist Left party.For some, a sense of injustice has hardened into a fear of the outsider since Chancellor Angela Merkel welcomed migrants to Germany in 2015. Ahrendt says far-right riots in the nearby town of Chemnitz\u0026nbspin August\u0026nbsphave\u0026nbspmade the company’s efforts to promote democracy seem even more essential: “We wanted to set a precedent, because an intolerant, racist atmosphere will not be permitted at Nomos\u0026nbspGlashütte.”Some businesses and organisations have reported that since the AfD has gained more support in elections, the number of applicants from overseas has decreased. Dr Michael Genkin, the leader of a visitors programme that welcomes international scientists to the Max Planck research institute in Dresden, says that after 2015, Saxony became less attractive for workers of all kinds. “We indeed had the impression of a decreasing number of applicants at our institute around the time of those political developments in Saxony, and in Dresden specifically,” he says, noting that the number of applicants was too small to draw a statistical conclusion.Ahrendt says events in Chemnitz and elsewhere have shown the world a darker side to German politics that it is up to responsible businesses to counter.“My company is concerned about this image,” he says. “We want to show that there is a brighter side to Germany, especially in Saxony. When you are close by, Chemnitz is just a little place in Germany but when you are far away, it represents all of Germany.”10 best watches for menThe workshops at Nomos are booked out until the end of the year. “That is great news, especially since they are voluntary and take place within work hours,” Ahrendt says. “From our point of view, everyone should work to protect freedom and democracy—and perhaps even more so in Saxony, since it was something that we fought for in 1989.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

At this biennial event, the participating companies exhibit their latest service robotic technologies and componentsThe robot developed by Seed Solutions sings and dances to music during the Japan Robot Week 2016 at Tokyo Big SightThe traffic misdirection, known as a border gateway protocol (BGP) hijacking, lasted for around an hour and a half on Monday evening, ending at around 10.30pm GMT.ThousandEyes\u0026nbspexecutive Alex Henthorn-Iwane\u0026nbspsaid it was the worst incident affecting Google traffic that his firm had ever seen. He also speculated that the hijacking may have been the result of a war-game experiment.The incident\u0026nbspwas particularly suspicious because internet\u0026nbsptraffic was being sent to the Chinese government’s\u0026nbspinternet\u0026nbspprovider, China Telecom, which has previously been accused of improperly\u0026nbsprouting\u0026nbsptraffic through China.A report\u0026nbspearlier this year by researchers at the US Naval War College and Tel Aviv University found\u0026nbspChina\u0026nbspTelecom has\u0026nbspbeen hijacking internet\u0026nbsptraffic passing through the US and Canada on a regular basis.Conveniently, China Telecom has ten strategically placed, Chinese controlled internet ‘points of presence’4 (PoPs) across the internet backbone of North America, the report\u0026nbspstated.\u0026nbspVast rewards can be reaped from the hijacking, erting, and then copying of information-rich traffic going into or crossing the United States and Canada – often unnoticed and then delivered with only small delays.A Google spokesperson told The Independent: “We’re aware that a portion of internet traffic was affected by incorrect routing of IP addresses, and access to some Google services was impacted. The root cause of the issue was external to Google and there was no compromise of Google services.”In an update to its Google Cloud Status Dashboard, Google said it was conducting an internal investigation in the hope of\u0026nbspmaking\u0026nbspappropriate improvements to help prevent a future recurrence of the issue.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This sand was transported by the glacier from the bottom of the impact crater to the ice margin, and it has yielded a wealth of information on the impact (Svend Funder)“While it requires more research, we consider it possible that the Cape York irons may have been outer fragments or even boulders on the surface of the main meteorite.\u0026nbspWe suspect these initially detached in Earth’s gravity field and then decelerated as they entered the atmosphere to fall south of the Hiawatha crater.”Professor Kurt H\u0026nbspKjær, lead author of the research\u0026nbspfrom the Natural History Museum of Denmark, said: “The crater is exceptionally well-preserved and that is surprising, because glacier ice is an incredibly efficient erosive agent that would have quickly removed traces of the impact.“The next step in the investigation will be to confidently date the impact.\u0026nbspThis will be a challenge because it will probably require recovering material that melted during the impact from the bottom of the structure, but this is crucial if we are to understand how the Hiawatha impact affected life on Earth.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The precision of new measurements continues to improve, opening the doors to new parameters of space, such as super-Earth planets in cool orbits like Barnard\u0027s star b.The scientists want to collect more data to confirm the planet’s presence, and say it could provide an excellent target to test using the latest in space observation technology such as\u0026nbspNasa’s planned Wide Field Infra Red Survey Telescope.If using such technologies they can observe the planet directly, it will open up their understanding of the kinds of planets that are forming around other stars in distant space.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

That is the fact of the matter as there will be no electricity.“Chief Pleas want to put together a contingency plan but I don’t think they are capable of doing that – they are a dysfunctional government. Chief Pleas will just do what they always do, and that is nothing.“The only hope is to get someone independent in to bang some heads together and if they want to bang mine,\u0026nbspthat’s fine.

We have to make sure that island residents are in a secure position.“It is the letter, in which the company’s managing director talked about people having to leave Sark, which has really upset people here.“There is so much uncertainty and worry.”Mr Raymond said he was confident a mass exodus could be avoided “if we can get our contingency plans in place”.He added: “They are in the development stage at the moment so I can’t give out too much details, but it will involve consolidating around certain centres – making sure there are certain buildings that have power so people can congregate there.“It really is a war-time mentality. Do you really expect people to be living like this in the 21st century?”Boy speeding on electric scooter given six points on future licenceDeputy Peter Ferbrache, president of Guernsey States’ Trading Supervisory Board, this week said he hoped Guernsey Electricity could step in “if the lights are definitely going to go out”.However, it is not clear how the firm could practically be able to provide electricity to the island.Mr Gordon-Brown dismissed the idea and added: “The last thing Guernsey Electricity want to do is get involved with Sark politics.”Tony Le Lieve, chairman of Sark’s Chamber of Commerce, said that residents and businesses were now genuinely concerned about what would happen.He said: “With no power and no water, we wouldn’t be able to live here. It should have been sorted out amicably.“We should not be three weeks away from our power being switched off. I hope someone with some common sense will get the two parties to sit down, perhaps with a mediator who is independent and can look at the situation from both sides.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I would rule nothing out.”\u0026nbspERG chairman Jacob Rees-Mogg\u0026nbspheightened tension by writing to all of his Conservative colleagues calling on them to oppose the draft deal and arguing that it failed to “match the expectations set out in Theresa May’s Lancaster House speech”.He went on: “The proposed agreement will see the UK hand over £39bn to the EU for little or nothing in return...For these reasons I can not support the proposed agreement in parliament and would hope that Conservative MPs would do likewise.”At the same time as the cabinet in London, ambassadors representing the 27 remaining member states met in Brussels for their first look at the complete withdrawal agreement text.As a Labour MP I believe our next manifesto must include a Final SayHow our economic and trade relations will change after BrexitTheresa May’s Brexit is pointless – the worst of both worldsThe top diplomats were told by the EU’s deputy chief negotiator Sabine Weyand, who talked them through technical aspects of the draft and a document outlining\u0026nbspthe future trading relationship.Diplomatic sources said some member states made “interventions”, indicating they are worried the plans may give Britain a competitive advantage. National governments will get their say in the coming weeks.Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, also wrote to European Council president Donald Tusk to say that the withdrawal negotiations had concluded and the next step in the process could begin.He said: “You will find attached the text of the draft withdrawal agreement, for which the Government of the United Kingdom has signalled its approval.“On this basis, the Commission recommends to the European Council (Article 50) to find that decisive progress has been made in the negotiations on the orderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, allowing the negotiations on the withdrawal agreement to be concluded and the next step of the process to be initiated.“I look forward to our continued good cooperation with a view to bringing this important matter to a successful conclusion.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This requires the customs union as the basis of the future relationship,” deputy chief negotiator Sabine Weyand said, according to the note seen by The Times newspaper.May calls in ministers to approve deal reached by UK negotiators“They must align their rules but the EU will retain all the controls. They apply the same rules. UK wants a lot more from future relationship, so EU retains its leverage.”\u0026nbspThe binding clauses would mean the UK would be tied to EU rules on workers’ rights, environmental protections, and state aid while the so-called backstop applies – which everyone in Brussels believes it will for quite some time.The provisions are enraging some Tory Brexiteers, who see Britain’s departure from the EU as an opportunity to strip out what they see as excessive regulations and rights for workers.“She hasn’t so much struck a deal as surrendered to Brussels and given in to everything they want and tried to frustrate Brexit that it’s not so much a vassal state anymore as a slave state,” unofficial rebellion leader Jacob Rees-Mogg said, articulating the views of many of Ms May’s MPs.Government forced to publish secret Brexit legal adviceUK travellers will not need visas to visit the EU in no-deal BrexitRemainers also rounded on the leak. Dominic Grieve QC, a Tory MP and the former attorney general, said: “Speaking in private Sabine Weyand has been brutally honest about what the Prime Minister’s deal will really mean.”He added: “I could not look my constituents in the eye and say this would be a better deal than the one we have as a member of the EU and so I will vote against it and instead I will vote to hand the final decision back to the public. A choice between this miserable Brexit and no deal is no choice at all. The British public deserve a real choice between leaving the EU on these terms or sticking with the deal we’ve got inside the EU.”But speaking on Wednesday morning Theresa May loyalist William Hague urged Tories to ignore the “leak overnight from somebody you have never heard of before” and to back the plan, arguing that Brexit could be thwarted if it was ditched.The leaked written account of the meeting seen by the newspaper also suggests\u0026nbspthat Britain “would have to swallow a link between access to products and fisheries in future agreements” for the future relationship. The claim is political dynamite because some Brexiteers want the UK to be able to exclude EU fishing boats from British waters after the country leaves.We will not comment on the various press reports over the past 24 hours.Cabinet ministers are being strong-armed to support the deal, with some deemed “key” to its approval call in for one-on-one meetings with the Prime Minister ahead of a moment-of-truth meeting on Wednesday.The final text of the draft withdrawal agreement has not been made public, meaning ministers must either decode the vast legal agreement themselves or rely on Downing Street’s interpretation of it.EU ambassadors will meet simultaneously in Brussels this afternoon to examine\u0026nbspthe agreement, and be briefed by EU officials\u0026nbsp– though the full sign-off process from member states is expected to take longer.\u0026nbsp“It’s going to be a thorough information on the state of play,” a spokesperson for the European Commission said.Even if the Prime Minister can secure the support of her own cabinet it looks increasingly unlikely that she will be able to get the plan through the House of Commons, with opposition from Labour, Tory eurosceptics, and the DUP now looking more certain than ever.Created with Sketch.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.John Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

She is expected to face serious opposition from some eurosceptic ministers.

The DUP has said they cannot support the deal because the backstop would see Northern Ireland fall under different regulations to the rest of the UK.This is a key section of the withdrawal agreement,\u0026nbspon the customs backstop:\u0026nbspIf...the Union and the United Kingdom decide jointly within the Joint Committee that the Protocol, in whole or in part, is no longer necessary to achieve its objectives, the Protocol shall cease to apply, in whole or in part.\u0026nbspIt makes clear the UK will not be able to exit the backstop unilaterally - one of the reasons Tory Eurosceptics are currently condemning the proposed deal in the strongest of terms.Breaking: The government has published the draft withdrawal agreement. Read it HERE and remember, it\u0027s the section on the customs backstop that is key.We\u0027re expecting the full draft withdrawal agreement - all 400+ pages of it - to be published at 7.45pm.\u0026nbspThe most controversial part relates to the customs backstop, which we believe will include a plan for a UK-wide backstop. Crucially, we think the UK will NOT be able to exit the backstop unilaterally\u0026nbsp- a major red line for many Brexiteers.\u0026nbspIt hasn\u0027t gone unnoticed\u0026nbspthat Theresa May said the Cabinet had agreed to back her deal collectively, rather than\u0026nbspunanimously.\u0026nbspCould some ministers still resign tonight?

A third of those who replied were undecided.\u0026nbspThe majority (63.3 per cent) backed a second referendum when asked how the government could give people a say on the terms of Britain’s exit from the bloc, while 10.9 per cent suggested a public consultation.About 10 per cent said they trust the government to do a good job, and 7.4 per cent said the UK should just leave the EU.Kajal Odedra, executive director of change.org UK, said people feel “bombarded but gagged by Brexit”, regardless of whether they voted to leave or remain in the European Union.EU to decide whether Brits will need visas in event of no-deal BrexitVoters in most vulnerable Tory seats \u0027back fresh Brexit vote\u0027Every day takes us closer to giving the people the final say on BrexitThornberry says Labour could still back Final Say Brexit referendumCorbyn rejects calls for Final Say referendum, despite Labour backlashJohnson insists May can be forced into Final Say referendum on BrexitWriting exclusively for The Independent, Ms Odedra said: “The choices the government makes in negotiations are critical.\u0026nbsp“But they are being made far away from the public with no consultation whatsoever.\u0026nbsp“When we asked change.org users, only 7 per cent of those polled felt they have been given a chance for their voices to be heard since the referendum.“And 85 per cent felt they didn’t have any say in shaping the government’s Brexit strategy.”Leave voters were more likely to feel heard by ministers at about 23 per cent, while only 1.4 per cent of Remain voters said they had been listened to, according to the poll.Young people were also more likely to feel ignored than older voters, the findings show, with just 8.3 per cent of 16 to 24-year-olds reporting that they believe their voices are being heard.Around a quarter of over-65s said they felt listened to, compared to 20 per cent of those aged 55 to 64, and 10.5 per cent of 25 to 34-year-olds.It comes after a special parliamentary event heard that\u0026nbspmore people back a fresh referendum than oppose one in all of the 67 most marginal Tory seats.The YouGov survey of 25,000 people\u0026nbspalso found that a majority of voters in the Labour constituencies that voted Leave in 2016 now back a fresh referendum, by an average of 59 per cent in favour compared to 41 per cent against.It also comes as more than 3,000 people were expected to attend a major rally in London to urge\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspto reject a bad Brexit deal.Cross-party MPs have backed the call,\u0026nbspincluding Tory Jo Johnson, who resigned from government last week over Theresa May’s Brexit strategy, Labour’s David Lammy and SNP\u0026nbspWestminster leader Ian Blackford.Liberal Democrat MP\u0026nbspLayla Moran, who backs the Best for Britain campaign,\u0026nbspsaid: “No one voted for this pathetic little deal which actually hands over our sovereignty, making the UK a rule taker rather than a rule maker. It is the opposite of taking back control.”Caroline Lucas, former Green party co-leader,\u0026nbspadded: “The only solution is to take the final decision out of the hands of deadlocked politicians, away from the backroom deals, and give it back to the public with a People’s Vote.“On Brexit, it’s clear we have a parliament in stalemate that can’t deliver a clear choice for the future. So it’s time to let the British public do it instead.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But if a no-deal\u0026nbspBrexit is avoided, a further fall back in inflation and a rise in nominal wage growth should spur a sustained consumer recovery next year.”“We still think that CPI inflation will return to the 2 per cent\u0026nbsptarget in the first quarter\u0026nbspand will average just 1.8 per cent\u0026nbspin 2019,” said Samuel Tombs of Pantheon.Separately, the ONS reported\u0026nbspon Wednesday that annual factory gate prices rose 3.3 per cent in the month, up from 3.1 per cent in September and coming in ahead of City estimates.The statistics body\u0026nbspestimated\u0026nbspthat average UK house price growth\u0026nbsppicked up to 3.5 per cent year on year in September, up from 3.1 per cent in August.Prices fell 0.3 per cent in London over the period.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Europe and its security.”The suggestion angered Mr Trump, who sent a series of hostile tweets about the comments.On Tuesday the US president tweeted: “Emmanuel Macron suggests building its own army to protect Europe against the US, China and Russia. But it was Germany in World Wars One \u0026amp Two – How did that work out for France? They were starting to learn German in Paris before the US came along. Pay for Nato or not!”The election of Mr Trump to the White House appears to have given more urgency to the cause of boosting the EU’s defence capabilities, with leaders warning they cannot simply rely on the United States.Commission president Mr Juncker said last year that “deference to Nato can no longer be used as a convenient alibi to argue against greater European efforts”.In 2016, then defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon said the UK would use its veto to stop the creation of any EU army. However, the UK is leaving the EU, and will therefore no longer have any say in its governance.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A crew member escorts a migrant child out of a plane transporting a group of 51 migrants from Niger, entitled to international protection, after its landing at the Mario De Bernardi military airport in Pratica di Mare, south of RomePalestinians gather in front of damaged buildings in Gaza City following Israeli air strikes targeting the area overnight.

Hunting the animals is now a conservation imperative with the US authorities offering bounties for each snake killed.\u0026nbspIt is a testing challenge as Penniston described this week after being pictured with the 120lb monster python in Miami-Dade County.Snake hunter Kyle Penniston reveals incredible length of record python (Image: Brian Hargrove )\u0026ldquoSo this snake just showed me you really can do anything, he told social media followers on Facebook.\u0026ldquoI just caught this python alone. I was riding along the levee and saw this massive girl in the water. Jumped out and grabbed her by the head and realised how big she truly was.Penniston, from Homestead, Florida, went on to describe how the snake, capable of exerting enough pressure with its muscular coils to asphyxiate a human, was ready for a brawl.\u0026ldquoShe started wrapping me while I tried getting her up the levee, he continued.\u0026ldquoShe ended up making me lose my grip and, as soon as I knew it, she had my hand in her mouth. I grabbed my pistol off my side, loaded one in the chamber and it jammed. I kept fighting until we were both dead of energy.Lurking in the swamp. Deadly python moments before capture (Image: Brian Hargrove)\u0026ldquoI finally was able to get her up the levee and l euthanised her as it\u0026rsquos required by our programme.Penniston thanked python-hunting colleague Brian Hargrove for photographing the record-breaking snake, which measured 17ft 5inches.Officials at the South Florida Water Management District\u0026rsquos python elimination programme said this was the third supersize, 17ft-plus snake caught since efforts were launched to eradicate the non-native species which began damaging the Everglades\u0026rsquo delicate ecology in the late 1980s.The original pythons were most likely released by exotic pet owners who found them too difficult to keep. Once freed, the pythons found the subtropical conditions right for breeding and the prevalence of native American wildlife, such as raccoons, opossums and even bobcats, perfect food.Jaws of the death... Python opens reveals its awesome mouth (Image: )To date, 1,859 have been eliminated, with hunters earning $8.25 an hour and $50 dollar bounties for each one over four foot. Additional $25 dollars sums are added for every foot so Penniston can expect $375 (\u0026pound290) for his latest efforts, which see him become the second most prolific python hunter with 235 kills.\u0026ldquoJust six months after eliminating the first 1,000 pythons from district lands, this programme is about to double that total because of a true team effort, said SFWMD scientist Mike Kirkland, project manager for the python elimination programme. \u0026ldquoWith the governing board\u0027s unwavering support, district staff and a dedicated group of hunters are working to help control this invasive species and protect native wildlife.The\u0026nbspthreat pythons pose to even the Everglades\u0026rsquo most powerful predators was captured on film earlier this year when a hunter saved a young alligator being killed by one of the snakes.Gripping video footage showed how Mike Kimmel wrestled the young alligator from the nine-foot Burmese python moments before having the life crushed out of its body.Fearless Kimmel went into the swamp and was able to get a strong grip on the snake and force it to free the four-foot alligator.\u0026ldquoWhen I see what the pythons have done to the Everglades, it\u0026rsquos something I can\u0026rsquot stand by and watch, he said.\u0026ldquoThey\u0026rsquore a huge problem. The Everglades are sick right now to begin with. On top of everything, you have this invasive predator that has nothing else to keep it in check besides humans.\u0026ldquoIt eats and kills everything. The native wildlife have never dealt with a cryptic predator like the python. They don\u0026rsquot have the instincts or defence mechanism for it.

But in what is considered largely as a victory by Brussels and Downing Street, Mrs May has secured a UK-wide Irish backstop, the insurance policy to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland. The mechanism became Brexit\u0026rsquos most vexed issue because the EU\u0026rsquos own plan was used as the building blocks for what was agreed by the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos Europe advisor Olly Robbins and his European Commission counterparts Michel Barnier and Sabine Weyand. After proclaiming \u0026ldquono British Prime Minister could accept the terms set out by Brussels, which would have essentially kept Northern Ireland locked in the EU\u0026rsquos customs union and single market for goods, Mrs May has now agreed a UK-wide approach to the backstop.

What is the Brexit backstop? Has Northern Ireland been split from UK?                 Brexit deal TODAY: What time will Cabinet meet TODAY?Does this mean the European Court of Justice will have influence in Britain?Ultimately, the ECJ will be the final arbiter on issues involving EU law that may arise from the Irish backstop agreement.Geoffrey Cox, the Attorney General, has discussed a \u0026ldquojoint arbitration panel to break any future impasse during review negotiations surrounding the backstop.But EU officials believe such panels are not allowed to settle political disputes of this nature.Questions of interpreting EU law can only be settled by the ECJ, which will leave the Luxembourg-based courts with an important role to play in the UK\u0026rsquos exit from the backstop.Could the backstop become the future trading deal?Michel Barnier\u0026rsquos deputy Sabine Weyand told EU27 ambassadors last Friday that the UK-wide customs arrangement would become the \u0026ldquobasis of the future relationship.She said: \u0026ldquoWe should be in the best negotiation position for the future relationship.\u0026ldquoThis requires the customs union as the basis of the future relationship.\u0026ldquoThey must align their rules but the EU will retain all controls. They apply the same rules.\u0026ldquoThe UK wants a lot more from the future relationship, so EU retains its leverage.Obviously this is still all to play for, but Brussels feels like it is in a strong negotiating position moving forward.

including Jungle Queen Georgia Toffolo, who called him a sex god.Devout Catholic Rees-Mogg has made no secret of his socially conservative views, including being anti-abortion and against gay marriage.His plummy tones, double-breasted suits and traditional manner have earned him the nickname The Honourable Member for the Nineteenth Century.The environment secretary has achieved a remarkable turnaround since kning Boris Johnson during the  leadership contest.His support among party members dropped through the floor and it seemed his chances were gone for ever.But Mr Gove, who led the Leave campaign in the EU referendum, has rebranded himself as an ecowarrior as Environment Secretary.He has also thrown his full support behind Theresa Mays Brexit plan, winning him friends among MPsnot the party faithful.Though an unlikely candidate at the time, the Brexit campaigner reached the final two of the  leadership contest.She withdrew over ill-judged remarks about Theresa May not being a mother.She is now Leader of the House, and survived in post despite reports Mrs May was planning to cut dead wood in her January reshuffle.Mrs Leadsom had a role in the downfall of Sir Michael Fallon after she accused him of lewd sexual comments.The popular and savvy leader of the Scottish Conservatives has been touted as the potential saviour of the Tories in Westminster.But Ruth has said repeatedly she wants to focus on Scotland and as she is not an MP she currently is not eligible to stand as leader of the UK party.In September  she declared she never wants to be Prime Minister.She will also be putting politics on the back burner for a while as she has just had a baby. Mrs May was humiliated when her snap election backfired in , costing the party its Commons majority.Critics in her own party are circling over her handling of Brexit, with rumours more than  MPs have sent letters of no confidence.She could be forced out MPs demand her exit and she loses a subsequent vote.There would then be a Tory leadership campaign, with the winner crowned PM.Alternatively, Mrs May could lose a vote of confidence in the Commons, leading to her government falling.In theory, the Queen could ask the Labour leader to form a minority government, but the numbers in the Commons would make it impossible for him to govern.There could well be a fresh General Election with both major parties trying to secure a parliamentary majority."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/denise.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=686\" height=\"960","title":"james bulger age parents ralph bulger denise fergus","story":"The two-year-old was led to death in Bootle, Merseyside, on February ,  by depraved Robert Thompson and Jon Venables.

And what a mother.They say no one is irreplaceable but I think she is — which must be such a lot of pressure for him. In short, he has spent his entire le waiting for his mum to die before he can start his dream job.And in the meantime his le, in some ways, is on hold. He was not allowed to marry the woman he loved and was instead forced into a loveless marriage.And every time he so much as expresses an opinion about anything, he is denounced as being “meddling”.So it’s no wonder that in Prince, Son And Heir, the BBC documentary this week marking his th birthday, Charles was quick to quell concerns that he would be a “meddling” or activist king, saying: “I’m not that stupid.”Declaring the role of sovereign and heir to be dferent, he said he is aware of the constraints he will encounter as king, and says his behaviour will change.I can see why he is saying that, given the amount of criticism that has come his way over the years. But when you think that he was campaigning about issues such as the environment and single-use plastic long before anyone  got on the bandwagon, it might be better to see him as a trailblazer than a meddler.I admire that he has a voice.And when he is king I think he should use it — not be silenced by the pressure of the role.He has a very broad range of knowledge and he is absolutely passionate. We live in a society where everyone has their say — so why shouldn’t he In fact, I thinkhe visited Europe he might help with Brexit.There is no doubt the Queen is a hard act to follow — when the time comes, that is. Now Charles is  he is the longest serving heir to the throne in history. And he may have years to go, as the Queen looks and sounds fantastic .But we should stop maligning Charles and start supporting him.He is a good man and there is no doubt he is dedicated to the job. He is mature enough to know how to do the job well and he certainly knows what is expected of him.He has brought up two fantastic sons that any parent would be proud of.And he really is passionate about changing the world for the better.It has been more than  years since he set up his Prince’s Trust charity.Last year alone it helped nearly , young people get into education, training and jobs. It is simply fantastic.He is deeply committed to his fantastic we, who is very down-to-earth and great fun .He is also passionate about promoting women’s issues, so whatever you think of him you must give him credit for that.I believe very strongly in the monarchy. I would do anything the Queen asked me to do.The Royal Family are a great thing for our country and something to be very proud of.In a world of increasing uncertainty, they are this country’s rock and foundation. We should all get behind Charles and celebrate him as our future king.Apart from anything , we need all the stability we can get. ANYONE living in London will be unsurprised to hear that there are now a record number of people sleeping rough there.Figures show there were , rough sleepers in the capital between July and September – the first time the total has exceeded , in a three-month period.It’s awful and it’s shocking to see people sitting in the cold begging for money.And it’s hard to know how to help. Of course, the temptation is to give money but obviously that’s just a short-term fix.Night shelters are a good short-term solution. Buthomeless people don’t get involved with a network that can really help them, it’s unlikely their circumstances will ever change.My husband Paul volunteers with the fantastic charity West London Mission . It offers homeless people a hot shower, new clothes, a meal and a decent night’s sleep.But it also offers access to project workers who will help people change their circumstances.Its aim is to empower and help homeless people become part of a community, because that’s the start of them getting off the streets, into accommodation, then into work.There are so many reasons that people become homeless. Some have lost their job and can’t afford rent, or they’ve fallen out with family and turn to drink and drugs.They might have mental or physical health problems, a history of abuse or a dficult childhood moving between foster homes.But where there is le, there is hope. Paul has been working with one guy who was homeless and hopelessly addicted to drugs.But, over time, he has got clean, found a place to live and, last week, got a job at a restaurant, which is what he was doing before he got involved in drugs.He’s got his le back, basically. It does happen.Soyou are worried about homelessness, think about donating to an organisation such as WLM. Better yet, volunteer your time and skills.Even just helping someone to fill out a form, which can be incredibly dficult for some people, can make a huge dference and is so rewarding.TODAY is Remembrance Day and I wear my poppy with pride. This year I will particularly recognise all the true heroes from World War One. I thank them for their service, and remember we are always in their debt.It is so important we never forget the sacrice they made and the bravery they showed.I doubt there will ever be another generation like them. AS a rule, I like to live and let live. But I really had to roll my eyes at the story of -year-old Dutch pensioner Emile Ratelband, “who identies as a -year-old” and is fighting to legally change his age by  years so he can get more work and attract more women on Tinder.Emile, above, was born on March , , but says he feels at least  years younger and wants to change his birth date to March , .His argument is thattransgender people are allowed to change sex, he should be allowed to change his date of birth because doctors said he has the body of a -year-old.So does that meanI feel like a supermodel inside, I can I get my job title legally amended Or maybe at  I could identy as  so I can have access to my pension SO the six men arrested for burning an effigy of Grenfell Tower are in hiding and relying on friends and relatives to bring in food and drink. Still, they are yet to speak out – or apologise.What beggars belief is not just that these sick men thought that no one would notice nor care when this footage emerged on social media – but really that they are unhinged enough to do it in the first place.I’m pretty sure about one thing, though. No matter what consequences they will face for their actions from the law, they will never, ever live this down in the eyes of the world – and nor should they.I’m talking about Michael Douglas, . When he was awarded with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for more than  years in the entertainment industry, he gave his father, Kirk, a kiss on the lips to celebrate.In my experience there comes an age when your kids don’t want to kiss you – particularly on the lips and particularly your dad.It’s part and parcel of growing up that your kids don’t even want you to breathe, let alone kiss them.In fact, everything you do embarrasses them.

I sense, like the recently axed Big Brother and The X Factor, it’s been living off its reputation for a couple of years.Enjoyable as it’s been, the basic issue with this run has been the lack of a central figure in the mould of Syed Ahmed, Katie Hopkins or the late, great Stuart Baggs to take the series by the scruff of the neck.Some have shown vague promise but the closest thing it’s had to an alpha bell-end is Captain Pangea himself, Kurran Pooni, who was marked out less by his all-round uselessness than by the wrist he broke arm-wrestling back at the house, and his insistence he was “ per cent stepping up as project manager” just before he  per cent stepped down.There was no dodging the bullet, though, last week, when Lord Sugar demanded he PM a marketing campaign “for a noo airline” with accompanying adverts “and a noo unorm as well”.Kurran wasn’t underselling the sense of destiny he felt at this responsibility. “Everything in my le has led to this moment,” he claimed, presumably ’cos he hadn’t done anything  up until that moment.The great thing about this task, though — like all the best Apprentice episodes — was that the laughs were shared round equally.So while advert director Kurran was recreating the Club Tropicana video on Southend seafront, Camilla and Jackie were designing a stewardess’s unorm for the party-themed Jet Pop that wouldn’t see the light of day eveneasyJet suddenly opened a brothel chain in Amsterdam.A horrible thought occurred, though, as she was market-researching at Heathrow.She’s not going to wear that thing pitching to  industry experts at BA HQ, is she  She bloody is, you know.She gave it the full doors-to-manual flirtation as well. So everyone’s mind was already in the gutter before Jackie finished the audience off with the news: “It’s very easy to wipe down, as well.”In the normal course of events, reducing Claude Littner to a helpless giggling wreck would be enough to lose any task.The other team, though, Typhoon, had contrived to come up with something almost as bad, Manage Air, a business-targeted operation whose corporate logo looked like a satanic pentangle and theme tune was AC DC’s Highway To Hell.There was a genuine sense of tension in the boardroom then, which would’ve been ruinedSugar had played it all for laughs.He didn’t, though. He let the contestants hang themselves with their own words before firing Kurran, who could leave with a sense of “job done”.He’s created a bit of Apprentice folklore, after all, and hopefully reminded everyone this show is far from dead.Naturally, in the final taxi scene, he also remained convinced of his genius, boldly declaring: “My advert was gold.”The first and possibly last time in his le where he’s not just  per cent wrong, he’s  per cent right as well.Glorious television.Dianne: “Stephen Fry.”The Time It Takes, Joe Lycett: “Sesame Street’s Big Bird lives in what street ”Oliver: “I don’t know.”Joe Lycett: “A bird in the hand is worth two in the what ”Jon: “Foot.”And Bradley Walsh: “Which former EastEnders star presents the Sky One series Extreme World ”Zoe: “Barbara Windsor.”CELEBRITY Hunted contestant and former Commando Johnny Mercer MP has faced a stark choice this past month.The eternal humiliation of being beaten by Chris and Kem, off Love Island, on the Channel  hide ’n’ seek game.Or two weeks in a confined space with a clearly smitten Kay Burley.Heroically, he chose the latter, enduring her attention and pet namewith the same sort of grit that probably saw him through three tours of Afghanistan.Then, last week, he sneaked off for an unscheduled visit to his we, Felicity, and Burley completely lost her s***.Lost it so badly, in fact, that she threw herself at the mercy of a passing bread truck driver, which led to the best update of the series: “Kay Burley is currently in a -ton lorry, on the M, between junction  and .”She was quickly grassed up, of course, then apprehended at the Warburton’s depot, without the need for a vet or a tranquilliser dart.But while it’s a poorer show without the old mad-whack, there’s still plenty of mileage left in this gripping series.AJ Pritchard is cornered in Shropshire, Olympic silver medallist Louis Smith has just been found hiding in his mate’s Jacuzzi showroomand Baldrick-brained duo Chris  Kemhave somehow given everyone the slip.But as for Johnny Mercer  He’s probably smuggling himself back to the Mouth of Hell fort, in southern Helmand, just for the relative peace and quiet. Paul Merson: “For me it’s six and a half of one and a dozen of the other.”Graeme Souness: “The only one with potential is Martial and Pogba.”Dion Dublin: “Liverpool are in second and a half gear.”And Charlie Nicholas: “Pogba’s either brilliant or a showpony. He played OK last week.”THIS week’s Doctor Who episode introduced us to the Demons Of The Punjab, who turned out to be nothing of the sort.They were just morbid sods who mope around the universe “honouring those who die alone”, like soldiers, holy men and Brendan O’Carroll on For Facts Sakes.No actual science-fiction storyline to speak of then.But that’s not really the point of this viewer-shedding series, which has already got on its high horse about sexism, Donald Trump, American segregationist racism, men giving birth and gun control.Kind of inevitable, then, that the BBC would eventually pour a bucket of its self-loathing sick all over the British Empire, via the partition of India in , with an episode that was every bit as historically powerful as Carry On Up The Khyber.The key dference, of course, was that Bungdit Din and his Burpers weren’t actually being used as a means of brainwashing children.Because If you were expecting Doctor Who to present the flip side of Britain’s relatively benign rule in India , then you’ll also be waiting for the episode where Jodie Whittaker lands in a Soviet gulag and starts teaching children about the brutal idiocy of Marxism.The BBC just doesn’t do anything other than its own left-of-centre view, these days – or irony by the sounds of things.As it’s just been revealed there’ll be no festive episode of Doctor Whobecause it’s “run out” of storylines.Run out  RUN OUT How the hell can a series run out of ideas when it hasn’t had any yet This Morning, Thursday: “Coming up, at quarter to , the rise of the penis filler, Doctor Ranj is here to answer your questions.”The show’s other penis filler, Martin Lewis, will answer them on Monday.IT seems almost wrong to single out just one programme from Sunday’s beautul Armistice Day coverage, but the year’s most meaningful TV awards should probably all go to BBC’s They Shall Not Grow Old, made by Peter Jackson, whose astonishing film gave a voice, laughter, tears and colour to some of the extraordinary men who survived the - trenches.Those of us who watched it, on Sunday, are unlikely ever to forget the experience. Those of you who didn’t, must catch up with it on the BBC iPlayer.Be sure, though, to watch it right through to the credits’ last chorus of Mademoiselle From Armentières, where it names the veterans who have all long since passed but whose memories and souls have never seemed more alive and unforgettable.“It’s quite hard to put your finger on it.”I’ll bet.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It should include common development of arms industry, she said as well as an EU-wide arms export policy and crucially a European intervention force.It came a day after a senior minister from the French Government called for the EU to become a powerful new “empire” to rival the US and China in an interview which will infuriate Donald Trump.Merkels remarks today in the EU parliament drew loud applause in the legislature but also boos from euro-sceptic members.One of them was chief Brexiteer Nigel Farage, who said: Its a European Union that we are told is now to become an empire - a militarised European Union.A European Union that has launched a new Cold against the United States of America.One hundreds years on from the Armistice we should genuinely be worried.The idea that this new militarised union is somehow a recipe for peace I suggest you sit back and think a little bit more carefully.Maybe you should all re-read history because the European project was set up to stop German domination and what you have seen today is a naked take-over bid.Yesterday French finance minister Bruno Le Maire said Europe must be strong enough to defend itself in the future - words the US president called insulting.Le Maire controversial calls for a new superstate came as he backed Macron’s and Merkels plan for a “real European army”.Le Maire suggested Brussels should go one even further and establish itself as an “empire”.Its about Europe having to become a kind of Empire, as China is. And how the US is, the French finance minister told the German newspaper Handelsblatt.After being quizzed by the newspaper on his comments, he added: “Do not get me wrong, Im talking about a peaceful empire thats a constitutional state.I use the term to raise awareness that the world of tomorrow will be about power.Power will make a dference: technological power, economic, financial, monetary, cultural power will be crucial.Trump has blasted Macrons idea for the European Union to build an army to protect itself from the US as insulting.The US President tweeted: President Macron of France has just suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the US, China and Russia.Very insulting, but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO, which the US subsidises greatly!It comes three days after the French President said the US is as big a threat to the EU as Russia and China and called for a “true European army” to defend the bloc.In an extraordinary attack on the US president, Macron lumped Washington together with Moscow and Beijing as Europe’s biggest foes.The arch euro federalist insisted only a fully fledged EU defence force can protect the continent against the trio’s aggression.He said: “We have to protect ourselves with respect to China, Russia and even the United States of America.“We will not protect the Europeans unless we decide to have a true European army.”The French president lashed Mr Trump for deciding to pull the US out of a nuclear treaty with Russia that was signed during the Cold War.He raged: “When I see President Trump announcing that he’s quitting a major disarmament treaty which was formed after the s euro-missile crisis that hit Europe, who is the main victim  Europe and its security.”Mr Macron made the comments in a radio interview from the town of Verdun - the site of a major WW battle - as he tours the Western Front ahead of Remembrance Day.They were welcomed by the EU Commission, which said it has already put the wheels in motion for the eventual creation of a euro army.A spokesman beamed: “If there is a Commission that has put forward the need for a meaningful defence identity for the EU, it’s this Commission.“President Macron has been consistently putting forward this narrative for a stronger Europe that empowers and protects.“This is totally totally compatible with our work and all contributions from our EU leaders, and especially from President Macron, are very much welcome.”But the remarks were savaged by former British Army commanders, who said the revelations showed why the UK must pull out of the EU’s defence plans.Major General Julian Thompson, who led British forces in the Falklands, told The Sun: “The EU Commission now openly admits it has created the preamble to an EU army.The UK is in that preamble and risks being kept in it.“Ministers must withdraw or risk losing forever whole chunks of the UK’s democratic control over defence.”Colonel Richard Kemp, a commander of UK troops in Afghanistan, added: “This is precisely what eurosceptics have been warning about.“It is time for ministers now to take notice and rein in what they have agreed since the referendum.They have been led astray in the most crucial area of sovereignty.”And Tory MEP Geoffrey Van Orden, a former British Army Brigadier, raged: “Instead of th century dreams of French-led European grandeur, President Macron should be helping build Western solidarity.“That means helping and not obstructing a strong partnership with Britain and strengthening the NATO alliance.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000248408276.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"brits wont need a visa to travel to europe even if we get a no deal brexit eu confirms","story":"UK citizens will be able to visit the EU for up to three months at a time without having to get new documents -

I would just like to thank everyone who has donated or got in touch to wish me well."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000146112814-e1542186138973.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"thomas cook flight birmingham airport near miss object","story":"The Airbus A was at a height of ft when it narrowly avoided a potentially catastrophic collision before touching down at Birmingham airport.A report by the UK Airprox Board which investigates near misses said the pilot believed the object was “some sort of balloon or drone”.It passed “directly beneath” the jet which had flown from Palma in Mallorca.

costing £,with her partner months ago - flagging her nut allergy immediately.The young woman, of Saint Albans, Herts, said she was then given a form for her doctor to sign that would guarantee crew would not serve peanuts to the passengers in her cabin.But she said her doctor took issue with one of the paragraphs in the statement, which reads: “The passenger’s peanut and or other nut allergy condition do not pose any serious risks to his her health given the conditions inflight as stated in attached.”She explained: “It says that there would be no risk of me having an allergic reaction.“But I’m still at risk, there’s always a risk.”The young woman said she had even started wheezing while on a train and sitting next to someone eating peanuts - showing just how deadly the food could be for her.Sophie then provided a statement from her doctor confirming her peanut and nut allergy – but was told last week by the airline it wasn’t enough.The marketing worker said: “I provided this for proof – why they need proof I just don’t know.“Even though they know I have a peanut allergy, they are still going to serve peanuts as a cocktail snack.“I don’t know what  I can do.”Anaphylactic shock is a severe and potentially fatal reaction to a trigger such as an allergy.It normally comes on suddenly, and gets worse very quickly.Symptoms include:A sufferer may also display symptoms of allergies, such as an itchy raised rash , feeling or being sick, swelling or stomach pain.Cases of anaphylaxis can be fatal -

He was trying to get to escape to Turkey,” recalls Havel Ronnie.But here is signicant numbers of other foreigners here too - not just British – but many of the top leadership, who are Saudi, Chechen or Iraqi.”ISISs so-called caliphate has been left virtually decimated since they lost their de-facto capital, Raqqa, in Syria last year.However, according to the Havel Ronnie in and around Hajin the bloodthirsty group still control around  square kilometers of villages spotted along the Euphrates river and dislodging them will be extremely dficult.“ISIS have had over five years to prepare, and they have built tunnels and placed IED everywhere… they also know the terrain very well,” he states.“It is very slow work [and] we are having to take it, house by house, metre by metre.”The American-backed coalition recently suffered a major setback last month after the extremists launched a series of counter attacks using the cover of sandstorms.“The sandstorm lasted for almost three days and we could only see meters in front of us,” a female commander explains of that attack.Luckily they suffered no losses at that base, but it was almost over run by the jihadists.Some of those involved in the assault were also foreign fighters.“We captured a Saudi and Afghani…and my [female] comrade shot a blonde European man in the head,” she states pointing near to the ISIS vehicle, where it happened.“He was about to enter our base and explode his suicide vest.”The SDF have recently redeployed some of their elite ‘counter terrorism units to Hajin to bolster their troops in the area.“We will begin the offensive against Hajin soon...but I don’t think this battle will be done quickly” the chief commander explains.“This is not a war that can be won quickly,” he added.Eventhe jihadists do lose Hajin this commander does not believe it will be the end of the terror group.“I am certain that they will be defeated here, but, that will not be the end of ISIS... and what may come after maybe worse, he adds.According to him this is a generational battle which cannot be defeated just by retaking territory.“At least now we and you know where ISIS is but after they are gone, they could attack from anywhere, even in Europe,” he says.In August Baghdadi urged his followers to unleash suicide bombs in the West, just days after he was reported to be brain dead.In the recorded message the worlds most wanted man urged fanatics to follow the striking lions behind recent lone wolf attacks in Europe and Canada."},{"url":null,"title":"you had one job images photos","story":"Even something as simple as labelling a tin of butter correctly has been made a hash of and the people responsible for these hilarious snaps certainly wont be getting a promotion anytime soon.Sometimes the solutions to our everyday problems are so simple that we fail to see it when the answer is staring us right in the face.But even then, some problems can be too hard to deal with for some people.This hall of shame includes everything from grammar mistakes to other-worldly concepts.The outrageous gallery will have you chuckling at some of the funny ways people have mucked up a very simple job."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000449393058.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"alana burns pregnant mum council flat bathgate west lothian","story":"Alana Burns, , is due to give birth to twins in March and lives with children Alisha, two, Steven, four, Cayden, seven, Leigh, , and Caitlin, .Her older children Stewart, , and Bryan, , also live in the flat, which is above a pub in West Lothian.The home has four bedrooms but due to a leak in one room, the family are all crammed into just three bedrooms.They were living in a private let until the landlord decided to sell the property so they spent time in hotels before West Lothian Council found them the flat in September.Single mum Alana said: My relationship with some of my children is at breaking point.

two from the EU, two from the UK and one from a separate country.Leaks of the draft text pointed to Britain being asked to swallow being bound tightly to EU rules for years to come - with some oversight by EU judges as a consequence.One Brussels insider told the FT that the dferent rules for Northern Ireland were still contained in the document but “disappeared from view”.But in order to secure a UK wide customs backstop the Government will be forced to sign up strict EU rules on state aid for companies and so called “level playing field” rules.TODAY: Cabinet meeting takes place at pm where the PM will ask her key allies to approve the agreement -

in other words, the EU has a veto.It is coated in heavy fudge, but that is the inedible biscuit beneath the coating.He added that the proposals had united him and Boris Johnson in unholy alliance, adding: We agree this is a pointless Brexit in name only which is not the best of a bad job but the worst of both worlds.In the cause of taking back control we lose the control we had.Mr Blair highlighted the PowerPoint presentation used to promote Mrs May’s Chequers plan, claiming that the Prime Ministers Europe adviser Olly Robbins and the civil service had used “elaborate camouflage” to disguise elements of the proposals.He said: “I take my hat off to Olly Robbins, Olly is a very skilled guy, the elaborate camouflage of all the dferent points is a tribute to the skills of the British civil service, I say that sincerely.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000449335784.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"schoolgirls given free tampons nottingham period poverty","story":"City Councils in Nottingham and Bristol have voted to provide free products in schools to ensure pupils do not miss out on their education during periods.Notts and Bristol have also said they will also aim to encourage local businesses to provide sanitary products for staff.The move is a response to statistics that show some women are being forced to choose between paying the bills and buying tampons, while schoolgirls have missed school because they couldnt afford sanitary products.In Nottingham, the motion was put forward by Labour councillor Nick Raine after speaking to teachers on his ward.He said: It affects pupils education. A total of  per cent of young women say they have missed at least one day of school because they didnt have adequate sanitary protection, and some have missed more.He continued: Well work with schools and colleges so they dont need to miss school.As a council, this in our power to address. And it was about time, in terms of equality, to discuss these matters in public.In Bristol, Councillor Helen Godwin, who lobbied for the motion, said: This issue simply shouldnt belong in  and it is a travesty that we need to tackle period poverty in our city. Too many of our girls and women are unable to afford or access sanitary protection during their period.Godwin said she wants Bristol to be a trailblazer local authority in how they tackle the issue and will hold a period poverty summit next month to map out how to ensure that all girls in Bristol for Year Five to  can access pads and tampons in their school.She said they will also pledge to ensure that free sanitary products will be available from libraries and civic buildings, as well as encouraging local businesses to provide products to their workforce.It is my hope then that women and girls will never have to consider whether they can afford to have their period, she said.Charity Plan International UK has found that one in  girls aged  to  have been unable to afford sanitary products.A total of  per cent have had to improvise sanitary wear and  per cent of girls have changed to a less suitable sanitary product due to cost.Lucy Russell, Plan International UKs Campaign Manager, said: We welcome proposals and new ideas to help tackle the fact that for too many girls, dealing with their period each month is proving a tough challenge.

We have informed the police and emergency services that these  bridges will be road-blocked: Southwark, Blackfriars, Waterloo, Westminster and Lambeth.” On Monday, a protest organised by the group saw people descend on the headquarters of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. Other activists superglued their hands to the revolving doors of the department and locked their arms together with plastic tubes to ensure they could not be easily moved. Dozens of police arrived in vans to closely watch the protest as chants of fracking is stoppable and keep that oil in the soil rang out on Victoria Street. Police said one person was arrested.  Young activist Frederik Arstad, , who travelled from Oslo in Norway to protest, said the group wanted authorities to take more seriously the severity of the situation regarding climate change. It will raise the ocean levels, cause more floods, forest fires like weve just seen in Calornia, and it will affect the whole world, especially the poor parts of the world, Mr Arstad said. This will create climate refugees. They have to go somewhere and they might come here and we will probably shut them out, and there will be a human disaster. A number of the protesters hailed from near Cuadrillas shale gas fracking site at Preston New Road in Lancashire, which they claimed was environmentally damaging.

She has to overcome three major hurdles - her own Cabinet,  EU leaders, and finally a vote in the House of Commons. At every stage she could be thwarted - especially the last one. MPs are threatening mutiny over the Northern Ireland backstop, a customs backup plan that could leave the UK trapped in Brussels orbit. After months of very little to report things could now move very quickly in a frenetic round of diplomacy. A lot is unknown, but here is the most likely timetable in the weeks and months ahead.  Tuesday  November : After months of stalled talks over the Northern Irish border, and  days after the Brexit vote, a deal was finally reached at a technical level between the UK and EU. Wednesday  November: Ministers flooded to an emergency Cabinet meeting from pm that ran for more than four hours to sign off the deal. This was the first of three danger moments for the PM, and ministers were ordered to either back the deal or quit. Thursday  November: Theresa May due to give a statement to Parliament on the -page Brexit deal, allowing MPs to finally question her for the first time. Sunday  November: This date has been pencilled in for an emergency EU summit with  other leaders to sign off the deal. This will be danger moment number two for the Prime Minister, when she has to face down pro-EU leaders like Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel. But its likely shell face more trouble at home than in Brussels, where EU officials have already spent months working out the detail. Thursday  December: The next scheduled European Council summit. This is the last chance saloon to agree a deal with the other EU leadersno emergency summit is scheduled. Already its much later than the ideal date, which was meant to be October. Otherwise there wont be time to sign it off before Brexit Day.  Thursday  December: By this date, there will be a vote in the UK Parliament on the deal. This is danger moment number three for Theresa May - and by far the worst one. If any of the crunch moments will force her from office, it will be this one. She will almost certainly have to resign or face a vote of no confidence. She claims the UK will leave with No Deal anywayshe loses. But Labour say she should be forced back to the negotiating table call a general election or even trigger a second EU referendum.  January to March : Dozens of national and regional parliaments across the EU will hold their own votes on the Brexit deal. Meanwhile, No Deal planning has to ramp up in case everything doesnt come together in time.  March : Brexit Day. If theres a deal, this will be a total anticlimax because a transition will be in place. If theres No Deal, planes could be grounded, ports jammed up and customs checks thrown into chaos at pm.   December : If theres a deal, this is when the transition period - which continues pretty much all the EU rules we have now - is supposed to end. Only at this point will the much-discussed Brexit deal actually kick in. Talk has been floated of extending this date by a few months. After December : If theres still no deal to stop customs checks on the Northern Ireland border, under current plans a backstop would kick in. This could keep the UK tied to EU customs rules, until a proper agreement is reached, in exchange for keeping the Northern Ireland border open. What happensa deal is voted down   If MPs do not vote for the PM’s deal then the UK defaults to a no-deal Brexit. Such a scenario could trigger a crisis in the financial markets, plummeting sterling and adding to an unprecedented political crisis. What then  Constitutionally, the Government must decide what happens next. Ministers have to come to Parliament by  January to make a statement setting out their proposals. Will the PM quit or face a leadership challengeshe loses the vote   Few Tory MPs seem happy with Mrs May’s leadership but important factors have somehow managed to keep her in power to date, and they haven’t changed. Tory MPs know they are likely to face voters’ anger and there is no agreed successor. If she resigns it could still be messy. Will there be an election  Theresa May would also have to lose an vote of confidence in the Commons in order for an election to occur. What is the latest stage at which a no-deal Brexit can be reversed   Some argue the only real deadline for a deal is  March . As long as a deal has been struck, and approved by Parliament in a meaningful vote by Brexit day, then Article  can be extended in order for the legislation to be passed. This could mean that evena deal was voted down the first time round it could be put in front of MPs again, possibly early next year.

The factions are so complicated and so fast-moving that we genuinely dont know for sureshe will win. So weve put together a guide to how things went down then - and how theyre going down now.  When the numbers are crunched, it is clear that Mrs May will have her work cut out to convince enough MPs to support her EU exit strategy. Now that a draft deal has been agreed between the EU and UK, there are three hurdles to overcome. The first is Cabinet, the second is  EU leaders, and the third and hardest is the UK Parliament. Its the third bit were worried about here. MPs are grouped in several factions - their warring opinions on it all are explained in more detail here. Even though they disagree on the reasons why, they could band together and vote down the deal - defeating Theresa May.  Here are the factions and where they sit.  MPs would be enough to defeat the PM. TORY LOYALISTS: More than  are likely to vote with Theresa May, for the deal. Many have paid government jobs - so would have to quitthey oppose her. TORY BREXITEERS: One source rubbished claims  Tory MPs could oppose the deal. But they conceded “ to  of the swivel-eyed lot” could line up against the plan. This group fears a Britain trapped in vassalage with Brussels, and includes Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg. TORY REMAINERS: Insiders believe up to  Tory Remainers could vote against the PM’s deal. They include former ministers Justine Greening, Jo Johnson and Phillip Lee. DUP: Theresa Mays Northern Irish allies - who she handed pound.bn - are -strong. They will vote down any deal that allows customs checks between Ulster and Britain. LABOUR LOYALISTS: About  MPs are consistently loyal to Jeremy Corbyn on Brexit. As things look now theyll vote against the deal because it wont meet Labours six tests for a good exit. LABOUR REMAINERS: There are about  hard Remainer Labour MPs. Theyre likely to oppose the deal to avoid enabling a Tory Brexit. NERVOUS LABOUR: Some Labour MPs could BACK a deal - fearing otherwise Britain will be plunged into an even worse No Deal. There could be  or more. Caroline Flint is among them. LABOUR BREXITEERS: There are only about half a dozen. It was generally thought theyd side with Theresa May, but Kate Hoey MP broke ranks and said she could vote against. Westminster sources have drawn up an “inner list” of Brexit-supporting Labour MPs they believe will back the PM. But it has just two names on it. OTHERS: The SNP , Lib Dems , Plaid Cymruand Greensare all likely to vote against. Eight Independent MPs sit in the Commons, though seven were elected for parties before either quitting their respective whips or having it withdrawn. Of those, three, possibly four, would back the PM, with another likely to vote against the deal because it does not deliver a hard enough Brexit.

Her plan looks dead on arrival when the Labour leader made crystal clear his party will vote against it alongside Brextremist rebels and, at the moment, DUP MPs in what would be a fatal personal blow. Corbyns accusation that Mays posing a  choice between a botched deal and no deal thats a failure on its own terms following two years of bungled negotiations hurt because its largely true. Picking at sovereignty and trade deal sores, this was the best Prime Ministers Questions performance for months from a Labour leader who mocked her and Brexit Secretary Dominic Raabs discovery of the importance of the Dover-Calais route to and from the Continent.  The usual Tory wall of noise behind May was largely quelled and her dig at Labour splits, Corbyn asserting Brexit cant be stopped and Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer insisting it can, lacked sharpness as Corbyn gave himself wriggle room by arguing he wouldnt frustrate it but he would oppose a Tory mess. This is a colossal crisis for Britain and not just May when her effective deputy David Lidington earlier today admitted the Brexit hes supporting would leave the country worse off.  How fiercely Mays fighting on two fronts, caught in a Remainer-Quitter pincer movement, was reinforced by Brextremist Tory Peter Bone warning shed lose support of their partys MPs and millions of voters. Caught between a rock and a hard place, negotiating with her fractious Cabinet then winning a vote in Parliament will be tougher than securing from  European neighbours the friendless Brexit withdrawal deal unloved before all  pages are published.

Mr Bone MP told Theresa May during Prime Ministers Questions: “Is the Prime Minister aware thatreports are accurate you are not delivering the Brexit people voted for and today you will lose the support of many Conservative MPs and millions of voters across the country.” The Prime Minister backed the deal on offer and said it delivered on the result of the  referendum.

This is political fraud, and I’m not putting my name to it. A Brexit deal between the UK and EU is set to be agreed. The final hurdle will be a vote in Parliament.

And the groom is captured in the stark landscape, his neatly tailored wedding suit soaked through by sheets of rain lashing the crags. But the results of their bold choice of venue are a series of stunning images that capture both the raw beauty of the wilderness setting and their love for each other.  Newly-weds James and Laura picked the Isle of Skye after considering locations around the globe. James, , and Lisa,  flew from their home in Chicago to the picturesque island for the unique shoot following their Scottish wedding ceremony on September .The couple, who have been together for four years, got in touch with Andrew Rae - a Scottish photographer - on Instagram after viewing his incredible gallery of past images.However, the pair were hit with strong winds and a barrage of mud as they posed for the set.  Lisa said: We anticipated cooler, misty, weather similar to that of the Pacic Northwest in the states. Boy, were we in for a surprise. The wind was unreal. The weather in Chicago fluctuates pretty regularly in spring and fall. We could have a week of F and have snow the next. We have a fair amount of wind that comes off of Lake Michigan, but nothing like the wind in Skye. I’m sure it was F and sunny back home on our wedding day.  Lisa said the couple took a while to decide on their perfect destination to elope but after spotting pictures of the Isle, their mind was made up. Lisa added: We wanted a unique wedding experience that was reflective of us. We both love the outdoors and are always up for an adventure. We were interested in a remote area overseas, the idea just seemed more romantic.  She added: Our first destination thought was French countryside, but the more I researched it, the more dficult it seemed to be due to the language barrier. Scotland continually came up as an elopement destination and neither of us had been before so we just kind of went with it. Photographs of Skye really solidied it as the perfect place for us.  The couple prepared for the weather conditions and Lisa said she didnt mind getting her wedding dress covered in mud. She added: It was expected. I searched for the perfect dress that could pack well and was lightweight for hiking around for this purpose. We wanted to end up in the fairy pools, but due to the weather we never made it. I’ve been dreaming of Skye every day since.  The newlyweds grew up just half a mile away from each other Lisa said: We knew of each other in high school but connected well after college at a neighbourhood bar. We now own a home in the same neighborhood we grew up in.  Lisa said she would recommend a similar shoot to anyone who wants incredible wedding photographs. She added: We planned to marry at Loch Coruisk but could not make the trip due to bad weather. We chose to marry at Honeycomb Rock, an area near the pier to travel to Loch Coruisk. Andrew’s photography skills are truly an art form. I never imagined I would look at such a beautul photograph and see myself in it.  We had such a wonderful experience, everyone was so warm and welcoming. The people really made the trip. For those interested, expect the worst with the weather and embrace it. And please, leave Skye as beautul as you found it.

William and Kate, both , headed to Barnsley in Yorkshire,  miles north of London, to see some young people being helped by homelessness charity Centrepoint. The charity was one of the first that William adopted in  – following his mother by being royal patron. Later William and Kate are expected at Buckingham Palace where Prince Charles will be feted for his th birthday. At the charitys hostel - where  young people stay - the couple helped prepare lunch. Stirring Omero’s Red Pepper and Chorizo soup and cutting bread. Kate said: Don’t look at how evenly I cut it,” as she sliced a loaf while William stirred some soup in the kitchen at the Quarry View hostel.  William then took a tray and gingerly walked into a second kitchen to sit down with two young people who’ve been helped by Centrepoint and two staffers for a bite to eat. I’m doing my balancing the soup act,” the prince said as he moved down the right corridor. Sorry to keep you waiting for your lunch — we’ve been talking too much as usual. As they sat down, William tried to put his neighbours at ease with this is not your usual lunch. Kate said: I think I cut some rather big slices. Don’t be put off by the size of Catherine’s bread. They’re enough to wedge the door, William added.  As they sat down to lunch, William joked with his neighbour Cha Jenkins, , about a little card they’d been given to help with how to address the royal couple and other protocol. Among other advice, it recommended calling royals Your Royal Highness and, on second mention, Sir or Ma’am . He just laughed about it,” Cha says. He said something about updating it. He was wonderful, easy to talk to. It has helped us and puts awareness out there that there are young people that need help and that Centrepoint have done that. He asked me about the obstacles that I’ve had in le. Centrepoint has helped me. They are very good listeners. The soup is part of the Big Broth project which raises money for Centrepoint. It was the winning entry to a contest to decide a soup that’s now on sale at Waitrose and Ocado online grocer. The charity also hopes people will use the soups to invite friends and family to share meals and raise some money for homeless people.  They then visited the new Andy Norman Learning Hub, which is a dedicated area and provide resources for them to improve their chances of moving towards independent living. The couple got to know some of the young people who’d been learning about Remembrance and the First World War as part of a le skills tutorial. Did you know much about it  Kate asked while William added, It’s such a big topic. I always think it’s the numbers that are quite startling — the millions who were killed.  The charity helps  people across the city. Last year, , young people in Yorkshire and the Humber approached their local authority because they were homeless or at risk. In Barnsley, Centrepoint is working to provide these young people with accommodation and support to get them back into education, training and employment. Earlier, around  miles away in Rotherham, the couple visited car-maker McLaren Automotive’s new Composites Technology Centre, meeting those working in the factory and chatting to some of McLaren’s STEM Ambassadors about their work encouraging children to get involved in science-based learning and careers. William and Kate, along with Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex have regularly encouraged young people to follow a path into STEM subjects at school, university and into careers.

Women across the globe are desperate to copy her looks and get their hands on whatever clothes she wears. Dubbed the Duchess effect her outfits usually sell out within hours of her being photographed in them. But even the most fashion forward of people can still slip up sometimes - something the Duchess of Sussex proved to be true over the weekend.  The expectant mother accompanied her husband and other family members to the Royal British Legion Festival of Remembrance at the Royal Albert Hall on Saturday November . On first glance the -year-old looked incredibly chic in a black Stella McCartney coat dress, which cleverly hid her baby bump thanks to a big bow. She wore her dark hair down, tucked behind her ears and paired the dress with a black clutch and heels. But people couldnt help notice that something about her ensemble was a little odd - and its all to do with her tights.  Meghan, who has famously opted to forgo wearing hosiery thus far, decided to put on a pair of shiny, nude tights for the event. And many people on social media were bemused by the way they looked. One person wrote: Meghan rewearing her fab Stella McCartney coat from Cardf visit, but I cannot get over the glare of these tights. Another said: What has happened to Meghan Markles tights  Has she spilt her wine   However others found this criticism incredibly offensive and highlighted how dficult it can be to find tights that match your skin colour. I feel so sorry for Meghan Markle because her every move is scrutinized because shes American, a commoner older and biracial. Now they are talking about her nude colour tights. They dont exactly match her skin tone. Well, this is a COMMON problem for women of colour, argued one Twitter user. Another added: Do we really have nothing better to talk about on Remembrance Day than Meghans tights  This isnt the first time the duchess has come under fire for her choice of hosiery.  In May, she wore a similar pair of tights to Prince Charles th birthday party at Buckingham Palace and was also criticised for them. She has since been seen stepping out in public with bare legs. Some have suggested that the decision to cover her skin may not have been her own - as it is commonly thought that the Queen has an unwritten rule about guests and family members wearing tights at royal events. However Marlene Koenig, royal expert and Royal Musings blog founder, told BAZAAR this isnt actually true. She said: There are no rules for royal women regarding pantyhose. While most womenwear pantyhouse with suits or gowns for a good slim line, it is not required by any decree from the Queen. What do you think of Meghans tights  Let us know in the comments below.

Jenna Lee-McCaffrey, , said she worried how she would pay for her sons first birthday and Christening after she was allegedly left out of pocket. The mum says she eventually got the money back but it was eight days after her food shop. She claims her family was left without electricity on Sunday because of how long it took to have the money ed to her account. The error on her bank account occurred after she went food shopping at the Asda in Pontprennau, Cardf last Tuesday, Wales Online reports. Jenna claims she was told her card payment for her pound. food bill had been declined.But after her card was charged for a second time she found two payments had been taken, she claims.  Jenna, from Rumney, said: The second payment went through so I went to my car and just thought I would check. The first payment had gone out and and the second was still pending to leave my bank account. I told the lady on customer services and she said as the pending payment was floating it would take three to five working days to get it back. On Sunday, Jenna and her family were left without electricity due to the time it took for the money to be put back into her account. As a result, she said she has had to throw out a full freezer of food that defrosted as a result. She said: My electric went off because I was pound down which would have saw me over to this week. I went shopping last Tuesday and paid my gas and electricity which was pound each. That was supposed to last me until Friday or Saturday but luckily it went until Sunday. On Sunday evening we had to sit in the dark. I had to get them ready for school without ironing their unorm because I had no electricity. I had to go up there on Monday and was there two hours trying to get something. I came away with pound just to be able to get something my kids for tea. I spoke to three managers and they said there was nothing they could do. There was absolutely no sympathy - I had my young baby with me.  Jenna says the time it took to get the money back caused her to worry about her youngest sons first birthday. She said: Its my sons first birthday this Sunday and its his Christening so Im finding it dficult to pay for anything. I dont get any child benefits for him as he was born after the third child barrier so everything I get for him I have to work for. This sent me over the edge. I was in tears over it. My family shouldnt be seeing me stressed because of all of this. Im not looking to gain anything from this or an extra shop, I just wanted it to be dealt with in a compassionate way. Jenna said the money was ed to her account on Wednesday morning, eight days after her food shop. She said: When I went up, there was another lady there having the same problem. This could have happened to an elderly person or a single mother using her last pound to buy her baby some food. An Asda spokesperson said: “We would like to apologise to Ms Lee-McCaffrey and her family for the inconvenience caused. We are glad her money was refunded by the relevant service provider and that she accepted a gesture of goodwill from us.” "},{"url":null,"title":"over 400 people form vigilante","story":"NewsMore than  people form vigilante group to tackle crime in lawless BritainBirmingham residents formed We Stand Determined after becoming fed up with anti-social behaviour and deciding to act as a second line of defence for the communityShareCommentsByNeil MurphyDan Coles:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsTwo organisers of the We Stand Determined group \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailConcerned residents have formed a vigilante group to tackle growing crime in their area after a spate of violent attacks. Nearly  locals have formed the group ‘We Stand Determined’ to report any dangers the Birmingham community may have faced. The group was put together on Facebook three weeks ago after an unsuccessful petition to get more police in the area. Organisers Wayne, Tracy and Michael founded the group after discovering a friend had been attacked in his home by thieves armed with hammers. They now organise twice-weekly patrols across the city. The group insists it is non-violent and seeks to work in partnership with the police while acting as a new line of defence for the community.  Solihull-based college lecturer Wayne, , who does not wish to reveal his surname over fears for his safety, said: The way our group started, and the reaction we’ve had, has showed us how much local communities need groups like us to fill in the gaps the authorities simply don’t have the funding for. There has been a recent spate of crime in Birmingham recently and Solihull in particular has fallen victim to an increase of just under , more cases so far this year. People needed someone to turn to, someone who will listen and visit them in their homea constituent is fearful for their own safety. We’re vigilantes, but we’re vigilantes with a twist, working within the law and not against it. Our group is a central place for the local community to come together to log crimes, comment and help stop crime in the area.  Birmingham has recently been blighted by a wave of stabbings, shootings and murders. Also plaguing the city are Corsa Cannibals known for stripping down Vauxhall Corsas to sell the parts on. Tracy said We Stand Determined is not against West Midlands Police as they understand the force can only do what they can with the funding they are given. But the group say this doesnt solve the problem of reduced Bobbies on the beat. We Stand Determined says it has big plans to generate a totally new level of support in the area by organising buddy systems for the elderly and defence classes for anyone who feels they need to be able to protect themselves.  It soon hopes to grow bigger and have representatives based in every area of the country so Wayne, Tracy and Michael can help everyone sleep a little easier. Tracy, , said: We stress to our members thatthey see something, they should noty the police first. We would like to join up with the police, but we want to be able to make our own decisions on where the help is really needed, and not where the police tell us to be.  Wayne added: We hope to gather funding to support out future objectives, at the moment we are totally self-funded. I just want to make a big dference to the area, and help anyone, anywhere, who needs it. Crime here is getting out of hand. We’re so proud of our community, for standing up to what we believe is an ongoing issue that’s yet to have a solution. A spokesman for West Midlands Police said officers were aware of multiple groups but advised members to join police-approved Streetwatch programmes instead.

Alana Burns, who is due to give birth in March, has crammed her kids Alisha, two, Steven, four, Cayden, seven, Leigh, , and Caitlin, , as well as adult children Stewart, , and Bryan, , in the flat above a pub. The family has squeezed into three of the four bedrooms as the fourth is uninhabitable due to a leak. Ms Burns said: My relationship with some of my children is at breaking point. We cant keep living like this. I just want to get out of this hell. Id rather live anywhere , as long as it is not in here. It has been really tough. The council has been out to the leak and said theyd get in touch with me, I have heard nothing. The family was living in a private let in nearby Livingston until her landlord decided to sell the property in August. They spent a month in hotels before West Lothian Council found the Bathgate flat in September.  But Ms Burns added: Im feeling down every night and sometimes you just feel like giving up. But I just have to keep going for the sake of the kids. It is not safe for anyone to be sleeping in that room so were now down to eight people sharing three bedrooms which is ridiculous. Ms Burns says the flat, which does not have a television or room outside in which her children can play, also has uneven flooring, damaged ceilings, noisy neighbours and is not receiving post. She is having to pay out pound a day on electricity and claims a third party is using her supply. The mother continued: We all have to wake up at .am and a taxi picks the kids up at .am to take them to school in Livingston. I need a proper house where I can bring up my children. The whole situation is unbelievable. My kids cant go out to play here. The road in front is busy and there is a car park at the back of the property so it isnt safe. All the kids are stuck inside all night crammed in without any TV. There is no way were using anywhere near that level of electricity. We wouldnt be herewe had a choice but we need to now get out as soon as possible.  A West Lothian Council spokesman said: It can be challenging to find suitable accommodation for large families who present themselves as homeless, given the limited stock of larger homes available. In this case, the council arranged for temporary accommodation from a private landlord to try and meet their housing needs until a permanent home could be found. Previous repairs notied by Ms Burns have been fixed by the landlord. The leak was only notied to us on November , with a repair to be arranged soon. We would encourage Ms Burns to engage with the offers of support already made, to allow us to help find a solution for her familys housing needs. This includes widening her choice of areas to maximise her opportunities for permanent housing.

The heir to the throne was born at Buckingham Palace on Nov. , , four years before his now -year-old mother ascended to the throne following the death of her father George VI. As Britains heir apparent, Charles has waited longer than any of his predecessors to become monarch and would be the oldest-ever king in a lineage that dates back , years.  Prime Minister Theresa May paid tribute to Charles in parliament on Wednesday. Throughout the Prince of Wales le his commitment to public service has been total, she said. The more one looks atle, the more one sees a man who has spent  years defying expectations and refusing to be categorised. Charles has used his unique position to campaign on issues including climate change, architecture and farming, often challenging orthodox views. You have to make of it what you feel is right - theres nothing laid down so thats what makes it so interesting, challenging and of course complicated, he said in a BBC documentary aired last week. It comes after new pictures show Charles in the garden of his London home Clarence House together with his second we Camilla, sons William and Harry, their wives Kate and Meghan along with William and Kates children, George, Charlotte and Louis.  In the BBC film, William said he hoped his hard-working father would spend more time with his grandchildren and ease up on his busy schedule. Hes the fittest man I know but equally I want him to be fit until hes , you know, going on. So having more time with him at home would be lovely, William said, although he acknowledged that Charles still believed he had much to achieve. He hasnt even reached the point that his natural progression should do - ie being monarch - so hes still got his job to do, he said.

According to a Channel  documentary called The Royal House of Windsor, Charles honorary grandfather Lord Mountbatten never wanted the young prince to be with Camilla, so attempted to set him up with his granddaughter, Amanda Knatchbull.

His favourite dish is a fancy twist on a classic, its Greek moussaka but made with grouse instead of lamb and is inspired by pheasant crumble pie. Writing in Country Le, he said: I got this recipe from someone I know. It is delicious.  I invented a grouse one recently, coq au vin with grouse, as well as mousakka with grouse. It doesnt always have to be lamb - in other words, groussaka! Grouse are wild birds found around the UK. Hunters will shoot the birds for the gamey meat, but its not the sort of food youll find in your typical supermarket. Charles adds it to moussaka, which is normally made by layering aubergine, potato and ground lamb topped with a creamy sauce.Its a very upmarket addition to the meal.

The woman, from Cheshire, was reported to police after she appeared to write on a secret Facebook group that she had used the potentially lethal treatment on her son.The highly-covert group is for parents who believe autism - a lelong, developmental disability - is caused by parasites. The groups , members, who are allegedly charged pound to join, share images of the so-called parasites leaving their children after treatment while congratulating themselves. But autism campaigner Emma Dalmayne claims the shocking images in fact show childrens bowel linings that have been burned out of their bodies by the bleach.  The treatment, known as CDor MMS , is administered orally or via enema and is being sold in the UK by online dealers and in person. Emma infiltrated the Facebook group and discovered the mother from Cheshire appearing to confess to using CD on her young son and reported her to Cheshire Police. Posts from the mum appear to show her admitting to administering  drops a day to her son, but becoming worried when he seemed weak and wouldnt get out of bed. Emma is calling for the government to ban the treatments and has launched at petition calling for alleged autism cures to be made illegal, which has more than , signatures.  Emma, an autistic mum-of-six from London, said: No parents will admit to doing this to their children publicly. This treatment is not illegal at the moment but we need to get rid of it. These parents are so ashamed of doing it in the first place. These people are brainwashed by [proponents of CD and MMS], who say that those against this support big pharma. The biggest problem is that the government dont do anything about this. This is not illegal yet. It is not illegal to use CD on your children and it needs to be. The most extreme case I have seen to date is a six-year-old boy who had to have his bowel removed and a colostomy bag fitted after his parents gave him these enemas. What you see in these images is the bowel lining of these victims. Some of the people who disagree with my campaigning have told me I should die, Im a whore, my children are vaccine damaged, I wont heal them because I want them to be autistic and I claim disability allowance so it wouldnt be profitable to heal them. It makes me so angry as an autistic person. Im furious that people want to heal this. There is no cure for autism. It isnt a disease or a disorder, its a neurological dference.  The Food Standards Agency issued a warning that both MMS and CD should be avoided and that the concentration of MMS is equivalent to industrial strength bleach. The mother, whose son is severely autistic, refused to respond to attempts to speak to her. A spokesperson from Cheshire Police said: This is an ongoing incident and we are investigating whether any criminal offences have taken place. Another parent, from Leicestershire, who claimed on the group that she had used MMS on her baby daughter, asked the group membersshe was doing alright because the baby was OK. The woman and her husband, both originally from Algeria, claimed they did not want to comment and had noticed how opinions y about this treatment. Her husband said: She is not happy to talk about. We are not there yet. I therefore have nothing  to say.  On the Facebook group, there is advice on how to make protocol , testimonials and also safe online practices information. Guidelines on the group that were published in  advise members that use of CD is beyond the mainstream standard of care and can get you into trouble. It also saystherapists, nurses or school officials come to your home please keep your supplies and dosing discreet. Recent posts from the website show concerned parents listing abnormal symptoms after administering CD to their autistic children. One mother posted: Hi everybody, my son has the last few days blue lips, is that normal . Others respond saying no, that is not normal. Check his heart. The concerned mother replied Im worried now. What can it be  But it started after we used CD.  On July , another parent posted a graphic image of her daughters dirty nappy with long pieces of bowel lining laid out on a piece of kitchen roll. The mother asks members to identy what parasite it is, and one respondent claims her daughter must be doing bettershe expelled this without even an enema. An admin posted this is good. Keep doing enemas to pull them out. On July , a member posted a picture of a parasite she had expelled dangling from a fork - though Emma believes it is cm of a childs bowel lining. Along with the Facebook group, Genesis II church also advertises the use of MMS on their website and lists sellers of the treatment. The organisation has  churches worldwide, including one in London and Co. Kildare, Ireland. It offers a ten-day course for members to train as MMS doctors or ministers, after which they could be able to open their own church. Once the ministers have healed  people, they will be given a doctorate degree. It also includes details about how it not only cures autism, but cancer, dementia, HIV, tumours and genital warts. Holistic therapist Danielle Bryant, from Wales, was warned repeatedly by the Food Standards Authorityand Medical and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agencylast month thatMMS was not deleted from her website it would be closed down. She admits that she was a health minister for the Genesis II church after attending one of their courses on how to make MMS, but claims she only ever used it on herself. Danielle said: Ive never really sold it. I have only ever made it for myself. I put the MMS on my website, but I never had any takers. The FSA contacted me to say they would take down my websiteI didnt take down [the link for MMS. I used MMS for a few things and that was quite a few years ago. Id read about it and I had a positive outcome. I just did the [Genesis II] course around six years ago.

He allegedly told detectives that he flew into a rage and strangled Shanann after catching her in the act on a baby monitor screen. But police rejected Wattss story and charged him with three counts of first-degree murder. Bella and Celestes bodies were found on the property of Anadarko Petroleum, one of Colorados largest oil and gas drillers. Shanann was discovered dead in a shallow grave nearby.

However, he didnt give any further details. He said: I dont feel like this is even real right now. Its like a nightmare I cant wake up from. Watts allegedly eventually confessed to police after giving a number of interviews to national media. Police said he led officers to Shananns body. Ahead of Wattss guilty pleas last week, it had been reported that the killer was on suicide watch and was not doing well at all. A source told People: “The gravity of the situation has hit him like a ton of bricks. Depression is setting in, and he’s despondent.  Shanann and her daughters were laid to rest on September .

The woman, known only as Sangita, was admitted to the hospital suffering from severe stomach pains. Concerned, doctors ran a series of tests to see what might be behind her painful symptoms. They were left totally dumbfounded when they saw a lump in her stomach containing dozens of foreign objects. The patient,was thought to have swallowed the items over long periods of time causing the metal to build up and her stomach to harden.  Dr Nitin Parmar, senior surgeon at the Ahmedabad Civil hospital in India said:“The stomach of the woman had become rock hard. When we conducted the X-ray, it showed a lump in her stomach. Safety pins consumed by her had partially perforated her lungs, a pin that she had consumed even punctured her stomach walls prompting us to carry out the surgery immediately.”  Doctors were then given the grim task of removing the ious items she had consumed, many of which were sharp and metallic.  One item recovered in the procedure was a mangalsutra, a traditional necklace worn by married Hindu women. Stranger still was the reason why she had consumed these items in the first place.  Sangita was thought to be suffering from acuphagia a rare disorder where a person consumes sharp metallic and indigestible objects. Prior to her surgery and admission to a government hospital she was found wandering the streets. After a few days, she started complaining of the pain in her stomach.

Northern Chiles Atacama desert has adapted to surviving without water for over  million years but unusual levels of rainfall have now seriously damaged the rare ecosystem and its uniques microbes. The region is constantly under observation from experts because the extreme dryness is regarded as a good analogue for Mars studies. As with Mars, the soil is extremely poor in organic le and yet it is still inhabited by microbial species from the three domains of le which are both dryness and radiation tolerant, and have lived in the region since the Jurassic period.  The situation in the hyperarid heart of the Atacama desert in northern Chile that has seen consecutive rains for the first time in  years has shocked scientists. Rather than supporting the development of le in the desert, they say the rain has destroyed it. The team from the Centre of Astrobiology say that the rain has devastated the microbial species that live there and were accustomed to no rain, according to the study published in Scientic Reports magazine. The recent rains have been attributed to climate change and investigator Armando Azua-Bustos explained: Our group has discovered that the contribution of water has not meant a development of le in the Atacama, has caused a huge devastation of the microbial species that lived in these places before the precipitation. They added: ... the sudden and massive input of water in regions that have remained hyperarid for millions of years is harmful for most of the surface soil microbial species, which are exquisitely adapted to survive with meagre amounts of liquid water, and quickly perish from osmotic shock when water becomes suddenly abundant.  The study said the indigenous micro-organisms that were perfectly adapted to live in the extremely dry conditions were unable to adapt to the new conditions and  percent of microbial le in the areas studied has been destroyed. The Atacama desert is one of the driest places in the world and is the only true desert to receive less precipitation than the polar deserts.

Buruli ulcers, also known as Mycobacterium ulcerans, is an infectious disease which kills off skin cells, small blood vessels and fat under the skin. As the bug buries deeper into a sufferers body, ulcers begin to form before eventually a person is at risk of losing their whole limb. Cases of the bug are on the rise in parts of Australia, with Victorias Department of Health and Human Service raising concerns about the number of victims. Dr Brett Sutton commenting on the rise said: It may be that mosquitoes are biting possums and are biting people.  It might be that the possum faeces in the environment then contaminates it and people are getting it into their skin through cuts or scratches. In , there were just two cases of the bug, before this rose to  last year, reports nine.au. Experts are predicting this year will see  new cases of people infected by the flesh-eating bug. The bug can leave sufferers needing months of recovery. Jett, , had to learn to walk again after developing a Buruli ulcers that put him in hospital for three months.

He said, I think that you need to go to Brisbane, and theres a real chance thatwe dont find out what this is, he will lose his leg. The Victorian government donated millionfor research on the ulcer and Dr Sutton said half has already been spent. The bug can often start as a small painless bump, similar to a common insect bite which grows and swells over a number of weeks.  The bump usually becomes painful and can lead to a mild fever before turning bright red and crusty - with a scab that wont heal. The scab then disintegrates as the bump turns into an ulcer. Treatment involves either oral antibioticscaught early enough or surgery to remove a small amount of healthy tissue around the affected area to get rid of the infection completely. In some cases, more complex surgery may be needed where a skin graft of health skin is transplanted over the ulcer.

While looking incredible for his age, Mickey Mouse has undergone some big changes across nine decades . For example, the first ever version of the lovable character was actually called Mortimer and only for Walt Disneys we Lillian did he get re-branded with his new moniker, Mickey. Now Disney are inviting the world to join in the celebrations and step into his world - born from the mind of a total genius. As part of a host of celebrations to mark  years of Mickey, Disney has launched the True Original Exhibition in New York as well as a free art exhibition in London.  The interactive New York pop-up is a tidal wave of all things Mickey - from original work commissioned by contemporary artists, to the very first motion sketch of the loveable rodent himself. New Yorks True Original Exhibition features original work by  artists - each bringing their own flare in pieces representing what Mickey means to them. This is far from a simple gallery of exhibits - its a total multi-sensory experience. British artist Michael Bosanko was approached by Disney to make his own contribution to the New York exhibition in the form of his light paintings.  His work is created using light to draw images in mid-air, capturing it on camera in a single shot. Speaking about being a part of the Mickey th celebrations, Michael, based near Caerphilly in South Wales, said: Mickey is just such an icon and hes an image recognised across the whole world. I was approached to take part and immediately said yes. Some of the artists are as young as  and have come from dferent walks of le, each creating totally unique and inspiring pieces and Im immensely proud of what weve created collectively. Its an honour to show my work alongside them and be a part of the True Original th celebration. The ,sq ft exhibition itself is set across  rooms - each filled with something truly jaw-dropping - cameras must constantly be at the ready!  The Mirror had the chance to step into this marvellous Mickey world in New York - and to say expect the unexpected is an understatement. The exhibits start in the early days of Mickeys le, in his first ever motion pictures Steamboat Willie and Plane Crazy. Stepping from the introduction cinema room to the first black and white exhibition room is more like taking a leap from the real world straight into a Mickey cartoon itself. The room is filled with D sculptures and floor to ceiling posters of old school Mickey - and of course his long-suffering girlfriend Minnie. The rooms seamlessly flow from one to the next, with each presenting a magical feast for the eyes, often including thought-provoking, contemporary works. In the fourth room, named Ink  Paint, visitors are transported from Mickeys black and white days to a world of stunning technicolour, paying homage to the team of artists and painters in Disneys legendary painting department.  Other rooms document the creation of some of Mickeys most-loved appearances - including his first featurefilm, Fantasia. Exhibit curator Darren Romanelli said: I’m incredibly excited to bring Mickey Mouse back to New York City where Steamboat Willie premiered. The moment becomes even more special by being able to pair art world legends like Kenny Scharf alongside today’s top emerging artists in an exhibition unlike anything we’ve ever seen. These artists have all been touched by the magic of Disney and the experience will reflect that through and through. I can’t wait for the world to see it all come to le. The history of Mickey Mouse Mickey Mouse began le as a basic sketch in  and was created as a replacement for Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. Walt Disney had entered a dispute with his business partner at Universal, and lost the rights to Oswald - triggering the birth of the worlds most famous mouse. Originally called Mortimer Mouse, the moniker didnt last long after Walt Disneys we Lillian said she hated the name and suggested it be changed to Mickey. The first Mickey short to receive signicant attention with synced music and sound was Steamboat Willie, an animation released in November . This was quickly followed by a second animated short, Plane Crazy - and by the end of  - Mickey had become a national fad.  Mickey stayed silent in eight animated shorts, before squeaking his first words in  - hot dogs - in The Karnival Kid. Until then, he had only giggled and squeeled. Bolstered by the marketing and advertising, Walt Disney launched a line of Mickey merchandise and within two years of his creation, the Mickey Mouse fan club for children was set up. Mickey looked much the same for the next seven years, before a young animator called Fred Moore gave him his first makeover - and introduced the Mickey we all know and love today. Previously, Mickeys simplistic design comprised of a series of circles, limiting his movement in animation, before Fred adapted his body to a pear shape, added pupils to his eyes, shortened his nose to make him cuter and added a pair of the now-famous Mickey gloves. By , Disney Studios was producing around  Mickey short animations every year and had the world gripped.  By the s, Mickeys fame had led to theme parks opening in his name, newspaper comic strips, toys, books and magazines. He was officially a household name. Mickey has gone on to become to a pancultural character and brand, with Disney claiming the mouse had a % awareness among children between - worldwide - beating Father Christmas. And despite the huge number of Disney characters which have been created over the last  years, Mickey still represents the true original icon. As Walt Disney said himself: I only hope that we never lose sight of one thing -that it was all started by a mouse.

The mum-of-three from Victoria, Canada, was also diagnosed with sleep apnea three years ago after constantly feeling exhausted despite sleeping for up to nine hours a night. Fearing the problems serious health problems that can be brought out on by the breathing disorder including an increased risk of a heart attack, diabetes and more, she knew she had to change. She switched her high calorie diet for an Isagenix programme, consuming two protein shakes, a healthy meal and healthy snacks. Within a month she lost a stone and a halfand now shes dropped more than half her body weight, as well as ten dress sizes.  Now weighing st lbs , she was a finalist in a body transformation challenges and has qualied for the World Beauty Fitness and Fashion Show. Julie, who manages family business Millstream Self Storage, said: Before I had one foot in the grave,that wasnt a wake-up call I dont know what  was. I was told I would need a machine to help with my sleep apnea for the rest of my le. I was horried to have my husband sleep beside me, I didnt feel attractive with the machine and couldnt let my teenage daughters see me with the mask on my face. I dont think I was comfortable with any of my body parts before but now I love showing off my arms, legs and stomach. My husband says when he sees before photos of my back you can see how much my shape has changed. He described it as looking like a caterpillar with lots of rolls and no ident of a waist because my stomach stuck out really far.  I had no bottom, I was kind of rectangular, now Im a shapely beautul butterfly. My husband calls me hot Julie, he is just really amazed, he loved me big and loves me small, but thinks Im really hot now. He feels like he married two dferent women. I always felt beautul inside but now the outside reflects that too. Julie was overweight since childhood and remembers being mocked for her larger clothing and taking salads to school. She would regularly lose weight, which she would then put back on and then some. It additionally hit home in  when she struggled to go on a hike with her friend and forced them both to head back less than half way in. Julie said: I had a friend who liked big walks, I had previously been able to do them with her, but when I went on a hike I couldnt make it half way before having to turn around and go back down. I couldnt make it through and was so disappointment with myself, I was holding her back and I was already struggling on the easy parts  minutes in.  Her cousin told her about Isagenix and encouraged her to try to -day trial - within a month she had lost lbs. Julie said: She was looking a lot leaner and more muscle without exercising other than walking. It felt like the weight was falling off me, every day I woke up the scale was going down. Julie was announced a finalist of the Isagenix IsaBody Challenge earlier this year, celebrating her remarkable transformation. Her newfound le has led her to run her first k and even inspired husband Murray, , to five stone . Julie said: To be selected as a finalist was incredible, it was a huge challenge with over , submissions so being chosen was amazing and still to this day feels surreal. Previously for photographs I would hide by putting my children in front of me so you could see nothing more than my shoulders and face. Now I love my reflection when I look in the mirror, I love the confidence I see and Ive found Im looking people in the eye a lot more and smiling.

For the -plus who travelled to watch the weekend win at Ross County, it might be well nigh impossible.Because at the Global Energy Stadium on Saturday, Neilson’s Tangerines looked every inch the kind of side that finish top of this notoriously dficult of leagues. That was largely down to there being nothing pretty about this win.Under McKinnon, Laszlo and even Neilson already, United have shown when it comes to quality football,everything clicks there’s not a team in the second tier who can live with them.They can pass any side off the park, keep possession and conjure enough chances to comfortably win a game.For all but a few sides with genuine aspirations to win the Championship, however, that’s seldom enough. This is a ision where the team finishing first must also have the ability to grind out wins.It’s what St Mirren did last season, Hibs the one before and even Rangers found they had to be able to do as they got up two years ago.Even Neilson’s young Hearts side that galloped away with the title in  did, on the few occasions when necessary, show they could dig deep and battle for points.Now, and arguably for the first time since they dropped down from the top flight, it’s a quality United possess.They ended County’s nine-game unbeaten home run since the start of the campaign, not through playing the kind of football of which we know they’re capable, but by standing up to the physical challenge that’s always posed by the home side up there.Yes, United had to do plenty defending, but through a clear game plan, organisation and a willingness of players to put their bodies on the line, it was executed so well that, for all their territorial dominance, the Staggies had very few clear sights of goal.A nice bonus stemming from that fact was, for the first time in his short tenure, in the build-up to the game injuries were a signicant issue.Frederic Frans and Callum Booth were doubts last week and unable to train with the rest of the squad until a Friday session confirmed they wouldn’t make it. In William Edjenguele and Paul Watson, the manager found able deputies.He’s said since he arrived at Tannadice winning promotion would take a squad of highly committed players.He now knows he has that and try as they might not to, the fans must be getting excited."},{"url":null,"title":"wetherspoons-bans-dogs-from-all-pubs","story":"POPULAR pub chain Wetherspoons has banned dogs from all of its branches."},{"url":null,"title":"mobile-providers-charging-customers-for-phones-already-paid-off","story":"AN estimated four million UK mobile phone users have been charged pound million for handsets they already own, a charity has warned."},{"url":null,"title":"hydro-turns-five-meet-the-head-of-entertainment-who-spoke-on-anniversary","story":"OVER five million concert-goers in five years have visited the SSE Hydro...a figure which has exceeded the expectations of the woman responsible for bringing some of the worlds biggest acts to Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-takeaway-launches-deep-fried-mars-bar-calzone","story":"A GLASGOW takeaway has launched one of the worlds unhealthiest pizzas - a deep fried MARS BAR calzone containing around , calories."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-and-meghan-expecting-first-baby","story":"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are expecting a baby in spring , Kensington Palace has announced."},{"url":null,"title":"teen-bakes-grandads-ashes-into-biscuits-and-shares-with-classmates","story":"A high school student mixed her cremated grandfatherrsquos ashes into homemade sugar biscuits and shared them with several classmates, police in Calornia said on Wednesday."},{"url":null,"title":"rbs-paid-contractors-400-a-day-to-stuff-envelopes","story":"Royal Bank of Scotland paid contractors a staggering pound a day to stuff envelopes, wasting thousands of pounds of taxpayersrsquo money in the process, it can be revealed."},{"url":null,"title":"no-payout-for-celtic-fan-after-slip-injury","story":"A CELTIC fan who intended to sue the club for pound, after claiming a spilled drink caused him to fall and suffer injuries, has not been awarded any cash."},{"url":null,"title":"scots-clubs-set-to-bank-up-to-20m-from-new-scottish-cup-tv-deal","story":"THE SFA will bank up to pound million from a deal with BBC Scotland and satellite broadcaster Premier Sports to broadcast William Hill Scottish Cup games for the next six seasons."},{"url":null,"title":"im-a-celebrity-line-up-meet-this-years-campers","story":"A football manager, an ex-EastEnder and a former Doctor Who and Glasgow actor are among the famous faces set to brave the jungle for this yearrsquos Irsquom a Celebrityhellip Get Me Out Of Here!"},{"url":null,"title":"plans-submitted-for-new-mcdonalds-in-glasgows-east-end","story":"NEW plans have been submitted for a McDonalds drive-thru restaurant in Glasgows East End."},{"url":null,"title":"surge-in-buckfast-sales-blamed-on-minimum-pricing-trade-off-from-high-strength-ciders","story":"IT was a landmark pricing policy designed to transform Scotlands troublesome relationship with alcohol."},{"url":null,"title":"flip-out-offering-free-trampoline-sessions-for-schools","story":"MENTAL Health minister Clare Haughey had a spring in her step as she announced a free trampoline for schools programme."},{"url":null,"title":"top-scottish-blogger-emily-shakgough-to-meet-fans-in-glasgow","story":"TOP blogger Emily Shakgough will meet her Glasgow fans as the face of a top lingerie firm."},{"url":null,"title":"holidays-are-coming-all-the-christmas-adverts-on-tv-so-far","story":"GLASGOWS Christmas tree is officially up, George Square will light up the skies this weekend and the citys style mile is already getting busier - the holidays are officially on their way."},{"url":null,"title":"win-a-fantastic-diy-makeover-with-city-building-and-the-evening-times","story":"LIFE can be a challenge ndash no-one knows that more than Robert McGhee."},{"url":null,"title":"libby-mcarthur-age-denial-maybe-there-is-something-in-it","story":"In my teens and not long after my Guinea pig had died, my Dad said to be careful as the felt tip I was using was a permanent marker.

So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Star lost possession in midfield and Connor Crawford’s clearance was closed down by the Kings Park forward whose shot beat Kalache from the edge of the box and the hosts took a - lead on the hour mark.This visibly knocked the confidence of the Star team and Kings added a second goal when poor play again from Star trying to break gted possession to the hosts and once again their striker was on hand to make it - and give Star a mountain to climb in the last twenty minutes.Star didn’t give up however and could have been back in the game when the ball fell to Gregor Peacock in the box, the ing striker hit the shot and the ball was saved by the Kings Park goalkeeper.Kyle Selfridge went close to claiming a late leline but his free kick from twenty yards cannoned off the bar and the game finished - to the home side.The Star management team were disappointed as that’s the first time the Lochgilphead side have failed to score in the league in more than two years.On Saturday November  Red Star play host to Campbeltown pupils in what looks like another tough league match.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13563563.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_boyle.jpg","title":"danny boyles armistice tribute pages","story":"NewsDanny Boyles Armistice tribute Pages of the Sea to honour British Armys first black officer on Ayr beachA large-scale portrait of Walter Tull designed by sand artists Sand In Your Eye, will be drawn into the sand on the beach and washed away as the tide comes in.ShareByAbi Smillie:,  NOV NewsLieutenant Walter Tull\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe first black officer in the British Army will be commemorated on Ayr beach as part of director Danny Boyle’s Armistice commission Pages of the Sea. Lieutenant Walter Tull, was Britain’s second black professional footballer who had signed up with Rangers, and trained as an officer cadet in Gailes, Ayrshire. Walter- along with millions of other soldiers- will be honoured on Sunday, November  in a nationwide gesture of remembrance. A large-scale portrait of Walter Tull designed by sand artists Sand In Your Eye, will be drawn into the sand on the beach and washed away as the tide comes in. And the public will be asked to join in by creating silhouettes of people in the sand, remembering the millions of lives lost or changed forever by the conflict. The project is the latest collaboration between the National Theatre of Scotland and - NOW, the UK’s arts programme for the World War  centenary, and will use  beaches all around the UK as their canvasses for the mass art-work. Each of the beaches taking part in the project will commemorate a dferent WW casualty.  Walter Tull was born to Alice Elizabeth Palmer, from Kent, and Daniel Tull from Barbados, the son of a slave, on April , . After the death of his parents he and his brother Edward were placed in a children’s home in Bethnal Green. Edward was later adopted and it is believed that he went on to be Britain’s first black dentist after taking over his father’s practice on St Vincent Street in Glasgow. Walter, however, began playing football with Tottenham Hotspur in , and after touring South America with them he was offered a contract, making him the second black professional footballer in Britain. When playing for Tottenham and later Northampton Town he faced a lot of racial abuse and prejudice, yet he went on to have a successful football career. In , Northampton Town began negotiations to transfer Tull to Glasgow Rangers. However, the First World War broke out before Tull could play a game for Rangers. He enlisted as a private in the Footballers’ Battalion of the British Army, where he was quickly promoted to be a sergeant. He took part in and survived the Battle of the Somme, after which he was sent to England to recover from illness. He then went to train as an officer cadet in Gailes, Ayrshire.

more than , bin collections each year.Figures released through a freedom of information request show that over the last five years, council bin crews have failed to empty more than , bins from around , households.Furthermore, the number of bins missed each year has been rising since , when , bins collections were missed.Three years later, in , that number had risen to ,, and already this year , bins have been missed.Opposition councillors have lined up to criticise the figures, particularly in the wake of allegations that Scottish Borders Council is considering moving to three-weekly bin collections when the budget is proposed in February of next year.Hawick and Denholm councillor Clair Ramage said: ldquoBin collection is a very emotive subject and as councillors we receive many complaints over this very issue.ldquoTo see that there has been a rise in the number of missed bin collections is extremely alarming and has to be investigated as a matter of urgency but this is only the tip of the iceberg.ldquoIn the last month we have been informed that Scottish Borders Council is considering tri-weekly uplts, a change that I am completely opposed to.ldquoAt the moment Scottish Borders Council is struggling as we have seen householders use their recycling bins for general waste when their general waste bins are full.ldquoThis creates other problems, the recycling vehicles are then contaminated with general waste and have to pay penalties to the processing company.ldquoIf bi-weekly lts are not working then tri weekly lts will create even more problems, for example fly tipping.ldquoI realise that budgets are tight but the combination of missed bin collections resulting in rubbish spilling over encouraging vermin is not something that as a community we should accept.Hawick and Hermitage councillor Watson McAteer also commented: \"I do not recall missed bin collections being a statistic that is regularly shared with councillors. Perhaps the fact that for whatever reason , bins have failed to be collected explains why this is not on public record.ldquoI am regularly receiving complaints from constituents who find their bins still full on the pavement after the collection date.ldquoWhile of course there will always be occasions when the council have no control of the situation the figures being produced certainly challenge the current collection policy.ldquoCan you imagine the problems this would causethree-weekly collection was to be introduced  I for one will not support such a move and would ask the council to explain to council tax payers why this problem exists and what they are doing to resolve it.According to data collected by the Local Government Benchmarking Framework, which is a comparison network for Scottish councils, . per cent of Scottish Borders are satisfied with their local refuse collection.However, this is below the Scottish average of . per cent and is the second lowest of the rural and island councils that Scottish Borders Council is grouped with.The council also spends pound. per premises on waste disposal, which is below the Scottish average of pound..Leader of the opposition and Tweeddale East councillor Stuart Bell said that Scottish Borders Council officers work hard to recty issues, but residents need to be aware of how to report missed bin collections.He said: ldquoI will be interested in the councilrsquos conclusions on the long term trend. As I recall there has been a gradual introduction of food waste collections into the larger communities in the last few years, so the number of total collections may have increased at the same time as the number of missed collections has increased.ldquoBut I am concerned to see the detail of missed bin collections. I had expected, and can see, that the number of missed collections is higher in the winter months when the teams can have dficulty getting round in the snow, but it is worrying that the level of missed collections never drops below  in any one month. ldquoThe public needs to know that there is a very easy mechanism of reporting missed collections on the councilrsquos website and, in my experience, refuse and recycling staff at Scottish Borders Council do follow-up on issuesthere is a systematic cause.A spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said that the number of bins left unemptied each year is actually very small compared to the number the council collection.The authorityrsquos waste management service says it collects around .m bins each year, meaning the number of missed bins equates to less than half a per cent.The spokesperson said: ldquoThe number of missed bin collections over the last five years will be dependent on a number of factors including: the provision of a new weekly food waste service to around , households in  access issues due to obstruction and road closures vehicle breakdowns adverse weather service error an increase in the number of new homes which bins are collected from each year and bins not being presented by householders by am on scheduled collection days and incorrectly reported as missed.ldquoIt is not possible to determine the exact cause of any increase in missed collections but the increasingly challenging winters experienced across the Borders will be having an impact.ldquoThat was the case this year, when the extreme winter conditions experienced in January, February and March caused signicant disruption, with three full days where collections were unable to be carried out across the Borders.ldquoHouseholders reporting a missed collection over this period will have contributed signicantly to the increase this

She is originally from another European country but has made Haddington her home, with her husband and two wonderful children.Her explorations of nearby woods led her to discover an unusual grave amongst the trees. It is a grave of a horse, buried in the th century. It was this grave she had offered to show me. To get there we had a beautul walk along a secluded section of the banks of the Tyne. It was the trees I noticed first, of course, which were dotted along the banks of the river.Autumn was just then beginning to brush the trees with its colour, and it was one of those evenings when the setting sun seemed to take its time, bathing the land in bright streaks of orange light. Along the way, Marije paused and said: ldquoThis is my tree.It was a beech tree of signicant age, its branches arching over the Tyne, asfishing. She showed me her sitting place, underneath its embracing canopy. Here the roots curved to make a natural seat. Her older son spoke of seeing kingfishers, and sure enough, this was a perfect place to absorb the majesty of the Tyne as it flowed towards Haddington. Another beech of similar age grew close by. Their branches entwined, making it look like they were sisters holding hands.But I sensed then there was more to Marijersquos connection to this place, although I then had no idea just how powerful her story was.When we finally got to our destination in the woods further upriver, the light was too weak to penetrate the trees. The old grave of the horse was shrouded in darkness.Yet with the help of mobile torches we could view it, and for sure the grave was interesting and worth a story in its own right. I vowed to find out more about its background as we headed back to Marijersquos house in the dying embers of a sunset.When we reached her house we were treated to wonderful hospitality. It was then that Marije told her story of the beech tree.Not long ago she had been diagnosed with cancer. She faced the possibility of being taken by this cruel disease. Numbness and disbelief at first overcame her, then there was the realisation that le might be very short and she would have to leave her two young children.She walked to the beech tree soon after her diagnosis and sat cradled by its roots. Despite having family and friends whose love and support was invaluable, Marije explained it can also be a desperately lonely feeling. ldquoWe all know we canrsquot live forever, she told me, ldquobut to face the reality of my end at such a young age and with children was unbearable.ldquoI went on that walk to the tree in the most dire situation, she told me. ldquoI felt a connection as I sat under the tree, I really felt her old wisdom and energy.Her love for her young children is what gave her strength in the worst of times. The tree seemed to symbolise this powerful bond, its roots deeply holding it safe.ldquoPeople talk about mother nature, Marije said, ldquoand I understand why. When my hair fell out, I lsquogave it backrsquo to nature, underneath the beech. I know it makes me sound weird, but it really helped me.It is not weird, of course. Trees are full of wisdom, not in the sense of actual words but in the spiritual sense. Beech is said to be the matriarch of the wood, sometimes called the mother of the forest. It is a good listener. Our best ideas and inner reflections can come when we sit under the embrace of an old tree even science tells us this now.Sadly not everyone wins the fight against cancer, but thankfully Marije recovered after treatment. The experience has left her treasuring every single day and taking no sunrise for granted. And she is thankful to her beech tree, which was her companion and confidant in those times of emotional agony. It remains for her a place of contemplation and peace, where she can give thanks and absorb the joy of being alive.ldquoI cherish every day now in ways I didnrsquot before, she told me. ldquoI think it is important to allow our kids to feel the connection with nature. That means being in nature, and respecting it. After all, we are all part of it.This was the real story of that walk on that day a story of incredible bravery, pain, love and determination by a young mum I now have the privilege to call a friend."},{"url":null,"title":"labour-ties-bring-meeting-to-a-halt","story":"Prestonpans businessman Ferhan Ashiq had applied to increase the size of an alcohol display ndashand for a name change ndash at one of his stores.But Councillor Jim Goodfellowimmediately recused himself from the application because of his friendship with Mr Ashiq, who is a member of East Lothian Labour Party.After a short adjournment, Councillor Fiona Dugdale , convenor, also declared an interest.Remaining Labour councillor John McMillan, however, said he did not believe his relationship with Mr Ashiq, who has shops in Musselburgh and Prestonpans, could have an impact on his ability to make a decision, while Conservative councillor Jane Henderson said she did not know him.The boardrsquos legal adviser described the situation as ldquounusual but said the board was no longer quorate and Mr Ashiqrsquos application would have to be continued to the next licensing board for a decision.But a bemused Mr Ashiq noted: ldquoWhen it comes to the next meeting I will know most of the board members there.Legal adviser Carlo Grilli advised Mr Ashiq to send his father, whose name was on the application, and an agent instead.The application was to change the name of Mr Ashiqrsquos Prestonpans store on Redburn Road from Day-Today to Day Todayand increase the alcohol display from . square metres to . square metres."},{"url":null,"title":"rare-bottle-of-whisky-to-be-auctioned-for-combat-stress-charity","story":"It is one of only , matured in an American bourbon barrel for eight years, with a cask strength of  per cent alcohol.The auction is part of a fundraiser for Combat Stress, the veteransrsquo mental health charity, and is being organised by the music group the Flying Aspidistras ahead of their concert of remembrance, Now the Guns are Silent, at Gosford House on Sunday.The occasion will be a reflection on the harsh reality of war and the suffering felt beyond the battlefield.Kilchoman distillery on Islay has bottled this special single cask to coincide with the centenary of the end of the First World War.More poignantly, it is also to commemorate the sinking of two troopships, the SS Tuscania and the HMS Otranto, with the loss of nearly  men, in the waters around Islay in .Ailsa Fortune, the events organiser, said: \"The war affected every community in Scotland, from Islay to East Lothian.\"The end of any war leaves many broken lives.

network was a ldquodirect result of cuts to local authority funding by the Scottish Government.He said: ldquoThe condition of roads is a problem across Scotland. This is a direct result of the Scottish Government slashing council funding over this period, with East Lothian Council having suffered cuts of around pound million in the last five years.ldquoEast Lothian Council has done its utmost to protect the budget.ldquoThe Scottish Government needs to recognise the impact its cuts are having and give local authorities the funding they need to protect services, including road maintenance.The county is currently covered by km of roads, ranging from class A routes to unclassied lanes.And an Annual Status and Options Report, produced on behalf of East Lothian Council, has revealed that  per cent are currently in need of repair.The report, which looks at the impact of future funding on network maintenance in the long term, warns that the current level of investment of pound.million a year will mean that more than  per cent of the roads will be in a state of disrepair in  yearsrsquo time.And it reveals that, as an asset, East Lothian Councilrsquos carriageways depreciate in value by poundmillion every year.It also found that nearly km of rural public roads in the county were in poor condition and needed immediate investigation and possible treatment.The report said: ldquoThe level of investment on public roads in East Lothian has not been sufficient to limit the decline in the overall condition of the network.It revealed that additional investment of pound.million over the next  years could signicantlyimprove the state of the roads, with fewer than  per cent likely to need repairs by the end of the decade.Peter Forsyth, asset manager for East Lothian Council, said that the recommendation for operating the carriageways following the report was to continue with the current level of investment.In a report to the councilrsquos policy and performance review committee, he said the costs of corrective treatments, in particular carriageway reconstruction, were ldquoprohibitive and a preventative treatment approach should ldquomitigate the need to invest signicantly.But he warned: ldquoShort-term under-investment could result in major long-term expenditure necessary to recty major defects which could have been addressed earlier.Councillor Jane Henderson , leader of the opposition, said: ldquoOur road infrastructure assets are vital and dficult decisions will need to be made.ldquoWithout investment now the amount of money needed in the future will be a greater problem the old expression of lsquoa stitch in time saves ninersquo was never so apt.ldquoThe decision on how much to spend on roads now will inevitably mean choices.

It is a collection of stories and anecdotes mainly relating to sporting le and animals.The following tale is inspired from one of the anecdotal stories in Eganrsquos book:ONE autumn evening in the early th century, a storm descended on the county. Dark clouds opened their dreich souls and drenched the land with a torrent of rain. The wind and downpour kept people awake for the whole night, and but by sunrise the tempest was over.Yet all the sudden rain had caused the River Tyne to flood. The folk of Haddington gathered by its banks to witness a strange sight. For the surface of the water was laid with huge masses of hay. The storm had obviously caused the hay recently cut and stacked in the fields upriver to be blown into the flood water, or swept away by it.They watched as small mountains of hay floated by. It was an intriguing sight but of course for farmers it was their winter feed for their animals going waste to the sea.Then someone spotted a swan. It seemed to be attempting to find a place to land. The river was in a torrent and at times the majestic creature seemed to give in to the current and glide on its course until once again it found the strength and motivation to make for the river bank. It was in no imminent danger, but clearly desired to get out of the fast-moving water.As people watched the swan it was noticed that a strange black spot could be seen amidst its white feathers. As the swan drted closer to the bank, people realised what the black spot was: a rat!The rat was clearly alive, at times peeping over the plumage asto see where they were. The swan seemed unperturbed by the ratrsquos presence on its back. In fact, as people watched more closely there seemed to be a connection between the swan and the rat which was most unusual.The royal bird was clearly giving the rat a collie-buckie, or piggy back. How the rat came to be on the swanrsquos back in the first place nobody could tell. The wee creature was very likely at home in one of the bales of hay when it was swept away by the river. In the swirling water it must have struggled to survive.Then rescue came with the swan. Could the creature have scrambled onto the swan without its permission  Surely not! Did the swan actively help the rat  If so, the moment of rescue had been a compassionate act unseen by human eyes. As people followed the drama they realised that the swan was looking for a place to land, not for itself but for its passenger.A crowd had soon gathered to witness the swanrsquos progress. The power of the flood water meant it had real dficulty in finding a place to get close to the river bank. But finally the swan found the strength and opportunity to swim close to the riverrsquos edge.The rat, recognising the opportunity, leaped from the swanrsquos plumage and landed safely on dry land. For an instant the rat turned and looked at the swan, then scampered away. The swan, its mission accomplished, majestically glided back into the main flow of the river.If the rat had thought itself safe then it soon realised this not to be the case. The people watching the spectacle had motivations very dferent to the swan. As soon as the rat landed, dozens of young men, urged on by their elders, chased it with sticks and set their dogs upon it.The animal, having survived naturersquos tempest, now faced an even greater danger his le was sport for humans. The creature zigzagged as people, yelling and howling with delight, chased it this way, then that. The rat, being cornered by a group of about  lads armed with stones and sticks, turned and headed back towards the water.But it didnrsquot make it. The creature was given a deadly blow by a lsquomerciless fellowrsquo. A cheer rang out and people came to view the dead rat. Then a strange silence descended as people reflected, now too late, on what had happened. In the frenzy of the chase it had been so easy to see the rat as merely vermin, rather than a living creature who had struggled to survive and so earned the right to le.People dispersed, no longer cheering.The whole scene had been witnessed by the swan from its vantage point on the river. What its thoughts were on the human behaviour it saw we can only guess.Humans can be made to do this to each other as well, of course. In the frenzy of war, people are encouraged to see others as no more worthy of le than that rat. And the insidious power of this is that both sides are encouraged to think the same way.But deep down, when we touch our humanity, we know how wrong this is. Old soldiers themselves are the first to understand the tragedy of it and see the humanity in those who had been on the lsquoother sidersquo. While there are undoubtedly people who commit evil and need to be stopped, it is the conditions which allow hate to flourish which give rise to their power and influence in the first place.In our remembrance of those who have fallen, let us do so with the reflection and not the frenzy. Let us not forget that the real enemy of us all is hate."},{"url":null,"title":"inspectors-impressed-on-visit-to-elphinstone-primary-school","story":"Parents of youngsters at Elphinstone Primary School and Nursery Class received a letter this week from Education Scotland and the Care Inspectorate following an inspection visit in September.The letter outlined a number of strengths at the school, as well as areas to improve.Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, told the Courier: ldquoWe are pleased that inspectors from both agencies recognise the positive dference that nursery and primary school staff are making for the children and their families in Elphinstone.ldquoThey considered leadership, learning, attainment and wellbeing amongst other areas and concluded that the school was good across these quality indicators.ldquoIrsquom especially pleased to see Alison Cameron receive recognition for her leadership and direction so early in her time as headteacher of the school.ldquoI know that she and the staff team will continue to put pupilsrsquo learning at the heart of all they do.ldquoIrsquod also like to recognise Heather Williamsrsquo work in laying the foundations for this positive outcome during her time at Elphinstone.The letter noted strengths in the schoolrsquos work, including kind and articulate children who make the most of their learning, and the warm, inclusive ethos that creates a family feel.No further inspections are planned, with the school urged to ldquodevelop a strategic, joined-up approach to self-evaluation to ensure that all children can achieve the best possible outcomes and to continue to develop the curriculum.Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokeswoman for education, echoed the comments of Mrs Robertson regarding the schoolrsquos former and current headteacher.She said: ldquoThe inspection recognised a number of areas such as the positive relationships across the nursery and school which are making a dference for children and families.ldquoThey also commented that children were making the most of their learning and were provided with real leadership opportunities at the school."},{"url":null,"title":"austerity-over-in-the-county-definitely-not","story":"Jim Lamond, head of East Lothian Council resources, dismissed claims austerity was coming to an end as a report warned of uncertainty about the future of farming, food and drink, and tourism after the UK left the European Union .Audit Scotland identied the potential problems facing East Lothian as the key sectors of its economy came under risk.

We suspect these initially detached in Earthrsquos gravity field and then decelerated as they entered the atmosphere to fall south of the Hiawatha crater.Professor Kurt H Kjaer, from the Natural History Museum of Denmark and lead author of the research, said: ldquoThe crater is exceptionally well-preserved and that is surprising, because glacier ice is an incredibly efficient erosive agent that would have quickly removed traces of the impact.ldquoThe next step in the investigation will be to confidently date the impact. This will be a challenge because it will probably require recovering material that melted during the impact from the bottom of the structure, but this is crucialwe are to understand how the Hiawatha impact affected le on Earth."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/9043349.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"cabinet-approves-brexit-deal-after-marathon-five-hour-meeting","story":"The agreement was announced by the Prime Minister on the steps of  Downing Street after a marathon five-hour meeting of Cabinet which stretched on far beyond its expected time.The move clears the way for a special Brexit summit in Brussels ndash probably on November  ndash for EU leaders to approve the deal, followed by a crucial Commons vote in which MPs will hold Britainrsquos future in their hands.Speaking moments after the meetingrsquos conclusion, Mrs May acknowledged there would be ldquodficult days ahead and announced she will outline the deal to MPs in the House of Commons on Thursday.And she added: ldquoThis is a decisive step which enables us to move on and finalise the deal in the days ahead.ldquoThese decisions were not taken lightly but I believe it is a decision that is firmly in the national interest.She concluded: ldquoI firmly believe, with my head and my heart, that this is a decision which is in the best interests of the United Kingdom.Senior ministers met amid a storm of condemnation for the proposed deal from Brexit-backing Tories, with prominent Leaver Peter Bone warning Mrs May in the House of Commons that she riskedlosing the support of ldquomany Conservative MPs and millions of voters across the country.The chair of the European Research Group of Eurosceptic Tories, Jacob Rees-Mogg, wrote to Conservative MPs calling on them not to support Mrs Mayrsquos plan, arguing it would see the UK ldquohand over pound billion to the EU for little or nothing in .The deal is ldquounacceptable to unionists, will ldquolock us into an EU customs union and EU laws, and is ldquoprofoundly undemocratic, said Mr Rees-Mogg.Meanwhile, Arlene Foster, whose DUP party props up Mrs Mayrsquos minority administration in the Commons, warned the PM there would be ldquoconsequencesher deal treats Northern Ireland dferently from the rest of the UK.The level of Brexiteer discontent has raised expectations of further letters of no confidence in Mrs May from Tory MPs, with a total of  needed to trigger a vote on her position.Sources within Westminster said the delivery of letters to the chair of the backbench  Committee Sir Graham Brady was ldquoimminent.Mrs May described the debate around the famous Cabinet table as ldquolong, detailed and impassioned, in an apparent indication that her proposals had come under intense challenge from ministers.But predicted resignations did not materialise, as Mrs May said ministers had come to a ldquocollective decision to back the document agreed by UK and EU negotiators in Brussels.Speaking against the backdrop of boos and shouts from anti-Brexit campaigners on Whitehall, she said:ldquoWhen you strip away the detail the choice before us is clear ndash this deal which delivers on the vote of the referendum, which brings back control of our money, laws and borders, ends free movement, protects jobs, security and our Union, or leave with no deal or no Brexit at all.The European Commission released the text of the withdrawal agreement ndash running to  pages ndash on its website as EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier prepared to hold a press conference in Brussels.Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker wrote to European Council president Donald Tusk to inform him that ldquodecisive progress had been made in negotiations, allowing him to convene a summit of EU leaders.TheEuropean Parliamentrsquos Brexit co-ordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, welcomed the ldquopositive progress in negotiations, describing the draft agreement as ldquoa milestone towards a credible and sustainable future relationship between the EU and the UK."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/6687337.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"engineer-dad-from-glasgow-captures-stunning-images-of-posing-highland-stag-on-day-out","story":"Steve Green, , was on a road trip with his daughter Georgia, , last week when the pair came across the majestic creature.The engineer had a day off last Thursdayand decided to take a trip up to Glen Etive in the Highlands.The area is around  miles from Glasgow and is known for its thriving wild deer population.Dad Steve spotted the stag with a herd of around  deer but managed to get close enough to snap the amazing pictures.Steve said: \"Ive lived in Glasgow for  years but never even up that way.\"I had a day off work and decided to take a trip.\"We wanted to take the Glen Coe chairlt but it was closed so we took a drive along to Glen Etive -

I noticed it one day when I went to collect my son. This would have been around .I mentioned it to a friend. She and I were in the same womens group and a friend of hers had died from breast cancer. The brass plaque beside the tree was mottled and not very well looked after.One day I saw my friend cleaning it. She told me that her friend who died had been active in the feminist economic movement and she was cleaning the plaque in her memory. The Glasgow Womens Library got involved and they campaigned for it to be Tree of the Year in .The Suffragette Oak makes me think about the forgotten history of these women: the hard work and striving that went unnoticed. Thanks to these women who went that extra mile, we now have the vote ndash we have a voice.The tree was badly damaged in a storm last year and the council had to make it safe. The bits cut off were given to Glasgow Womens Library and they are making it into things to sell to raise funds. Isnt that lovely Another special tree was one I saw at a holiday place we rented at Achnacloich, near Oban.The gardens there have this amazing redwood that looks like a gigantic hand.The reason it looks like a hand was that when it was planted a rabbit kept nibbling the bud in the middle. Every time this rabbit nibbled it, another shoot would come out the side. It was one of the first redwoods to be grown in Scotland.We were staying there with loads of kids and it was the best climbing tree in the world ndash they would get lost in it.You would be sitting outside having a cup of tea in the morning and suddenly hear a wee voice from up in the tree asking: \"Whats your favourite flavour of crisps \"Carole Baxter, Beechgrove Garden presenterI LOVE rowan trees. All the species are beautul. There is such a range of colourful berries and they are a hardy plant. In my garden in Aberdeenshire I have eight ieties including cashmiriana, Joseph Rock and the native rowan.I have enjoyed the rowan for its berries as long as I can remember, certainly from a young age. It is a value-for-money plant: you have the blossom and fruits, lovely foliage and great autumn colour.People perhaps arent aware of the range of species and named ieties. You dont need to have the one that has the orange-red berries you can get white, yellow and pink berries.There are some small ones as well, such as Sorbus reducta which is ideal for a rock garden. We have that one at Beechgrove as well as vilmorinii, which has pink berries with almost blueish foliage. Those were my plant choices.What is interesting is that birds tend to home in on the red and orange berries to start off with so,you have cashmiriana with its white berries, it tends to hold the berries a bit longer.This year has been particularly good for the fruits because we had a cold spring and it gradually got warmer, so we didnt have the frost and the blossoms werent damaged, which was then followed by a nice hot summer.It is nothing to do with the fact we are going to have a hard winter as people often say ndash thats an old wives tale ndash it is the fact that we have had a good season.Episodes of Beechgrove Garden are available on BBC iPlayer until November Gordon Buchanan, wildle filmmakerSCOTS pine has been my favourite tree from a young age. I grew up on Mull and I have always loved woodland. I spent a lot of time as a kid walking through the woods.One walk we did took us a mile or so out of Tobermory. When you are eight or nine, even just going a couple of miles out of town feels like you are exploring the other side of the planet.It was while out walking that I first saw a Scots pine. It was one of those classic old \"granny\" pines with so much character, the limbs were all twisted ndash there was one that came out at a right angle and shot skywards.This Scots pine stood among mixed birch and there was no other tree around it that looked the same. It seemed so exotic and out of place. Your eye was drawn to it.As I got older and spent time in the Cairngorms and Abernethy Forest, I learned that much of Scotland was covered in forests filled with these trees. I thought it was the most magical habitat.The tree then became a symbol for all the wildle that you find living in those forests. I have spent time filming capercaillie as well as red deer, red squirrels and pine martens among the trees.Weirdly, now I have travelled further than just a couple of miles out of town, whenever I see Scots pine, they dont look exotic to me. I have recently been working in Russia where there is mixed birch woodland and what I call \"Caledonian Forest\" ndash this reminder of home.My love of Scots pine is undiminished but they have gone from being a symbol of the exotic to something very familiar.A couple of years ago I was working in a mountainous region of Turkey and you could almost have been in the Cairngorms. It was very similar. I felt at home.Animal Families and Me with Gordon Buchanan is at Kirkintilloch Town Hall on November , Brunton Theatre in Musselburgh on November  and Rothes Halls in Glenrothes on November Kirsty Wark, broadcasterA TREE is a marker, something you look out for at a particular time of year. My Japanese maple in the garden, for example, you just know when the leaves are going to turn, be vivid and then flutter to the ground.The yellow-berried rowan is one of my favourite trees. I love lime trees because I think they are so vivid in the landscape.Trees represent a constancy. Planting trees is entirely altruistic because, unless they are fast-growing, you are never in your letime going to get the real benefit of them. I love the fact that parks were laid out by the Victorians ndash and even much earlier with Lancelot \"Capability\" Brown.After my father died, we planted a rowan where he loved to fish most, which was Kendoon Loch in Galloway. That was in . It is beside the water and Im not sure it is the most fertile place for it, but it is hanging on in there. I went to see it last week.In Celtic mythology the rowan symbolises courage and protection. That is why you will often see old houses with rowans planted in the front garden by the gate. We planted a red rowan for Dad, but I really like a yellow rowan too.I used to know the names of all the trees because I was in the Brownies. I dont know them all now. I love walking in the forest up to Glenashdale Falls and Whiting Bay on Arran, those specic spaces where you are surrounded by flora and fauna.Sir John Lister-Kaye, author and naturalistTHERE is an ash tree that is one of the biggest trees in the garden here at House of Aigas near Beauly and almost certainly the oldest ndash it is possibly  years old. It is right beside the house.Ashwas a very valuable timber throughout the th and th centuries. It was used for all sorts of things ndash implement handles, cart frames, furniture.It is a very good, close-grained hardwood. Very few ash trees ever survived more than  or  years, perhaps  years, because they were too valuable. Highlanders were not well off and it was a good way of making money.There are very few old ash trees in the Highlands. This one has survived simply because it is so close to an th-century house and I think the owners must have said many times: \"Dont fell that tree, we like it\". And so it survived.What is wonderful about it is that it has survived for so long and that means it has seen so much. For instance, it will have seen Bonnie Prince Charlie come through raising the clans which, of course, culminated in the Battle of Culloden.It saw the folk mourning after the loss of Culloden and it saw Cholmondeleys regiment come and camp here and then burn the tacksmans house down right beside it. The tree must have been scorched by that fire. The Frasers who were living here at the time were all murdered in May .It has witnessed some real horrors. Later, it will have witnessed the Highland Clearances, people pulling out and leaving for the New World. It will have witnessed the Victorians arriving with their grand ideas and turning the place into a sporting estate.This \"loftier ash\", as I call it ndash because that is what Fraxinus excelsior means ndash has seen a lot of history and for that reason alone it is a very valuable tree. In my book Song of the Rolling Earth: A Highland Odyssey, I dedicated a whole chapter to it.Let me read you a bit from it: \"The ash tree has witnessed it all. I stand at its foot. Great roots have corrugated the ground around it with broad woody thongs undulating outwards in a circular plate of tangle and deep grip, roots that trail far across the lawns in every direction.\"It is solid, purposeful, locked in. Its trunk writhes with power. It is all heart. My fullest reach, both arms stretched, extends to less than a third of its circumference an inconsequential hug leaving me in awe of its rigid grandeur.\"Its bark is deeply grooved with long vertical ripples of hardness like a throng of ribbed buttresses all heading upward, shoring up its might, shedding veils of green dust at my touch.\"The bark fissures draw in treecreepers: those tiny mouse-like birds that dash upwards in little jerky pulses, defying gravity. Then, giving in to the earths pull, they flick down again, back to start, like a game of snakes and ladders never won.\"I am enthralled by this tree, rapt. Every time I stand here, I shrink it grows. I age it shrugs off such foibles and just goes on expanding into a thousand shaded alleys.

Visit aigasPaul Murton, Grand Tours of Scotland presenterA TREE that I have always admired is a rowan that grows from a huge boulder. It is one that everyone will have seen as they are driving north up the A to Fort William.Just as you get to Rannoch Moor and are climbing up above Loch Tulla, there on the left-hand side of the road is a massive boulder left over from the Ice Age.There is a crack in it where, for many years, this amazing little rowan tree has been growing.It has been blasted by the elements and cant be getting many nutrients from the rock, so I dont know how it survives.There is something quite symbolic about it. I have filmed it several times for programmes over the years. It also appears in one of my favourite books, Mountaineering in Scotland by WH Murray.In fact, the first time I saw this rowan tree was in WH Murrays book when I was  or .I hitchhiked from Dunoon to Glencoe to go climbing and I remember seeing it in the flesh and thinking: \"Oh, thats the one in the book\".That was exciting because I felt I was on the trail of real mountaineers. Any mountaineer who had been up to Glencoe going back decades will have seen that wee tree.How did it end up there  Perhaps a crow or a raven carried a berry, dropped it and it then got stuck in a crack where there was enough nutrients for roots to grow. It must be at least  years old.Im a bit of a secret tree hugger. I planted a lot of trees at my mothers place in Argyll years ago and it is nice to admire how much they have grown. There are a couple of chestnut trees, beech trees and Scots pine.Episodes of Grand Tours of Scotlands Lochs are available on BBC iPlayer until November . The series will be repeated on BBC in Greg McHugh, actorI GREW up in Morningside in Edinburgh and at the bottom of the garden were steps down to a wood. There was a mud road with a wall and trees behind it. I loved spending time there.All the kids in my street would go down and play. It was an incredible place. I know people think of Morningside as being posh, but this wasnt a kept space. It was completely wild and overgrown. My mum would always shout as I went out the door: \"Dont go near the giant hogweed!\"It was this little hidden spot in the city. When I was in third year at school, I did a history project on it and learned that this was the old \"poorhouse\" road that had grown over.To think of the families that would have walked up and down there, the trees have been witness to all of that.We would gather conkers, climb and make rope swings among the trees and put old doors down over the stream. On fireworks night there would be a big bonfire and all the families in the street went along.One of my brothers mates stood on a wasps nest and was incredibly badly stung. Afterwards it gave spending time among the trees a new element of risk. The thing that sticks in my mind is that, while during the day it was our playground, we would never dare go down there at night.The inaugural Scottish Tree Festival organised by Discover Scottish Gardens features more than  tree-themed events and runs until December .

It leaves viewers in no doubt that Mr Usmanov is the force behind Pakhtakorrsquos revival and even more dramatic plans for a super-modern -million stadium to replace the clubrsquos roofless s Tashkent ground.Pakhtakor manager Shota Arveladze on Ozbekiston But it never - crucially - quite says he owns the club. In fact, Pakhtakorrsquos ultimate formal ownership might be closer to Mr Arveladzersquos old Ibrox home than his new Uzbek one.Pakhtakor was purchased last year by a Uzbek registered ldquoforeign company called SFI Management Group. The company has never publicly named any shareholders or explained why it is listed as ldquoforeign.However, a corporate filing obtained by The Herald shows SFI has just one shareholder: Quality Trade Supplies, registered at a former draperrsquos shop in Douglas, South Lanarkshire.:Investigation: Scotlands firms, Argentinas bribes and Uzbekistans dirty cottonThe firm, QTS, for short, is one of Scotlandrsquos increasingly notorious limited partnerships, a kind of shell company which Transparency International has called ldquoa vehicle of choice for money-laundering and which the CBI has warned harms this countrys global reputation.The shop in DouglasQTS has never filed any accounts or named any ultimate beneficiary. There is no suggestion the firm has done anything wrong, but everything it does is shrouded in corporate secrecy. So much so that its role in SFI has sparked serious concerns among Uzbekistan-watchers over corporate transparency.That is because SFI does not just own Pakhtakor. The business has taken control of huge chunks of state industry in the country on ldquotrust. Under deals made with Uzbekistanrsquos rulers SFI manages the countryrsquos biggest metal-maker, Uzmetkominat and its giant Almalyk copper mine and smelter complex, one of the most polluted places on the planet. SFI has also moved on Uzbekistanrsquos state drugs monopoly and other metals and insurance businesses.In its fawning reporting, Orsquozbekiston  has linked investment at both Uzmetkombinat and Almalyk to Mr Usmanov, but without nailing down the billionairersquos exact role. Its Sense of Belonging documentary signalled a huge change in Uzbekistan. The old regime of Islam Karimov, the Soviet-era strongman who died in , has gone and the countrys new leaders are prepared to share economic power with expat oligarchs such as Mr Usmanov.ldquoAlisher Usmanov is taking an active role in a whole series of important projects for our country, the news channel declared over dramatic drone footage of doves flying across anhistoric Uzbek skyline.The opening of Ozbekiston s documentary on Mr UsmanovOne of those projects Ozbekiston  lauds is the construction of a the Tashkent Metallurginal Plant, which is being carried out, it said, ldquowith the support of Mr Usmanov.\"Scottish\"-owned Tashkent Metallurgical Plant under constructionThis  million euro scheme - now well under way - was announced by Uzbekistanrsquos still relatively new president, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, last year, as a major foreign investment.

We received no reply.Alisher Ilkhamov, a research associate at the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London, is very concerned over the lack of transparency.He said: \"The opacity surrounding deals such as the privatisation of Almalyq and the Tashkent City development indicates the emergence of a new type of authoritarian regime in Uzbekistan.\"Speaking more generally, Mr Ilkhamov added: \"If the previous, Karimov regime was based on preserving the Soviet-style command economy, then the Mirziyoyev regime is turning out to be more business-friendly and eager to attract foreign investments.\"However, the new regime like the previous one is failing to adopt sufficient safeguards against corruption and therefore is prone to the collusion between public office holders and the private sector represented mainly by oligarchs.\"This is gradually becoming more akin to what we see in Russia and Kazakhstan, a combination of relatively liberal economic system with grand corruption.\"Ozbekiston  reports SFI taking over management of the giant Almalyk mine and smelterLast month an Uzbek human rights group - eager to find out who was really investing in their country - urged the UK Government to act on SLPs. The UK Government is considering reforms.Alison Thewliss, the SNP MP leading the campaign for change in the House of Commons, said progress had been \"agonisingly slow\". Ministers, she added, should be really concerned about revelations from Uzbekistan.:Questions as Uzbek president grants tax breaks to anonymous Scots firmsResearcher and writer Richard Smith summed up: \"We are witnessing two pantomimes. In Uzbekistan, itrsquos no secret that Mr Usmanov manages huge swathes of the countrys economy via SFI Management Group, which is controlled by QTS. \"Meanwhile, the UK pretends to require disclosure of ultimate beneficiaries. Yet QTS has still not made any statement about its controlling person, more than a year after the law took effect, and remains unsanctioned.\"As the months pass, itrsquos dawning on everyone that, despite the fine words about transparency, the UK isnrsquot the least bit serious about disclosure.Mr Usmanov is a patriot helping to rebuild his country, according to state TV. But is he alone  Another Uzbek expat oligarch, Belgian-based minerals billionaire Patokh Chodiev, or Shodiyev, has also been linked with SFI . His London representative has repeatedly denied this to The Herald.Meanwhile, back at Pakhtakor it is not just the manager who changed after the SFI take-over. The club has a new president, Bobur Kabulovich Shodiyev. Russian media says this is Mr Chodievs nephew.

We know in any criminal trial the test is whether or not the prosecution has proved its case ldquobeyond reasonable doubt. If not, juries have to acquit. Which means not guilty ndash there is no middle way in the law. So why, in effect, have two not guilty verdicts Some lawyers, like Derek Ogg QC, have argued that logically it is the ldquonot guilty verdict that should go. This would concentrate jurorsrsquo minds on deciding whether or not the prosecution case had been ldquoproven beyond reasonable doubt. This is apparently how it was in Scottish courts in the th century. The ldquonot guilty verdict was reintroduced in the th century.However, many lawyers used to argue that the not proven verdict harmed the accused, not the accuser. Having a jury rule that the case against you was ldquonot proven might suggest that you got off on a technicality, or that the prosecution just hadnrsquot got its act together. Defence lawyers argued that guilt should be expunged by an unequivocal declaration of not guilty ndash meaning he or she really, really didnrsquot do it. The late former Scottish Secretary, Donald Dewar, moved a Commons Bill in  to have the ldquobastard verdict, as Sir Walter Scott called it, scrapped. But this wasnrsquot because he thought it would necessarily make rape convictions easier.Not proven still has its defenders. Some say abolition would undermine Scots law and that we shouldnrsquot be importing an Anglicised system on a wave of emotion. It is good for juries to have more than one option so that they can express a degree of doubt, or qualication. Brian McConnachie QC, the former President of the Criminal Bar Association, has pointed out abolishing it could have unintended consequences. As we discovered during the debate about scrapping corroboration in rape trials, getting rid of one anomaly often creates a raft of new ones.In Scottish jury trials there need only be a simple majority for conviction, eight to seven in a -person jury. In England the test is much stricter ndash there are smaller juries and the majority has to be  out of . If not proven is dispensed with, many would argue that the Scottish majoritarian system would have to go too. This might actually make it harder to get rape convictions.Indeed, you could argue that not proven gives an ldquoeasy option the other way ndash in favour of the accuser. It allows juries who believe the ldquovictim, but are not convinced by the prosecutionrsquos handling of the case, to say: ldquoWe think he or she probably did do it, even though the evidence isnrsquot conclusive. This arguably sends a signal to the civil courts that this person might be guilty on the balance of probabilities. Civil courts are less strict on the need to prove ldquobeyond reasonable doubt.This is actually what happened in the case of Miss M, the rape victim who has been arguing for not proven to be scrapped. She made legal history last month by taking the not proven verdict against former student Stephen Coxen to the Personal Injuries Court in Edinburgh, where it was effectively reversed. She was awarded pound, in damages. Of course, that raises further questions about double jeopardy. If someone is found not guilty in one court, does it makes sense for them to be found guilty in another If you accept the #metoo doctrine ndash ldquoalways believe the victim ndash then you donrsquot really need trials at all. However, this causes problems when the wrong people get accused. When one of the leading figures in the #metoo movement, the Hollywood actress Asia Argento, was accused in August of statutory rape of an underage boy in Calornia, her defenders insisted that she should be given the benefit of ldquodue process, and be innocent until proven guilty. This was correct. The rush to judgment was wrong and unfair ndash even though she reportedly gave the ldquovictim , to settle the claim privately.The problem with sexual assault and rape is that they often involve dficult cases relying, in the absence of corroboration, on ldquohe said she said and the credibility of the parties involved. I have never sat on a rape case jury, but Irsquove spoken to many who have, and they tell me the cases often involve alcohol and vague and muddled memories. It is probably the case that too few rapists are being punished. But tipping the scales in favour of the victims doesnrsquot always work.The justice system in England has been rocked by the collapse of a succession of highly-publicised rape trials in which the police withheld, or failed to disclose, evidence crucial tothe defence. The former head of the Crown Prosecution Service, Alison Saunders, had to make a formalapology, and then resigned last month, after a review covering just two months of English rape cases found that  had to be halted because the police had failed to hand over evidence of innocence. The police insist that they werenrsquot trying to rig the prosecutions. But the head of the politan Police, Cressida Dick, has since issued new guidance saying that ldquocomplainants in rape and sexual assault cases should be listened to, but not automatically believed. ldquoItrsquos not all about the victims she said.Justice is hard. The debate over not proven has been grinding on for a long time. Holyroodrsquos Justice Committee has said that the dual acquittal is on ldquoborrowed time ndashwhich I suppose is itself a kind of not proven verdict. Scrapping the Scottish verdictis beginning to look well nigh inevitable. But whether or not this will increase rape convictions is, well, not proven."},{"url":null,"title":"edinburghs-christmas-festival-has-113m-boost-for-the-city-report-finds","story":"Underbelly, the major Fringe producers who also manage the Christmas festival and Hogmanay, said last years events - which include an ice rink, a market, a city centre fair and other attractions - drew , visitors.Over the six week run, the Christmas festival grew its audience by .%, which was up from , visitors the previous year, a report by BOP Consulting has found.Underbelly recently released an impact assessment, by the same company, for Edinburghrsquos Hogmanay which showed an economic impact for Edinburgh from the festival in   of poundm.Footfall to Edinburghrsquos Christmas three main sites was counted at .m.The centre of the city is transformed during the festival, with attractions, rides, food markets and a big wheel taking up Princes Street Gardens and St Andrew Square.More than , tickets were bought for Edinburghrsquos Christmas rides, attractions and shows last year.The majority of the attendees were from outside Edinburgh and the Lothian area.Of the % who came from outside the capital, around seven per cent came from  dferent countries including Australia, Ireland, USA, Holland, Spain, Canada, France, Germany and New Zealand.Last year was the fth year of Underbelly produced Edinburghrsquos Christmas for the City of Edinburgh Council.

There are issues with BME teachers dropping out in the first three years of teaching.Equality issues in schools in general do not seem to be a strong enough focus and that is a particular case in terms of race.We have evidence that Muslim teachers are particularly struggling with racism in schools, and that can be from pupils or subtle messages from other teachers.Another key issue is that teachers talk about how racism in school has become more of an issue in the context of Brexit.

Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned. David calls himself a jazz film-maker and doesnt really like to spend too much time planning it all out.

We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Wednesday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : pmOrkney band, FARA have been nominated for The Belhaven Bursary for Innovation in Music — an award which grants the winners £, to pursue and develop their music.

Will the Chief Secretary work with the Secretary of State for Business to develop that proposal and work with the Business Department and the developers to see the fruition of what could be a very important part of the Government’s industrial strategy.”Responding to Mr Carmichael, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, the Rt. Hon. Liz Truss MP, said: “As part of the spending review we will be looking at the most efficient way we can achieve our carbon targets, and I am working closely with the Department of Business Energy and Industrial Strategy to do.”Commenting after the exchange, Mr Carmichael added: “The Minister’s response will do little to assure the industry that they are a priority for the Government. There was nothing in the Budget for this industry, and the Government have been working closely across departments for some time now. It is disappointing that little progress appears to be being made.“Wave and tidal power generation and new and innovative forms of producing green energy. The ambition of the industry however has not been matched by the policy framework, which continues to prevent this sector from reaching the point where it becomes commercially viable.“Renewable energy generation, particularly wave and tidal stream power are areas at which the Northern Isles is at the very forefront, and the creation of these Innovative Power Purchase Agreements would make great strides towards helping these innovative industries continue to flourish.

If we continue to turn a blind eye to the risk of developing type  diabetes as a result, we can only expect to see the number of undiagnosed cases escalate.‘Diabetic retinopathy is one of the leading causes of blindness among people of working age in the UK so it’s hugely important that diabetes is detected early and monitored correctly to avoid furthering the risks.‘At Specsavers, we offer digital retinal photography. This takes a detailed picture of the back of your eye and the microcirculation of blood – helping to highlight indicators of diabetes that need addressing.Eye screening is also a key part of your diabetes care and people with diabetes should have routine screenings done every one to two years by an optometrist. Contact your local GP or local diabetic screening service for more information.Sophie Castell, Director of Relationships at RNIB, says: ‘Sadly, all too often, people with diabetes can lose their sight due to complications. Yet with early detection and treatment, sight loss due to diabetic retinopathy can be prevented. Regular eye tests are important for everyone, but especially for people living with diabetes who should also ensure they attend appointments for specialist diabetic eye screening. It’s a few minutes that could save your sight.’ https:www.diabetes.org.uk resources-s - diabetes_in_the_uk_.pdf https:www.diabetes.org.uk about_us news over--of-people-unaware-diabetes-can-lead-to-blindness- State of the Nation’s Eye Health, Specsavers  RNIB  https:www.rnib.org.uk knowledge-and-research-hub-research-reports prevention-sight-loss stateofthenation http:www.rnib.org.uk sites default files RNIB_evidence_based_review_of_working_age_people.pdf vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We are pleased to confirm we have made some changes to the substation design at Finstown, which we hope will go some way to address concerns raised. We are also pleased to confirm that we will underground the proposed infrastructure at Hoxa Head.#In the coming weeks, SSEN’s project team will continue to assess the responses received as it further refines the project design.SSEN plans to submit its planning applications for the proposed substation at Finstown, the subsea cable and the underground land cable that will connect Finstown to the subsea cable later this year, while a final round of public consultation will be held in Spring  on the onshore infrastructure required to connect the ious renewable projects looking to connect on Orkney to Finstown substation.For more information on the project, including the latest visualisations of the proposed substation at Finstown, please visit: https:www.ssen-transmission projects orkney copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Throughout the coming winter we will monitor the agreed plan to make sure we cover any changes in weather using our existing resources to best effect.ldquoHowever, we all have a duty to take responsibility for our own personal safety which is why I encourage drivers to be aware of our gritting policy as it is simply not possible to treat every road at the same time.She added: ldquoPeople also need to be aware this year to the changes to Saturday and Sunday services.

Executive chairman Wolfhart Hauser had taken over at the helm following O’Toole’s departure, but will now revert back to his non-executive chairman’s role.Details of the changes came as the group reported interim pre-tax losses widening to £. million in the six months to  September from £.m a year earlier due to restructuring and reorganisation costs from the withdrawal of Greyhound services in Western Canada.But revenues rose . per cent to £. billion and on an underlying and constant currency basis, pre-tax profits jumped . per cent to £m, while earnings lted . per cent to £.m.But FirstGroup warned that its rail arm, which includes the South Western Railwayand Great Western Railway franchises, would see annual underlying operating profits fall year-on-year.

He’s about to get on a plane but the worn white Fender Stratocaster with the maple fingerboard, on which he wrote best selling hits with his band Chic and produced some of the biggest-selling albums of all time with David Bowie, Madonna and Diana Ross, won’t be shoved in the hold. The Hitmaker, as he calls it, and which is integral to his funky ‘chucking’ style, won’t be out of his sight. He left it on a train once, luckily got it back, but yes, he did freak out...The Grammy Award-winning musician, composer, arranger, guitarist and co-founder of Chic says, “I have a replica, and a plexiglass one and they sound really great live and on record, real close, but it’s not the same.” Rodgers is about to fly out of Toronto when we speak, heading for London in his trademark dreadlocks and beret to put the funk into the X Factor, replacing the touring Robbie Williams as a judge. He’s also collecting a humanitarian award from the Global Gt charity for his work with his We Are Family Foundation, named for his Sister Sledge anthem. Career-wise he’s flying high too, after releasing the first Chic album for more than two decades this summer featuring Elton John, Emeli Sandé and Lady Gaga, with another album due out in February and about to kick off a -date European and UK tour with the band that’ll make Glasgow Dance, Dance, Dance in December. He’s the newly elected Chairman of the Songwriters Hall of Fame and as the recently-appointed inaugural Chief Creative Advisor for Abbey Road Studios, it’s time to celebrate Good Times. Rodgers is responsible for decades of floorfillers, after starting out as a musician on Sesame Street, playing clubs and bars before co-founding Chic in  with bassist Bernard Edwards. There were Chic disco hits: Dance, Dance, Dance, Everybody Dance, I Want Your Love, Le Freak and Good Times, and hits he produced for others: He’s The Greatest Dancer, We Are Family, , I’m Coming Out, Upside Down, , Like A Virgin, , Let’s Dance . Then there are his collaborations, with Daft Punk on the Random Access Memories album and single Get Lucky, global hits that won him three Grammys, with Avicii, Sigala Disclosure and Sam Smith, plus the genre crossing talent that saw Good Times spark the advent of hip-hop when it was picked up as the base for Sugarhill Gang’s Rapper’s Delight. In all, his work has sold more than  million albums and  million singles, but it’s been  years since Nile Rodgers and Chic released a studio album. Hence the title It’s About Time. “Yes,” he laughs. “For one thing there’s the obvious – it was about time I did this stuff and got it back out.” It would have been earlier, but as Rodgers was working on the album the deaths of his friends and previous collaborators Prince, David Bowie, George Michael and Chris Cornell hit him hard. “What happened was I had got a large tape drop from Warner Brothers of masters that I thought were gone for ever and that made me feel so happy and nostalgic and I was about to release an album. But then people started passing away that I had written tribute songs about, and it made me feel like I’d be capitalising on Bowie and Prince’s passing, and it was just so wrong.”The time is right now, however, and at , Rodgers has been thinking about mortality. He’s beaten prostate cancer once in  and last year had a lump removed from his kidney. Today he declares himself fit and healthy,a little tired from last night’s Toronto gig, but he’s determined to fulfil his mission to get everyone dancing to feelgood music.“I know that our time on this planet is finite,” he says “and you know what, I want to spend the rest of my le making really great dance music. When I was producing Eric Clapton one day he came out of the studio and said to me that he was gonna play blues for the rest of his le. I said ‘Eric, you mean to tell meI come see a Clapton show I’m not gonna hear Sunshine of Your Love  Or any of those Cream and Blind Faith cool songs ’ And he said ‘no, you’re not gonna get that again, because I’m not going to play it again.’ I went home and thought about it for a bit and I said, ‘well, hell,Eric Clapton is gonna play blues for the rest of his le, I’m gonna play dance music for the rest of my le. Right! I just wanna play music for ever.“Not that I think I’m Eric Clapton, but you know,you’ve put in all this time, you have the right to decide what you want to do and I decided that I like to make music that makes people happy, makes people want to dance. It really feels good to me to see people express themselves through motion.”Speaking of dancing, as a legendary exponent of dance music, what does Rodgers consider to be his hottest move  How would he wow one night in a disco on the outskirts of Frisco  Rumba and Tango, Latin Hustle, too, Yowsah, Yowsah… “I have no idea,” he says and laughs. “I don’t consider myself a good dancer any more, because I was actually a serious dancer. I was actually a ballet dancer in another le. Not many people know that, but it’s true. Around the time I was working with Sesame Street when I was  or , and I took it very seriously for a while. Then I just started gigging a lot more and I didn’t have time to practise and ballet you gotta practise just as seriously as you practise music.” As for the upcoming tour, Chic fans can expect to hear the old favourites alongside some of the new album because Rodgers knows his crowd and after playing the festival circuit with Glastonbury and Coachella last year, he’s also conscious a lot of the audience will be hearing them for the first time. “At our shows I ask people to raise their handsthey’re seeing Chic for the first time, and we’re averaging about  per cent first timers. This is amazing to me! Especially since we’ve played the UK so much. I’m like Jesus, everybody has seen us! But no, more than half the crowd will raise their hands and that’s cool.”Rodgers may have four decades in the business but he’s still an innovator and already at Abbey Road has been the first to shoot a video there and has more plans to move and shake the legendary studio.“Abbey Road’s amazing,” he says. “They’re allowing me to do everything there, matter of fact, ha! I might re-invigorate my ballet career, have a dance recital there! It’s just incredible. It’s probably one of the most artistic, creative environments I’ve ever been in. I’m making films, doing concerts, even Paul McCartney wound up having a concert there after I came.”Born in New York in  Rodgers didn’t have the easiest start in le. His mother was  when she got pregnant with him and his biological father, Nile Rodgers Senior, a travelling percussionist, moved on. With his mother and step-father both being heroin addicts, Rodgers learned young to be self-reliant. The last time I interviewed him he spoke about how once as a five-year-old he got wedged down the back of the sofa when his parents were out of it and he had to wait for his grandmother to come round to the house and retrieve him. If he could, what would he say to that little boy stuck amid soft furnishings, waiting for someone to realise he was missing  “I’d say, buckle up, it’s going to be a hell of a ride!” He laughs. After learning to play the guitar at  Rodgers figured he could pay rent and landed his first professional job in the Sesame Street band at . But despite their struggles, he’s very close to his family, especially his mother, and is grateful for the legacy of music bequeathed him by his parents. It’s in his bones and has been all his le.“I have music in me, around me, it just swirls in my head all the time. I can’t turn it off as a matter of fact. Oh yeah, I always hear music, all day long. I heard it as a child, and I hear it now,” he says. In was almost inevitable he would make his name in music, from the beginning playing and practising every day. “I wish I could do that now,” he says, “I would give my left arm to be able to do that. Oh, no… you know what I mean.” He laughs. “I just think practising makes me play better, and he quotes the violinist Jascha Heetz, who once said ‘ I don’t practise one day, I know it two days, the critics know it three days, the public knows it.’ His insecure formative years necessitated a work ethic that spurred Rodgers on and brought financial rewards such as the house by the shore in Westport, Connecticut, with the boat moored at the jetty, where he lives today. Apparently alone, but then Rodgers never talks about his relationships. “Yeah, I’m pretty discreet,” he says. And just out of nosiness, because he’s ulged this to me before, and he is the child of a pair of beatnik hippies, does he still like to hang out there naked when he doesn’t have guests  He laughs. “Yeah, of course, why would I change  Old dog new tricks  No.” With his colourful le story, Nile Rodgers The Musical, should be worth the wait, but his much anticipated autobiographical show is still being written and may be another couple of years in the pipeline. Right now he’s got his hands full with the musical he wrote with Jean-Paul Gaultier, entitled Fashion Freak Show, currently wowing the Folies Bergeres in Paris, as well as another musical bound for Las Vegas and provisionally London’s West End. “The Paris show is doing great and the other one is loosely based on disco lestyle stuff and it’s being done by [Steven Hoggett] the choreographer from the Harry Potter show that’s in the West End now.”As to who would play Rodgers in the musical of his le, he’s at a complete loss, sounding surprised at the question.“Oh, I don’t know… I wouldn’t even… I don’t even know,” he says. “That person would have to be a hell of a lot more talented than myself, because they’d have to do a lot of things at an early age that I couldn’t do when I was that age!” He laughs.Compose, perform, produce, act, oh and they’d have to add ballet to the long list of talents now too, know their ballottéfrom their boogie. “Yes, they would.” He laughs. And no, he wouldn’t consider playing himself.Today Rodgers’ mother Beverly has Alzheimer’s, but the two find common love in music and when he visited her last week, as usual they revisited their playlist for le.“She loves everything. My mom is a be-bop junkie... and loves everything from Charlie Mingus to Nina Simone to Miles to The Beatles. The other day we were singing Hey Jude and she knows every single word, even sings the ad libs…” He lts his voice and does his mother doing McCartney’s scat, “Ju-Judy Judy Judy Judy Judy.“She’s amazing.”Rodgers’ own playlist of signicant songs would contain primarily jazz and some of his own tracks, not out of narcissism, but because he rarely gets to hear them. “I only hear my music when I’m playing it and there’s a huge dference between the recorded and performance versions. In performance there’s a lot of improvisation whereas recorded is exactly the same every time. Sometime when I hear the recorded version I go ‘oh my god, I forgot I wrote that part too’. The other day I heard Let’s Dance and forgot how intricate the horn voicings were. I listened to the whole album and thought wow, this is cool.“Let’s Dance was part of Rodgers’ reinvention as a producer, the album that turned his career around after punk kicked in and left disco apparently for dead. Boogie was busted as punk gobbed in its face and Chic, with their soul, RB, funk, glitter and groove were out in the cold. “Durin’ the disco sucks era,” he says, “we couldn’t get anything, no buzz, no one would listen to us. We were just persona non grata. It’s not that the music was bad, it was just we were not flavour of the month. People didn’t like us.”The collaboration with Bowie was to reinvigorate his career and satisfy his love for discovering new sounds. “Up until David’s record I had six failures in a row. I was known for producing disco. But after David I probably had six successes in a row: David Bowie, INXS, Duran Duran, Madonna, then Duran Duran again, then Mick Jagger and David Bowie with Dancing in the Street... yeah I had a clutch.“And collaborating is fun! Not only have you got your own energy to vibe off, but you have other people’s. I love being in Chic but for the last  years I’ve been mainly in the room with brand new people, in other people’s bands.” Looking back over his career Rodgers is hard pushed to nominate an event or song of which he is most proud. “I’m not more proud of Let’s Dance than We Are Family, Get Lucky, I Want Your Love, Dance, Dance, Dance, Everybody Dance or Rapper’s Delight.”As he lists the titles, it prompts a muscle memory, the beginnings of a hustle in the hips, a shimmy in the shoulders, so perhaps it’s the longevity of his sound that’s most impressive. Rodgers, however, can’t explain his success. “If I knew the answer to that question, don’t you think every record I’ve put out would be a hit ” he says. “Most of my records are not hits. Most of my records are flops. Only a handful are hits. Well, actually, a big handful....”A very big handful...“Well, yeah, anyway...” he trails off, modest and mellow.Holding his Hitmaker, it’s time for Rodgers to board his flight, with a final word about how much he’s looking forward to the tour. “You know, I really love composing, I love making records, and when we know from the charts that people are listening, there is a joy that we get. “But when you can actually see people having a good time, that feels pretty damn good. There’s nothing like that. It’s wonderful. So... see you in Glasgow for Good Times.” @JanetChristieNile Rodgers  Chic kick off their UK arena tour at The SSE Hydro Glasgow on  December.

At least that’s what it looks like from this European mainlander’s perspective.Scotland is regarded as a rebellious but likeable underdog who’s being dragged out of the European Union against its will. Bagpipes, haggis and whisky are all fine – but honestly, for the politically interested traveller, Scotland’s EU-friendly attitude is the icing on the cake.Brexit felt like a rejection for many of my fellow Europeans – so it feels good to know there are still people out there who think dferently. Yes, euroscepticism is on the rise in many countries – just look at Italy and its government’s anti-EU rhetoric, blaming Brussels for everything that’s going wrong, even for the Genoa bridge collapse. But there’s still a widespread acceptance of the EU in Europe. In fact, a recent survey commissioned by the European Parliament showed that  per cent of respondents believed that their countries’ membership of the EU was a good thing. That’s the highest it has been in  years.So for many people, Scotland seems like a bastion of reason in a world gone crazy with populism. The Scottish position on Brexit has evoked solidarity and sympathy. But the question is: does this attitude mean that an independent Scotland would be welcomed by the EU While the political landscape has signicantly changed since the independence referendum in , most people would see one country in particular as a roadblock. Spain is still having its own domestic problems with the separatist movement in Catalonia, a region in the north-east of the country. So that’s one member state that wouldn’t particularly be in favour of any independence referendum.Their government has recently changed, however. In June, socialist Pedro Sánchez took over as prime minister after his predecessor Pedro Rajoy was ousted in a vote of no confidence. Sánchez has been reaching out to the independence supporters in Catalonia, but he’s far from being in favour of the region parting ways with Spain and will not support a referendum. His party PSOE backed the hard stance of Rajoy’s government after the Catalan vote back in October  and helped impose direct rule on Catalonia under article  of the constitution.: EU negotiator: ‘Simple fact’ independent Scotland could join EUBut Scotland has one advantage over Catalonia: Holyrood and Westminster negotiated the Edinburgh Agreement, thereby allowing for the Scottish Government to organise a referendum. In contrast, Spain’s constitutional courts declared that Barcelona’s referendum was illegal. The situation is dferent, and that’s why some observers think that, provided another independence referendum was done constitutionally, Spain would now not stand in the way of EU membership from an independent Scotland. But hypothetically – just how long would it take an independent Scotland to rejoin  I asked David Martin, Scotland’s longest-serving member of the European Parliament. The Labour MEP had an astonishing answer: “If we were independent, I think we could be a member of the EU within two years.“ That seems like a remarkably short time. But again, Scotland has an advantage: its laws already comply with EU law which puts it well ahead of other EU candidates like Montenegro. Martin has a direct comparison as he is chair of the delegation to the EU-Montenegro Stabilisation and Association Parliamentary Committee.“We would have to negotiate things like fishing – which would not be easy but would not be impossible,“ he said. “We have to decide what we’re going to do about the single currency and about Schengen, but I think the areas for negotiation would be rather narrow.“: Guy Verhofstadt: Scotland ‘obliged to follow’ Brexit decisionOther MEPs have spoken in a similar vein: the German MEP Elmar Brok, for example, has reportedly said Scotland’s readmission into the EU could be “speedy“. An independent Scotland might only have a few “narrow” issues to discuss compared with all the points the EU would have to discuss with other membership candidates. But these subjects seem so sensitive and complicated and they could, in my opinion, turn out to be much harder to solve than some might hope for. Scotland right now benefits from the special position the United Kingdom has within the EU. If the country did become independent and tried to get back into the EU, it would have a better starting position than others, but it would not automatically be able to claim the UK’s opt-outs. Why would the EU allow a cherry-picking member once again – that didn’t work out so well with the UK, did it  Scotland would enter the negotiations like a completely new applicant.As you can imagine, from my German perspective, a closer membership than before would not a bad thing I have experienced the benefits of my country’s EU membership. But do all those who support independence know that an EU membership for a future Scottish state might entail giving up the opt-outs and adopting the euro In my mind, independence supporters in Scotland often make it seem asgetting back into the EU would be a really smooth operation. But let’s be honest: while Holyrood might gain control from Westminsterthere was independence, they would have to cede some of it to Brusselsthey wanted to join the EU again.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4829190.1542124527!/image/image.jpg","title":"spice girls kylie and elton where are new bands amid nostalgia fest","story":"Given Scotland is awash with the music of the past # in the form of ageing stars and tribute acts # Brian Ferguson questions whether young bands will be able to compete.It is hard to believe that Kylie Minogue was to blame for one of my most underwhelming music festival experiences. I was not the only one who was left a bit cold by the Australian pop superstar’s reinvention as a rock singer at the  T in the Park festival. A surprise on-stage collaboration with Nick Cave was unable to stem the flow of dismayed punters away from the festival’s main stage, wondering what on earth had become of the chart-topping icon.Why, then, did I feel a flutter of excitement at the news that Kylie is heading to Edinburgh Castle next summer for her first headline show in the city for an incredible  years  What has become of me that I have circled my diary on the date of the Spice Girls gig at Murrrayfield a few weeks before Kylie is in town It pains me to say it but I might just be getting swept up in an unstoppable wave of nostalgia which seems to have a tightening grip on the entertainment world. Although not new, it’s now become almost impossible to avoid and seems to be infecting venues, festivals and events of all shapes and sizes.:  famous songs every Scot will knowA flick through a programme for a concert hall in Scotland offers an interesting insight into the phenomena. Perth Concert Hall’s forthcoming line-up has an Elvis impersonator, a “Magic of Motown” night, an Eagles tribute act, and a visit from The Osmonds and UB. Among the acts being served up at the Caird Hall in Dundee are nights devoted to the likes of The Bee Gees, The Rolling Stones, Johnny Cash, Dolly Parton and Willie Nelson. Falkirk Town Hall’s programme has tributes to Bon Jovi and Whitney Houston, alongside Abba, Blues Brothers and Buddy Holly tributes.To be fair to all of the above, Scotland’s biggest venues are serving up a similar menu. Culture Club, Belinda Carlisle, James, Ocean Colour Scene, Franki Valli  The Four Seasons, The Australian Pink Floyd Show, Madness, Chic and Paul McCartney are all booked into the Hydro in Glasgow before Christmas. Tributes to George Michael, Abba, Arentha Franklin and even The Spice Girls are jostling for attention in the Edinburgh Playhouse’s spring programme.A few years ago, the nostalgia circuit was largely the likes of The Rolling Stones, Sir Rod Stewart and Elton John. Perhaps aware of the increased competition, the latter has just put tickets on sale for a tour in the autumn of .More than a quarter of a century after the death of Freddie Mercury, Queen are enjoying a major revival thanks to the film Bohemian Rhapsody.

It is hard to think of a Scottish indie, pop or rock act from the s that has not recently reunited or staged a classic album tour.On the one hand, it could be argued that everyone is a winner from the conveyor belt of reunions, revivals and tributes. Promoters and venues would not be booking shows unless they were damn sure of selling tickets.

That would be the worst of all possible worlds for Scotland.“So what I think is important now is that we don’t allow ourselves to fall for the Prime Minister’s spin that a bad deal has to be accepted because the only alternative is no deal.“Itdoes not mean that no deal is inevitablethis deal is rejected by the House of Commons. Instead what that opens the possibility for is getting better options like full single market customs union membership back on the table. We must be striving for what is right for the country. My job is to strive for what is right for Scotland, not accepting bad deals.“It’s ironic, is it not, that for the last two years the Prime Minister has told us that a no deal is better than a bad deal and now she’s arguing that we’ve got to accept a bad deal for fear of no deal.“That is a  choice.”Her remarks came as Democratic Unionist Party chief whip Sir Jeffrey Donaldson warned the arrangements for Northern Ireland could lead to the break-up of the United Kingdom.He claimed the deal would in the “long term” leave Northern Ireland closely aligned with the EU and could increase support for Scottish independence.“It’s about the constitutional and economic integrity of the UK, that is fundamental for us,” he told BBC Radio, adding that the “DUP does not stand alone on this, we have many friends within the Conservative Party and indeed in some other parties, who believe this deal has the potential to lead to the break-up of the UK”.: ‘Unacceptable’ that Scottish Ministers not shown Brexit dealScottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, who is currently on maternity leave after the birth of her son, and Scottish Secretary David Mundell have both warned they could quit their rolesBrexit threatens to “undermine the integrity” of the UK.Mr Blackford, an SNP MP, said the two Tories had “got questions to ask”, but added: “I’ll leave that to them.”For her part, Ms Sturgeon said: “I’ll leave David Mundell to worry about his own contortions. The Scottish Conservative party in general and David Mundell in particular have got themselves into all sorts of strange postions over this. They seem more interested in standing up for the DUP than standing up for Scotland which I think is a strange position for the Secretary of State for Scotland to be in. “My job is to stand up for Scotland. “Scotland voted to remain overwhelmingly. Not withstanding that I have argued consistently for a compromise position of single market and customs union membership. “What I don’t think anybody with Scotland’ best interests at heart could accept is a situation where Scotland is not just out of the single market but competing with Northern Ireland which would still be in the single market. That would be devastating for jobs and investment in Scotland and not something I think that anybody should be prepared to accept.”Mr Blackford stressed that Scotland should be treated the same as Northern Ireland.“As far as we understand things this morning it looks asit’s actually going to a be a dferent deal for Northern Ireland,” he told BBC Radio Scotland’s Good Morning Scotland.“If it’s permissible for Northern Ireland to stay in the single market as part of the backstop - and I welcome that for the people of Northern Ireland - then of course Scotland should be given the same opportunity.”He continued: “Nicola Sturgeon, our First Minister, has been very clear ever since the Brexit vote that we need to respect the votes of the people of Scotland and as a very minimum that means staying in the single market and the customs union, these are our red lines.”Mr Blackford insisted it was “absolutely right” that the Brexit deal should enshrine the Good Friday agreement, which ended years of conflict in Northern Ireland, and ensure there is noto a hard border with the Irish Republic.But he went on: “The key point is thatthere is to be a dferentiation for Northern Ireland there is no reason why the circumstances in Scotland can also not be respected.“We need to stay in the single market and the customs union, and the Government in London must listen to us on that.”Scottish Conservative chief whip Maurice Golden said: “The UK Government and the European Union have negotiated a plan to avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.“This shouldn’t be about creating a new border between us and England.“Nicola Sturgeon has spent months talking up the merits of the EU single market.“She needs to explain why it is in Scotland’s interests to fracture the UK internal market, as she seems to want to do.“The rest of the United Kingdom is four times as important in terms of trade to Scotland than the entire European Union.“It simply does not make sense to create a border at Berwick by creating dferent trading rules between us and England.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.The project, costing around £ million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in .

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that. There would be an impact in the short term of the dry ski slope.\"Whether it will ever be an attraction in its own right and generate signicant income, who knows, but that is not a consideration of the planning process.\"In effect it is a ersication of business in this area and therefore acceptable andit was to strengthen the stability of CairnGorm Mountain then thats a good thing.\"He said there were some hefty planning conditions attached to control the development.CairnGorm Mountains representative said some  per cent of total visits to the resort were in just three winter months of the year.Mr Gough had told the committee Natural Retreats had explored several options in depth to remove the reliance on winter income including mountain biking and zip-wiring but this plan was the most viable at this time.He said it was imperative the attraction can provide year-round employment in order to retain its best staff. This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Wednesday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118338.jpg","title":"Helping mountain to reach its peak","story":"Gavin MusgroveA pound MILLION vision to revive CairnGorm Mountain has been laid out to release the resorts immense unlocked potential over the next five to  years.US-based consultancy SE Group believes the resort can attract in the region of , winter visitors per year ndash more in seasons when there are peak snow conditions ndash with the right targeted investments.But controversially they appear to have written-off any future for Coire na Ciste which accounts for one-third of the ski area and boasts the best terrain for skiers and boarders at intermediate level and beyond.Instead the report proposes that all the focus for snowsports is on Coire Cas and two state-of-the art six person chairlts should be installed.There is also a role for the funicular which is currently not running at the resort because of safety fears.However, it is seen as having a subsidiary role as snowsports uplt and to be used and maintained more for non-skiers and ski school customers.Vermont-based SE Group carried out its independent review of uplt infrastructure at the resort between February and September, earlier this year.No funding has been allocated. Highlands and Islands Enterprise who commissioned the report have described the findings as a starting point.But it appears that there would have to be very persuasive arguments to now veer from this set course.HIEs head of business development Susan Smith told the Strathy: \"This is the start of a long journey but at the centre of this needs to be the buy-in from stakeholders and the local community.\"Naturally an element of funding has to come from the public purse.\"There are large infrastructure funds for which this project may be eligible.\"Intriguingly she continued: \"Without setting hares racing it is prudent that we look at what alternative funding mechanisms might be available.\"I would put the option forward there may be a number of philanthropic investors out there who are passionate about Cairngorm who may with a sensible model and plan consider some form of philanthropic investment.\"Ms Smith would only add when pressed: \"We have a very loose expression of interest which suggest to us there may be the opportunity to do a bit more work to tease out whether this is an alternative strategy but there is absolutely no guarantee.\"On Coire na Ciste, she said the consultants found there was no business case to develop the area as campaigners and many ski visitors would like to see.The HIE boss said: \"They have come back quite unequivocally saying that it would not stack.\"They have looked at the two sites and said it is unsustainable as a second site until there is a capacity of  peopleor more using CairnGorm Mountain because facilities would have to be doubled up.\"This is the view of the experts and they have consulted widely and I have to take confidence in that... to deviate from these findings there would have to be a signicant rationale to do so.\"Ms Smith said the two new chairlts would replace some of the surface lts but was unable to say which ones.She said that their partners Highland Council, Cairngorms National Park Authority, Scottish Natural Heritage and Forestry Enterprise Scotland were enthused and excited by the vision.She said: \"They believe that for the first time in many years this is a sensible approach for the way forward.\"She also said HIE wants to be much more inclusive working with the right community representatives.Ms Smith explained: \"It can not be a free for all. It has to be through proper and proportionate channels that we bring this forward.\"She said Natural Retreats is the operator and part of the journey and had bought into it.

in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe Armadale to Mallaig crossing is among the most popular ferry routes in Scotland according to new figures obtained by Kate Forbes MSP.According to  statistics, Ardrossan to Brodick had the highest number of passengers with ,, followed by Largs to Millport , Wemyss Bay to Rothesay , Oban to Craignureand Mallaig to Armadale .Skye, Lochaber and, Badenoch MSP, Kate Forbes said she was surprised that Mallaig to Armadale crossing proved more popular than Ullapool to Stornoway .The statistics also showed that the Skye to Mallaig route was the most popular crossing for coaches across Scotland.Kate Forbes MSP said: “Since RET was introduced by the SNP Government, it’s great to see the rise in passengers.“RET is vitally important to the islands and has arguably done more than anything  to level the playing field for island communities who need to travel.“Mallaig to Armadale figures were up by  per cent compared to the fateful summer of . Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service. That support is urgently required."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2018-mod-gold-medals-e1539885405814.jpg","title":"thursday at the mod skye and lochalsh gold medal","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThere was a Skye and Lochalsh double in the premier singing competition at this year’s National Mòd in Dunoon.In Wednesday night’s final Ceitidh Campbell from Kyle of Lochalsh won the women’s Gold Medal, while the men’s medal went to Ruairidh Cormack from Portree.Both singers are following in family footsteps in landing the prestigious honour, which is presented by Mòd organisers An Comunn Gàidhealach.Ceitidh’s mother, Barbara Smith, won the Gold Medal when the Mòd was held in Skye in .

This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting. He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding. He said: “The administration is looking for feedback, we are working on slopes with high risks and will come back to the next EDI with the costing.”Councillor Derek MacLeod described the current situation as “one episode in a long, long history of problems with the route#, and in contrast to his fellow ward member, Councillor Cockburn, he argued that the route should be “trunked between Auchtertyre and Garve” as he believed it to be strategic in linking the ferry points of Uig and UllapoolCouncil Leader Margaret Davidson told the committee that she would be meeting with the Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and would report back “what options have been put on the table.” Councillor Davidson said that the council were “acutely aware of what’s needed” and were working towards a long-term sustainable option for Stromeferry.

Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future. It is time to lay the foundations for reconciliation andhealing, and to open up a new phase of the peace

permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27491  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe writer, newspaper editor and Irish republican Seumas O’Kelly was a native of Loughrea, County Galway. Author of short stories, plays, poems and a novel, The Weaver’s Grave which was his masterpiece, O’Kelly’s le was cut short because of his commitment to Irish freedom. The O’Kelly family of Loughrea were flour millers and merchants and Seumas received a good education. He was a fellow student of James Joyce in University College Dublin. There is a remarkable photograph of the BA degree class of  including Joyce, O’Kelly and George Clancy. Like O’Kelly, George Clancy, a close friend of Joyce, was to die a tragic death. He was Sinn Féin Mayor of Limerick when on  March  he was murdered in his home by the Black and Tans, on the same night as former Mayor Michael O’Callaghan. Seumas O’Kelly was a committed republican from an early age. He is recorded as one of those to the fore in the centenary commemorations of the  Rising in . He was writing for Arthur Grfith’s Irish Republican Brotherhood-funded newspaper The United Irishman from  and for its successor Sinn Féin from . While a full list of attendees is not available it is probable that he was at the founding meeting of Sinn Féin in November . In  O’Kelly was appointed editor of the Leinster Leader in Naas, County Kildare. He founded a branch of Conradh na Gaeilge in the town and was active in Sinn Féin locally. He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year. Several of his plays were produced at the Abbey Theatre. Constantly busy with literary and journalistic work, O’Kelly was subject to poor health. He joined Óglaigh na hÉireann when they were founded in  but was unable to play an active military role. His brother was a Volunteer and was jailed in England after the  Rising. The paper Nationality, edited by Grfith, was established in  and O’Kelly was one of its writers. It was the main organ of Sinn Féin during the  and  by-elections. In May  Grfith was arrested and jailed in England and O’Kelly took over as editor of Nationality. Following the  November  Armistice which ended the First World War, British soldiers and loyalists ran riot through the streets of Dublin, attacking suspected Sinn Féin supporters. On the night of  November a crowd of drunken soldiers invaded the Sinn Féin Ard Oig at  Harcourt Street . Seumas O’Kelly was at his desk in the Nationality office and tried to defend himself with his walking stick. The office was wrecked and O’Kelly collapsed. He was brought to Jervis Street Hospital where he died of a brain haemorrhage. Seumas O’Kelly was honoured with a republican funeral to Glasnevin Cemetery, attended by huge crowds.

In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded. The IWFL actively opposed British rule and supported Dáil Éireann. For example in August  Hanna was badly beaten by the RIC who attacked a Sinn Féin meeting at which she spoke in Kilbeggan, Co. Westmeath. IWFL women went on to champion women’s rights in the decades following the Treaty when they faced the very dferent challenges of a partitioned Ireland with conservative anti-women governments North and South. The Irish Women’s Franchise League was founded  years ago on  November .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27493  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonA wreckers’ agenda is being driven by the DUP and Tory government.

They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27494  ","story":"• th NOVEMBER  - Newly elected Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams Mícheál Mac DonnchaTHE Ard Fheis of  marked a signicant stage in the political development of Sinn Féin. The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

Boyle, Chief Executive of Ballymena Business Centre. The project is part funded by Invest Northern Ireland and the European Regional Development Fund under the Investment for Growth  Jobs Northern IrelandProgramme.I used to be a childminder and had two young children and didnrsquot think it was possible for me to get into the beauty business - but then I went back to college and studied beauty at the Roberta Mechan College, she said.I have a real interest in health and well-being and wanted to offer these services to others. I opened in April this year and I currently offer specialist skincare, nails, massage and waxing.Helen turned her dream into a reality after taking part in the Go For It Programme which is delivered free of charge by a team of experienced business mentors through Northern Irelandrsquos wide network of enterprise agencies.It provides expert advice and help with developing a robust business plan to help turn ideas into a commercial enterprise.Commenting on the success of the programme, Helen said: Often it is hard to know where to start that was my experience before starting the Go For It Programme. The support and guidance offered through it helped me fine tune my business idea from concept to working reality.They helped me with practical things in the early stages like setting out a business plan and doing a detailed analysis. It was great for helping me to budget and forward plan.ldquoI would urge anyone who has ever had the idea of starting up their own business, or evenyou have just started operating your own business to apply for a place on the Go For It Programme. The skills and knowledge imparted is beyond the realms of what you could achieve on your own.Melanie Christie Boyle, Chief Executive of Ballymena Business Centre, on behalf of Mid and East Antrim and Borough Council, added: ldquoHelen joined the Go For It Programme driven by a desire to launch her very own beauty business, driven by a passion to help women improve their skin and help them feel good about themselves.Helen undertook an intensive beauty course under tutelage of an industry expert with a clear vision and motivation to open her own salon as soon as she completed her examinations.We worked with Helen to develop a business plan, focusing on key areas such as defining her service provision, marketing and financial forecasting, as well as helping her secure commercial premises at Ballee and Harryville Community Enterprise Centre.It is great to see how Helen has progressed her business in such as short space of time, building a loyal customer base and a excellent reputation for her quality customer service and using only the very best range of products.If you have a business idea yoursquod like to develop oryou are thinking about starting a business call    or visit: visit www.goforitni.

The investment by The Lotus Group, one of Northern Ireland’s best established property solutions companies includes the relocation of the company’s headquarters to the listed building which formerly housed the Down Shoes factory. The iconic art deco building has been carefully refurbished to create a central and fully al new base for The Lotus Group’s management team and support staff, and offers additional space for further commercial and residential development. The flagship site on Banbridge’s Newry Road is also home to the heritage inspired Lotus Village - a private housing development by the company. Work has now commenced on the second phase of the project which includes a range of high end semi-detached homes, townhouses and apartments.The regeneration programme and HQ move signals a new developmental phase in the strategic direction of The Lotus Group, resulting in a re-focus on key business sectors and the provision of added value services.This includes the private nursing home sector, where, based on years of expertise, The Lotus Group has moved away from the standard ‘landlord-tenant’ model to the provision of a quality-driven ‘managed asset’. This is reflected in its selection of Countrywide Care Homes as a strategic partner for its nine nursing homes operating throughout the UK. By successfully managing the transition of the nursing homes from the failed Southern Cross Group to Countrywide, The Lotus Group has secured a total of  beds, underpinned  jobs, and delivered a signicantly enhanced quality of service to residents. This includes three nursing homes in Northern Ireland.According to Chief Executive Brian Henning, adopting a longer term view to service delivery sets The Lotus Group apart from others in the sector: “The past few years have proven that those who understand the property market in its entirety and are prepared to take a long-term, strategic view, are best positioned to manage the market in the future. Despite the recent economic upheaval we believe there remain many opportunities which demand creative and strategic property solutions.This is essential to support the recovery and growth of the NI economy as it moves out of recession.“Throughout the last  years we’ve continued to invest in the best people, consolidated our strengths in key market sectors, created partnerships which add value, and utilised our expertise to deliver a strengthened and stable property portfolio which meets the needs of the changing economy.Looking to the future, Mr Henning added: “We’ve honed our business offering and have a highly experienced, professional team in place. Through prudent management we’re ideally positioned to deliver robust, professional and service-led solutions of which our new partnership with Countrywide Care Homes is an excellent example.” Adding his support, David Simpson, MP for Upper Bann said: “This investment by the Lotus Group is a good news story for the local property sector and represents a positive economic development for the area as a whole. It proves that even through an economic downturn, strategic planning, entrepreneurial spirit and strong leadership can deliver long term results.”  with Melanie Christie Boyle, Chief Executive of Ballymena Business Centre, who provided Helen with expert advice and help with developing a business plan in order to help turn her business idea into a reality\"   with Melanie Christie Boyle, Chief Executive of Ballymena Business Centre, who provided Helen with expert advice and help with developing a business plan in order to help turn her business idea into a reality\"  Local mum hails Go For It programme after she achieves le goal of opening her own business Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8537099.1529312918!/image/image.jpg","title":"new park ride facility at fane valley welcomed","story":"Local Alderman Junior McCrum has welcomed the new park and ride facility being built adjacent to Fane Valley in Banbridge.

The site is a joint effort between Translink and Roads Service. Ald.

With a limited number of tickets still available, ‘Em Two Balloons duo Gerard Jordan and Ciarán Nolan told Daily Belfast how audiences can expect all their favourite characters from previous stage outings with a wedding bringing together the West and North of the city for its fairytale finale.“This is the fourth year we have brought ‘Em Two Balloons and their Christmas show to the Roddy’s,” explained Ciarán, “we had great success last year with the Terrible Tragedy of the Twinbrook Turkey and we are back again to tell all about the Fairytale of New Lodge. We had Deck the Falls back in , Turkey last year and now this feels like the completion of part of a trilogy.”“The demand for the shows is growing each year,” said Gerard, “audiences have really taken the characters Ciarán and I play and given us such great support. At the start of November we learned that there are only  per cent of the tickets left at the Mac and people are coming in every day to get their tickets early for the Roddy’s. If there were more days in December we would put on more shows as the demand is there.”“Audiences can expect pretty much what they have experienced before, especially in terms of laughter,” said Ciarán. “There are wedding bells in the air in the production, North Belfast is meeting West Belfast and the introduction of the Glider is bringing our characters East. I mean, what’s the most exotic thing for a Westie  It’s’ getting on the Glider and heading East, seeing Stormont in real le,” he laughed. “The characters Gerard and I have created Jean and Joan, Tablets and Muttley and our two doormen Feargal and Maxi are all there as well. Countess and Winalot, the two dogs, are woofing all the way towards Christmas too. Our bride is played by me and called Mini Driver who is from the Oldpark, Feargal is our groom and the all important wedding prep forms part of the story too.”Gerard spoke of how the hard work has been going on behind the scenes since .“It’s been great how much the audiences have backed us. The real compliment is that the audiences keep growing and this year we’ve added matinees into the Mac, we want to branch out to new audiences each year and will be taking the show to Naomh Éanna on December  as well.”Ciarán said that due to overwhelming demand a handful of dates will be performed after Christmas at Fruithill Bowling Club, Gort Na Mona and St Paul’s GAC on the ,  and  of December. “We will be working on new material for  and ‘Em Two Balloons will be bringing out a new production.

He said officials in Dublin had not been formally notied of a deal being reached in Brussels. \"Were at a stage where there is still no agreement at this point in time,\" the spokesman said. \"There is actually no agreement.\" He added: \"At the moment, this is only speculation.\" In another sign that Dublin may not be happy, a spokesman for Irelands deputy premier, Simon Coveney, said: \"Negotiations between the EU and UK on a withdrawal agreement are ongoing and have not concluded.\" He also said a \"number of issues are outstanding\", adding that negotiations were at an \"extremely sensitive\" juncture. In the Dáil earlier, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the language around the customs arrangement was not important, so long as Irish objectives were achieved. \"Whether it is a double backstop, a backstop to a backstop or a hybrid backstop is not the point. \"The point is having a legally binding guarantee that a hard border would not emerge between Northern Ireland and Ireland,\" he said.

against the backdrop of boos and shouts from anti-Brexit campaigners on Whitehall, she said: “When you strip away the detail the choice before us is clear – this deal which delivers on the vote of the

We are clear - we will not be voting for this humiliation!— Sammy Wilson MPNovember , Some Conservative MPs have also criticised the deal, claiming it would keep the UK under EU control.Mr Martin said the matter “deserves better than that”.“I was a bit dismayed to see people coming out very early – Sammy Wilson from the DUP, for example – even before they had read anything to do with the text, proclaiming they were going to oppose it, and people from the hard Brexiteer group as well,” he said.“I think the issue deserves better than that, and I would hope that the other parties in Britain would stand back and look at this in detail and come to a considered position on the agreement which has been reached between the European Union and the United Kingdom.”The Fianna Fail leader said relations between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland are at their lowest in  years and blamed the Conservative Government at Westminster and the Fine Gael administration in Dublin for changing “the overall dynamic”.Fianna Fáil leader Micheal Martin told the Irish Association conference at Queen’s said relations between NI and ROI are at their lowest in  years, adding that Brexit “has no upside for Ireland”. pic ziGXop— Rebecca BlackNovember , “Where the Major, Blair and Brown governments had shown a deep commitment to Northern Ireland’s long-term progress, there was an apparent impatience in the Cameron government that they still had to spend time on the issue,” he said.“In fact David Cameron’s approach was that Northern Ireland had to ‘stand on its own two feet’ rather than expect London to help overcome every problem.“The change of government in Dublin also marked a new approach. Set-piece meetings continued but there was a clear disengagement and an expectation that it was time to just let the DUP and Sinn Fein get on with business.”Speaking to the media at an Irish Association conference at Queen’s University Belfast, Mr Martin said:“I welcome the fact that the European Union and the United Kingdom, it seems, have agreed on a text for the withdrawal part of the agreement.“The devil is in the detail and that is something we have got to keep an eye on, not just today but in the coming years. Brexit is going to be a long journey, this is just the withdrawal agreement.“What’s key for me is Brexit is not good for Ireland, it’s not good for Britain, so we have got to aim for the softest Brexit possible.“A no-deal scenario would be Armageddon, it would be ruinous for Britain.”Speaking at the same event Ulster Unionist Steve Aiken also commented on deteriorating relations both north south and east west.He said: “The DUP told us they were holding the Conservative Party to account. Look what they have done, they have undermined the union, they have helped destroy devolution in Northern Ireland, the DUP has been an absolute disaster.“It has been a disaster for Northern Ireland, it has been a disaster for unionism, and I think members of the DUP need to very clearly reflect on where they have got themselves in this position.”SDLP leader Colum Eastwood criticised what he characterised as a “knee jerk” reaction to the draft deal from the DUP and Brexiteers.“We are glad to see that there may well be a deal between the European Union and the British government but we are always very concerned at the knee jerk reactions we have seen from the DUP and others,” he said.“I think it’s important that everybody reads this deal, takes the time to digest it.”Mr Eastwood, speaking a short distance from the border in his Foyle constituency, added: “It’s very important that we protect people here from a hard border – that we have access to the customs union and single market.“I think it would be much more sensibleBritain and Northern Ireland had access to the customs union and single market – it would be even betterwe weren’t having Brexit at all.“But our job today is to bank the back stop, our ultimate insurance policy.

This requires the customs union as the basis of the future relationship.“They must align their rules but the EU will retain all the controls. They apply the same rules.

Brexit updates: Arlene Foster warns Prime Minister of consequences - Theresa May to give statement after Cabinet Civil servants told to stop including DUP in Brexit emails as partnership with Conservatives crumblesBrexit has left both the Tories and Labour ided between those who support leaving and those who do not, and ious nuanced factions in between.While there are  MPs, seven Sinn Fein MPs do not take their Westminster seats and the Speaker and his three deputies do not vote.So the magic number Theresa May needs to meet or surpass is  - ie more than half of .Since the  General Election, her party has had  seats, which leaves them short of a working majority alone but ahead of Labour on  and the SNP on .This is why the Tories entered into a \"confidence and supply\" deal with the Democratic Unionist Party, which has  MPs who can take her Government over the line.But she currently faces open revolt from both the DUP and Brexiteer and Remain wings of her party.The European Research Group, led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, has claimed it has  MPs ready to vote against what it sees as Mrs Mays capitulation to Brussels.Opponents suggest the number would be whittled down under a concerted offensive of arm bending by the Tory whips, so it may finally may be considerably less.The DUP, hardcore Brexiteers, appears to be so opposed to a deal it believes casts Northern Ireland adrt from the rest of the UK that it seems at this stage unlikely they can be reconciled.And Tory Remain supporters have bridled at the deal, with some saying the customs union gives Brussels too much unaccountable power and others who say it does not go far enough.Pro-EU rebel Anna Soubry told BBC Radio s Today programme on Wednesday that a customs union had to be accompanied by Single Market access for the good of trade, saying: \"If you speak ... to British business they will tell you a customs union is important, but so is the regulatory alignment as well. That is what I need to see.\"This means Mrs May could need to find up to  votes - but perhaps more realistically somewhat less - from where.The SNP and the Lib Dems, who have  MPs, both support remaining in the EU and are likely to vote against it.So the Prime Minister may well need to extend an olive branch to Labour, which also has its own isions between those like Chuka Umunna who oppose Brexit, those like Caroline Flint who support it reluctantly because their constituents voted to leave, or those like Kate Hoey who are ardent Brexiteers.Jeremy Corbyns frontbench position is that they will not support a deal that does not meet its six tests, which include safeguarding worker and consumer rights and providing the \"exact same benefits\" as membership of the Customs Union and Single Market.Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey told the BBCs Today programme on Wednesday that the proposal was \"unlikely to be a good deal for the country\", saying it wanted to see a permanent rather than temporary customs union.The question is how many of Mr Corbyns MPs are prepared to defy him and support the Prime Minister, reasoning that a no-deal Brexit, which they fear could bring about an economic disaster, would be a worse outcome."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit live updates cabinet backs theresa may difficult choices particularly on northern ireland","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

That is the fundamental red line.”The critical stumbling block has been over what happens to the border between Northern Ireland and the Republicno trade deal is secured by the end of the Brexit transition period in December , with Brussels having wanted the north to stay in a customs union with the EU to keep the border open.Under the “backstop” arrangement said to be in the draft text, the whole UK would remain in a customs arrangement with the EU instead – a condition sought by Ms May – until a future deal is secured, though there would be deeper provisions for Northern Ireland on customs and regulations, something the DUP find unpalatable.A review mechanism is also understood to be part of the text, which would determine when the UK would leave the backstop arrangement, but it is unclear whether it meets the demands of Brexiteers – including some in the cabinet – who want Britain to be able to unilaterally walk away."},{"url":null,"title":"giant meteorite crater bigger than paris found beneath greenland","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Those responsible have branded by the local politician as ldquogrossly irresponsible.Cllr Curran described those who engage in such behaviour as ldquoselfless, reminding them that they are guilty of an environmental crime by dumping their waste in unauthorised areas.There are a number of illegal dumping hot spots across the district with the Downpatrick councillor suggesting the mentality of those responsible is particularly dficult to fathom.ldquoI cannot understand why people do not make use of household waste centres in Downpatrick, Castlewellan and Ballynahinch, declared Cllr Curran.ldquoThe mentality of those who dump waste along rural roads is beyond me. What puzzles me most is that people who engage in this activity end up paying for its removal through their rates bills. They are literally costing themselves money, but that does not appear to register with them.Cllr Curran said there was no excuse for illegal dumping as there were so many ways for people to dispose of their waste legally and safely.ldquoFly tipping and illegal dumping results in a blot on the landscape and is an image no one wants to see. I firmly believe that those responsible for despicable behaviour should feel the full force of the law, otherwise this activity will continue, he warned.ldquoIllegal waste can range from bin bags dumped at the side of the road to old household furniture, rubble or old trees.

It is clear that the objective of restoring the Ulster Way to Downpatrick and Rowallane has been on the organisationrsquos lsquoto-dorsquo list for far too long. Now is the time for action, added Cllr Enright.Cllr Walker said councillors now need to ensure that what he described as this ldquovital project is prioritised on a cross-departmental basis to have any hope of success within a reasonable timescale.ldquoIt is vitally important three separate council departments get involved moving forward. Delamont Country Park offers huge potential and re-establishing a network of community trails is an exciting proposal which we hope will come to fruition, he said.ldquoThe response from the public to have its say on the future of the park was brilliant and thanks to everyone who took the time to take part in what was a very worthwhile event. I initially lobbied for more investment in the park and am glad local council officials took this on board and are developing a masterplan with public input at its heart.Cllr Andrews said he was pleased to take part in last weekrsquos consultation and was impressed at how many people took the time to attend, confirming he will be supporting the motion and views outdoor leisure as an economic driver for the whole region.ldquoThe people who attended last weekrsquos event agree that the country park is a major tourism asset and offers signicant development potential which must be appropriate and not spoil what is already in place, he continued.ldquoDelamont can act as a major economic driver and benefit not just the immediate killyleagh area, but the wider district..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Rogue trader tried to swindle £7k from Newcastle pensioner  ","story":"A FRAUDSTER tried to scam an  year-old Newcastle woman out of nearly pound, for tarmacing her driveway which he had deliberately damaged, Downpatrick Court has heard.Dean James Winderstood shamefaced in the court on Thursday on five charges relating to work he carried out in February.Winder, who traded as Unique Style Driveways, admitted one charge of fraud by misrepresentation and three further charges of aggressive, misleading, and unfair commercial practice.He was also admitted using an inaccurate service flyer which failed to say that his business was registered in England.All offences took place between February -.The court heard that the scam may never have been uncovered had it not have been for the actions of a taxi driver.Police praised the driver who raised the alarm with the Trading Standards Service after he learnt of what was happening as he brought the woman to a bank to withdraw pound,.Trading Standards called the police who arrested Winder and another person at the scene.Winder was given  hours of community service and fined pound by District Judge Amanda Brady for his actions, which were later condemned by police as ldquodisgusting.He was also instructed to immediately pay back pound, which he had taken from the woman as a deposit.A prosecution lawyer said that Winder approached the woman and her partner unsolicitedly to power wash and seal a paved area at their Mourneview Road home for pound.However, after doing the work, Winder pointed out some problems with the driveway and offered to do further work for pound,, which was increased to pound, to tarmac the full driveway.Some of the problems that Winder had pointed out in the driveway were those he had actually created while doing the first job, the prosecutor added.A defence lawyer acknowledged that Winder, now with an address at Holmes Avenue, Dreghorn in Irvine, Scotland, had seen an opportunity to get further work from the elderly couple and had done a ldquopoor job of tarmacing the driveway.However, he said Winder had made a full admission for his actions, offered his apologies and had turned up in court with the full amount of money to be ed to the elderly householder.The lawyer added that while there was another man involved in the work and transaction, Winder was ing the money on his own.Judge Brady described Winderrsquos actions as ldquomean-spirited. She told him: ldquoYou took advantage of an elderly person, quite deliberately, and deliberately damaged her driveway to get more money.Winderrsquos conviction was later welcomed by the police.Chief Superintendent Simon Walls said: ldquoThis was a callous and calculated act by Winder who deliberately set out to scam this couple out of their hard-earned money.ldquoWhat Winder did was disgusting and I hope the courtrsquos judgement will bring some level of comfort and reassurance to the couple.ldquoI would also like to praise the taxi driver who raised the alarm and thank our colleagues in Trading Standards Service.Chief Superintendent Walls also appealed to friends and family of older or vulnerable people to talk to them about lsquocold callersrsquo and make sure they know what to do when salespeople come to their door.He added: ldquoNot all cold callers are rogue traders, but some are. If you feel that something isnrsquot quite right, it usually isnrsquot.ldquoUnofficial traders can overcharge unsuspecting and often older householders for poor quality work, or work that is never completed at all.ldquoRemember, itrsquos your home and itrsquos OK not to open the dooryou have any concerns.

Keenan quickly tagged on a rsquo with two Morgan frees stretching the lead to four points by the th minute.Ballymartin were far from playing the role of bystanders, but they managed to shoot seven wides against the wind, misses that proved crucial at the finish.With  minutes gone Chris McKay had a stinging shot crash off the crossbar following a stunning passage of play, but Keenan and Morgan ensured St Johnrsquos kept ticking over with points apiece.Ballymartin continued to waste several good scoring opportunities before Michael Higgins picked up his sidersquos first score in added time at the end of the first half as St Johnrsquos went in with a - to - lead.It took the protagonists a while to settle in after the break, but with  minutes gone Cathal Doyle reduced the arrears to four points with a score from play. St Johnrsquos then cruelly lost the services of the influential Eoin Moag to a black card and minutes later he was followed for an early bath by Darren Savage, who received a second yellow and then red.St Johnrsquos backs were now to the wall and Ballymartin made sure they stayed there. However, another Morgan free stretched St Johnrsquos lead to - to - before the real Ballymartin fightback started.Consecutive points from Michael Cunningham, Ryan OrsquoHareand Ross Cunningham left a single point in it and Ballymartin were in the right tack.The Lilywhites pushed and probed for the equalising score, but with the game in added time St Johnrsquos broke free and a surging run from Conor Flanagan ended with him setting up Branf for the match-winning score.Just to rub salt into the wounds, Morgan added a point from play to leave St Johnrsquos with their Division  status intact.St Johnrsquos: D Morgan, C Magorrian, A Morgan, J Addis, D Savage, R Flanagan, M Grant, A McMullan, E Moag, C Brannf , C Morgan , C McKay, M Keenan , J Clarke, C Flanagan.

Projected as three-screens, the film was cleverly edited to juxtapose the ying yellow line constructions, from the scouts lining up their yellow kayaks to the farmers forming their line of yellow bales.With the use of dramatic aerial shots, the formation of the yellow lines could be seen clearly as they cut through the landscape, representing both the Border and itrsquos people. The film received great response from the audience participants as they witnessed the powerful result of their involvement.With lsquoAcross and In-Between,rsquo Suzanne Lacy highlights the wit and cleverness of Border le in the face of political pressures, focusing on the power of play in creatively responding to complex issues.Suzanne commented: ldquoOur project draws those who live along the often-invisible boundaries between countries into a conversationmdashmetaphoric and literal ndash on personal and symbolic meanings of this border and by extension all such borders drawn by political forces.ldquoThe artwork explores inverse paradigms: visible and invisible, official and unofficial, rural and urban, the real border and imagined ones.

If they succeed, this would automatically mean more barriers to trade with the EU, including across the Irish border, she stated.Dr Hayward agreed that the Mrs Fosterrsquos argument against any sort of backstop was ldquoperfectly reasonable as it is not ldquothe intended destination. But she still argues that it is of ldquocritical importance.. It is the issue over which the whole Withdrawal Agreement could collapse, leaving all of us in the mire of a lsquoNo Dealrsquo outcome.ldquoIt is therefore very important that all judgements of the backstop are based on a clear and accurate understanding of what it actually means, unclouded by hyperbole.And it is in relation to the backstop where Dr Hayward, who is a Fellow in the Senator George J. Mitchell Institute for Global Peace, Security and Justice, took most issue with Mrs Foster analysis:ldquoFoster claims that Northern Irelandrsquos access to the UK single market would be restricted. In actual fact this is entirely in the hands of the British government ndash it is a domestic issue unrelated to UK-EU negotiations, the Queens Reader asserted, before adding:ldquoSecondly, Foster says that lsquoEU access, comes with the requirement for Northern Ireland to fully adopt and implement EU regulations with no changesrsquo. But it is not necessary to have full regulatory alignment with the EU in order to have tarf free access to its market. That would be like saying wed have to have all our laws imposed by Beijingwe are to get tarf-free access to China.Dr Hayward does however admit that major ergence would require an operational backstop:ldquoThat said,the UK erges widely from the lsquocommon rulebookrsquo of the EUrsquos single market, it would not be possible for goods produced in Northern Ireland to have free movement around the single market as is currently the case. It would be in just such an instance that the backstop could come into play. This would not mean that all EU laws would apply in Northern Ireland but rather that goods produced here could be considered to be of EU standardcertain procedures are followed.In her opinion piece last week Mrs Foster stated that:ldquoFree Trade Agreements donrsquot just cover regulation but tarfs too. This would require not just being in the single market but in the customs union. In other words, a total sea Border descending between Northern Ireland and its largest market, Great Britain.Dr Hayward does not agree however and says ldquothere is absolutely no prospect of a total sea border under any scenario.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A petition has also been sent in to the National Assembly.Many local residents from Penarth, Barry, Cardf and further afield have shared their frustrations over the sediment being dumped off the coast.Penarth man Anthony Slaughter, who is the Cardf and the Vale Green Partyrsquos campaigns officer and also the chairman of Gwyrddio Penarth Greening, said: ldquoWe understand and share local residentsrsquo concerns over the dumping of this potentially hazardous mud in the Severn estuary.ldquoIn addition to any possible risks associated with this waste we are opposed to any action that enables the development of the Hinkley C nuclear power station.ldquoAs the only political party in Wales that is completely and unambiguously opposed to all nuclear power we do not support the plans for either Hinkley C or Wylfa B power stations.Even rock musician and anti-nuclear campaigner Cian Ciaran, who is the keyboard player for the band Super Furry Animals, has come out against the matter.The musician lodged papers at the High Court seeking an injunction to stop the dumping and said that the ldquonuclear establishment cannot be trusted.ldquoAbsence of evidence is not the evidence of absence, and therefore the precautionary principle should dictate a rethink, said Mr Ciaran. ldquoA rethink by our politicians and policy makers to do the right think by its people.ldquoThe implications and consequences of this dredging could be far reaching.South Wales Central AM Neil McEvoy has set up a CrowdFunder page to raise pound, for the protest as he believes there may be a judicial review.He said: ldquoOur initial target of pound, was so that we could carry out an interim injunction in order to temporarily halt the dumping of the Hinkley nuclear reactor mud.ldquoHowever, in order to stop the mud dump for good we will need toto court, which could lead to a judicial review. Judicial reviews are very costly and so extra funding will be required. This will be used for court fees and to put together a strong legal challenge against the mud being dumped in Wales.ldquoIrsquom concerned because I do not believe enough testing has been done. Wersquore talking about mud being dredged from outside a nuclear reactor.Energy company EDF are dredging the mud ahead of building two new nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point C in Somerset.

A petition has also been sent in to the National Assembly.Many local residents from Penarth, Barry, Cardf and further afield have shared their frustrations over the sediment being dumped off the coast.Penarth man Anthony Slaughter, who is the Cardf and the Vale Green Partyrsquos campaigns officer and also the chairman of Gwyrddio Penarth Greening, said: ldquoWe understand and share local residentsrsquo concerns over the dumping of this potentially hazardous mud in the Severn estuary.ldquoIn addition to any possible risks associated with this waste we are opposed to any action that enables the development of the Hinkley C nuclear power station.ldquoAs the only political party in Wales that is completely and unambiguously opposed to all nuclear power we do not support the plans for either Hinkley C or Wylfa B power stations.Even rock musician and anti-nuclear campaigner Cian Ciaran, who is the keyboard player for the band Super Furry Animals, has come out against the matter.The musician lodged papers at the High Court seeking an injunction to stop the dumping and said that the ldquonuclear establishment cannot be trusted.ldquoAbsence of evidence is not the evidence of absence, and therefore the precautionary principle should dictate a rethink, said Mr Ciaran. ldquoA rethink by our politicians and policy makers to do the right think by its people.ldquoThe implications and consequences of this dredging could be far reaching.South Wales Central AM Neil McEvoy has set up a CrowdFunder page to raise pound, for the protest as he believes there may be a judicial review.He said: ldquoOur initial target of pound, was so that we could carry out an interim injunction in order to temporarily halt the dumping of the Hinkley nuclear reactor mud.ldquoHowever, in order to stop the mud dump for good we will need toto court, which could lead to a judicial review. Judicial reviews are very costly and so extra funding will be required. This will be used for court fees and to put together a strong legal challenge against the mud being dumped in Wales.ldquoIrsquom concerned because I do not believe enough testing has been done.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We suspect these initially detached in Earthrsquos gravity field and then decelerated as they entered the atmosphere to fall south of the Hiawatha crater.Kurt Kjaer collecting sand samples at the front of Hiawatha Glacier, which was transported from the bottom of the impact crater to the ice margin Professor Kurt H Kjaer, from the Natural History Museum of Denmark and lead author of the research, said: ldquoThe crater is exceptionally well-preserved and that is surprising, because glacier ice is an incredibly efficient erosive agent that would have quickly removed traces of the impact.ldquoThe next step in the investigation will be to confidently date the impact. This will be a challenge because it will probably require recovering material that melted during the impact from the bottom of the structure, but this is crucialwe are to understand how the Hiawatha impact affected le on Earth..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Giant meteorite crater  ubigger than Paris u found beneath Greenland article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  comments        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg --\"Most popularMost commentedLoading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos nowMost popularCommentedLoading...Read more         ,CommentsSorry, an error occurred.Thank YouYour complaint has been sent to the site administrators.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentContact UsPhoto SalesNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartDatingTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

His trophy for the Masters class success was a sword. David said: “I’ve been training from  years old on and off and decided to start competing six years ago. I held quite a few titles at the Northern Ireland Fitness Model Associationshows then started competing at the British National Bodybuilding Federationshows, where I have placed second three years in a row in the masters over  class. My goal is to become the masters champ at the BNBF.” Of why he started bodybuilding he said: “I started because I was a skinny kid and wanted to change my appearance, so my father took me to a gym one day and when I lted the weights for the first time I knew it was for me.“I always wanted to compete but never thought I was good enough till one day I said what the hell and went for it, so looked into shows where it was all natural athletes.” He added: “For shows you need to be strict on what you eat, when you eat and what types of food you eat and calories per day as it helps to hold onto muscle but, at the same time, you want to bring your body fat down to get great condition and for your muscles to be sitting out.“I have an amazing coach James Melville from the Compound Room, Lisburn, who I work with very closely. He does all my prep for shows. “I do all my training at Fitness Factory gym, Lurgan. “Leading up to shows I put my body through a lot of stress where I will be training two to three times a day six days a week, working on all body parts.” Police Ombudsman appeals for witnesses Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"After Christmas he’ll be getting ready to compete at the BNBF British qualiers in Belfastwhere he’ll be aiming to win the masters title and qualy for the British finals in Liverpool.He said: “It would be a dream come true to get top five against the best UK national bodybuilders.” And of his recent successes: “I still really can’t believe it, It hasn’t really sunk in properly as going over I didn’t expect to place or was even happy to crack the top five. “I really can’t believe it, I still think it’s all a dream.”David thanked his family and friends for their support and said his partner Mandy “has been by my side with amazing support”.He added: “Without Mandy and kids Megan, Ben and Cody it would not have been as special, as it was a family holiday and for the first two days I had to watch them eat all the nice foods.

The deal sets out a -year plan to grow the economy, boost jobs and tourism, increasing skills, encouraging investment and developing infrastructure. Six Northern Ireland councils are working in collaboration with the Northern Ireland Civil Service, Northern Ireland Office, Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government and the Treasury as well as Queen’s and Ulster Universities, and Further Education Colleges to move forward with the City Deal plans.Mr Buckley said: “Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon’s absence from what has been described as a once in a generation opportunity is astounding.”He added: “I am stunned ABC appears to have missed an incredible opportunity through Belfast Region City Deal. Just last month the council’s chief executive Roger Wilson was quoted as saying: ‘We are proactively developing a high-quality business infrastructure, boosting skills in the region, supporting economic development and promoting the borough as being very much open for business.’ “City Deal ticks all of those boxes and more, and our borough’s vital strategic location would surely have made it the ideal location to benefit from the City Deal bid. The fact that councils as far away as Newry and Mourne have secured their place at the Belfast region city deal table, gives me even more cause for concern as to why Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon are missing. “Just last week ABC council announced it had written to the Chancellor alongside Mid-Ulster and Fermanagh and Omagh councils to ask for a Treasury backed scheme, and Northern Ireland’s rd city deal. This leads me to ask why theyare not included in the Belfast city deal, when others were.“You just have to look at our neighbours to see what is being outlined. The Newry Southern Relief Road, for example, will be an invaluable addition to the area. In County Antrim, Carrickfergus is earmarked for around £m of investment in its town centre. My constituency of Upper Bann is crying out for similar investment, and was geographically and economical well placed to be included.”A spokesperson for the Council said ABC Council “set out its plans to explore mechanisms for a Growth Deal in collaboration with Fermanagh  Omagh District Council and Mid Ulster District Council in a letter to Chancellor Philip Hammond. “We believe that working with our two neighbouring councils – which represent one quarter of Northern Ireland’s population – we have a strong chance of securing a Growth Deal which will work to boost economic growth and deliver a step-change to the future prospects of the collective area. It will work alongside the Belfast City Region Deal and the proposed Derry Londonderry City Deal to bolster the NI economy as a whole.”Police investigate war memorial incident Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

Ulster Business chats to Danske Bank’s Vicky Davies and Richard Caldwell about the bank’s new Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub and ‘Making more possible’ for Northern Ireland businesses When you are already leading the technology and digital race in Northern Ireland banking, where do you go from there  For Danske Bank, its sights were set on something hugely ambitious, and something philanthropic which it believes can help cultivate, boost and grow the next generation of technology and fintech business start-ups in Northern Ireland. Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, run in partnership with Catalyst Inc, is a stunning, modern incubator and hub which will see dozens of entrepreneurs and start-up businesses shape and craft their ideas in the heart of Danske Bank’s own Belfast city centre headquarters. The partnership with Catalyst Inc makes a lot of sense, as it already plays host to dozens of knowledge-based businesses across  acres in the Titanic Quarter, and the Innovation Centre in Londonderry. Vicky Davies is managing director of strategy and corporate development at Danske Bank. “We have a clear ambition to be the best bank in Northern Ireland, and we plan to do that by making more possible for our customers, employees, stakeholders and society”, she says. It’s that message, ‘Making more possible’, that adorns the wall of one of the main meeting rooms in the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub. “Banking is changing so fast. It’s relentless in terms of new entrants, innovation and the level of new fintech money coming into the industry.” “We know we need to change at pace, or face being left behind.” “We needed a partner in this venture, and we were looking for someone with reach and expertise,” she said. Following an initial meeting last year with senior management at Catalyst Inc, Vicky says there was an immediate mutual connection, and they went from there. “They have the expertise in running a space like this, and we have access to banking and business expertise – with both of us having great experience in helping businesses to grow. So, every dimension we looked at – it was a really good fit.” The hub is an impressive space, awash with splashes of colour, connectivity, co-working spaces and meeting rooms – including a nod to Princess Leia with an image on a wall – and it is able to play host to around - entrepreneurs and business start-up professionals, with top end cable and fibre internet connections. It’s further evidence of Danske Bank ensuring it’s well ahead of the pack and out in front. It’s about bringing a business from an embryonic start-up, to a thriving company, helping lead the way in its sector. But for Danske, this isn’t all about the bottom line. It’s about creating a thriving hub for the future stars of Northern Ireland’s burgeoning tech sector. And it’s a two-way street – with the bank aiming to learn as much from the start-up businesses nestled in the top-end spacious ground-floor hub, as the other way around. So, what does this mean for Danske Bank in terms of business banking and as an institution further bolstering its credentials in the digital space. Richard Caldwell is managing director of personal banking and small business. “We want to be part of the local fintech journey. We want to help influence and develop ideas,” he says. “There are more than , businesses in Northern Ireland, and we want to continue to support start-ups in general – by putting expertise and support into this partnership, we will help this particular set of small businesses to grow in what is a burgeoning sector.” “Ultimately, real success for us would be seeing products brought to market, and helping businesses grow from an embryonic idea, through to start-up, growth and expansion. With the business maybe ending up as one of our loyal corporate customers in the future.” Richard says research showed that many of Danske Bank’s existing bigger business customers wanted the bank to provide “something more tangible” for start-ups, to grow companies for the future. Although tenants in the new fintech space don’t necessarily have to bank with Danske, the Bank does offer banking support, including everything from a current account, to receiving assistance from a growth adviser to support them with their banking needs. gt “This is a major investment for us,” Richard says. “This is one of the most expensive ground-floor retail premises in Belfast, and we have devoted it to this hub. This is front and centre in the heart of Belfast.” The location of the new hub couldn’t be better – with the new Glider bus linking the hub to Catalyst Inc headquarters in Titanic Quarter. And, as modern tech businesses evolve and reach out to new markets and time zones across the globe, there is also  hour access to the Fintech Hub. The hub has a team of four, two from Danske Bank and two newly recruited by Catalyst Inc. Together Danske Bank and Catalyst Inc have also launched a new online  to help the wider growing number of start-up businesses across Northern Ireland to connect with investors, peers and potential new recruits across Europe - thehub.io helps connect start-ups to relevant resources, such as talent, networks, financing, tools and advice from experts which will help them overcome some of the challenges of scaling up. It is clear that strategically this is a big push by both organisations to play a key supporting role through the provision of both physical and online resources. Digitalisation Richard is keen to point out support for the hubs is just part of a bank-wide digital transformation agenda at Danske. “For example, we want to change the nature of traditional relationship management at the Bank. In addition to managing traditional banking needs as we have always done so well, we are now moving into the added value space. As well as the human touch, customers increasingly want top notch digital solutions to make their lives easier, to give them ease of access and quicker credit decisions.” The digitally-savvy way of thinking is giving Danske Bank competitive advantage, and that is from an already well-established position in the market. Last year they appointed a chief digital officer, who is a member of the Bank’s executive committee. “Our people are still our best asset and will remain so,” Richard said. “We have great people. And customers still highly value that human touch and expert advice. But what the journey looks like for transactions, well we have digital solutions for everything. For your payments, wages, drawing direct debits or paying suppliers. “Right now we are piloting and rolling out digital credit decisions for business customers. This is transforming the credit journey for both our customers and our business relationship managers. For example, one customer recently applied for an overdraft through the digital credit solution and got approval and the funds in their account in  minutes.” Danske Bank was the first of the local Northern Ireland banks to bring in app banking, and solutions such as Samsung Pay, Fitbit Pay and Garmin Pay. And this new Fintech Hub is very much another stride forward. The bank is also leading the pack when it comes to customer satisfaction, right across businesses of all shapes and sizes. “For some time now we have been the market leader in business banking. Research continues to show that our customer satisfaction scores are first for large business, and first for small business,” Richard said. Both Vicky and Richard are keen to see what they predict will be short and long-term benefits from the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub. There’s an organic osmosis, allowing ideas to flow freely between the Danske Bank people visiting from upstairs and those entrepreneurs which it hosts on the ground floor. “The entrepreneurs in the hub bring a fresh mindset, one we can learn from as we continue our own digital journey throughout the bank,” Vicky says. Richard added: “The fintech sector is seen in many quarters as a challenger to traditional banks, but we are embracing it and feel we can grow with it, to the benefit of our customers.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Oly-1.jpg","title":"titanic quarter office scheme out for tender","story":"Posted on Tuesday  November  by Ulster Business A huge office scheme for the Titanic Quarter has taken a step forward as the development is put out for tender.
