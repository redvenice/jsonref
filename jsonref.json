The therapist encourages her to “connect” with herself and “experience nature better”. Hardman wanders through the wood and finds a small hornbeam, which is twisting up towards the light, struggling to make its way in the shade of a mature oak. She is attracted to its shape, admires its bark, and draws parallels with her own life: how long it takes to heal and grow, how the scars we gather can still be beautiful “like the zig-zagging trunk of this young tree”. She reaches up and snaps one of its twigs: the tree is dead.“Serves me right for being so dreadfully whimsical,” Hardman writes. “There seemed to be no neat life lesson here, nothing you’d want to write on a fridge magnet or share on social media. I’d come here hoping to connect with myself, and instead I’d been drawn to a tree that was secretly dead.”It is a valuable lesson in Hardman’s The Natural Health Service, a practical and self-aware account of the relief from mental illness to be found outside. Hardman, and the many people she meets, identify respite, recovery and resilience in walking, running, cold-water swimming, gardening, “forest bathing”, birdwatching, botanising, horse riding and caring for pets. The common denominator is what Hardman calls “the great outdoors”, that plangent, hearty Victorian-sounding cliche. But as she shows, other species and their ecosystems can be rebellious medics. At times, the “natural” world resembles the magic mirror that undercuts Snow White’s stepmother: rather than reflecting back ourselves, it is alive with its own agency, a challenge to our narcissism.The Natural Health Service is one of a rapidly growing forest of new books that examine cures found in nature. This winter alone has brought the publication of The Wild Remedy by Emma Mitchell Losing Eden by Lucy Jones Rootbound by Alice Vincent and Wintering by Katherine May. One of last year’s unexpectedly prominent books – unexpected because it was rejected by publishers and crowdfunded via Unbound – was Bird Therapy by Joe Harkness. Just as trend is followed by takedown, so this spring sees a potential debunking in the form of Natural: The Seductive Myth of Nature’s Goodness by American philosopher Alan Levinovitz.The idea that human health can be salved by “nature” has been around for as long as we have regarded ourselves as a species apart from other living things. It truly arrived in Britain with the Romantics, for whom prosperity enabled a more reflective and worshipful relationship with the landscape that others had to toil in for a living. Keats and Byron loved swimming sea-bathing was an upper-class health fad that inspired the first seaside resorts. The popularisation of nature’s healing power peaked after the industrial revolution, when later Victorians were beset by fears of the all-conquering machine. Fresh air, exercise and healthful hobbies, from collecting butterflies to finding fossils, were prescribed in much the same way as GPs today are experimenting with “prescribing nature” to patients. Hardman reminds us of the prescience of Octavia Hill, the social reformer and co-founder of the National Trust in 1895, who campaigned to save urban land for city parks. London commons that could make developers fortunes had greater value as outdoor space, Hill argued: “To my mind they are even now worth very much but they will be more and more valuable every year – valuable in the deepest sense of the word health-giving, joy-inspiring, peace-bringing.”As the climate and extinction crisis quickens, so there is a rush for a literary cure. In Britain it began with Richard Mabey’s Nature Cure in 2005. In many of the most popular recent examples of nature writing, other species and wild places have played a healing role – for bereavement in Helen Macdonald’s H Is for Hawk, and alcoholism in Amy Liptrot’s The Outrun. Nature Cure (briefly) details Mabey’s mental breakdown after completing his magnum opus, Flora Britannica, and the succour he found by forgoing his childhood home in the Chilterns for the bleaker plains of south Norfolk. When I ask Mabey if he regrets being midwife to the nature cure subgenre, an emphatic “yes” spills forth. “I feel slightly guilty about the title, which was my idea and it was very euphonious, but I quite soon began getting letters from people saying they loved the book but that it was not much to do with nature curing me. If a pedantic scholar counted the paragraphs that were to do with the illness, it probably amounts to about six pages,” he says. “Really it’s a book about encountering and adapting to a quite new landscape, which you could say was a post-cure experience.” Mabey had to reach a certain stage of recovery to write Nature Cure. As he, Hardman and other nature cure writers emphasise, they can be too ill to leave the house to imbibe the healing wild, and too ill to write, too.“It’s wonderful when it occurs people in distress find that encounters with the natural world do restore them,” says Mabey. But two things concern him about the concept of a nature cure. “I’m worried that it’s become mooted as a kind of panacea – green Prozac. And if there’s anything wrong you just go out and look at the pretty flowers and you’re going to be marvellous. That’s a tall order if the natural world is in a state of crisis with the insect apocalypse and British songbirds collapsing all around us. There is also a danger that therapeutic nature becomes another way in which nature is reduced to service provider. The foregrounding of us being the centre of attention, the central agents of change and growth, all form part of a mindset that I think is obsolete. We need to rethink where we stand in relation to all these other organisms and what the transactions are between us, and stop saying they are all for our benefit, even though most of them probably are.”In an insightful essay on nature cures, Richard Smyth quotes the poet Polly Atkin, who is diagnosed with chronic illnesses Ehlers-Danlos syndromes and genetic haemochromatosis, a metabolic disorder that leads to a toxic accumulation of iron in the body. Like Mabey, Atkin has misgivings about this literary blossoming. “There is very little published work that points out how problematic it is – largely because the people who understand the problem are mainly those with incurable conditions and they’re often too busy being incurable to write books about nature,” she says. “More importantly, mainstream UK publishing is so attached to the ‘nature cure’ narrative that it can’t imagine another story to tell about how we relate to the world around us.”The stage is set for a debunking of the literary nature cure but in Natural, it never quite arrives. At the end of the book, despite Levinovitz taking smart aim at the snake-oil salespeople of late capitalism – those selling expensive natural remedies, natural “cures” for cancer, or loudly advocating “wholly natural” childbirth, sex or sport – he concludes that there is something innately glorious about the non-human natural world.What Levinovitz critiques is what he sees as a religious attitude towards nature. An appeal to natural goodness – with “unnatural” as its evil twin – is among the most influential arguments in all human thought, ancient and modern, east and west. In fact, every human-made object is extracted from our planet everything is “natural”. Levinovitz argues our veneration of “nature” is dangerous, citing former South African president Thabo Mbeki’s desire for Aids patients to take beetroot and other “natural” treatments. What Levinovitz does is help us to identify the “propagandists, bigots, demagogues, and marketeers who wrap their rhetoric in the mantle of ‘what’s natural’”. When it comes to making money from nature, the small, poorly renumerated band of writers proselytising for its health benefits do not enter Levinovitz’s line of fire. While H Is for Hawk will long stand as a literary classic, nature cure writing has taken a practical turn. Hardman and Harkness’s books are squarely self-help. Their qualities include brutal honesty and generous advice. Both authors, alongside others such as Jones and Mitchell, make clear that while time in the natural world has ameliorated their mental illnesses, so too have antidepressants and talking cures. These writers don’t succumb to the requirement for a happy ending either: no one suggests they are cured.We might wonder if a writing cure is also part of their wider recovery, but it is not always so. John Clare, who died in 1864, has long been the most notable nature writer with mental health problems. The Northamptonshire farm labourer, whose superb poems made him a literary sensation in the early 19th century, could be considered both evidence for and against the theory that nature makes us well. Did he only fall ill once embraced by literary London, psychically uprooted from his rural heartland? Or was he ill despite surrounding himself with nature? A country life is no guarantee of mental wellbeing: depression is a major problem in modern farming plenty of farm workers endure it.There is an echo of Clare’s experience in Harkness’s account of life since the publication of his debut, Bird Therapy. “I will never write about nature again,” says Harkness bluntly. He has been diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder and generalised anxiety disorder – mild medical terms for the crippling anxiety that Harkness vividly describes. After an attempted suicide and a breakdown, he began walking and discovered the exhilaration of encountering birds. “Of all the therapies I’ve tried,” he writes, “nothing has had the prolonged and positive impact that birdwatching has.” He spotted that the requirements of birdwatching matched the five ways to wellbeing devised by a project endorsed by the charity Mind: to connect, to take notice, to give, to keep learning and to be active.As Harkness’s profile grew on social media, he decided to write a book, receiving high-profile endorsements, including an incisive foreword by the naturalist Chris Packham, who declared it an “exceptional” publication because it would save lives. Eight months on, Harkness recognises that his book has brought positive things: his honesty about mental illness has encouraged others to reciprocate. He has been told by readers that it has indeed saved their lives. Unfortunately, the online platform that enabled him to promote his book also damaged him. “The more open I was on social media, the less people engaged with me. If you’re already struggling with self-esteem, it is hell to be on it. The only way I could deal with it is not use Twitter any more,” he says.He has also shed his illusions about the “guild” of nature writers. He imagined this literary world would be an inclusive salon for the free exchange of ideas about nature and mental health instead he found a workplace, “a competitive market with a lot of emphasis on product and what you’re selling”, where “people become very focused on themselves”. One nature writer, he says, told him that Bird Therapy only sold well because of Packham’s foreword. Harkness, who is a special educational needs co-ordinator working with vulnerable young people, says he is so glad that writing is not his job. His post-book cure has been to remove himself from social media and literary “backslapping” and simplify his birdwatching regimen. “I don’t drive to birdwatch any more. I walk from my house. I’m under no pressure to see anything exciting. I’ve stopped commodifying it. I just think of being out where I should be. Whenever I do that I’m really thankful for it. Nature is not there to make me feel better. It’s something we can use to help us but ultimately we have to be there for it as well. And we’ve got to make wholesale changes to how we live.”Most nature cure books, both literary triumphs and practical manuals, are overwhelmingly about us. Perhaps we should catch more glimpses of other species as we look into the mirror? Mitchell’s The Wild Remedy, a diary of a year with severe depression, throws welcome attention on natural medicines – the thrilling dash of a sparrowhawk, or the cosy sight of ladybirds clustered together during winter in a knapweed seedhead. She recreates her encounters with other species around her home in Cambridgeshire in paintings, sketches, photographs and cabinets of curiosities. But, she says, “I’m not using my garden and the wood beyond my cottage as a sort of green Tesco, burgling myself some green serotonin and dopamine. It’s much more of a two-way relationship.” Mitchell, like Harkness, initially connected via social media with readers and others who lived with mental illness. She is not always well enough to visit a nearby wood every day. When she does, she monitors, observes and records the wildlife, and relays it to her audience. A biologist by training, Mitchell hopes her writing and art enlighten our increasingly urban society. “I’m trying to use the place where I live as a source of education for people who may not know what cherry plum blossom looks like – ‘This is coming into flower, go and see if you’ve got it on your patch,’” she says. Awakening readers to other species around us is a gift to those species, and it is bequeathed by almost every nature cure writer.Last summer, an area of flowery meadowland in the wood near Mitchell exploded with life. The hot summer of 2018 must have produced “a metric fucktonne of caterpillars” she laughs: the following year there emerged hundreds of marbled white butterflies. “The dose of dopamine was just off the scale.” She filmed it for her social media followers. A few days later, in full flower, the meadow was scalped because of fears it contained ragwort, a flower that can in rare cases prove fatal to horses (and which landowners sometimes mistakenly believe they are obliged to control under an arcane “injurious” weeds law). An exquisite ecosystem was cut down at its peak. Alongside Mitchell’s enjoyment of this meadow emerged a deep connection with it, and a responsibility for it. “My connection with this land is not as a commodity. This is not skincare I get from a beauty parlour. This is not a monthly subscription to sniff some dead-nettle flowers. This is something that has changed my ability to live with my depression,” she says. In this case, she went into battle with her local council, at some personal cost – “I’m a spokesperson for thousands of invertebrates because they’ve got no voice,” she says – and succeeded in changing the cutting regime. The meadow won’t be cut again this year until the flowers and invertebrates have finished flowering and flying.The Earth is our home and we are making ourselves homeless. Jones quotes the farmer-thinker Wendell Berry: “We are involved in a kind of lostness in which most people are participating more or less unconsciously in the destruction of the natural world, which is to say, the sources of our own lives.” Perhaps some of our lack of awareness, Jones thinks, is an instinctive denial of death just as we block out our own mortality, so too we pretend our compulsive consumption is not hastening the premature end of our species’ enjoyment of the planet.As Jones argues, despite all our writing about “nature”, we still lack the language to bring its jeopardy – our jeopardy – to the forefront of our troubled minds. Western consumption has made the planet ill, and now we are patients too. Grief and mental illness can be introspective and paralysing or they can inspire action. Which path will we as iniduals, societies and as a species choose?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4e76fda2c964cb03afc0a9808663ba763b20b9a/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e1f14443b93210104d6133207fcd2e6","title":"greggs cornish resurrection sparks consternation from locals","story":"Bakery chain opening outlet in home of Cornish pasty after last one closed two months agoIt has long been hostile territory for Greggs, but it seems that the high-street chain is to go once more into the breach of opening up a branch in the home of the Cornish pasty.Months after the company closed down its one and only branch in the county, a new outlet is expected to be unveiled close to the hamlet of Victoria.Cue renewed outrage on social media from local people fiercely proud of their county’s most famous culinary export.“Haven’t they realised we eat a lot better than that down here with hundreds of decent bakeries the length of Cornwall?” said Carole Sebart, an employee at a cafe in Padstow.Paul Richards, a photographer in Truro, Cornwall, suggested on Facebook: “It might succeed with the tourists. Locals will avoid. So will have to see if it’s financially viable.”The company, which has more than 1,700 shops across the UK but none in Cornwall, declined to comment but is understood to be months away from a potential opening at a service station on the A30 which has a pizza cafe, as well as branches of Costa Coffee and McDonald’s.A spokesperson for the service station, Cornwall Services, said: “We cannot currently confirm who the new tenant will be. We hope to make an announcement very soon.”Greggs’ previous foothold in Cornwall was within another service station, at Saltash on the very eastern edge of the county, before it beat what some referred to as a hasty “Greggxit”.Its initial opening in 2018 sparked consternation, with a celebrated veteran pasty maker, Marion Symonds, saying: “I don’t think many Cornish people would ever buy one of their pasties.”While pasties can only be called Cornish if they include only beef, potato, swede or turnip, onion and seasoning, the current Greggs menu continues to offer what the chain describes as their “take on this delicious West Country classic”, a version containing steak, mince beef with potato and onion.It adds: “Plus, to give it our own touch we add carrots and peas. Controversial, we know. But we like a few colourful veggies in there.”But the company faces a daunting task if experience is anything to go by. One independent baker on a previous occasion told the Sun that even his attempts at ersification had ended in failure: “We tried different flavours, like chilli and things like that, but people just want traditional pasties.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90e03271b2210bb578750db4d6a7ab9d21b1af3a/0_157_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=8609986f8143c38e51c208edd5086416","title":"plague coronavirus british panic buying","story":"Having had a temperature and a dry cough for some days now – don’t worry, I’m not going to write That Column – I’ve been doing the reading equivalent of shopping in my closet. And, ever a sucker for a theme, this has turned out to be that rare occasion where I’ve ended up going: “Ooh, I must have some more Fruit \u0026amp Nut and get Daniel Defoe’s A Journal of the Plague Year down off the shelves”. Forgive me that was unclear. Fruit \u0026amp Nut is a hugely frequent occurrence a need for historical accounts of mass distemper less so.Obviously I’m slightly put out to discover that what follows might not be the first review of the work. I understand Defoe’s fascinating account of the 1665-66 London plague season received very favourable notices when it came out (the year 1722). I myself found it a brilliant curiosity of a book when I read it first time round (the year 1995). But from the particular vantage point of the year 2020, I can only say: guys, it really is all there. Ye olde panicke buying, ye olde refusal to self-isolate – “they did not take the least care or make any scruple of infecting others” – ye olde wittering and twittering of conspiracy theories. “The error of the times,” as Defoe optimistically judges them.Nor were our plague-plagued 17th-century forebears short of famous imbeciles with a public platform. Defoe’s narrator marvels at the pitiable foolishness of one noted idiot who spent his time going about the city spouting deranged pronouncements and doomy surmise, the occupation of breakfast television presenter not existing at the time. Nor, indeed, the occupation of former leader of the Brexit party.There are suddenly familiar tales of the rich taking flight (in the 1665 version, to the countryside, as opposed to the sort of bunker complex where one might have to know Mark Zuckerberg socially). The narrator voices huge admiration for the poorest workers and those on the frontline of fighting the pestilence, who “went about their employment with a sort of brutal courage”. I thought of this when Jenny Vaughan of the Doctor’s Association told Thursday’s Channel 4 News: “We will lose our colleagues – we will be burying our colleagues.”.Others in 1665 London behave absolutely appallingly, of course – worse even than you might see in the 2020 supermarket bog roll aisle. Then again, it’s still early days for us.Speaking of shopping, it’s striking how 350 years of retail innovation don’t amount to a hill of beans. Like many of my friends right now, Defoe’s narrator is sufficiently disorganised to have very little stuff in, when the plague gets serious. “I was one of those thoughtless ones …” Thereafter, his stockpiling necessities are flour, malt to brew “as much beer as all the casks I had would hold”, salted butter and Cheshire cheese (the components of a much more agreeable supper than pasta, surely). Most ominous is his realisation that regular panic-buying sorties were likely the occasions on which many people ended up catching the distemper.So everything changes, and nothing changes. Almost 50 years after the plague, Defoe comes to write the book in what he regards as a media explosion. Newspapers and periodicals and pamphlets were now everywhere, meaning that reports, accurate or otherwise, “spread instantly over the whole nation”. This is the only thing on which we might pull rank on Defoe, with a friendly “Dude: it gets SO much worse. Wait till they get school parents WhatsApp groups, and uncles on Facebook.”And yet, it’s surely the 1722-ers who should be pulling rank on us. After all, you’d hope that in three and a half centuries of supposed progress, we might just have moved beyond virally disseminated quack cures and “hearing that the virus is a bioweapon invented by the US  China???” But we haven’t, presidents and politburo officials included. We remain, as Defoe put it, “addicted to prophecies and astrological conjurations, dreams, and old wives tales”.Most resonantly for the contemporary UK, perhaps, the infectious disease Defoe is writing about comes to an already ided nation – barely five years after the Restoration, not a whole lot more after the civil war, and with ideological and religious arguments positively frothing. The narrator rather hopes it will end up uniting people. “Another plague year would reconcile all these differences,” he idealises. “A close conversing with death … would scum off the gall from our tempers, remove the animosities among us …”Yup, well, SPOILERS: it doesn’t. “As the terror of the infection abated, those things all returned to their less desirable channel,” the narrator laments. “There did not cease the spirit of strife and contention, slander and reproach, which was really the great troubler of the nation’s peace before.” Likewise. Perhaps we’ll make a better fist of it.For now, there is a distinct war-by-other-means to what we might euphemise as “the discourse” around coronavirus, on social media and beyond. People have been very used to entrenching on leave and remain lines now we seem to have almost reflexively self-split into Panickers and Deniers. These two categories don’t mirror their immediate forerunners, of course – you can be a hard remainer and a hard panicker, for instance, or a hard leaver and a hard panicker and so on. Some people who’d had enough of this lot having had enough of experts have now had enough of this lot deferring to experts.Still, we polarise about everything else – why not this? Maybe there is something of the comfort of the familiar in fighting pitched online battles about whether Boris Johnson is or isn’t telling the truth about a matter. It’s all we’ve known for years. It’s just the stakes are suddenly rather higher.Wishing the prime minister anything but the absolute best in his stewardship of this crisis is psychopathic. But it does feel a little late in the day for Johnson to set himself against whipped-up hysteria and dodgy fake news. In an era of rumour and superstition, Defoe laments that the government of 1665 didn’t do more to clamp down on popular falsehoods, putting this down to their “being unwilling to exasperate the people”. Our current government seems markedly more willing to exasperate the people, with its coronavirus response atypically cavalier compared with that of so many other countries. This … might be a good thing? Then again it … might be up there with the very worst things? After four years which have upended so many of the certainties, it’s rather difficult to get any bearings. But wherever we really are, and whoever Boris Johnson really is, we finally are all in this together."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a48d23317731a0322e0cfa0acaa6e5d966f82e3/0_270_3945_2367/master/3945.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7eb143a936983590dda339c780d956b9","title":"i cant get above water how americas chicken giant perdue controls farmers","story":"Corporate control is a curse for farmers like Rudy Howell who are burdened with debt and have no alternative buyersBack in the 1990s, Rudy Howell, then in his mid-50s, took over his father-in-law’s poultry contract business in North Carolina. He and his wife hoped it would provide a decent income they could combine with their small pensions to fund a comfortable retirement.But contracts typically hand a remarkable amount of control to the parent company. In this case, Perdue maintains ownership of the birds, and the contract stipulates that farmers can only use feed, medication, vaccinations and other supplies provided by or arranged by Perdue. The contract also grants Perdue the authority to determine the breed of chickens produced, the numbers in each flock, the time allowed for processing each flock, and placement for future flocks.Howell and his fellow poultry farmers are so far from independent that in March 2018 the small business administration office of the Inspector General issued a report stating that most poultry farmers do not qualify as independent businesses eligible for loans from the agency because integrators exert so much control over them. “This control overcame practically all of a grower’s ability to operate their business independent of integrator mandates,” it concluded.It’s a system that has been criticised by farm support groups, because it prevents farmers from changing poultry producer or leaving the business due to the amount of debt accrued to get started and maintain the business. The average estimated debt required to build one chicken house is $300,000, with farms usually containing at least four. The bank debts immediately lock producers into depending on their contract to meet repayments. Howell says he is also mandated to take on farm upgrades as required by the company.“It’s a combination of long-term debt through a contract and a very high cost of exit. For the company, it’s a short-term commitment. The farmers are at a huge disadvantage,” said Scott Marlow, senior policy specialist at the Rural Advancement Foundation International-USA. “By the time the farmer pays initial debt, they have to buy new equipment so they never get out of debt, never get to the point where they’re not in significant debt.”Howell has little alternative but to stick with Perdue. In Robeson County, North Carolina, where he farms, there is only one other company, Mountaire Farms, to do business with, but the changes it would require to meet different standards would demand a massive amount of starter debt.Perdue told the  that Sanderson Farms and Pilgrim Farms also operate in the area. In fact, as far as we could discover, Sanderson Farms only operates hatcheries and a processing plant, not chicken houses. Pilgrim Farms told the  it does not operate any houses in the county.While a number of contract broiler growers are reporting incomes substantially higher than average farm incomes, the  United States Department of Agriculture has said growers’ income can vary widely with some reporting earnings as low as $18,782.A South Carolina poultry grower also supplying Perdue, who asked to remain anonymous, made a similar claim: “You’re penalised if you don’t perform and it’s not your fault. You listen to your flock supervisor throughout and then do poorly. Why am I at fault if I do everything they want me to do?”“On average, we have to kill 6-8,000 chickens per flock because they’re not growing, but we don’t get compensated for it. We shouldn’t have to pay for birds that are given to us sick and it’s been getting worse over the past year,” he added.In response, a Perdue spokesperson told the : “Culls and livability varies from farm to farm. Birds that are well cared for will generally have a higher livability and that has a lot to do with the management style on the farm. As part of our animal care initiative, we have put a lot of emphasis on identifying birds that are in pain or can’t get to feed and water, and taking the proper measures. It is the right thing to do.”The spokesperson added: “Our poultry farming contracts are designed to help insulate farmers from most of the financial risks associated with raising chickens and turkeys – including volatile markets – while providing year-round farm income and rewarding top performance.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc125d6998b44a2398a9cc913b29f9e09bdcda80/0_553_5399_3239/master/5399.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f811f1220228d749984d31e8b3abdbc0","title":"on the verge a quiet roadside revolution is boosting wildflowers aoe","story":"Projects to reduce grass cutting and increase the ersity of plants and wildlife along Britain’s roads are having dramatic resultsIn 2014, Giles Nicholson was battling the growing year from hell. A mild winter followed by a warm, wet spring had turbocharged a ferocious mass of cow parsley, nettles and dense grass along the hundreds of miles of road his team maintains for Dorset council. Austerity meant there was barely enough money to pay for repeated cuttings to hold back the matted swards. Complaints poured in about messy roadsides.But the chaos of that summer would prove an unlikely turning point for wildflowers and bioersity in the English county. Vast stretches of roadside have been transformed. Where there were thick clumps of grass, there are low-growing wildflowers such as black medic, birds-foot trefoil and red clover. The verges are cut two or three times a year, not 12, saving the council tens of thousands of pounds. Butterflies and other invertebrates have returned in their droves.The reasons behind this unlikely mini-revolution for bioersity are simple. When the worst of the 2014 growing season was over, ecologist Philip Sterling was brought in to oversee the council’s service team. He and Nicholson, Dorset council’s countryside and greenspace manager, set about applying the centuries-old principles of hay making to the management of verges, cul-de-sacs and urban grass patches across the county. It is a practice that has now been adopted by other counties in the UK, including in Lincolnshire.The process is simple: cut infrequently, ideally, just twice a year in spring and then late summer once plants have bloomed and seeded remove the clippings to gradually reduce the fertility of the soil and prevent a buildup of mulch repeat, wait, and enjoy the resurgent wildlife and flowers.“It will not fail,” says Sterling, who, as programme manager for charity Butterfly Conservation’s building sites for butterflies project, has taken his roadside revolution around the country to any local authority that will listen. “As fertility declines in a soil, bioersity increases. At first that seems a little counterintuitive because you imagine the more you pour into a soil, the more plants that can grow. That’s not how it works in the natural system. In more fertile systems, a few species dominate and they swamp and smother everything else.”Grass cuttings are almost always left where they fall along the thousands of miles of road verges that are maintained by law in the UK. Over time, the resulting mulch increases the fertility of the soil, meaning the grass grows with increasing vigour and needs to be cut more frequently. The cut and collect method breaks the cycle.The before and after photos of otherwise ordinary roadsides across Dorset show the dramatic effects of Nicholson and Sterling’s maintenance regime, as suffocated seed banks have been allowed to spring back into life. Yarrow and yellow flashes of lady’s bedstraw punctuate roadsides and roundabouts throughout summer. Magenta pyramidal orchids linger outside a branch of Tesco.The cost savings of managing roadsides this way are equally stunning for the council’s accounting department. The annual budget for highway verge management dropped from nearly £1m to £650k in five years under the cut and collect, low fertility approach. London boroughs, councils from across the country and European governments are paying attention.“For the last 40 years we’ve been doing entirely the wrong thing,” says Sterling, impatient with the possibilities for roadsides across the UK and beyond.Last September, the wildlife charity Plantlife produced new guidelines for transforming the management of the UK’s roadsides that incorporate some of Nicholson and Sterling’s practices. Crucially, the plan to turn verges into wildlife corridors is also backed by the country’s highways authorities and construction and services businesses such as Kier and Skanska.“It’s about bringing colour back to the countryside and to our roadsides. If we have that colour there, then we’ll have lots of other wildlife there as well,” says Plantlife botanist Trevor Dines.“Plants are the powerhouses of our food chains. They are the only things that are collecting energy from the sun and pumping it into the food chain. Without that ersity of plants there, you don’t get the ersity of other wildlife,” he adds.One 4.5-mile stretch in Dorset shows what is possible: the Weymouth relief road. Opened in 2011 ahead of sailing events at the Olympics, the seven hectares (17 acres) of verges that line one of the busiest roads in the county have become a crucial site for bioersity.Yellow clusters of kidney vetch, the only wildflower where the small blue, Britain’s smallest butterfly, will lay its eggs, dominate the roadsides in the spring and summer. But the medicinal pea-like flowers, whose seeds can cost more than £2,000 a kilo from commercial providers, are not an extravagant token of the region’s Olympic legacy.“I harvested the seeds for that myself,” says Sterling, recounting the painstaking task of growing enough kidney vetch at recycling centres and flood bunds since the early 90s. “Now look how much there is.” Since the road opened, more than half of the species of butterfly known to inhabit Britain have been recorded on the grasslands lining the road, including the Adonis blue and Chalkhill blue. Sterling has 10kg of of kidney vetch seed ready in his office for when the Stonehenge tunnel gets approval .“If you think about the species of butterfly that Weymouth relief road supports on seven hectares, what would it be like on a hundred hectares?” says Nicholson excitedly.“There’s a huge opportunity here in the UK to change what we’ve currently got,” says Sterling. “We can put back much of what we’ve lost. It’s not impossible to do. We haven’t gone beyond that tipping point where there is so little left that there’s no point.“If half the species of butterfly in the UK can turn up on a road verge created less than 10 years ago, then we do have the capabilities to do this, don’t we?”But such enthusiasm for Britain’s wildflowers are not apparent everywhere. Opposite a burger van in a ditch near Ely lies one of England’s rarest plants, the only known native fenland ragwort plant.The critically endangered wildflower, which is supposedly protected by being on a Site of Special Scientific Interest, is surrounded by faded McDonald’s packaging and beer tins. The plant was only discovered when a French botanist from a nearby Cambridge research centre identified it while relieving himself in a layby in the 1960s, so the story goes.“It was the first sighting of fen ragwort since the mid to late 19th century, so getting on for 100 years, more or less,” says Tim Pankhurst, Plantlife’s conservation manager for the east of England, as lorries storm pass on the road that links Ely and Newmarket.“That’s it for fen ragwort. This is the sole native site in Britain. A lonely roadside ditch at the back of a verge near Ely.”The tall plant is a relic of how the fens, in Cambridgeshire, Lincolnshire and Norfolk, used to be: a vast expanse of marshland full of native birds and wildlife. Fen ragwort would have been torn up and moved around by flood waters, but since the region was drained in the 18th century, there’s now only one known native site.Grass needs to be three to four inches long for flowers such as clovers, daisies, selfheal and creeping buttercup to thrive. Prof Jane Memmott, president of the British Ecological Society, says we should drop our obsession with keeping everything tidy. “I think bohemian untidiness is what we’re aiming for – you don’t want it to look like neglect. If gardeners can\u0027t wave goodbye to their manicured lawn, Buglife recommends leaving a strip of long grass and mowing it just once in autumn and spring.Dandelions are a crucial source of food for early pollinators such as solitary bees, honey bees and hoverflies. Each dandelion head contains up to 100 inidual flowers, known as florets, which contain large amounts of nectar and pollen.Old English roses and dahlias might look beautiful but they focus much of their energy on producing petals, leaving little nectar for insects. A good test to find out if a flower is insect-friendly is to see whether you can see the pollen and nectar parts without pulling the petals back. If they are visible, it’s probably ok for pollinators, Memmott says.The trend for artificial lawns threatens valuable habitats for a wide range of butterflies, bees and birds. Research from 2011 found that 7,423 acres of the UK’s garden space had been lost over eight years and nearly all of this loss was down to people putting decking, concrete or artificial grass over their gardens.\u0026nbspRestoring wildflower meadows in the agricultural heartlands of the UK by creating a network of wildlife corridors has become a particular focus for conservationists. The widest road verges in the country are in East Anglia, on the former drovers’ roads once used to transport livestock to London and other major cities. Small stretches in Lincolnshire have been managed as roadside nature reserves since the 1960s.Seated around a table in a rural pub near Spalding in Lincolnshire is an unlikely trio of wildflower revolutionaries taking Plantlife’s maintenance guidelines one step further. Derek Scott, an agricultural equipment manufacturer, Henry Dymoke, a local farmer and landowner, and Mark Schofield, a conservation officer at Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust, have developed a machine that could spread the cut and collect method around the country.Scott’s company manufactures industry-standard machinery for vegetable washing, which is exported to every major agricultural economy. In 2018, Schofield convinced him to apply his engineering prowess to a pioneering tender by Lincolnshire County Council to create machinery that would allow the local authority to use the cut and collect method on hundreds of miles of road in the county.Crucially, the machinery had to be able to deliver the cuttings to an anaerobic digestion plant that could convert the grass into biogas, which is found at Dymoke’s farm, Scrivelsby Estate.The Vergenair 5.5 verge harvesting system is a JCB tractor, an Italian suction flail and a Larrington trailer. The bespoke machinery trundles along the roadsides, cutting the grass and sucking it into the trailer which can take up to 10,000kg to the anaerobic digestion plant.“We’re replacing a natural process. We see fossil records of the auroch, the ancestor of the modern-day cow in cave paintings. Predators would drive them on from place to place, they’d have routes to get to water and they’d be moving from one bit of grazing to another bit of grazing,” says Schofield.“Hay cutting is our replacement for the wild auroch, the tarpan, the horse, the red deer. You can’t unleash the auroch on the A158 but you can have an artificial beast that’s a lot more manageable.”The contraption allows the council to use the cut and collect, low fertility method across Lincolnshire and could go nationwide. But the project has come to an abrupt halt. The Environment Agency (EA) did not renew the permit for Lincolnshire to continue the trial due to concerns about waste codes and regulations.Because roadside verges are not being managed as a crop, they are formally classified as waste. To continue the project, Dymoke would have to purchase expensive new permits from the EA and invest thousands of pounds in upgrades to the anaerobic digestion plants.For now, Dorset and Lincolnshire lead an increasing number of councils in the quest to turn UK roadsides into the backbone of a nature recovery network where native plants and wildlife are free to re-emerge.Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow bioersity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71218c0d4064855e2f0c261031338bda47b45bd3/220_62_2710_1626/master/2710.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2abdbc4ab46621466befbcfd9d389889","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"The pick of the world’s best flora and fauna photos, including the last female white giraffe and boxing hares"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f53dffacfc850d06b878518550d36595e8397852/120_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f74ea174f0e22d688d09d6ee40f3a66","title":"and then we danced review gay romance tbilisi","story":"Tbilisi is the setting for this charged romance between two men training as traditional Georgian dancersReal-life dancer Levan Gelbakhiani is Mehrab, a redhead with round, watchful eyes training as part of the National Georgian Ensemble in Tbilisi. It’s in his blood – his delinquent older brother David (Giorgi Tsereteli) is a dancer too, as were his parents and ageing grandmother. A macho discipline that comprises forceful military moves and elaborate, athletic leaps, the tradition of Georgian dancing contains “no room for weakness” and certainly “no sex”, according to Mehrab’s teacher. Enter new student Irakli (Bachi Valishvili), tall, dark and handsome with a twinkle in his eye and a spring in his step that knocks Mehrab sideways. Swedish writer-director Levan Atkin’s heady third feature is attuned to the way desire has a tendency to throw everyday mundanities into sharp relief.Mehrab is indifferent when dance partner Mary (Ana Javakishvili) falls asleep on his shoulder, but when it’s Irakli, he’s silently elated. Most of the boys’ increasingly charged interactions play out in the studio before the sun has risen, and after hours, over a lamp’s orange glow cinematographer Lisabi Fridell bathes their blooming attraction in syrupy amber light. A street lamp illuminates a private show and turns it gold, as Mehrab dances shirtless for Irakli to Robyn’s seductive track Honey. This awakening eventually leads him to one of Tbilisi’s underground gay clubs. Gelbakhiani is commanding in his first acting role, metabolising heartbreak and moving with an irrepressible prowling sensuality.In ultra-conservative Georgia, desire between two men remains strictly taboo. And so longing throbs like a sickness in small, unacknowledged gestures like the careful folding of a would-be lover’s T-shirt or a juicy, bleeding pomegranate (recalling, perhaps, Call Me By Your Name’s peach). Luca Guadagnino’s queer romance might seem like a reference point, but that film’s swanky Italian villa is a world away from Mehrab’s, with his precarious restaurant job and out-of-credit mobile phone.

For the few who do, the ‘Matric’ celebrations are prodigiousIn the Cape Flats, the townships and countryside in and around Cape Town where deprivation is high, many students drop out of high school due to pregnancy, substance abuse, being recruited by gangs or to support their families. School fees are a steep price to pay in an area where most families struggle to put food on the table.Matric dances are held to celebrate those who graduate (matriculate). For months beforehand, families who live in poverty-stricken areas save to buy extravagant ballgowns and tuxedos, and to hire limousines for the big night. If a family is lucky enough to have a student graduate from high school, no effort is spared to give them the night of their dreams. For many, this is the first family member to graduate.On the night of the dance, the communities on the outskirts of Cape Town are buzzing with activity. Red carpets are rolled out while aunts decorate houses with organza fabric, and tables are heavily laden with food for family and friends.

The sad thing is that sometimes kids who have a lot of potential and who actually want to finish high school have to drop out to work so that they can help support their families.This is just the start for me.No matter what your circumstances or how poor you are, don’t ever give up. That matric certificate is a key that can open any door. Don’t let finances get in the way of following your dreams. I’m not letting it stop me. Keep working hard – it pays off in the end!I believe that hard work and determination will determine your future. And passion. If you don’t have passion for what you do, you will easily be distracted. When you enjoy doing something, you feel the need to do it.In these times you can’t blame your circumstances for where you end up in life. I want to rise up and prove that I can make something of my life.I see how the kids around me drop out of school and fall victim to drug abuse and gangsterism. I want something better for my life."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af37983d99f8d8ed557705dca57f8a7c003d060b/0_151_588_353/master/588.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d2270840022ee4673e86086c4b9ea75","title":"the new equality proposing marriage simultaneously","story":"Like double rainbows, double proposals feel unexpected and delightful, and they allow couples to tailor their engagement to suit their valuesI hope I’m not giving too much away by saying that episode three of Netflix’s slaphappy romantic reality show Love is Blind opens with a proposal. Contestant Damian Powers is down on one knee, asking his newfound love interest Giannina Gibelli to be his wife.Then, Gibelli flips the script.Instead of a “yes” or “no,” she clambers on to the ground herself and announces, “One thing that I don’t believe in is roles or labels … I see you as an equal, I want to ask you Damien Powers, will you marry me?”Powers weeps with joy, as, one assumes, do the show’s producers (what a twist!).Like double rainbows, double proposals feel unexpected and delightful. And they don’t just happen on TV. Kirsten Palladino, editor of the LGBTQ+ focused Equally Wed magazine, has observed their rising popularity within the queer community over the last seven-odd years. “Couples we’re seeing who are doing mutual proposals really want to be equal partners in every way, and don’t subscribe to heteronormative, socially prescribed gender roles,” says Palladino, who estimates that about a quarter of the couples profiled by her publication both proposed. “It sets the stage for a relationship whether neither person has the upper hand.”After four years together, Canadian couple Tom Hill, 33, and Amy Shostak, 35, decided they both wanted to propose when the time was right. “We liked the idea that you can do things however you want to do them,” says Tom. “Equality has always been a big cornerstone of our relationship, so we were like, ‘Is there a way we can both propose? What does that look like?’”“Ultimately the trickiest part of system we developed is: if one person proposes and the other person still has yet to propose, there’s a period where the proposal isn’t complete but one of you has done a big emotional event,” he says. “So we decided if one of us proposed, we wouldn’t tell anyone else until the second person also proposed, whether that was a day later or six months later.”While Amy admits the first few months of “the period” were “very weird”, with both of them slightly on edge every time they went to a restaurant or hiked a mountain, ultimately the couple proposed about six hours apart in November 2018. Tom took Amy on a short road trip to a lakeside resort town outside their city. When they got to their hotel, Amy napped while Tom iced an elaborate cake as part of an inside-joke she woke up, and he proposed. Later that night, after dinner and dancing, the couple walked to the edge of a pier and Amy decided it was the right time to get down on one knee, too.“He was shocked, because the time in between was so brief,” says Amy.“I had just been so focused on doing my proposal I was not expecting a response proposal,” says Tom. “The thing that seemed like it would prevent a surprise provided it. I very much wept and wept.”Adam Fleishman, 36, and Brenna Holler, 34, from San Diego and Vancouver respectively, also both proposed, though somewhat spontaneously.Earlier this year, after about two years of dating, the couple finished walking their dog and was just settling in for a quiet breakfast at home when, explains Brenna. “We were talking about future plans and Adam got this really silly look on his face and started counting down from three. By the time he got to one and a half I sort of realized what was happening and I, as a competitive person, wanted to propose to him, so when he reached zero we both asked to marry one another.”“I think we were both thinking it, sitting across the table from each other,” says Adam. “As cheesy as it sounds, the looks we were shooting each other said it all anyway, so I just started counting down, ’cause I knew we would both want to do it at the same time.”Because straight engagements and weddings are rooted in longstanding, heteronormative convention, the option of having both partners propose may not even occur to some couples. Yet as more partners choose to both propose, and share their stories within their social circles, mutual proposals may catch on in a bigger way. In the few weeks since Adam and Brenna announced their engagement, they already have heard from friends who found their story inspiring and proposed in a similar way as a result.What mutual proposals reflect more than anything is the fact that today, there are no right or wrong ways for an engagement to happen – and by popping the question twice, couples can double their fun. As Tom says: “Proposing in itself is very nerve-racking, very exciting, wonderful – and also being proposed to is a thrill and amazing. Why not do both?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c25eb5fbe27293ced3141b411bbb6518167ece39/0_11_1453_872/master/1453.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e421232780b56881571b8947967787f","title":"would a society of moral saints be a worse place to live","story":"We shouldn’t make every decision about how to use our time, or spend our money, on ethical grounds aloneIn 2000, in his book Bobos In Paradise, the US commentator David Brooks noticed that the emerging class he called “bourgeois bohemians” had a particular fondness for rough textures: slate kitchen counters, coarse rugs, stone fireplaces, and so on. Where their parents prized smooth surfaces, these countercultural capitalists (and not to be rude, but I suspect the ’s readership contains a few) yearned to go back to the land. Brooks grasped, too, that they saw something moral in their choices. Their rough-hewn chopping boards didn’t merely signify that they led better lives, but that they were better people.This came to mind the other day when I read a new study on the psychological phenomenon of “moral licensing”. It’s been known for a while, now, that we’re prone to using our ethical acts as an excuse for our less ethical acts – so that, for example, the person who religiously eliminates single-use plastic from their life feels entitled to take a couple of extra long-haul flights per year, even though the harm of the latter might outweigh the benefits of the former. But a new German study, by researchers Jannis Engel and Nora Szech, provides an alarming glimpse of just how ready we are to let ourselves off the hook.The experiment involved shopping for towels, and the details are a little complex, but the headline finding is stark: participants who felt they were doing something moral by choosing between “pure organic cotton” towels proved less bothered by whether or not they were produced under ethical working conditions than those choosing between regular towels. Even assuming that organic cotton is greener (and that’s disputed), many who value it surely do so for the rather selfish reason that they believe it’s a higher-quality product. Yet this apparently made them feel so virtuous that it eroded their sense of obligation about the conditions in which it was produced.More and more, I find myself wondering if the ubiquity of findings like this points to something fundamentally wrong with the outlook the philosopher Daniel Kaufman has called “morality everywhere” – the notion that we even ought to be considering our every daily move through an ethical lens in the first place. This “aggressive moral scrutiny directed at the minutiae of everyday life” is suspect on multiple grounds, Kaufman thinks. For one thing, it backfires, triggering resentment against holier-than-thou types, and maybe contributing to events such as Donald Trump’s election. (Which certainly hasn’t been good for the environment.) Another problem is that it assumes morality’s the only virtue worth cultivating – whereas the flourishing of the arts, sport, literature, family life and much else require that we don’t make every decision about how to use our time, or spend our money, on ethical grounds alone. A society comprised exclusively of moral saints would be a worse place to live.I’m not sure I agree – or if I do, that this is any reason not to try to make ethical consumer choices. But I can’t deny there’s something strange about “ethical living” as a moral code, if a) it’s impossible to follow it flawlessly, and b) it wouldn’t lead to the best form of society even if everyone did. Perhaps our world-improving energies would be better directed elsewhere.The philosopher Susan Wolf argues that being as ethical as possible is a bad goal to aim for in her essay Moral Saints."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d244d2269cc981b07f79df23ed0540e9c2fae7e/0_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c60185ae25559c73257eff707c716aad","title":"blind date gustavo bryan","story":"Gustavo, 31, nurse practitioner, meets Bryan, 34, head of salesWhat were you hoping for?At worst, a funny date story and a free dinner.

But who these days has the money for the former, or the time for the latter? Nowadays, the surest signs that you’ve reached maturity are an obsession with property magazines and a fascination with the quality of your sleep. Going by this criteria, I am more middle-aged than the most middle-aged sitcom dad ever (Darrin from Bewitched, who, Google informs me, was played by an actor five years younger than me when the show started. I am totally and definitely fine about this.)I am fascinated with sleep – but nowhere near as fascinated as everyone else, it seems. I can hardly walk down the street without someone telling me about their latest sleep app, or reading an article about “good sleep hygiene”, or hearing how sleep deprivation is the health equivalent of chaining 40 Benson \u0026amp Hedges a day, and of course how tired – so very, very tired – everyone is, because they didn’t get their requisite eight hours last night.How I laugh at this. I throw my head back and laugh the kind of full-throated cackle an evil genius makes right before he presses the red button that blows up the world. I have barely slept more than five hours a night since my daughter was born eight months ago, and there is something genuinely hilarious about this era of sleep obsession when you have a baby who refuses to let you sleep. It’s like living in a busted shack when everyone around you is banging on about the problems with their new basement extension. (I told you I was into property magazines.) “The truth about why you keep waking up at 3am” a doomy headline in this paper read recently. Is it because there’s a screaming baby in the cot next to your bed? “God, I’m so tired,” I used to say when I was young and merrily childfree. Talking about how tired I was back then seemed to be a way of proving how deeply sensitive I was (too fragile to sleep) while simultaneously giving the impression that I led an extremely exciting social life (too fabulous to sleep). But I did genuinely think I was tired, and this is what I want to say to my twentysomething self and any other young person who is about to say how tired they are: you’re not.So no, I don’t want to hear about how tired you are. But if you’re all having such trouble sleeping, how about if you take over the night shift with my baby? I’ll definitely sleep, and you and the baby can rave all night together. David Baddiel has said that the only thing that cured his insomnia was having kids, because they exhausted it out of him. Think of the money you could save on sleep apps, kids!Awake at 4am, I fantasise about a time when my kids are teenagers and sleeping until midday, which means I’ll sleep until midday, too. Or perhaps not: older parents warn me that, while child-induced sleeplessness cures insomnia, it also breaks you, leaving you doomed for ever after to wake at 6am. So maybe we’ve got this parenting thing all wrong: just as twentysomething bodies are supposed to cope best with pregnancy and childbirth, perhaps fifty- and sixtysomething biorhythms work best with a baby’s sleeping patterns. Older friends and relatives could rise at 6am and take the baby out for a nice walk around the park, while we broken thirty- and fortysomethings could be left to get on with other things. Like sleeping. Strangely, none have yet accepted my suggestion, but they’re probably just mulling it over.Last weekend I went away for a friend’s 40th, alone. We had dinner on the first night, and it was lovely, but I was impatient to get back to my hotel room where I knew the fun would really begin. Reader, I slept solidly for 11 hours. When I woke – naturally, as opposed to being woken – I nearly wept with happiness. The second night was a party and, giddy with freedom and an unaccustomed feeling of being well rested, I danced until the sky was light. The next day, I went home, and my husband, who had been looking after all three kids all weekend, asked how I was. I looked him right in the eyes and said, “God, I’m so tired.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3df767c305382ae35c3ac9a3e7f86cfa912c5820/0_0_2117_1271/master/2117.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=437530a5094c173dfedd51f482ca270e","title":"uk travel insurers stopping policy sales over coronavirus","story":"Which? calls for urgent action by government, insurance firms and travel sectorMany of Britain’s biggest insurers are pulling down the shutters to new travel insurance customers, with Aviva, Direct Line and Churchill the latest to stop selling policies as a result of the coronavirus outbreak.Responding to the moves, the consumer body Which? said the government, insurers and the travel sector needed to “urgently” work together to tackle the challenge because “the industry depends on people having the confidence to travel knowing they will be covered”.On Wednesday 11 March, LV became the first big insurer to stop selling travel insurance to new customers. Then on 13 March, Direct Line and Churchill said they had taken a decision to temporarily suspend the sale of travel insurance to new customers “so we can focus on our existing customers”.A couple of hours later, Britain’s biggest insurer, Aviva, said it had “made the difficult decision to withdraw our single-trip and annual multi-trip travel insurance to new customers”. It added: “We envisage that this decision … will be a temporary action. We will continue to monitor the situation closely.”Direct Line and Churchill said they had experienced “a huge increase in demand” for travel insurance, and that their priority was to protect and service their existing customers. “We have not taken this decision lightly and we carefully considered many different options prior to reaching this decision.”The changes are on top of restrictions being added to policies by these and other insurers.The moves by several of the UK’s biggest insurers underline unprecedented turmoil in the industry caused by the spiralling cost of dealing with travel problems caused by the outbreak.Other companies are taking the opportunity to highlight how they are still open for business.

Thank you for making clear the EU will too.”The document appears to signal a weakening in the EU position in only one key area: its demands on fisheries, where the 27 member states had until now been seeking to “uphold” the current common fisheries policy (CFP).The CFP relies on historical catching patterns to determine how much fish each nation can take. The new text acknowledges the UK demand for scientific advice to take precedence and appears to downgrade the commitment to “respecting” the status quo.Elsewhere, however, the draft treaty offers little succour to the British government, which insists that it will not sign up to any arrangements that involve continued direct application of current EU law or oblige parliament to implement new Brussels rules in the future.Despite the British insistence that it will devise its own state aid rules, limiting the level of subsidies from the government for ailing airlines, steel manufacturers and other industrial actors, legal text drafted by Barnier emphasises the need for the UK to apply the EU’s own rule book and “harmonise” with Brussels as policies develop.The document stipulates that where there are disputes on state aid rules, the European court of justice in Luxembourg will be the arbiter of EU law and issue binding rulings to the British courts to implement.Where Brussels devises entirely new rules on state aid, whether to industry or farmers, a new joint committee will have to sit within six weeks and “add the new act or provision” or the EU would be free to implement “sanctions” that “have a real and deterrent effect”.The draft treaty also insists that the UK will have to guarantee “non regression” on EU regulations on labour and social protection despite its withdrawal from the bloc.On environmental standards, the EU insists that targets set by Brussels will also apply to the UK after it leaves the single market and customs union at the end of the year.The regulations referred to in the document include industrial emissions, air quality targets and nature and bioersity conservation.The document also refers to harmonisation on “health and sanitary safety in the agricultural and food sector”, in a sign that the EU will resist changes to UK laws to allow the production of chlorine-washed chicken or hormone-treated beef.The US government is likely to demand access to the British market for such produce, which would undercut UK farmers unless they too could change their practices.The next round of negotiations between the two sides, which started last month, was due to take place next week but face-to-face talks in London have been cancelled in response to the coronavirus pandemic.EU and UK officials were expected to take part in stripped back talks through videoconference calls.

But at least Al Boum Photo and Paul Townend got the reception they deserved, at the end of a compelling and ever-changing race that was in the balance until the final strides.Townend had earned it as much as his partner, having risen to the challenge of filling the riding boots of Ruby Walsh as stable jockey to Al Boum Photo’s trainer, Willie Mullins. Mullins saddled the first four winners here and Townend was aboard three, with the Gold Cup victory ensuring that he took the prize for the meeting’s leading rider for the first time.Al Boum Photo is the first horse to win consecutive runnings of the Gold Cup since Best Mate in 2003, and the win owed much to Townend’s positional sense in a race that was run, for the most part, at a very steady pace. That ensured that the field was still tightly bunched coming down the hill for the final time, but the horses ridden prominently – Al Boum Photo, Lostintranslation and Santini – were best placed to strike for home and all made their move just after the turn for home.Al Boum Photo and Lostintranslation took the final fence as one, with Santini just half a length behind. Lostintranslation was the first to wilt as they battled up the hill, but Santini, making only his sixth start over fences, was closing strongly in the final strides and would have needed only a few more yards of turf to overhaul the favourite.For Mullins, the most successful trainer in Cheltenham Festival history, this was a second successive victory in a race that had famously eluded him, often in the most frustrating of circumstances, until Al Boum Photo’s win 12 months ago. This was just the winner’s second run of the season, as Mullins repeated the schedule that proved successful last year, and he will no doubt follow a similar path next season, reminiscent of the care with which Henrietta Knight steered Best Mate to three Gold Cups.“We just decided not to break a winning formula and it’s paid off,” Mullins said. “I thought this year’s Gold Cup wasn’t anything like last year’s, and that if he had a clear round and a bit of luck, then it was all to play for.“It’s really, really good for Paul, to take over from someone like Ruby Walsh. People said he was under pressure. Paul does his own thing, he probably rides better under a little bit of pressure. Paul has come and stamped his authority on his season in Ireland. It’s a tough act to follow, but he is Paul Townend, stable jockey to Willie Mullins, and he is top class.“We missed a couple of fences but he has a tendency to do that. He started to jump well when we needed to, and that got us into a good position when we got to the top of the hill.“This is the stage, before this I was having a brilliant day but this is the one, the icing on the cake. The Gold Cup is the Gold Cup and I’ll have to wait a year for another one.”Townend was not the only one casting an eye already towards 2021. The crowd at Cheltenham to see the race was 68,859, only a fraction down on the 70,000 capacity that usually makes the pilgrimage to the west country for the final day of the Festival, and tickets will be in very short supply if Al Boum Photo returns next year to attempt to join Best Mate and Arkle as the winner in three consecutive years.Santini, still so lightly raced, is likely to be a stern opponent once again, while Champ, a stable companion at the Nicky Henderson yard, will also be a huge contender judged on his extraordinary win in Wednesday’s RSA Chase.Al Boum Photo, though, is now steeplechasing’s undisputed champion, and is quoted at a top price of 6-1 to make it three in a row. It is a thought to carry into the weeks and months ahead, as racing prepares for a future with no one in the grandstand."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb0666d7d747380218c6da8441eda61959cf290d/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=009c13f3447f876d9c0189d80c493f0b","title":"london marathon postponed to 4 october in response to coronavirus","story":"This year’s London Marathon, which was due to stage a showdown between the two greatest distance runners in history and attract over 43,000 participants raising millions for charity, has been rescheduled to Sunday, 4 October because of the spread of coronavirus.Hugh Brasher, the event’s director, said he was left with little choice but to delay the race, which had been due to take place on 26 April, because of the global pandemic. “The world is in an unprecedented situation grappling with a global pandemic of Covid-19 and public health is everyone’s priority,” he said. We know how disappointing this news will be for so many – the runners who have trained for many months, the thousands of charities for which they are raising funds and the millions who watch the race every year.”The decision follows the postponement of the Boston marathon, another of the six prestigious world marathon majors, earlier on Friday. It is moved from 20 April to 14 September.Last year the London marathon made a world record for a one-day annual fundraising event of £66.4m, while this April’s race was promoted as being a mouthwatering clash between the Kenyan world record holder Eliud Kipchoge and the Ethiopian Kenenisa Bekele, the world 5,000m and 10,000m record holder and second fastest man ever over 26.2 miles. Whether the pair will still face off in London in October appears doubtful – if the Tokyo Olympics goes ahead they are highly unlikely to race two marathons in less than two months.British Athletics, which was planning to use the London marathon as a trial for Olympic places, said it planned to stage a special race in a closed location to select the team. “We can confirm that we are planning to stage a marathon trial specifically for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games,” a British Athletics spokesperson said. “We are looking at 25 to 27 April, and the event would be held in a closed location, with limited numbers.”Meanwhile London marathon organisers have confirmed that every runner with a place in the 2020 race will be able to run in the rescheduled event on 4 October without further payment – or can request a refund if they prefer. Charities and sponsors with runners who cannot take part in the postponed race may substitute other runners for the rescheduled race.“We know there will be many, many questions from runners, charities and others and we ask you to please bear with us as we work through the detailed planning process to deliver the 2020 London Marathon on its new scheduled date,” added Brasher. “We will email all runners and charities today and then update them via email by the end of next week at the latest. We will also post regular updates on our website and social media channels.”Kipchoge wrote: “It is unfortunate news that the London marathon has been postponed but I fully respect the decision made by the organization as safeguarding the health of the world always takes our top priority.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/748d32d8b4ad511d58a090ecf6edcf6130ea98db/74_349_4701_2820/master/4701.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7d995db688a06159b8c8b830dcd1993","title":"rfl super league fixtures leeds pull out catalans coronovirus","story":"Super League is considering approaching Sky Sports with a proposal to show all its games live after cancellations because of coronavirus created gaps in the broadcaster’s schedules.Rugby league is continuing to operate a business-as-usual approach for as long as possible, with Super League and Challenge Cup fifth‑round fixtures set to go ahead, with spectators, this weekend. The Rugby Football League insists it will adhere to government guidance on the spread of Covid-19 – which could mean a total shutdown next weekend after Downing Street signalled it was preparing to stop large public events, including sports fixtures, to alleviate the pressure on police and the ambulance service. But, for now, it is one of a handful of sports that has not yet gone against that advice and announced changes to its schedule because of the outbreak.Sky will show Castleford’s game with St Helens on Sunday as an additional extra for rugby league supporters, with the broadcaster keen to have some live sport this weekend. However, the  has learned that one club – understood to be the Tigers – suggested to Super League that they go one step further. They have floated the idea of proposing to Sky that all six games each weekend could be broadcast live: one on Thursday evening, another on Friday and two each on Saturday and Sunday afternoons. That proposal, however, is reliant on Super League either continuing as it is – a prospect that seems highly unlikely given the spread of the virus – or playing games behind closed doors, something that could happen next weekend.One source said there was even talk of asking Sky Sports to pay to televise all the games, which would offset the costs inherited by clubs should they stage regular-season league fixtures behind closed doors. The prospect of that happening was described as “particularly far-fetched” – but Super League is keen to strengthen its relationship with Sky by offering to plug holes in their schedule.The RFL sent an email to clubs on Friday saying it would not consider cancelling games or even moving them behind closed doors as long as no player tests positive for the virus, even though one Leeds Rhinos player is self-isolating after displaying possible symptoms. That led the Rhinos to declare they would not travel to Perpignan on Friday morning to fulfil their Super League fixture against Catalans Dragons on Saturday.“We have been in continual dialogue with Department for Digital, Culture, Media \u0026amp Sport on this matter, including again this morning and on the basis of there being no confirmed cases reported to us by our clubs, fixtures remain in place for the coming weekend,” the email said. “At all times the RFL has followed and is following the Government’s guidance as requested. We will, of course, monitor the position carefully for any changes.”The cancellation of Leeds’s trip to Catalans has incensed the Dragons, particularly their owner, Bernard Guasch. He estimates it could cost Catalans £300,000 if their next home game, against Toronto on 11 April, is also called off. He said: “It’s a real disaster. The Leeds game has cost a fortune and we are expecting to have to refund people for tickets to the next home game against Toronto.“We live day-to-day and every day we get a little closer to the end of the month and we have to settle with players, staff and other costs. It is a very uncomfortable position.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51d0d94a0756de8ecdd1b9e43ac3b885c34cfb69/0_347_4634_2781/master/4634.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1b73ae31c1e53015c8badc98635bbce","title":"wales v scotland six nations match called off coronavirus rugby union","story":"The Welsh Rugby Union called off Saturday’s Six Nations match against Scotland 24 hours before the kick-off to fall in line with other sports in the country which had cancelled events because of coronavirus.The WRU issued a statement on Friday morning saying that, after taking medical advice, the match would go ahead. Almost immediately the Premier League and the Football League announced they were suspending fixtures until 3 April, along with the women’s Super League and Championship, England’s Test series in Sri Lanka was called off and in golf the Masters was postponed.The Welsh government said on Thursday, after taking part in the Cobra meeting to discuss what action to take to contain the virus, that there was no medical reason to call off the match between Wales and Scotland. The following morning the WRU said the game would go ahead as planned.“Throughout, the WRU board have followed the scientific advice of government, Public Health Wales and medical experts,” it said in a statement, “and determined that the game would be held or postponed based on that advice.”Less than five hours later a new statement was issued saying the match had been postponed. The reason for the about-turn was that, while the medical advice remained the same, “we have decided that it is in the best interest of supporters, players and staff to fall into line with recent measures taken across the UK and global sports industries.”The WRU found itself in self-isolation and, ultimately, it acted on the prompting of the Welsh government, which had come under criticism on social media for sanctioning a game that would attract some 75,000 spectators and generate packed trains into Cardiff and crowded bars in the city as well as the queues to get into the ground.“Every effort has been made to stage this game and we appreciate that iniduals will have been inconvenienced,” said the WRU. “Given the fluid and unprecedented nature of this issue, a postponement became the only viable option. We took advice from other stakeholders, including the Six Nations, on this fast-moving issue.” The Under-20s match between Wales and Scotland was played in Colwyn Bay on Friday night behind closed doors.The postponement meant none of the final round’s matches would take place, with England’s trip to Rome called off last week and the Paris showdown between France and Ireland following at the start of this week. No alternative dates have been agreed with October looking the most likely month: Ireland’s home match with Italy also has to be rearranged.Like Italy, Wales and Scotland will be looking for agreement with Premiership clubs over the release of players. October is not a month that falls within the international window, meaning clubs are not obliged to make their players available. That would cost Wales Nick Tompkins, Dan Biggar, WillGriff John and Taulupe Faletau while Scotland would be without their captain, Stuart Hogg, who sent a Twitter message to Scotland supporters after the postponement saying “thank you very much and take care,” Chris Harris, Sam Skinner, Allan Dell and Duncan Weir.The French Rugby Federation has put the Top 14 on hold, along with the second-tier Pro D2, because of the pandemic while all rugby in Scotland will be suspended for two weeks from Sunday but has since . “Health is the absolute priority,” said Paul Goze, president of the Ligue National de Rugby. “It is essential to stay together in this period of national solidarity.”The Scottish Rugby Union said: “We have taken on board all expert medical advice before now and we are taking a precautionary approach to give time to assess what the impact of coronavirus will be on Scottish society in the coming weeks before deciding on the next steps.”The Premiership Cup final between Sale and Harlequins was set to go ahead at the AJ Bell Stadium tomorrow but has since been postponed. The game was called off yesterday evening after one of Quins’ support staff showed “flu-like symptoms” and subsequently went into isolation. “We’re incredibly sorry to all the people who will be disappointed,” a Premiership Rugby statement said. “However, the welfare of fans, players and staff remains our first concern.”Saturday’s Championship match between Nottingham and Jersey Reds was called off after two of the visiting players went into self-isolation and World Rugby postponed its women’s rugby sevens series tournament due to be held in South Africa for two days from 28 March.On Thursday the Guinness Pro14, which involves teams from five countries, was suspended indefinitely because of the pandemic which has prompted widespread travel restrictions in Italy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f51c2d2645c1cf7361149af1940fe1cda58a8426/0_162_5105_3064/master/5105.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a866ef1c84e243cb9ce111237bfae1c8","title":"cheltenham festival 2020 in pictures","story":"Our photographer Tom Jenkins captures the winners, the losers, the punters and all the thrills and spills at this year’s Cheltenham Festival"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eef81e670ca3f51b686a70102c21eb602d0347bb/0_115_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b35ae005aeaa171f6489062741c95923","title":"facebook uncovers russian led troll network based in west africa","story":"Fake Facebook, Instagram and Twitter accounts seemed to aim to inflame ides in USA newly discovered Russian-led network of professional trolls was being outsourced to Ghanaian and Nigerian operatives, according to Facebook and Twitter, who removed the network’s accounts on Thursday.The network was small: just 49 Facebook accounts, 85 Instagram accounts and 71 Twitter accounts in question. But it marks the first time that a Russian information operation targeting the US has been found to be run from Africa.Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook’s head of security policy, said the company believes it was such a small network because it was disrupted in the early stages of building its audience. It was, Gleicher said, “operated by local nationals – some wittingly and some unwittingly – in Ghana and Nigeria on behalf of iniduals in Russia.“The people behind this network engaged in a number of deceptive tactics, including the use of fake accounts … to manage pages posing as non-government organisations or personal blogs, and post in groups,” Gleicher added.“They frequently posted about US news and attempted to grow their audience by focusing on topics like black history, black excellence and fashion, celebrity gossip, news and events related to famous Americans like historical figures and celebrities, and LGBTQ issues. They also shared content about oppression and injustice, including police brutality.”Although the Facebook network posted a significant amount of content, it steered clear of explicitly political postings. Instead, the desire seems to have been to post content that would grow the audience, while also inflaming contemporary American ides.“Although the people behind this activity attempted to conceal their purpose and coordination, our investigation found links to EBLA, an NGO in Ghana, and iniduals associated with past activity by the Russian Internet Research Agency (IRA),” Gleicher said.The Twitter accounts shared many similar traits. But an archive of the messages posted by the fake accounts, shared by Twitter, offers extra insight into how Russian information actors are exploiting the coronavirus pandemic for their own ends.Hundreds of messages in the archive, which covers late January and early February, mention the pandemic, mostly in replies to influential accounts and iniduals.One, bizarrely, warns British reality TV star and 1980s computer magnate Alan Sugar to “be careful” of the coronavirus. Another shares the news that “health officials fear that misinformation about the virus could spark a run on medications”. But most of the tweets simply reflect an urge to jump on popular topics to gain more followers, a reflection of how early the network was discovered.“These 71 removed accounts, operating out of Ghana and Nigeria and which we can reliably associate with Russia, attempted to sow discord by engaging in conversations about social issues, like race and civil rights,” said Twitter’s safety team in a statement.During the cold war, the KGB sought to exploit smouldering racial isions in the US with a series of “active measures”. According to Oleg Kalugin, Moscow’s former spy chief in America, the KGB carried out a series of dirty tricks.These included writing anonymous racist hate letters to African diplomats in New York, purporting to come from American white supremacists. Kalugin and his fellow KGB officers, posing as journalists, published these letters, quoting them as examples of rampant American racism.Kalugin said he “lost no sleep” over such tactics, “figuring they were just another weapon in the cold war”. The KGB also planted stories in US publications saying Washington sided with the racist regime in South Africa, he said.The Soviet Union may be long gone but Moscow’s strategic thinking remains largely unchanged. There is compelling evidence that the Kremlin has sought to reboot KGB methods of propaganda and disinformation via anonymous posts on social media.According to the US special counsel Robert Mueller, in 2016 trolls working out of the notorious factory in St Petersburg made contact with a number of American black activists.The Russians posed as a grassroots group, Black Matters US. In February 2017, a Russian troll using the persona Black Fist even hired a self-defence instructor in New York to give classes to black Americans, Mueller reported.Leaked documents reported on by the  last year showed that Russia was engaged in a renewed push for influence in Africa."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a99f6b74d2bf40ba13ae5290971f818444d0d6c2/0_416_5013_3008/master/5013.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d77adfe6c93ed8f9896d5fd44ce1bf2c","title":"readers tips sawdays spring favourite places uk","story":"Grand houses and gardens, woods, villages, parks and gardens, museums and galleries … share your favourite springtime UK outingIt could be a National Trust property or an area of protected countryside vibrant with wildflowers and birdsong, a village that comes to life in spring, a gallery or museum opening up after the winter.

That sets up an ongoing bruising battle between the two candidates for the immediate future even as the vast majority of observers believe Sanders will eventually have to grit his teeth and fall in line behind Biden.No major 2020 Democratic candidate, current or former, has told supporters not to back the eventual Democratic nominee. Likewise, no serious Democratic surrogate has urged supporters to sit out if their candidate doesn’t win. It is a precedent made even more urgent given Democrats’ anger at Trump and fears over him winning a second term.But the fierce fight between the progressive and centrist wings of the party has had an impact as the party begins to look ahead to the November battle.Saikat Chakrabarti, the former chief of staff to the New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the president of the New Consensus network, said the worry is not getting progressives to vote for a nominee they may not have backed in the primary. Chakrabarti said it was rallying voters who stayed out of the general election in 2016.“The thing I’m worried about is if Joe Biden wins the nomination, what will he do to get actual voters,” said Chakrabarti, “the kinds of folks who stayed home in 2016, and I mean disaffected African American voters, working class voters, people who are really having a tough time with the current economy.”As the primary has shifted essentially to a two-man race, the rivalry between Biden and Sanders and their respective supporters has intensified. Interviews with over more than a dozen Democratic strategists and officials yields a sense of confidence that all the participants in the primary will shift their focus to defeating Donald trump in the general election.But these Democrats also caution that to erase hard feelings left over from the primary, the Democratic nominee will have to extend some kind of olive branch to the runner up and his supporters.Biden will have to work hard to win over disappointed grassroots progressives if he wins as expected. In the now highly unlikely event Sanders wins, he will have to ease concerns from wary Democratic moderates.“I think there has to be a set of actions,” said Steve Grossman, a former Democratic National Committee chairman. “I think there has to be a consistent expression of respect for the progressive wing of the Democratic party that is palpable and meaningful and smart and savvy and thoughtful.”In recent days Biden and his top aides have said urged Sanders supporters to come support their campaign. Similarly on Thursday, Jeff Weaver, a senior Sanders adviser, said the Vermont senator would support Biden if the former vice-president got the nomination. Weaver said Sanders would “absolutely” bring his supporters into the fold even if he didn’t get the nomination.“If Joe Biden is the nominee Bernie Sanders will support him wholeheartedly, we’ll campaign for him,” Weaver said.During Biden’s election night speech on Tuesday he thanked Sanders and his supporters “for their tireless energy and their passion”.“We share a common goal and together we’ll defeat Donald Trump,” Biden said. “We’ll defeat him together. We’re going to bring this nation together.”But for now, with the contest still live and heading for a debate in Arizona on Sunday, Sanders and his supporters are showing no sign of falling in line behind Biden. Progressive Sanders supporters still see a narrow path to the nomination , even as Biden’s delegate lead becomes insurmountable. For them, simply defeating Trump isn’t enough.Jennifer Epps-Addison, network president of the Center for Popular Democracy, which endorsed Sanders, said Democrats cannot rely on antipathy to Trump to turnout young people and progressive activists inspired by Sanders campaign in November.“If they want our time, our energy and our organizing efforts, then they’re going to have to agree to actually include us in the leadership and the governance of the party,” said Epps-Addison.She added that if Biden is the nominee it will matter who he chooses to be his running mate, warning against anyone with a problematic record on criminal justice.“We are very concerned that Donald Trump right now is poised to run to the left of Joe Biden on criminal justice reform,” Epps-Addison said. “It is a terrifying prospect for those of us who are knocking doors in black and brown communities that have been terrorized by the crime bill that Joe Biden was the architect of.”In a scenario where Biden wins the nomination, he will have to consider embracing some of the issues Sanders campaigned on, said Jared Leopold, a veteran Democratic operative.“I think a lot of it is going to be about leaning into the issues that they care about,” Leopold said. “That doesn’t mean that Joe Biden needs to fundamentally change who he is, but I think talking about issues that young people care about and progressives care about will be important to mobilizing those voters in the fall.”Mark Longabaugh, a senior adviser to Sanders’ 2016 campaign, said that “any kind of marriage is a two way street”.“Biden, if he is the nominee, would be wise to reach out and make an effort to make Sanders and his supporters feel welcome in a Biden coalition,” Longabaugh said.And right now, Sanders has a better chance of exerting influence over the main committees at the Democratic national convention in July than winning the nomination.“The more delegates you have clearly the more leverage you have,” Longabaugh said. “And he has plenty of delegates.”He added: “And my own view is that if Bernie Sanders does not have a good night next Tuesday, he needs to seriously think about getting out and rallying around the Joe Biden candidacy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/559c4e2fefa1438f4f034fb20ea2e312c4d5c14e/0_61_1666_1000/master/1666.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5dd1544140e5ff3512ed75e4205e66c2","title":"tell us your experiences testing for the coronavirus","story":"If you work for Public Health England (PHE) or NHS 111 we want to hear from youTo ease the strain on Public Health England, NHS hospital laboratories will test swab samples from people who display symptoms of coronavirus﻿.We want to hear from people working for PHE and NHS 111 about their experiences of testing people for coronavirus.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals.The virus can cause pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.In the UK, the medical advice is that if you have recently travelled from areas affected by coronavirus, you should:More NHS advice on what to do if you think you have been exposed to the virus can be found here, and the full travel advice to UK nationals is available here.China’s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January, and there have been such transmissions elsewhere.As of 13 March, more than 128,000 people have been infected in more than 80 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.There have over 4,700 deaths globally. Just over 3,000 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China. More than 69,000 people have recovered from the coronavirus.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/322aaf0f933ebdd61d88a1fd3eedee04002d0224/0_116_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=891ea9fe3f9960f69d3df2632c170adc","title":"justin trudeau coronavirus response canada measures","story":"Canada has unveiled aggressive new measures to contain the coronavirus outbreak, shutting down parliament and advising against foreign travel, even as Justin Trudeau urged citizens to remain calm in a national address delivered from self-imposed quarantine.“We have an outstanding, we have outstanding public health authorities who are doing an outstanding job. We will get through this together,” said the prime minister, who has been in self-isolation after his wife, Sophie Grégoire Trudeau tested positive for Covid-19 on Thursday.Officials announced a raft of new measures including closing parliament for five weeks and redirecting incoming international flights to a small number of airports as part of enhanced screening measures. The government also announced it will ban cruise ships with 500 people from docking in the country’s ports until 1 July – but stopped short of closing the borders.“Borders don’t stop travellers. Travellers find other ways into countries. Travellers become less honest,” said Patty Hajdu, the county’s health minister. “Canada’s approach from the very beginning has been to use science and evidence.”Instead, the government has asked Canadians to avoid non-essential travel outside the country and to limit contact with crowds.“Social distancing is an important contribution that everyone can make to our control efforts,” said Theresa Tam, the country’s chief public health officer. “This means avoiding crowded places and non-essential gatherings, considering shopping or taking public transport in off-peak hours and greeting one another with a wave or elbow instead of a handshake, kiss or hug.”So far, Canada has conducted more than 15,000 tests and has 157 confirmed cases of the virus, most of which have been found in the provinces of Ontario and British Columbia, she said.Despite the relatively low number of cases, the federal government and provinces have acted swiftly in recent days.British Columbia, Alberta and Quebec have all banned events larger than 250 people. Ontario, the country’s most populous province, will close schools for two additional weeks following spring break, as will Quebec.Late on Friday, officials in Toronto, the country’s largest city, announced the closure of all child care facilities, public libraries and community centres. They also announced the surprise cancellation of all spring break camps and urged residents to reconsider taking public transit.“The actions you take today will save lives,” Hajdu said. “This is a serious public health threat, and a crisis as well as an emergency.”Experts cautioned that no clear blueprints yet exist on now to stem the spread of the virus — but said that certain measures have shown degrees of success.“There’s no complete science behind any of it really — but it’s worthwhile to explore different ways of trying to control things,” said infectious disease specialist Dr. Susy Hota, medical director of prevention and control at Toronto’s university health network. “That’s where the social distancing makes sense to consider doing it early and trying to reduce the overall impact on everybody.”As the country prepares for an economic slowdown, driven by both the coronavirus and a plunge in oil prices, Trudeau said his government plans to green-light a wide-scale economic stimulus plan in the coming days.“We are in the enviable position of having significant fiscal firepower available,” he said.“We need to design policies that will really help liquidity and cashflow for businesses that are uniquely affected right now,” he said on Thursday.The prime minister has not yet put a figure on the stimulus plan, but said the action will target Canadians who are most vulnerable to a downturn.“No one should have to worry about paying rent, buying groceries, or additional childcare because of Covid-19. We will help Canadians financially.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de893478f19ac82d255acdfdca810987dbeeb103/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=124ba5032e5d54eccffcc6834ea26236","title":"local london mayoral elections postponed year coronavirus uk","story":"Elections delayed after officials said coronavirus crisis would affect campaigning and votingLocal elections and the London mayoral election have been postponed for a year to deal with the coronavirus outbreak. The government made the decision to push back the 7 May elections after the Electoral Commission said the health crisis would have an impact on campaigning and voting.“We will bring forward legislation to postpone local, mayoral and police and crime commissioner elections until May next year,” a government spokesman said.England was scheduled to hold 309 local elections and 40 elections for police and crime commissioners. Four of those PCC positions also have responsibility for their local fire services.The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, who was due to run for his second four-year term, said: “I will continue to work with the government and experts to help London manage coronavirus over the weeks and months ahead. I will always do everything in my power to stand up for London.”Challengers for the London race include Shaun Bailey for the Tories, the Liberal Democrat Siobhan Benita, the Green candidate, Siân Berry, and the former Tory cabinet minister Rory Stewart, who had all ramped up their campaigns in recent weeks. The Electoral Commission said: “Clearly, any decisions to delay elections which are due is significant and would not normally be desirable.

If we can’t guarantee that elections can be delivered securely, safely and accurately, it’s better to postpone, and decisive action was needed earlier rather than later.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94f7071ecdbc95fcbd748a434232df4a0f7dbe5b/297_0_3598_2160/master/3598.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=968e0740208be810bb9b9e87f2591c98","title":"move to soften drink driving laws in canadas alberta province prompts debate","story":"Alberta officials suggest major changes, saying the current system punishes people but they ‘continue to drive impaired’A proposal to change to drunk driving laws in a Canadian province has reignited a fierce debate over the best way to prevent alcohol-related deaths on the country’s roads.Officials in Alberta suggested that major changes are coming to the province’s laws on the issue and have even raised the possibility of the decriminalisation of drunk driving.“It’s obvious the criminal justice system punishes people, but it doesn’t stop people from reoffending and people continuing to drive impaired,” said Andrew Murie, CEO of Mothers Against Drunk Driving Canada, which has strongly supported decriminalisation across Canada and is now lobbying for Alberta to enact similar policies.“Our organisation is all about stopping deaths, not punishing people.”Drivers whose blood alcohol concentration exceeds the legal limit currently face a number of penalties in Alberta, including fines, jail time and vehicle seizure – most of which lead to a criminal record.But neighbouring British Columbia piloted a new approach nearly a decade ago, giving police officers discretion to impound vehicles and revoke licenses – but without necessarily pursuing criminal charges. Stiff criminal penalties still exist for serious cases.“It’s a combination of rehabilitation and punishment the criminal justice system is basically a punishment,” said Murie.Manitoba unveiled a similar program in 2018, arguing that the new approach deters one-time offenders from returning to the criminal justice system and is more efficient. Murie said administrative fines are processed within an hour – rather than the four hours needed for a criminal charge.“That’s an incredible accomplishment that hasn’t been accomplished anywhere else in the world,” he said. “We have way more people alive today than if BC hadn’t changed their system.”Kyla Lee, a Vancouver-based lawyer specialising in drunk driving cases, disagrees that decriminalisation in British Columbia has brought about such radical change.She said that the administrative tools are financially devastating to lower-income residents who often can’t afford the fines levied against them.Alberta has not yet announced what changes to the law might look like, other than it is “considering all options”.Lee agreed that an approach which forces drivers to address the “underlying issues” rather than forcing them into the criminal system provides better end results.“If you can keep a person alive, working and contributing to society and address whatever it is that got them in that position, that’s going to be much better for preventing these types of incidents from happening in the future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/137efcc867cccbca2da827e7fef8919b589ccc42/0_98_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=141f2ce0964569f885bbaa5bc894eb00","title":"palermo pins hopes patron saint rosalia rid italy coronavirus","story":"Residents of Sicilian capital pray for another miracle from Saint Rosalia, who they say rescued the city from a deadly plague in 1625Legend has it that in 1625, as a plague swept Palermo and killed dozens of people each day, Saint Rosalia appeared before a man.Rosalia, a young Sicilian hermit who died 500 years earlier, told him that if the people of Palermo walked in procession while carrying her relics, to be found in a grotto on Monte Pellegrino, then the “evil fever” would disappear.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided it is used correctly.After months of debate over the authenticity of that apparition, Saint Rosalia’s remains – among them a piece of her jaw and three fingers – were paraded through the city at an event attended by thousands of devotees. When the plague began to ebb, she was proclaimed the holy protector of the city.Four hundred years later, the prayers that Palermitans offer to Saint Rosalia travel in chain messages on WhatsApp. They are asking her for another miracle: free the city of coronavirus, which has killed more than 1,000 people in Italy.The country has been under a government-imposed lockdown to contain the outbreak. Since then, the streets of Palermo have been desertedt. It is a surreal scene in one of the noisiest cities in southern Italy.So far, the virus has infected about 111 people in Sicily, a relatively small number compared with the rest of the country, but enough to scare people.Sicilians are well aware of Lombardy’s wealth, where the outbreak has killed 500 people. If Covid-19 spreads with the same intensity in a disadvantaged region such as Sicily, the consequences for the population could be catastrophic.The last emergency in Palermo was in 1992, when the city was invaded by thousands of soldiers. The enemy then, the mafia, had claimed more victims than coronavirus.The bosses of Cosa Nostra waged war on the state, killing police officers, judges and journalists. In response, the government dispatched 5,000 military personnel to contain what, by that point, had become an all-out offensive against the Italian state.“I’ll never forget those days,” says Leoluca Orlando. “But it was also the beginning of a revolution that brought this city to raise its head against the mafia. It took years before we managed to weaken the power of Cosa Nostra in our city.“We didn’t resolve the mafia scourge in four days, just as we won’t overcome coronavirus in a week. Winning battles requires patience and determination.”Shortly after the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, announced a nationwide lockdown, hundreds of Palermo’s citizens besieged the few supermarkets that were open late to stock up on food and water.“I’ve been at home in voluntary isolation for days. From here, thanks to smart working, we hold the city council meetings online to cope with the emergency. In 24 hours we translated into 18 languages the new guidelines to avoid transmission of the virus.”Last year, Orlando defied the far-right former interior minister Matteo Salvini, who closed all the ports to rescue boats trying to save migrants.“I recently read a poem on coronavirus. It said that if we all make it through, at the end of this tragedy we’ll be better people. At this time, the world views Italians as plague-stricken. I hope someone has learned a lesson. I hope people realise what it means to be discriminated against. I hope they understand how it feels to have the doors slammed, just as we did with migrants.”Experts predict the economic impact of coronavirus in Sicily could be devastating. In a region where the strongest sector of the economy is tourism, the fear that people will not visit this summer is taking hold.“The price we’ll pay for this epidemic will be high,” says Milani, an LGBT activist and coordinator of the Palermo Pride festival. Enjoying the sun in her chair outside her famous leather-goods shop in Palermo, she takes in the eerie silence on streets normally teeming with tourists and shoppers. Even before Conte ordered retailers to close, few shopkeepers in Palermo were opening their doors for business.“What worries me most isn’t the economy but the human cost. This epidemic will have a lasting effect on interpersonal relations, which were already compromised before coronavirus. Before the outbreak, people spent less time together. Now we keep a distance from each other for health reasons. When will it end?“This situation will leave a mark on everyone’s soul. I’m thinking about those neighbourhoods in Palermo that thrive on human relations. Of course, we must be vigilant because some people will try to get rich from the emergency as well.”In the historic open-air market of Ballarò, the most noisy and colourful neighbourhood in Palermo, a man has already taken advantage of the lack of masks in the city. While pharmacists display signs telling customers that masks have run out, he has set up a stall in the market selling packages containing 14 masks for €5. Despite the fact they resemble dust-cloths, judging by the number of traders wearing them, business is going well.“Unemployment is widespread here in Ballarò and people make do as best they can,” says Francesco, known in the area as Terza Putia (Third Shop) – the number of his fish stand.Last Wednesday night, Ballarò market was cleared, after the government ordered the closure of all shops, including market stalls. Before that traders wore masks and gloves though the streets were empty of customers.“It is a very serious problem for us,” he says. “Here, we mainly sell fish and fruit. Our economy is based on the daily struggle to sell our products. For those who sell fresh fish, even a day without customers is a huge loss. In Ballarò, if coronavirus doesn’t kill us, hunger will.”Bars, pizzerias, restaurants: everything is closed in the city. The tables placed outside, on the streets of Palermo, are empty. The only business allowed is home delivery. At Pizzera la Brace, at the gates of the old Borgo Vecchio district, Samuele Agnetta, a 27-year-old pizza maker, is working tirelessly, all day, in front of a red-hot wood-burning oven.The Confturismo-Confcommercio tourism confederation estimates a loss of €5bn-€7bn if the crisis continues until May, with an estimated 22 million fewer visitors in the next three months. “There was a queue here every night,” he says. “Before coronavirus, it was difficult to find a table. Look now – empty. Usually we have three chefs here. Today, I am alone, and 25 of the waiters and cashiers have stayed at home. There is no point making calculations because the economic damage will be incalculable.”On top of Monte Pellegrino, overlooking the sea and the entire city, is the Sanctuary of Santa Rosalia, built in 1629, in the place where the saint’s bones were found. Inside the cave, there is a gilded statue of her contained in ornate urns and surrounded by relics.Tourists are few in these parts, especially in this period, but those who stop by leave a message in the visitors’ book at the entrance. “Santa Rosalia, save us from the coronavirus,” reads one of the most recent ones.“From the beginning of the outbreak, two out of three messages written in the visitors book are on the coronavirus,” Gaetano Ceravolo, the parish priest, says. “Palermitans are very devoted to the saint. Especially at times like this.“It is not the first time a virus has claimed victims in the city. Here, in 1600, there were between 50 and 100 deaths per day. It was a massacre. Even then, there was a quarantine. Those who did not respect the ban, forcing them to stay at home, were hanged.”Now, by order of the religious authorities, all masses, funerals and marriages are banned to try to limit the spread of coronavirus. To encourage his faithful to remain indoors, Gaetano live-streamed Pope Francis’s Angelus prayer service on the sanctuary’s website. “It is not going to mass that makes us Christian. This virus is likely to drive us away from each other. Instead we must look for the good, even in such dramatic situations.“If we cannot embrace or exchange a handshake, then we take the opportunity to smile at each other, to exchange words of affection or simply to look at each other. We need to make the best of this crisis. It is the only way to survive.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1992848ce749d95c46c1e4481884135f2a286d8/0_356_3088_1854/master/3088.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6cc4d1d83021eca55d5b7d56faf1a45","title":"really fed up britons life coronavirus hotspots china italy","story":"UK citizens in China, South Korea, Japan and Italy detail their experiences as outbreak continuesWhile the spread of coronavirus in the UK is in its early stages, Britons around the world have been living with the impact of the virus for some time.In Hangzhou in China, just a few hundred miles from Wuhan, the city where the outbreak started life has slowly been returning to normal for Gav Munro, an artist, and his wife, Juliet, after being isolated at home for five weeks.“We were under self-quarantine at the end of January but by February it had become mandatory and we were restricted to one person per household being allowed out every four days,” said the 47-year-old. “On the first night of quarantine, I went for a ride on an electric bike and it was so quiet. That was when I knew it was serious.”China has been dealing with the crisis since the beginning of the year. A month ago, the worst affected area, Hubei province, was reporting several thousand new cases a day. On Wednesday there were only eight new infections, the first time the province has recorded a daily tally in single-digits.“During our time in quarantine I went for walks in the communal garden in the apartment complex,” said Munro, who has lived in China for 13 years. “I didn’t feel like there was an environment of fear as people weren’t really panicking. You’d go to the shops and people would help each other out.”On 14 February the couple were given a “free pass” to leave whenever they wanted. When outside, Munro has been using an app called Alipay Health Code to make sure he does not walk into areas where there may be confirmed cases.The app, which has been criticised for appearing to share private information with the police, gives users a red, yellow or green QR code depending on the status of their health. Munro has found it helpful. “It’s amazing,” he said. “A green code, which I have, means I can go about as normal. A yellow code means someone may be quarantined for seven days, and a red code means 14 days. You have to show the code in every store you go to, but it reassures me that I’m in a safe area.“The city is slowly getting back to normal and everyone I know is desperate to get back to work.”The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided it is used correctly.Despite spending more than a month indoors, John Williamson and his wife, Vivi, were in self-quarantine for the second time in Liuzhou in southern China, where there have been a few hundred cases in the province. “We stayed with Vivi’s parents in Nanning over 100 miles away after the Chinese new year holiday and didn’t leave for more than 30 days,” he said. “It wasn’t mandatory but travel wasn’t recommended at the time. When we arrived back home we decided to self-quarantine again just in case.”John, 59, and Vivi, 40, finished their second self-quarantine on Thursday. “We probably won’t go anywhere beyond the local supermarket and if we do go out, we of course will be wearing masks.”John, who teaches English at Guangxi University of Science and Technology, said things had been very different since the virus hit. “Before there were no barriers anywhere,” he said. “Now there are metal fences all over and access to our building is restricted to only one entrance.“At first I thought the measures were overkill but I think we have the problem relatively under control now. It’s not that bad but it feels like I haven’t been out for so long. At least when we wanted something we could have it delivered. You could even get coffee from Starbucks.”In South Korea, which is now the fourth-most-affected country after China with 7,869 cases, there’s hope that the country is approaching a turning point.In North Gyeongsang province, near the centre of the country’s outbreak in Daegu, Amanda*, 25, an English teacher, said many events in April had been cancelled. “There are signs everywhere reminding us to wear masks, wash our hands and use sanitisers,” she said. “There are even some places, like pharmacies, where you cannot enter without wearing a mask. Buying them is also limited to two per person to ensure there’s enough for everyone.”Amanda stays across new developments through government alerts on her phone. “They update me on the number of confirmed cases, which regions they’re in, which hospitals patients are in as well as hygiene prevention measures we should follow,” she said. “They also tell us the public transport routes patients have taken so we know which ones to avoid. I personally feel the authorities are really taking this seriously.“Schools are closed and the return date has been consistently pushed back – it was 2 March and now it’s the 23rd. I think it will get a bit better but we’re not out of the woods yet.”One hundred miles north in Seongnam, despite some businesses closing early in the evening, Emily Barton, 28, and her husband said they felt relatively safe.“Over two weeks ago it was much busier outside but people are more wary now of giving each other space,” said Barton, who works as a teacher at an international school. “We’ve been avoiding public transport and large gatherings but everyone is being so careful.“A drive-through testing facility has been set up to make it easier for people to remain isolated. You drive up, they test you, you get given some snacks and wait in your car for the results. It’s very efficient.”“As a married couple in our late 20s it’s difficult not having much to do. It’s not just boredom, but worry and monotony. I’m concerned about how long schools will be closed for,” she said. “I work at a small private school and with parents not paying fees because students are not attending, there’s a risk of it having a knock-on effect on teachers’ wages.”Steve Good, across the Sea of Japan in Kushiro, Hokkaido, wants his two children to go back to school, after they closed at the end of February. “We can’t work as much as we want,” said the 51-year-old teacher, who has lived in the country for more than 20 years. “Their books are still at school so we don’t really know what to do, but we don’t want to waste the time we have.”After a state of emergency was declared in the prefecture at the end of February, residents were asked to remain at home for a few days. “Unlike lockdowns in other countries we were asked nicely not to go out, rather than told not to. This might be because people in Hokkaido are used to crises like earthquakes and tsunamis. There’s no panic, just a strange energy – it’s weird,” he said.“Toilet paper and rice are the main things you can’t seem to buy. We’ve been in self-quarantine for nearly two weeks but there’s only so much you can do. I think it will all blow over in a couple of weeks but we’ve already got cabin fever.”Japan has closed schools until April. The country had one of the largest outbreaks outside China in February, when the Diamond Princess cruise ship was docked in Yokohama. At the end of February more than 600 passengers tested positive. It has now dropped in the table of global infections to 15th place with 639 cases.As Covid-19 spreads in Europe, Italy has become the deadliest site for the virus outside China with over 1,000 deaths and more than 15,000 infected. The entire country is on lockdown – all shops, bars and restaurants are closed, and schools and universities are not due to open again until April.Lauren Doling, 49, who works as a teacher and lives in Rosate, one hour from the centre of the outbreak in Codogno, said she felt isolated now that she could not leave Lombardy. “I can’t use the  to move around any more so I’m at home a lot more now, when I would have been out for up to 13 hours a day,” she said. “There’s quite a bit of paranoia going around and it’s quite eerie.“Bars were open in the evening last week, where you would wait for someone to come and serve you at a table, but now everything’s closed,” said Doling ,who has lived in Italy for 19 years. “There are empty shelves in the supermarket. I’m vegan so it doesn’t really affect me, but there’s no meat and milk.”Doling has prepared online lessons for her students. “We’re teaching them using a new platform which has been an interesting challenge. I’m feeling frustrated our regular lives have had to be put on hold for the time being, though. It’s as if everything is on standby.”Near Dolo in the Venice province, Jodie, 42, has been trying to keep her eight-year-old son occupied during their third week indoors. “We’re just at home doing nothing,” she said. “We have YouTube and Fortnite, but he probably shouldn’t be playing that.”“Three weeks ago our WhatsApp group for parents went crazy with panicked messages about schools being closed,” added Jodie, who works as a PA. “We didn’t think we would have to self-quarantine but then we couldn’t get hold of any hand wipes, soap and face masks. Hand gel is now back in stock though which is a good sign.”“For every little town in Italy there’s a mayor, and ours happens to also be the local doctor – she’s been very good at keeping us up to date on Facebook. We’re just waiting for it to end now. We’re fed up, really.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/075a08e72112cf8abed17868774124d706c578dc/0_0_4320_2592/master/4320.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3260d4de507990cf4c8d94cfac4f41a2","title":"revolutionary guards enforce coronavirus controls iran","story":"Streets, shops and public spaces to be cleared in next 24 hours after virus kills hundredsIran’s Revolutionary Guards are to clear streets, shops and public places in the country within the next 24 hours, in a dramatic escalation of efforts to combat the spread of coronavirus.The near-curfew follows growing exasperation among MPs that calls for Iranian citizens to stay at home had been widely ignored, as people continued to travel before the Nowruz new year holidays. Shops and offices have largely remained open.Controversy over the health ministry’s authority within government and the haphazard way in which Iran’s provinces were implementing its advice has led to the change in tactics, and a clearer role for the army. The failure to impose a quarantine around the spiritual city of Qom, seen as the centre of the outbreak, has caused anger on social media.There have also been complaints that the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, has not been taking a sufficiently hands-on role in the crisis.Official figures, disputed by foreign media and opponents of the regime, show the numbers of dead in Iran have climbed to 514 and the numbers infected to 11,634. Hospitals in some provinces have been overwhelmed by the demand for treatment.Satellite images released this week showed what appeared to be mass graves in Qom, suggesting Iran’s coronavirus epidemic is more serious than authorities are admitting.The pictures show the excavation of a new section in a cemetery on the northern fringe of the city in late February, and two long trenches dug by the end of the month.The new steps, reflecting a transfer of power from political to military rulers, and ordered by the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was announced by the armed forces commander-in-chief, Mohammad Baqeri. He said the intervention would start in the next 24 hours and last as long as a week. The volunteer Basij force will be involved in the programme, which will include phone calls, internet contact and house-to-house visits.As many as 1,000 fixed and mobile detection clinics were being set up as part of the plan. He said the army would step in alongside nurses to set up a corps of staff, including volunteers that could work alongside exhausted medical workers. Army factories were producing face masks and gloves, and 6,000 army hospital beds were being made available, he said. The health ministry said it was setting up a national coronavirus mobilisation programme to increase early detection and had already piloted implementation of it in five provinces.A spokesman claimed the pilot scheme had already reduced the scale of infections in Qom and Guilan provinces so that the total number of new cases for the first time was exceeded by the numbers recovering.The aim was to identify patients at the first stage of the disease and prevent them from circulating in the community, as well as those associated with them, so cutting the transmission chain.Despite Iran’s reputation as an authoritarian state in which human rights are ignored, the opening fortnight of its fight against coronavirus has been marked by citizens demanding the state take more draconian and consistent steps to bring the disease under control. An earlier proposal for a house-to-house detection system was criticised on the grounds that it might lead to the spread rather than the containment of the disease.Khamenei had tweeted the day before: “Evidence suggests this could be a biological attack. So the fight against the coronavirus can be left to the armed forces, and it can also be a biological defense combat exercise and increase our national authority and capability.”Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman, Abbas Mousavi, joined in the row, saying: “Instead of hypocritical compassion and disgusting boasting, stop economic and medical terrorism so that medicine and medical equipment reach the medical staff and people of Iran.”“By the way, pay attention to the American people too!” the spokesman advised US officials.Iran has asked the International Monetary Fund for $5bn in aid to help combat the crisis but may well find the request is blocked by the US. Any hopes the crisis would lead to a temporary truce between Tehran and Washington appear to have been dashed by an Iraqi militia attack on a US army base in Iraq."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eda97feb9877122b91874be75ea31599880cfc65/0_201_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=683c1ab1d6bc766d3d9619161dff4d47","title":"uk to ban mass gatherings in coronavirus u turn","story":"Measure likely to come into effect next week after sporting bodies and others act unilaterallyMass gatherings are to be banned across the UK from next weekend, the government has announced after Boris Johnson’s cautious approach to the coronavirus outbreak was overtaken by care homes, sporting bodies and even the Queen taking matters into their own hands.On Thursday, despite formally moving to the delay stage of the coronavirus action plan and warning that many more families would “lose loved ones before their time”, the prime minister stopped short of calling for mass events to be cancelled or schools to be closed. There was no specific advice for how older people should protect themselves, aside from avoiding going on cruises.On Friday, the World Health Organization stressed the need for a range of measures to tackle the virus, which is thought to have infected up to 10,000 people in the UK, most of them unknowingly because they are not showing any symptoms.The WHO director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said all possible action should be taken: “Not testing alone. Not contact tracing alone. Not quarantine alone. Not social distancing alone. Do it all.”Hours later, in a significant change of tack, Downing Street signalled it was preparing to stop large public events, including sports fixtures and concerts, to alleviate the pressure on police and the ambulance service. It did not specify what size of event would be affected, and the timing of the clampdown has yet to be decided, but it is expected to come into force in a week’s time.Emergency legislation due to be passed by the government next week is expected to include compensation for organisations forced to cancel events. It is also expected to include the power to temporarily detain sufferers if necessarily.Whitehall sources said the country would move toward widespread home-working, although details had yet to be thrashed out.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided it is used correctly.Scores of events had already been cancelled unilaterally, as firms and institutions made their own assessments of the risk. There was a series of announcements earlier on Friday about care homes closing their doors to visitors, sporting and cultural fixtures being suspended, and universities ending in-person lectures.In what is thought to be an unprecedented step, Buckingham Palace announced that the Queen would cancel public engagements in Cheshire and London next week “as a sensible precaution”. Visits from the monarch, who is 94, draw crowds of well-wishers and use local council resources.A large number of care homes, including 120 run by Bupa, announced they would close their doors to outside visitors to protect elderly residents, despite updated government guidance suggesting that only those with virus symptoms should be turned away.The Premier League, Football League, Women’s Super League and Scottish Premier League joined the global sporting shutdown. The English leagues were suspended until 3 April at least, Saturday’s Six Nations clash between Wales and Scotland was postponed, and England’s cricket series in Sri Lanka was called off. The London Marathon and The Masters in Augusta – golf’s leading tournament – were also postponed.Johnson has been facing increasing questions about the government’s approach, which is markedly different to that of some other countries. The former health secretary Jeremy Hunt described the UK as an “outlier”.On Thursday, Johnson played down the importance of banning mass gatherings, even suggesting Scotland’s decision to ban events with more than 500 people reflected the lack of resilience of its emergency services.“The scientific advice, as we’ve said over the last couple of weeks, is that banning such events will have little effect on the spread,” he said.On Friday, the number of diagnosed cases in the UK rose to 798, though the government believes the true figure to be 5,000 to 10,000, and the first death was confirmed in Scotland.The former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown has criticised the lack of a coordinated international response, urging global leaders to pledge to do “whatever it takes,” to tackle the outbreak.Writing in the , he likened the scale of the response necessary to the Manhattan Project, which led to the creation of the nuclear bomb. “If the Manhattan Project could bring people together in the 1940s to create the most lethal weapon in human history, surely we can come together in the 21st century to save lives and the livelihood of millions.”Brown blamed the spread of “populist nationalism”, which has been “subiding our world”, for the inability of governments to deal with the crisis together. He encouraged them to be more open about how they were learning from each other’s experiences.His plea came as the French president, Emmanuel Macron, announced that world leaders will hold an emergency G7 video-conference summit on Monday. “We will coordinate research efforts on a vaccine and treatments, and work on an economic and financial response,” he said.Global stock markets rallied on Friday after their worst day since the 1987 crash, on hopes that economic policymakers might deliver a coordinated response.In the UK, ministers have insisted their decision-making is based on scientific advice. One factor influencing their thinking has been the risk of “fatigue” setting in if restrictive measures had to be applied for a prolonged period.Labour has been broadly supportive of the government’s approach so far but the shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, demanded more information.“We’re supporting to the move from the contain to delay stage, but the government needs an explain stage,” he said. “We have a duty to voice the concerns that are being raised with us: and the public want to know why the UK appears to be taking an approach which is different to other countries, when other countries themselves are saying their approach is based on their science.” A Whitehall source said: “Ministers are working with the chief scientific adviser and chief medical officer on our plan to stop various types of public events, including mass gatherings, beginning next week. We are also talking to businesses and other bodies about the timing of moving towards much more widespread working from home.“There are many complex considerations to make all these measures as effective as possible. We will make the right decisions at the right time based on the best scientific evidence.“For example, we are concerned about the burden large events put on public services – including the health service and the police – from dealing with coronavirus. Officials are working with industry bodies to identify how to support businesses that will be affected by this decision.“We have drafted emergency legislation to give the government the powers it needs to deal with coronavirus, including powers to stop mass gatherings and compensate organisations. We will publish this legislation next week.”Parliament announced a clampdown on visitors, and urged MPs not to go on overseas visits. Members of the public would be able to watch debates from the public galleries, but not tour the parliamentary estate.The Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, said: “We are clear that now is the time to be pragmatic everyone in the country is being asked to strike a balance and it is right that we do the same.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7200859fb487792e1336e456cb1a1b0c126614c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c3503426875ecac8614c1ddb0a46742","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance 14 march","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:The restrictions on European travel to the US applies to non-US citizens who have been in the 26 countries of the Schengen area during the 14 days before their planned arrival in the United States. The travel restrictions are set to last for 30 days but do not apply to the UK or Ireland.The aid package, passed with overwhelming support, provides free testing and paid sick leave, in a bid to limit the economic damage from a pandemic that has shuttered schools, sports arenas and offices. The development follows Donald Trump’s declaration of  a national emergency in response to the pandemic. More than 2,170 cases have been recorded across the US.Saudi Arabia has suspended all international flights for two weeks, starting Sunday, state news agency SPA reported. Last month, it took the unprecedented step of banning foreign pilgrims from entering the country.NZ’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, said all people arriving in the country, including returning citizens, will be required to isolate themselves for a fortnight. Only people arriving from the Pacific, were there are virtually no cases, are exempt from the rule. Ardern also cancelled Sunday’s memorial commemorating the first anniversary Christchurch mosque shootings. The country has recorded only six cases so far, and no instances of local transmission.Officials said parliament will be closed for five weeks and that incoming international flights will be redirected to a small number of airports for enhanced screening. The government also announced it will ban cruise ships with 500 people from docking in the country’s ports until 1 July.Colombia, Bolivia, Venezuela, Paraguay and Peru have all suspended European flights. Argentina also announced it would suspends links with the most badly affected countries and Guatemala said it will ban arrivals from the United States and Canada. The flight bans were announced as Venezuela confirmed its first two cases of the coronavirus Friday, deepening fears about a possible outbreak in the crisis-hit country where hospitals are barely functioning.Cambodia announced it would refuse entry to citizens from Italy, Germany, Spain, France, and the United States, according to local media. Vietnam will also stop issuing tourist visas to citizens from Europe’s Schengen area and Britain, starting from Sunday, it was reported.Australia’s chief medical officer has written to doctors warning there has been “extreme pressure” on personal protective equipment and that testing kits were no longer available in some regions of the country. He implored doctors to only test those who meet both clinical and epidemiological criteria.In South Korea, for a second day in a row the daily number of recovered people on Saturday (204) exceeded that of new confirmed cases (107). Meanwhile in Wuhan, the Chinese city where the outbreak began, officials reported just five new cases on Friday, the second day in a row the tally has been less than 10.So far 71,694 people have recovered, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University.

After the most dramatic week since the financial crisis, investors are counting their losses while economists fear the world economy risks a painful recession this year.Anxiety that global policymakers are failing to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic wiped trillions of dollars off stocks across the globe. The turmoil was compounded by Saudi Arabia launching an oil price war, which threatens to put some US shale producers out of business, triggering debt defaults.For younger traders in the City, this was their first introduction to true panic on the trading floors. Global markets plunged twice, on Monday and Thursday, with losses exceeding the worst times in the eurozone debt crisis.Some investors may ask whether this is the bottom. It could be, but seasoned traders and investors will merely see it as a dead-cat bounce. Those of a more nervous disposition may just want to sit tight until the volatility dies down.”Even older City heads hadn’t seen anything like it. Oil suffered its biggest crash since the 1991 Gulf War, after Saudi Arabia dramatically vowed to flood the market with supplies.Saudi ordered its producers to turn the taps up after Russia refused to back an Opec plan to curb output. This shocked the markets, as Covid-19 is already cutting energy demand. Brent crude plunged by a third to $31barrel, while US crude hit $27. Shares in oil producers across the globe fell too, helping to trigger Monday’s market crash.“Saudi Arabia is now selling its oil into Europe at about $25 per barrel and inventories are building rapidly. As the coronavirus crisis now accelerates in the US and Europe, there is little that can save Brent from $20barrel except for a war in the Middle East or a last-minute Opec+ deal.“The WTI crude oil price has halted just above the $30barrel line at which virtually all US shale oil wells are rendered unprofitable.The end came amid wild swings – usually downwards – on Wall Street, as Donald Trump’s shock ban on EU travel to the US spooked investors. But there was a late rally too, as Trump declared a national emergency to help fight the coronavirus threat.The bull market began in March 2009, as the world economy began to recover from the economic shock of the last crisis. The speed of its demise shows the next crisis has arrived.“Both the real economy and the financial economy are exhibiting acute signs of stress,” Kostin told clients. But he also believes markets will recover late this year.“A new bull market will likely be born later this year … By year end, economic and earnings growth will be accelerating, the fed funds rate will be at the zero lower bound, and the impact of any fiscal stimulus will be flowing through to consumers.”Wall Street’s fear index has soared alarmingly, to levels not seen since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. The VIX index, which measures volatility, almost doubled during the week, showing serious strains building in the financial world.The VIX surged as shares tumbled, safe-haven government bond yields hit new lows, and riskier corporate debt prices slid. A high VIX is a sign that market will remain volatile for some time, so investors will be buckling up.We are going into a global recession. After what’s been happening the last few days, we are going to see a spread of economic sudden stops.The trouble with economic sudden stops is, it’s not easy to restart an economy.”El-Erian also predicted that the market volatility wouldn’t end soon, telling Fox News: “I wish I could tell you that I see calmer waters in front of us, but I do not. Waters are going to get even choppier.”The coronavirus pandemic is threatening to reignite the eurozone debt crisis. Italy faces a deep recession this year, with shops and offices closing under a nationwide shutdown.Fears that Italy may need a bailout forced Italian borrowing costs up from record lows, which accelerated dramatically after ECB president Christine Lagarde suggested rising bond yield spreads weren’t her responsibility. The European Central Bank rushed out a clarification, but the row distracted from a new stimulus package including ultra-cheap loans for banks.Ms Lagarde’s miscommunication both during the press conference and afterwards has lost her political and leadership capital.“The fallout from Ms Lagarde’s mishandling of the press conference underlines the importance of communication for central banking. The ECB presented a comprehensive, effective package yesterday, but markets didn’t listen because of how poorly it was communicated.“The package will thus take longer than usual to feed through and have positive effects. It remains to be seen if Ms Lagarde can recover from this.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0eb763183be999a9984302df1e9b413ac8dc4af2/0_0_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44a83a4fdb731be212cfdc73520da235","title":"coronavirus closes down italy","story":"With Italy in lockdown, Peter Beaumont charts the spread of Covid-19 in the country while Lorenzo Tondo describes its impact.

Photograph: Nick BradshawBorders around the world have started to shut as the Covid-19 pandemic worsens and Europe becomes its new epicentre.Twenty new cases of the disease were reported in the Republic on Friday evening, the second-highest daily jump in the figures. There are now 90 confirmed cases and one death in the Republic, along with 29 cases in Northern Ireland, which reported nine new positive tests on Friday.Denmark announced it was closing its borders to other nationalities Canada advised against non-essential international travel anywhere and the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Malta all announced travel restrictions and quarantine measures.Italy recorded 250 deaths from the disease in a single day, the biggest increase so far and almost as bad as China’s worst day for deaths in February.Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney issued a new travel advisory on Friday night.“In light of rapidly changing conditions and restrictions across a number of EU countries, my Department is now advising people to exercised ‘a high degree of caution’ before deciding to travel to other EU States,” he posted on Twitter at 10pm. The Department will continue to update advice, he added.The advice does not apply to the UK, he confirmed.Earlier, the department advised against all travel to Italy and all non-essential travel to Spain. Of the new Irish cases, six are associated with travel, and 12 with contacts of confirmed cases. Four of the latter involve healthcare workers.The remaining two cases are the result of community transmission.The largest cluster of cases involve 16 people who have been infected with the virus in a single part of the country.Public health officials are now saying anyone with a new fever of 38 degrees or more, or chills andor respiratory tract infection including cough will require testing.This is expected to lead to a big increase in the number of people needing to be tested. However, GPs will be able to refer patients directly to the National Ambulance Service for testing without having to first consult public health doctors, as was the case up to now.There also plans to start providing testing facilities in 12 specified centres in addition to people’s homes, officials told a press briefing in HSE headquarters in Dublin.‘Status yellow’ On Wednesday, the Defence Forces will move to a “status yellow” force posture, with about 330 troops available to aid the HSE response to coronavirus.About 800 more troops will be available on an hour’s notice under the status yellow, Vice-Admiral Mark Mellet, the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces, said on Friday.Amid confusion and some mixed messages about what social restrictions parents should apply to their children, who are now off school, officials urged parents not to arrange playdates for groups of young children for now.“However, rather than staying indoors, consider outdoor activities such as playing football in the open in small groups of three or four while maintaining social distancing of 2 metres,” said Dr Ronan Glynn, assistant chief medical officer.A number of doctors on Friday advocated for a stricter interpretation of the rules on mixing.Dr Glynn said the restrictions on social interactions were not “absolutist” but “if children continue to mix with children as normal, the measures won’t be as effective”.Meanwhile, chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said officials were not telling pubs and restaurants to close as part of the social restriction measures and they were “not talking lockdowns”.“We’re not locking down the country, I’ve heard rumours of army and gardaí but we have no plans for that,” he said.Isolation bedsThe HSE said it was talking to hotels regarding isolation beds, while hundreds of prisoners may be released from jail as the Irish Prison Service warned of “significant challenges” it faced containing the spread of the virus.Minister for Health Simon Harris and Dr Holohan are due to meet their counterparts in Northern Ireland on Saturday against a backdrop of erging approaches to the crisis on either side of the Border.President Michael D Higgins has called on people to work “in a spirit of solidarity and co-operation” in confronting difficulties triggered by the virus.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4201523.1584055098!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus plan sees ireland embark on vast social experiment","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDubliner Breeda Brody masked up  on Grafton Street  to protect against the spread of coronavirus. Photograph: PAYou have to go back to the second World War to look for parallels to the events unfolding in Ireland and across much of Europe. Certainly, there has been nothing in this writer’s lifetime to match the breadth and severity of the measures just introduced by the Government to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Neither is there much in our recent experience to match the speed with which events have unfolded, and the speed with which the threat has escalated.Earlier this week, Ministers indicated Ireland would publish its national plan for tackling Covid-19 next Monday. This was already late in the day Britain published its plan 10 days ago.A plan will provide an anxious public with a route map for dealing with the crisis and show how the Government plans to proceed through the stages to meet, and ultimately see off, the threat posed by the disease.Unfortunately, the situation is worsening so fast that there was no time to wait for publication of the plan before introducing a widespread shutdown of public services and restrictions on public gatherings.This sudden change of pace was further underlined when Ministers on Thursday morning announced the closure of schools and creches countrywide for the rest of the month. About the same time, the Health Service Executive was publishing a guide to “Getting your school, college or educational setting ready for Covid-19”. This document will not be needed for a bit.The Government and public health officials are talking about leaving the present state, when we were trying to contain the virus, to now enter a “delay” phase. There was no talk of a delay phase in the early pronouncement by the experts, who said we would move from containment to mitigation if demanded by circumstances, but the idea seems to have been borrowed from the British plan.Whatever about the phrasing, these measures are drastic and, as Ministers acknowledged, they raise many questions. Closing schools and creches, for example, gives rise to massive childcare challenges for many families. Some parents will have to stop working in order to plug the gaps. Losing healthcare workers as a result would be the equivalent of shooting ourselves in the foot.Will closing schools be effective? And simply shutting the schools is not an answer in itself. Children can become vectors of the disease outside the classroom too, unless they follow the rules of correct hygiene and social distancing. The threat to elderly relatives could rise rather than fall, as a result.The move to pull the shutters down on much of public life was triggered by an upsurge in confirmed cases in recent days, as well as the nature of some of the cases we have. Covid-19 cut a swath through hospitals in Limerick and Cork over the past week, infecting staff and patients and forcing hundreds of contacts into self-isolation.There have been two cases of community transmission, which means we don’t know the source of the infection in these cases. Doctors have been saying for days there is much more out there than has been recorded because we have not been testing widely enough.With computer modelling predicting a rapid rise in cases, it was clear the always stretched Irish health system would be overloaded within weeks. Meanwhile, the disease was gaining a firm foothold across continental Europe, now the new epicentre of this disease.This left policymakers feeling they had only one option: strike hard now in the hope this will delay the onset of cases, delay the spike in admissions and curb the spread of the disease.In the United Kingdom a different approach is being taken. This seems to involve an acceptance of some community transmission, at least at levels with which the National Health Service can cope. Consequently, the social restrictions being imposed are far less intrusive, so far.For now, the Irish public is fully behind the Government’s restrictions. The social distancing and hygiene messages have been clearly communicated and, hopefully, clearly understood. People seem to be up for the vast social experiment involved, whether it involves distance learning or remote working. Whether that remains the case if weeks turn into months remains to be seen.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4202012.1584090201!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland is exactly 14 days behind italy in terms of coronavirus cases","story":"Bars and shops across Italy have been closed as tougher restrictions were added to an already severe lockdown aimed to fight coronavirus contagion.

If we wish to avoid an epidemic peak that overwhelms the health service we must flatten the curve of transmission.“We are exactly 14 days behind Italy in terms of positive cases rising above 5 patients per million and adjusting our trajectory now with serious and radical efforts is our best hope to save as many lives as possible.”The letter calls for an information campaign for the public on social distancing, the redeployment of healthcare staff to public health role such as triage, contact tracing and testing, high-volume testing and quarantine of infected people.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Ireland\u0026rsquos leading producer is at capacity despite producing 50,000 rolls an hourGovernment issues travel warning as borders across the world start to shut to tackle pandemicConcern for childcare operators if Covid-19 emergency measures extendedMany fear being deported during coronavirus outbreak if they come forwardPlatoons of 30 to be available to back up HSE at each barracks around RepublicRHI inquiry findings: DUP and Sinn F\u0026eacutein special advisers \u0026lsquowielded significant power\u0026rsquoTotal of 119 cases confirmed on island of Ireland as Trump declares national emergency in USFamous stone attracts in the region of 460,000 visitors every year to Co CorkPrisoners with less than three months on their sentences would be considered for release firstTrial of childcare worker (29) accused of sexually assaulting four girls in creche is set to conclude next week\u0026lsquoNo playdates, no parties and no playgrounds,\u0026rsquo warns hospital consultantColum Eastwood calls for immediate reform of the processes of governmentProposed ban on industrial action dropped in HSE policy documentClaims turn on alleged misinterpretation of smear slides taken between 2010 and 2018Belfast court hears man (79) is facing charges of attempted murder and attempted grievous bodily harm with intentHighest daily total to date comes as Sinn F\u0026eacutein calls for all-Ireland approach to crisisUnion \u0026lsquocannot guarantee\u0026rsquo continuity if health advice on social distancing not implementedIrish Life claims policy was void by reason of non-disclosure by Eamon Dunne of cocaine use and depressionSubmission from officials said move would facilitate better community integrationStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4202509.1584141345!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus toilet paper manufacturer struggles to meet unprecedented demand","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tOrders for toilet tissue have increased by 200 per cent since the coronavirus outbreak began, Aldar Tissue managing director Darren Farrell said. Photograph: Dave MeehanIreland’s leading manufacturer of toilet paper says it is doing its best to meet demand as people stockpile as a result of the coronavirus. Aldar Tissue, based in Finglas in Dublin, employs 22 staff. The company has its own brand, Jasmine, and also manufacturers for Aldi, SuperValu and Musgraves. It is one of only two toilet tissue manufacturers in Ireland. The other is Dawn Paper, based in Slane, Co Meath. The sight of shoppers panic-buying toilet paper and rows of empty shelves have become enduring images of the coronavirus pandemic, not just in Ireland but worldwide. Aldar managing director Darren Farrell said orders from retailers were up 200 per cent since the outbreak began and the company was working seven days a week and 16 hours a day. Currently, it is at capacity producing 50,000 rolls of toilet tissue per hour. The company’s order book is full for the next three months and it can take no more orders. Mr Farrell said demand was “unprecedented” worldwide. “This has never been seen before in toilet tissue.” The company sources its raw materials from paper mills in the Middle East and Portugal. The paper that is used in toilet tissue is virgin pulp. Mr Farrell believes the run on toilet paper is due to a number of factors. People perceive that the product is manufactured in China and that the country, where the coronavirus originated, is refusing to export it. He said this was untrue and that most toilet paper used in Ireland was also manufactured in Ireland. “We have taken orders in the last week for the next three months. It’s gone absolutely phenomenal. Can we keep up with demand? Obviously not. We are doing our best,” he said. Mr Farrell, whose background is in trading paper, founded the company in 2013. He said toilet tissue is a commodity in constant demand in the country and will never go out of fashion. “It will always be there unless they come up with a new concept. It is a product that has 100 per cent penetration into every household in the country,” he said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4202607.1584134023!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"defence forces to shift to status yellow with 330 troops aiding hse","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThere is no plan to deploy troops to support the gardaí on the streets, although such a scenario cannot ultimately be ruled out, says Vice-Admiral Mark Mellet. Photograph: Alan BetsonThe Defence Forces will move to a “status yellow” force posture on Wednesday of next week, with in the region of 330 troops available to aid the Health Service Executive (HSE) response to coronavirus.About 800 more troops will be available on an hour’s notice under the status yellow, Vice-Admiral Mark Mellet, the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces said on Friday.The status yellow is one level higher than the Defence Forces’ usual “force posture”, which is denoted as blue.Vice-Admiral Mellett said there was no truth to rumours that the Defence Forces would be going on a status red alert from Monday, and emphasised that his troops would be offering support functions to the HSE. There is no plan to put troops on the streets in their capacity as an aid to the civil power, he said.A platoon of about 30 people would be constantly available to supplement the HSE at each of the nine barracks around the country, as well as at Haulbowline Naval Base and Baldonnell, the Air Corps headquarters.A larger, company-sized force of about 100 people can be mustered at any of the bases within an hour under the status yellow, he said. He said the functions fulfilled by the Defence Forces would be as drivers, chefs, emergency medical technicians, maintenance, engineers or perhaps decontamination teams. If needed, he said his personnel could take samples from people suspected to have Covid-19.Isolation and medical facilitiesHe confirmed that the Defence Forces properties and capabilities were being audited as use for isolation facilities or other medical facilities that the HSE may need. In the first instance, he said that would focus on their properties but he said the armed forces could provide tented facilities if needs be.Speaking to The , he also said naval vessels could be pressed into action as testing facilities, as the navy had developed the skillset to test for illnesses in large numbers during humanitarian missions in the Mediterranean, although he emphasised that there was no current plan to do so.He said at the moment there is no plan to deploy troops to support the gardaí on the streets, although such a scenario could not ultimately be ruled out. “It’s a scenario that right now is not on our radar but as a contingency it is core business to us to aid the civil power.”He said he was satisfied he had sufficient resources to manage the Defence Forces involvement in the Covid-19 crisis, despite recent concerns over the levels of personnel available to the service. “I have the manpower resource that has been allocated by government and that’s the resource I play with,” he said.“I’ve never met a chief of defence who wouldn’t like to have more resources, but my job is to maximise the return from the defences I have, and that’s what I’m doing. I’ll manage the Defence Forces against the ask from the HSE.”Returning troopsHowever, he said that, if necessary, he would examine pulling troops back from overseas missions, where 550 are currently serving. He also confirmed that the Defence Forces are in discussions with members who have left the force and are considering “re-entry”.“If I have people who are fit and qualified who have recently left the Defence Forces that I can bring back in, I’m going to try and ensure that the legislative provisions are available to me that will allow that to happen,” he said.He also confirmed some members who were planning to retire “are being asked to extend in the service” but said that number was low.He said it was likely members of the Defence Forces would be infected with Covid-19 during their work in the weeks ahead. Four members are currently self-isolating.“The health and welfare of our personnel is of primacy in this, and I have to be conscious that many of my personnel will get Covid.

Photograph: Facundo ArrizabalagaEPABritain’s government will introduce emergency laws next week to ban mass gatherings in an attempt to curb the coronavirus outbreak, an escalation of its crisis plan which critics had said was too relaxed.Prime minister Boris Johnson has so far resisted pressure to take some of the stringent measures adopted by other European countries to slow the spread of the virus, also known as Covid-19.But on Friday, England’s soccer Premier League suspended all matches until April 4th and other events such as the London Marathon were postponed by their organisers.“We have drafted emergency legislation to give the government the powers it needs to deal with coronavirus, including powers to stop mass gatherings and compensate organisations,” a government source said.“We will publish this legislation next week.”British media said the ban on mass gatherings could come into force from next weekend and could affect events such as the Glastonbury music festival, the Wimbledon tennis championships and the Grand National horse race.Meanwhile, the number of coronavirus cases imported into mainland China from overseas surpassed the number of locally transmitted new infections for the first time on Friday, data released by the National Health Commission showed on Saturday.Mainland China had 11 new confirmed cases on Friday, up from eight cases a day earlier, but only four of those - all in the virus epicentre of Hubei province - were locally transmitted.The other seven - including four in the financial hub of Shanghai, one in the capital Beijing and two in the northwestern province of Gansu - were all detected in travellers coming into China from overseas, specifically Italy, the United States and Saudi Arabia.Later on Saturday, Shanghai’s city government confirmed a further two imported cases in travellers from France and Spain.OutbreakThe numbers underscore how China, where the outbreak began in December, appears to now face a greater threat of new infections from outside its borders as it continues to slow the spread of the virus domestically.A total of 95 cases have entered mainland China from overseas by the end of Friday, the commission said.Hubei has now seen new infections fall for nine straight days. All four new cases on Friday were in provincial capital Wuhan.The death toll in mainland China had reached 3,189 by the end of Friday, up by 13 from the previous day. All the latest deaths were in Hubei and 10 were in Wuhan.The virus has infected 80,824 people in mainland China, the commission said. Globally, more than 138,000 have been infected and over 5,000 have died, according to a Reuters tally.As cases rise overseas, the steel hub of Tangshan in northern China’s Hebei province warned people entering the city against trying to conceal their travel history.People who do so will have to bear all treatment costs if they are later found to have contracted coronavirus, the Tangshan city government said.Despite the uptick in imported cases in Shanghai, the city is gearing up to re-open all its public parks by March 20th, Fang Yan, an official from Shanghai’s Landscaping and City Appearance Administrative Bureau, told a press conference on Saturday.A total of 195 city parks have reopened so far after “the war against coronavirus situation showed positive changes”, the official said. Thousands of public venues had earlier been shut across China in a bid to halt the virus spread.Chinese president Xi Jinping spoke to his Italian counterpart Sergio Mattarella over the phone to offer his “sincere condolences” to the Italian people over the crisis, CCTV reported on Saturday.New infections in Italy soared by more than 2,500 on Friday and virus-related deaths made their biggest single-day jump, increasing by 250.In the three weeks since the country identified its first virus cluster, Italy has reached 17,600 confirmed cases, with 1,266 deaths.The government has ordered an unprecedented lockdown, ordering businesses to close and restricting movement.Mr Xi also held phone calls with the presidents of two other severely hit countries, Iran and South Korea, again expressing condolences, the state broadcaster said.Severe measuresCountries across the world have implemented increasingly severe measures to halt the spread, including closing borders and schools.New Zealand announced all incoming passengers, including it own citizens, will be required to isolate themselves for 14 days, with few exceptions.The steps being implemented globally increasingly mirror those taken by China, which in January made the unprecedented decision to halt outbound transportation from cities with a combined population of more than 60 million people, starting with the epicentre of Wuhan.In the US, which reported its 50th death from the outbreak on Friday, president Donald Trump said the new emergency decree will open up $50 billion (€44.9 billion) for state and local governments to respond to the outbreak.“We will defeat this threat,” Mr Trump told a news conference. “When America is tested, America rises to the occasion.”New Zealand’s new measures, which prime minister Jacinda Ardern called some of the toughest border restrictions in the world, go into effect on Monday.The only countries exempt from the restrictions are a handful of Pacific islands which have not had any cases of Covid-19.New Zealand has had only six confirmed cases of the illness, and all of those have been connected with international travellers and there have been no signs of any local outbreaks.The head of the World Health Organisation said Europe is now the “epicentre of the pandemic”.The government of the Czech Republic made a middle-of-the-night announcement ordering retail businesses including shopping malls to close from Saturday morning.The exceptions include those providing essential services such as supermarkets, petrol stations and pharmacies.New infections also rose sharply in Spain, and the government put 60,000 people in four towns on a mandatory lockdown on Friday that echoed the situation in Italy.In Madrid, which is struggling with nearly 2,000 infections, many in nursing homes, the government was pooling intensive care units and considering offers by hotel chains to transform rooms into sick wards.-ReutersAPEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4201478.1584038176!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit next week s london talks called off due to coronavirus","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMichel Barnier, Brexit chief negotiator for the European Union.

Photograph: Luke DrayGettyMichael Gove, the British cabinet minister who will negotiate the implementation of post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland, has declined to confirm that checks will be required on goods crossing the Irish Sea from Great Britain to the North.Mr Gove told a House of Commons committee that it would be for an EU-UK joint committee to determine how the Northern Ireland protocol should work.“The effective working of the protocol is a matter for the joint committee to resolve and I’m looking forward to that meeting in order to ensure that we can develop the protocol and implement it in all its provisions in a way that ensures that the people of Northern Ireland and the Northern Ireland economy benefit,” he said.EU negotiators insist that the role of the joint committee, which is due to meet for the first time on March 30th, is limited to determining matters such as which goods are assumed to be destined to remain in Northern Ireland rather than exported to the EU. But the protocol makes clear that Northern Ireland will have to follow the EU customs code, which requires information and checks on goods coming from Great Britain.Irish Sea borderPrime minister Boris Johnson has stated a number of times that there will be no checks and no border in the Irish Sea but Mr Gove said the British government was committed to implementing the protocol in full.“We are committed to making sure that the Northern Ireland protocol is implemented in order to underpin the BelfastGood Friday Agreement. And the point is well understood that the joint committee is there to ensure that it is implemented and also to resolve some of the questions over precisely how,” he said.Mr Gove suggested that the next round of talks between Britain and the EU, which is scheduled to start in London next Wednesday, could be postponed because of the coronavirus outbreak. And he said the government would not publish an economic impact assessment of the free trade deal it is seeking from the EU.“I am personally sceptical of efforts to say that any given impact assessment by a government department is an accurate prediction of the future. As load-bearing devices go, they are perhaps not the most effective ways of delivering a proper range of views about what the economic consequences of a course of action might be,” he said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

I didn’t have a clue what he was talking about. He said, ‘Stand up a second.’“I don’t think I had time to react. He stretched his arms out straight towards me and for a second or two did an impression of a zombie walking towards me.”She said he took a couple of “clumsy steps” before putting his hands – with a “heavy touch” – on her shoulders and “leaned in” before moving her “out of the way” to kiss her on both cheeks before trying to kiss her on the lips.Woman J said she “raised” her arms to “break contact” with Mr Salmond, adding: “I took a couple of steps back, he turned around to pick up the documents and acted like nothing had happened.”She said she felt “scared… humiliated… devastated” and in “complete shock”, explaining she did not understand what had happened and struggled to “process” it.“I remember thinking that I was glad that his reaction wasn’t angry,” she added.She told the court how later in Mr Salmond’s study she “freaked out” when he touched her nose, and became “startled” when he “briefly” touched her leg and face.She said they had gone to the study and engaged in “chit chat”, agreeing the room was cold.She said he commented: “Well, you shouldn’t have bare legs.”Asked by Alex Prentice, QC, for the prosecution, how that made her feel, she replied: “I took offence to it. I couldn’t have been more appropriately dressed, and I was wearing tights.”She said he briefly put his hand on her leg above the knee, allegedly exclaiming: “Oh yes”.She claimed she “froze”, in part because she felt “hemmed in” while sat at his desk in front of his computer.“Apart from the security guards, we were essentially alone. There was no one else in the building,” she added. “I felt in a curious position.”Mr Salmond left the room while she worked “quite a while” on the documents.She said she declined his offer to stay over in one of the rooms.When Woman J left Bute House in the early hours of the morning she said she was feeling “quite emotional”, but “with hindsight” believed “it was all premeditated”.Asked how she felt the next morning, she replied: “Like I had had an awful nightmare.”Under cross-examination by Shelagh McCall, QC, a defence advocate for Mr Salmond, she accepted the former First Minister was a “touchy feely” kind of person The SNP worker said she had thought her experience was “a complete one off” but was “dumbfounded” when she read later media reports of more alleged complaints against Mr Salmond.She also accepted that in a statement given to police she did say: “I didn’t really understand what had happened to me. I didn’t think I had been a victim of something.”She rejected Ms McCall’s suggestion that the “zombie impersonation” never actually happened.Mr Salmond, 65, from Strichen, Aberdeenshire, denied 14 counts of sexual assaults against 10 women.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/03/12/TELEMMGLPICT000227715025_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqB9TNGSg3mw1zIYGf6IZil_PnnjZCHM7buvIhfynOWKk.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"government wants us get not","story":"Boris Johnson with the Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty and the Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Vallance It is footage that has become infamous from the coronavirus epidemic in Wuhan: residents waking up to find metal bars welded across their doors by police, sealing them into their homes until authorities decide to let them out. China has been widely praised for its Herculean containment effort. It seems to have worked. But alongside the enormous mobilisation of resources and public spirit, there was a hard edge to Beijing’s method. When our Government says that it cannot contain the spread of coronavirus, it is saying, essentially, that it is either not willing or able to arm the cops with welding torches and that, without them, it cannot keep the population under control for long enough. A vaccine is probably a year to 18 months away. So, No 10 says, this is a marathon, not a sprint.This is one of many assumptions underlying Britain’s anomalous approach to the epidemic. The Government is taking criticism from all sides for not falling into line with other European and Asian countries, many of which have shut down schools, moved early to ban large gatherings and, in some cases, made it illegal for anyone to leave their home without a critical reason. But the bet in London is that countries taking draconian measures early in their infection cycle are going to run out of steam and leave themselves with no tools to manage later resurgences.Despite examples of containment elsewhere, the Government believes that the epidemic is now so widespread across the world that permanent containment is impossible. The management of it, therefore, is all about timing. If the UK can get into an equilibrium in which the epidemic does not exceed a certain rate of growth, the health system might have a chance of coping.Currently, however, infection is speeding up rapidly. The British gamble seems to be that the speed can be fine-tuned. If it starts to overwhelm the NHS’s capacity, other measures, like stricter isolation advice, will kick in to slow it down. As this process continues, the idea is that the least vulnerable people get the disease and recover, ultimately developing enough immunity to protect the elderly and ill. At that point, isolation measures can be eased.If this sounds like a risky operation, it’s because it is. In fact, it looks rather like trying to catch the surf using a broken board and a spreadsheet of sporadic data about the ocean floor and the shape and speed of the incoming wave. This makes one other element of the strategy absolutely critical. The Government needs to monitor the epidemic with monomaniacal focus. If its modelling assumptions about the virus’s characteristics, the behaviour of the population or the capacity of the health service start to look dodgy, it needs to change tack at lightning speed. UK data collection so far has, by all accounts, been excellent, which should give us a bit of confidence.The need for nimble policy is one possible reason for laying off the welding torch and travel bans. China is close to declaring victory, with President Xi Jinping visiting Wuhan recently to take credit for the work of the country’s scientists and health workers. State propaganda has lauded the inimitable People’s Leader, comparing him to a fantastical “sea-stabilising holy cudgel” from a classic Chinese novel. This may not leave a lot of room for changing approach if a second wave of infection hits as China begins to lift restrictions.The UK’s approach, however, has its own potentially huge flaws. The most salient is the assumption that it is neither possible nor desirable to stop the epidemic completely. The behavioural science underlying the claim that you cannot get people to stay away from each other for six months or a year is an obvious weak point. Given that this situation is unprecedented in the modern era, how on earth do these behavioural “scientists” know?What’s more, they seem to be assuming that the Government does not have hard power at its disposal. If it drew on its emergency powers, flooded cities with police drones and threatened jail time for wanderers, we would probably learn to stay put pretty quickly. So what the Prime Minister really means, when he worries about a mood of uncooperative “crisis fatigue” setting in, is that the danger from the virus is not great enough to warrant such a major suspension of liberty.This relies on a series of educated guesses. Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance has made several statements about the virus that other scientists argue are highly uncertain. He has said that it is likely to become endemic, that the population needs to develop “herd immunity” to protect us from recurrent waves of illness each year and that the current fatality rate is around one per cent. These statements are no doubt based on good evidence, but could still be wrong.For one thing, Singapore, China and South Korea seem to demonstrate that the spread isn’t inevitable. The many deaths we are being told to expect may be avoidable. Even if containment is impossible and the virus recurs, it may have changed form so much that “herd immunity” does not protect us. And the current fatality rate seems to vary wildly. In South Korea, looking just at “completed” infections, 11 per cent of patients have died and 89 per cent have recovered, whereas in Italy, one person has died for every one that has recovered. The difference could be explained by the quality of care (Korea has many more ventilators), age, underlying health or some other factor. As with the virus’s long-term effects, we just don’t know.Nor can Government scientists be certain about the epidemic’s peculiar features. They think it spreads most within clusters, such as family or church groups, unlike seasonal flu, which spreads in a reasonably linear way across clusters. This means that an infected person on a train is not as much of an obvious infection risk with Covid-19 as with normal flu, and this is the sort of observation that underlies the Government’s models and its timeline. But why the new virus spreads this way, scientists cannot say. That makes it hard to assume it will behave in the way the models predict.The truth is that it will be years before we know who has called it right. A strategy is not right or wrong based on how many governments adopt it. It is nothing more than a live experiment. All we can do is hope that Britain’s leaders and scientists are getting it right given the nature of the epidemic here and the resources at their disposal.

Their mother is in an Iraqi prison.They are two of hundreds of children that Russia is bringing back from squalid prisons and camps in the former caliphate, in what could be the world\u0027s largest repatriation effort.While the UK is torn by a debate over the future of about 60 British children in a similar situation, Russia is already in the middle of its operation.At least 3,000 Russian nationals went to fight alongside Islamic State (Isil) militants in Syria, and a third of them hailed from Dagestan, a region of 3 million.Russia’s original repatriation programme was halted at the end of 2017 after security services argued that women who came back with the kids were too much of a risk. So the authorities resumed the programme a year later, this time focusing on children.“Children are not to blame and shouldn’t be responsible for the immature choices of their mothers and even their fathers,” said Marina Yezhova, Dagestan’s ombudswoman for children’s rights, who has overseen the repatriation of 98 children since 2017.Nations in Central Asia have brought back several hundreds each but Russia’s programme is likely to beat that.Dagestan has a list of 1,118 kids in Syria and Iraq eligible for return.The North Caucasus region was a fertile recruiting ground for Isil, with a culture of violence instilled after more than a decade of battling between Islamic insurgents and federal forces.The Islamic insurgency spread from Chechnya in the 1990s.Just a few years ago, federal forces would send in SWAT teams to lock down entire neighbourhoods and raid houses of suspended militants at Komsomolskoye, now a quiet village sitting at the foot of the Caucasus mountains.Multiple interviews and testimony reveal that Russian security services went as far as to encourage some of the locals to flee just before 2014 when Russia hosted the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Vladimir Putin’s pet project.But unlike her neighbours, Ms Gazimagomedova, 63, never had trouble with the authorities or the police, and neither did her two daughters, who left with their families for Syria in 2014 and 2015.The sisters, 40 and 38, were never religious or radical but simply obeyed their husbands, taking their young families with them, said Ms Gazimagomedova, a petite woman in a traditional scarf.Now that Sumaya and Zagidat are back in Russia - without their parents - they have a lot of catching up to do.A government-assigned tutor helped Zagidat cover two years of curriculum last year since neither of the girls went to school in Syria. She’s now in the third grade but still two years older than her classmates.“She was scared of people and wouldn’t talk to anyone when she got here,” Patimat Abdullayeva, a social worker at the school, said of Zagidat, a tall girl dressed in long sleeves and a white hijab who was shy and reticent on a recent afternoon while her classmates were fooling around during a break.Unusually for girls her age, Zagidat’s younger sister, Sumaya, wears a purple headband that Muslim women typically wear underneath a hijab because it’s “comfortable” and it makes her feel “like an adult.”When asked about life in Syria, Sumaya went off to talk about her present interests: dolls and taking snapshots on her grandmother’s old camera. Ms Gazimagomedova has now applied for custody for three other grandchildren who live with their mother, her other daughter, at the notorious al-Hol camp in Syria.It was not just the youth from marginalised areas like Komsomolskoye who left for Syria. Children from more affluent families from secular backgrounds were recruited as well.Sadredin, a retired law enforcement official, lost his daughter to the caliphate. Just three weeks ago, his two grandsons were flown in from al-Hol.He asked not to give his last name for this story.“I don’t want my colleagues to know,” he said. “This is a shame for me.”The boys, 12 and 10, are in good health but cannot read or write, according to Sadredin. Their mother died in shelling and their father is missing.The children are monitored by social workers and psychologists, and new arrivals spend two weeks at a recreation camp where they undergo psychiatric evaluation in an informal setting.Most of the children are too young to have been seriously traumatised, officials said, but psychiatrists found some of them to be suicidal or with issues like panic attacks and learning difficulties.Back in Komsomolskoye, children played in the school yard by a one-storey building: a mosque built by a private benefactor. School administrator Nasikhat Muradisova shrugged at how unusual it was in Russia to find a place of worship on state school grounds.“At least we’re keeping an eye on the kids here,” she said. And while the authorities continue to work to bring back the children from the terrible conditions in Syria and Iraq, Ms Yezhova cautioned that the risk of radicalisation remained even back in Dagestan.“Children are not not the problem, it’s the environment they live in, she said.No one can guarantee that they won’t share a call for dismantling a secular state in favour of a theocracy.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/men/2019/10/18/TELEMMGLPICT000213221614_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450\"","title":"laurence foxs victory blow against hypocrisies left wing luvviedom","story":"The actors\u0026#39 union Equity has issued an apology and agreed an out-of-court settlement with Laurence FoxWhen I joined Laurence Fox on a Question Time panel earlier this year, I had no clue I’d booked myself a ringside seat in the culture wars. Walking offstage after a rowdy but (I thought) generally good-natured episode, the actor muttered, “Oh god, that’ll get me into trouble”.I couldn’t imagine what he’d said that was so controversial. Was it mocking the eco-hypocrisies of jet-setting celebs, or dismissing the idea that public anger about the Sussexes was predominantly driven by racism? Or perhaps his ‘radical’ suggestion that the gender of Labour’s next leader mattered less than their policy agenda?Even in these easily-offended times, the backlash was astonishing. Unforgivably, the actors’ union Equity branded him a “disgrace” and urged their members to “denounce” him - all for expressing views shared by large swathes of the public. Two months later, and following the threat of legal action, Equity have finally issued an apology and agreed an out-of-court settlement.This was not one of history’s most convincing apologies: the mealy-mouthed “I’m sorry if anyone was offended” type, beloved by politicians. Nor was it universally endorsed members of Equity’s ‘Race Equality’ panel have resigned in protest (the worthy Left can never resist a good sub-committee).Yet the gesture, though grudging and feeble, sends a powerful message to the conformist creatives whose views have become a web of hypocrisy. In this topsy-turvy world, authoritarians masquerade as victims, a union can engage in distinctly inequitable behaviour while calling itself “Equity”, and brag about ersity while demanding total conformity of opinion.Though Fox’s views were dismissed as the ramblings of a “privileged white male”, it’s also clear from the veneration of other well-born thesps that “privilege” doesn’t matter if you hold the “right” views - take Hugh Grant or Benedict Cumberbatch. Even belonging to an acting dynasty is fine, provided it’s an aristocracy of Trotskyites like the Redgraves.Fox’s victory is doubly satisfying in a culture which often seems to give the Left unlimited licence to say abhorrent things, while zealously punishing right-wingers for even the most anodyne remarks. Members of the great and the good have wished elderly Brexiteers dead, with no social repercussions whatsoever. Outing herself as “literally a Communist” seems to have furthered the far-Left commentator Ash Sarkar’s TV career - an unthinkable outcome had a right-winger proudly worn the mantle of fascism. Diane Abbott’s admission that “Mao did more good than harm” did not prevent her from being promoted to the Shadow Cabinet. Likewise, the iniduals responsible for Equity’s missives, nestled safely beneath their union umbrella, can expect no real punishment for the damage they sought to inflict.

With the world in the grip of a pandemic on a scale unseen for a century, the West is finally getting the chance to see what its governments are made of. The results, needless to say, have been mixed. The UK was, until yesterday, a little more reserved than most, with the prime minister, Boris Johnson, making good use of social media (not to mention medical experts) to allay public fears via a series of video clips that plans were in place and that there was no need to panic. Though plenty have called for more action (with Piers Morgan particularly vociferous in his need for “something” to be done) the UK government has at the very least been consistent in following a semblance of a plan, and of communicating it carefully to the public and the outside world. Its announcement that the nation would yesterday move to its second phase, one of delay, is in sync with that measured approach.That is not to say that this is the correct strategy — we simply will not know the true success of it until the epidemic has subsided. But it has certainly appeared more rational than others.One can hardly blame the Italian authorities for rapidly implementing draconian measures on its population in a bid to stem the tide. Italy has an elderly cohort unmatched by any country bar Japan. It is almost uniquely at risk to this particular virus, and with a culture that sees the older members of it less isolated than in Anglo-Saxon counterparts. Nevertheless, Italy’s decision was so hurried, it gave other nations very little time to react — people who left Italy as the restrictions were being put in place arrived at airports abroad, including in the UK, completely bemused and unprepared to respond to such escalation. But that is symptomatic of  wider lack of coordination, and wider reactionary behaviour, across Europe. The outbreak has already caused anger in Italy at the lack of assistance Rome feels it has received from Paris, Brussels or Berlin. Germany even banned the export of protective medical clothing and face masks, whilst China was busy shipping such equipment, as well as doctors, to the peninsula. A patient in a Naples hospital has reportedly been treated with a drug used in China, returning them to being able to breathe unassisted, as part of Beijing’s efforts to assist Italian authorities.The Czech Republic, a country that had no cases a few days ago, has now closed its borders to 15 affected nations, including neighboring Germany and Austria, declaring a state of emergency for 30 days whilst museums, galleries, pubs and restaurants are also subject to measures from complete closure to strict opening times. As in Italy, this policy appears to have been sprung in the aftermath of the number of cases exploding in a very short space of time, presumably long after the virus has entered the country.In the US, though, the tragedy of taking action in order to be seen doing “something” has taken on a farcical element, with President Donald Trump unilaterally deciding that EU citizens travelling to the US from Europe, and vice versa, are to be severely limited, with the sole exception of the UK. Why? No one is really sure — but it has more than a passing resemblance to Trump\u0027s call for “a total and complete shutdown” of Muslims entering the US until he could “figure out what is going on” that he made when running running for office. Sadly, the UK has not proven completely immune to reactionary politicians throwing out decisions at short notice. Yesterday, Nicola Sturgeon, having been present at the Cobra meeting where the next phase of the UK’s response to the virus was discussed, decided to announce the next steps herself before the prime minister addressed the nation, before also adding her own special measures that would apply only in Scotland (not based, apparently, on medical expertise).The effect of this was obvious — to suggest that she was doing more to prevent the spread than the UK government, and in doing so, stoke nationalist sentiment that Scotland would be better off making its own decisions. That kind of political point scoring, and the need to be seen to be doing more, regardless of actual outcome, is the opposite of what the nation needs — at a time when calm heads and unity is required, Sturgeon has chosen to be reactionary and self serving.  What is coronavirus, how did it start and could the outbreak grow bigger?Coronavirus delay phase: How it will affect schools, the elderly and events in the UKShould I be worried about coronavirus?

The idea that you have a compulsory tax on the TV set sitting in the corner is dumb,” he told the Financial Times, calling the funding model “an anachronism”.The licence fee has existed since 1927, when it was a levy on wireless radios, and is now £154.50 per year. From this summer, over-75s will have to pay for it unless they qualify for Pension Credit.Other former BBC bosses believe that the corporation should drastically slim down in order to justify the fee.Mark Thompson, who stepped down as director-general in 2012, said the corporation needed to recapture viewers and listeners who have migrated to subscription services such as Netflix, and a younger generation for whom YouTube now has more brand recognition than the BBC.“If that means prioritising streaming and mobile services and making painful choices about existing linear TV and radio, so be it. The BBC has placed bold bets on the future before. In the interests of the audiences it serves, it needs to take the radical path again,” Mr Thompson said.Lord Grade, the former chairman, said the BBC must take “drastic” action to focus its activities. The corporation is desperate to attract younger viewers, after Ofcom warned that it is in danger of “losing a generation” to YouTube, streaming services and other media.It plans to plough millions more into BBC Three, the youth channel that has lost a significant proportion of its audience since moving online four years ago. At a Commons select committee this week, Lord Hall of Birkenhead, the director-general, disclosed that BBC Two’s Victoria Derbyshire Show had been axed because it was mostly watched by a male, middle-aged audience.“They are more male and older than you might think,” he said of the viewers.“They are mainly over-55s, and it tends to attract less women and younger viewers than the average for news programmes.” He added that the programme cost £3 million to make yet its television audience is only 300,000.At the hearing of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee, Lord Hall was told that he faced a “public relations iceberg” over the impending over-75s policy as he admitted that 90-year-olds could be hauled before the courts for non-payment.John Nicolson of the SNP, a member of the committee, told Lord Hall at the parliamentary session: “Imagine the reputational damage. The distress caused to these old people.”During the session, Clare Sumner, director of policy at the BBC, confirmed that over-75s may receive home visits from employees of Capita, the firm responsible for tracking down licence fee evaders.However, she insisted that they would be “support workers” specially trained to deal with the elderly. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/22/10/city-of-london-1.jpg","title":"banks investment transparency environment fossil fuels poll","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Half\u0026nbspdon\u0027t want their money to fund\u0026nbspfossil fuelsSeven in 10 people think banks and other savings providers should do more to show where their money is being invested, a survey has found.Some 70 per cent\u0026nbspof people would like to see more transparency from providers generally to show where their money is going, Triodos Bank said.Two-thirds of respondents did not know whether their money or savings currently go towards supporting fuels which may have an environmental impact, such as oil, gas or coal.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHalf\u0026nbspsaid they did not want their money to support fossil fuels, the survey of more than 2,000 people across the UK found.Earlier this week, it was confirmed in the Budget that the annual Isa allowance for the new 202021 tax year starting on 6 April\u0026nbspwill remain frozen at £20,000 for adult savers - but for child savers the allowance will see a significant increase.Created with Sketch.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearThe dramatic price fall calls into question the theory from some analysts that bitcoin had become a safe-haven asset in times of geopolitical instability.According to the theory, investors look to non-sovereign assets and currencies in order to safeguard their wealth during moments of global crises.Global unrest at the start of the year appeared to support this idea, with\u0026nbspbitcoin increasing in price by nearly a third in the first month of 2020.The latest cryptocurrency price crash, however, has mirrored the fortunes of traditional markets.\u0026nbsp“Bitcoin is a very young currency and does not have the volumes to act as a safe haven asset,” said Marcus\u0026nbspSwanepoel, CEO of London-based cryptocurrency firm\u0026nbspLuno.“However, as we head into a bear market we think investors will see the benefit of holding uncorrelated cryptocurrencies.”Whistleblower Edward Snowden was one of several prominent figures on social media suggesting that they might buy during the dip, with others dubbing it\u0026nbspthe greatest sale of the decade.Bitcoin has seen a strong rebound since reaching a low of $4,100, suggesting that some investors have sought to capitalise on the low price.\u0026nbspIt is currently trading at around $5,650, with an overall market cap of just over $100 billion.“The next few days will be crucial for cryptocurrencies to see if the sell off has bottomed out,” Mr Peters said. “Sentiment seems to be turning, perhaps off the back of investors tempted by the low prices of the likes of bitcoin.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Germany did something similar on Friday.Other countries are very likely to roll out their own schemes.The question is whether these schemes – never tested before – will be sufficient to prevent a spike in insolvencies and the inevitable ensuing redundancies.The post-financial crisis decade has been a bleak one for average wage growth.In the UK inflation-adjusted wages only recovered their pre-2008 peak at the end of last year.Things have not been much better for the median worker in the US on the wage front.Even if governments are able to prevent a wave of redundancies economists will already be revising down the expectations for real wage growth.Companies that are on the verge of insolvency due to a collapse in custom – or firms plagued by uncertainty about the general business outlook – do not tend to give above-inflation pay settlements to their employees.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Ordinary people may experience this as fuel and groceries being cheaper than normal.But if their incomes are under pressure from stagnant wages or from losing their jobs, price deflation will not translate into an overall increase in living standards.This week Italy announced that households’ mortgage payments to banks would be suspended after imposing its total lockdown on the country, recognising that if people cannot work they cannot repay their borrowings.Expect similar policies – with governments putting pressure on banks to offer forbearance for missed payments – to be rolled out in other countries that go down a similar route of lockdown or enforced social distancing.As with falling prices, though, this will not translate into a rising living standards because, although people might welcome a suspension of their repayments, they will also likely face damage to their incomes.It’s important to bear in mind how many households are already financially vulnerable.Around 40 per cent\u0026nbspof iniduals across the developed world countries of the OECD have insufficient money or saleable assets to support themselves at the poverty line for more than three months.“Many workers will have very limited liquidity buffers to tide them over if they cannot earn,” says Adam Slater of Oxford Economics.Their livelihoods may well depend on the willingness – and, crucially, ability – of their governments to provide them with welfare and support.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Normally, you will then have 14 days’ notice, according to Citizens’ Advice.What are symptoms of coronavirus – and where has it spread?Latest travel updates as coronavirus continues to spreadCan face masks really protect you against coronavirus or flu?The dirty truth about washing your handsA different kind of notice called a section 21 can be served without giving a reason. The tenant usually has two months to leave the property but the notice period can be longer.Landlords may be willing to make arrangements with tenants to delay rent payments but they are under no obligation to do so.  “If you’re struggling to pay rent, talk to your landlord straight away, says Rachael Gore, senior housing expert at Citizens Advice.“You should explain the situation and could ask for more time to pay or ask to catch up any missed payments by instalments. If you can’t come to an agreement with your landlord, it’s a good idea to pay what you can afford and keep a record of what you offered. You should get advice if you can’t reach an agreement because there is a risk that your landlord might try to evict you.A repayment plan means you\u0027ll make smaller payments to your landlord over a longer period of time. You’ll still have to pay everything back - but it could be easier than paying the full amount in one go.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

You could make the problem worse if you can’t keep up with your payments.Unfortunately, coronavirus has not changed people’s existing housing rights. In most cases, your landlord will have to give you notice and then get a court order in order to make you leave.If you decide to stay in the property past the notice period your landlord will need to ask a court to order you to leave your home. It is not known how a court would deal with case of renters who have fallen behind because of coronavirus.When the notice period ends, your landlord can apply for a possession order. They must apply to court within a year of giving you the notice. If they don\u0027t, the notice will expire and the landlord can\u0027t use it.Created with Sketch.Coronavirus fears lead to empty streets and shelves across UK Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The usually busy Royal Mile in Edinburgh is empty as people stay away from public areas amid the coronavirus outbreak on 13 MarchHo bart\u0027s Amusement Arcade in Westward Ho!, Devon is offering toilet roll and soap as prizes in grabber machinesAn empty platform at Farringdon Station in London the morning after the Prime Minister said that Covid-19 is the worst public health crisis for a generationShopkeepers Asiyah Javed and husband Jawad from Day Today Express, in Stenhousemuir, Falkirk are giving away facemasks, antibacterial hand wash and cleaning wipes to the elderly in a bid to stop the spread of CoronavirusA usually busy street in Cambridge is empty as people stay away from public areas amid the coronavirus outbreak on 2 MarchA hand sanitiser dispenser is seen inside the stadium during the Premier League match between Manchester United and Manchester City at Old Trafford on 8 MarchMaaya Indian Kitchen in Milton Keynes is offerig customers a free roll of toilet paper with every takeaway orderEmpty toilet paper shelves at a supermarket in London on 12 March A member of the public is swabbed at a drive through Coronavirus testing site set up in a car park in WolverhamptonA passenger wears a protective face mask as she travels on a bus in the City of LondonA Southampton fan wears a face mask before the match against Newcastle United on 7 MarchA loudspeaker placed in grounds of St Mary\u0027s Catholic Church in Broughattin, Dundalk, County Louth ahead of funeral mass later this morning.

You will probably also have to pay your landlord\u0027s legal costs.Only bailiffs appointed by the court can evict you from your home.If you have to take time off work and are not paid, or receive sick pay that is less than your usual wages, you might be entitled to claim benefits, or your existing benefits might increase. Seek advice if you currently receive housing benefit or tax credits, for example.“If you are employed and can’t work at home and you follow NHS guidance to stay at home for 7 or 14 days because of coronavirus you’ll be considered unfit for work, says\u0026nbspKate Smith, senior benefits expert at Citizens Advice. You will qualify for statutory sick pay (SSP) if you usually get it when off work sick.Statutory sick pay is paid for up to 28 weeks.“You can’t get SSP if you’re self-employed, says Smith. If you have paid national insurance contributions regularly for the last couple of years you could qualify for Employment and Support Allowance (ESA).The government has said new claimants suffering from coronavirus or required to stay at home can be paid from day one of the absence from work. Employers with up to 250 staff will be refunded by the government for up to 14 days of sick pay for employees off work because of coronavirus.The National Landlord’s Association said: “We understand and sympathise that some tenants may struggle to pay their rent where they are seeing a temporary drop in their income if they can’t work because of the coronavirus.In such cases it is essential that they inform their landlord at the earliest opportunity and try to work out future payment arrangements.“Where this creates problems for landlords with their mortgage repayments we would hope that lenders give landlords the same flexibility with payment holidays that they are offering to home owners.”Some high street banks have said they will help borrowers who are unable to meet their mortgage or loan repayments on time because of the impact of the virus. Landlords who find themselves in this position are advised to contact their lender.For more information visit Shelter\u0027s website:\u0026nbsphttps:england.shelter.org.ukhousing_adviceShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Across Europe, statutory sick pay averages 65 per cent of median earnings.The pandemic is also shining a light on the UK’s renting rules which give tenants fewer rights than in many other European countries.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Acorn argues that renters should be offered the same leeway.Prem Sikka, a professor of accounting at the University of Sheffield, said the government had provided “basically nothing” in the Budget to help the less well-off who may struggle financially because of coronavirus.“They said they would refund businesses for statutory sick pay of £94.25 a week for 14 days,” Professor Sikka said. “That’s not going to even cover the rent on its own.“A lot of families are in private rented accommodation. It is often overcrowded, they will find it impossible to self-isolate.“For council tenants there is an easy solution which is the government pays money for rent over to the council.“For private renters it’s more difficult – you have a whole variety of tenants from poor to posh. Help needs to be targeted at the poorer end.”He suggested doing this by using data the government already has on who is claiming in-work benefits.“The government needs to take charge and say, ‘We’ve asked you to isolate so we will help you.’”Another method of getting help to people that need it most would be providing an additional one-off payment to universal credit claimants, Pro\u0026nbspSikka said.“This kind of financial help will be very beneficial to the economy because those who have less money tend to spend all of what they have on goods and services.”Richard Murphy, a chartered accountant and campaigner who runs Tax Research UK, believes any private renters who contract coronavirus should be able to live rent-free for up to three months.He wrote in a recent blog post: “Far too many people have too few savings to survive major periods of economic inactivity without massive prejudice to their short-term and long-term wellbeing.”\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“Should the epidemic spread then as a matter of statutory right any tenant should be provided with a minimum three-month rent-free period to ease the stress upon them whilst this crisis lasts.”\u0026nbsp“I would suggest that the grant of that extension should be automatic to anyone who does not make a due payment of rent on the required date during the period of the epidemic. They should be automatically granted this extension by the landlord without having to make any further application or to complete any additional paperwork.”A government spokesperson said:\u0026nbsp“The government has always been clear that our priority is to put people first, which is why there is support in place to help affected people and minimise any social and economic disruption.“We’ve announced a range of measures to support people and communities, including a £500m\u0026nbspfund for households experiencing financial hardship and ensuring statutory sick pay is available from the first day people take off work.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We will be sharing all of the details in the weeks ahead.”The central part of Apple\u0027s WWDC event for the public is a major event, hosted by executives, during which it shows off new updates and products. It did not indicate exactly how that keynote or any other part of the conference would be structured under the online plan.The dirty truth about washing your handsWhat is the difference between Covid-19 and the common cold and flu?Can face masks really protect you against coronavirus or flu?The UK government\u0027s four stages of fighting coronavirus explainedWhat are symptoms of coronavirus – and where has it spread?Apple was yet to officially announce that it was holding the conference, but it traditionally takes place in early June and details are announced months before. As such, speculation had mounted in recent weeks that the company could be forced to pull the event, amid rapidly spreading coronavirus in California and official orders banning large gatherings.It now joins most other major technology companies – including Google, Facebook and Microsoft – in pulling its annual software conference in an attempt to stop the spread of the disease.Apple said it would give $1 million to local organisations around San Jose, where the event is usually held, to offset losses from the new format. The conference traditionally takes over large swathes of the city for a week as developers, the press and others fly in.This year will be the 31st of Apple\u0027s WWDC events, which are traditionally used to update all of its own platforms – such as iOS and Mac OS – as well as introducing new products. They bring together thousands of developers from across the world, leading to fears that this year\u0027s could help spread Covid-19 more widely.Created with Sketch.

Apple suggested that those same software updates and developer discussions will still go ahead, under the new online format.\u0026nbsp It suggested that all of Apple\u0027s 23 million registered developers will be able to take part in the virtual event.“With all of the new products and technologies we’ve been working on, WWDC 2020 is going to be big,” said Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering. “I look forward to our developers getting their hands on the new code and interacting in entirely new ways with the Apple engineers building the technologies and frameworks that will shape the future across all Apple platforms.”The company did not indicate whether the online format will mean the event is free.

Across Europe, statutory sick pay averages 65 per cent of median earnings.The pandemic is also shining a light on the UK’s renting rules which give tenants fewer rights than in many other European countries.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Many leaders feel it is the luck of the draw. The verdict feels as if it depends more on the inspection team than the framework.\u0026nbspNowhere near enough recognition is given to the context of schools and colleges which are doing great work in relentlessly challenging circumstances.“And, finally, the tone of inspections too often feels combative rather than supportive.”Sean Harford, Ofsted\u0027s national director, is expected to address the conference of headteachers in Birmingham on Saturday afternoon.An Ofsted spokesperson said: “We’re pleased that three-quarters of school and college leaders who were surveyed believe our new approach to inspection is an improvement.”Association of School and College Leaders\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It is about gaps in students’ knowledge from which they might suffer long-term disadvantages,” Mr Hillman saidThousands of\u0026nbsprequests for compensation and complaints have been logged to universities across the UK, the figures show.\u0026nbspIt comes after students have set up petitions calling for refunds.At King’s College London (KCL),\u0026nbspmore than 500 students had their tuition fees partially refunded because of the strikes. More than £640,000 was awarded to\u0026nbspstudents, ranging from £122 to £4,500 each.\u0026nbspAnd yet in other institutions, only a handful of students were given one-off payments. University College London (UCL) paid out just over £6,000 to eight students after they submitted complaints.Jess, a former UCL master’s student, said she sought compensation\u0026nbspafter she missed out on around\u0026nbsphalf\u0026nbspof her teaching time in her final term but her request was refused.She told The Independent: “The main impact it had was on my stress levels. It meant limited access to academic resources and less chance to see tutors.“This limited what we could confidently study and made me, and others, far more worried about the quality of our work.”The English graduate added: “It also created immense frustration because I’d saved for so long to attend and I essentially missed a big chunk of the MA I’d spent the money on.”UCL said refunding tuition fees in respect of industrial action is not part of its policy. Payments were made to students who complained they were\u0026nbspdisadvantaged without appropriate mitigation.\u0026nbspStudents at other universities, including Loughborough, Roehampton and Essex, did not receive tuition fee refunds but were instead offered “goodwill” payments for cancelled lectures and seminars.Essex University allocated £180 to students who had more than 17 teaching events cancelled during the\u0026nbspaction in 2018. Students who missed out on between one and eight events received just £40.\u0026nbspAnd Sussex University\u0026nbspestablished an ex gratia scheme to provide payments to students that suffered distress from strikes in 2018\u0026nbspand 2019. So far £1.1m has been paid out to thousands of students.\u0026nbspThe University of Edinburgh also set up an opportunity fund, made up from money not spent on salaries during strikes, which provided more than £1m to 4,410 students affected by industrial action.At Kent University, nearly 5,000 final-year students in 2018 were offered Amazon vouchers\u0026nbspafter the university received 500 complaints about disruption.Other universities, which have not offered any payments, said\u0026nbspthey have carried out other actions to mitigate the impact on students – including adjusting coursework and exam timetables.Students demand tuition fee refunds for fresh wave of strikesUniversities brace for compensation claims as 43,000 staff strikeStudents demand tuition fee refunds for planned university strikesSome institutions\u0026nbsphave used the money withheld from striking staff to go towards student mental health support.But many of the universities which responded to the request did not set out how they had minimised\u0026nbspdisruption or how withheld salaries would be spent on students.Jo Grady, general secretary of UCU, said: “Students have shown phenomenal support for staff throughout the strikes, and understandably want to hold their institutions to account for the disruption they have faced, so it’s no surprise they are seeking compensation.\u0026nbsp“Students should demand transparency from their institutions on finances and how pay withheld from striking staff is being spent – these are significant sums that should be used for the benefit of students and staff.\u0026nbsp“We would also urge students to put further pressure on vice-chancellors by asking what specific actions they are taking to help end the disputes and avoid any further disruption.”Nicola\u0026nbspDandridge, chief executive of the Office for Students (OfS), said: “We expect universities and colleges to do all they can to avoid disruption for students, and to minimise the impact of industrial action on their studies.\u0026nbsp“That means that they need to think about how best to make up for missed teaching and make clear to students how they will respond if examinations or assessments are affected.“We require universities and colleges to comply with our regulatory conditions during industrial action as at any other time. That means that they must do all they can to mitigate against the impacts of this action, and keep students informed at every stage.”A Department for Education spokesperson said: “Students rightly expect to get a good deal for their investment in higher education and in the event that any student was seriously affected by strike action we would expect universities to take appropriate action, which could include compensation.”A spokesperson for Universities UK said: “We understand that missed teaching time is unsettling. The specific approach to putting things right will vary by institution.\u0026nbsp“If students feel their studies have been negatively impacted and alternative arrangements are inadequate, they should complain through their university in the first instance.\u0026nbsp“If students are not satisfied with the response from their university they are able to escalate their complaint to the relevant Ombudsman for their country.\u0026nbsp“In some cases, students may be entitled to a partial refund or financial compensation. This would be where there is evidence of a breach of contract where the university has been unable to put in place reasonable alternative arrangements, for example.”University and College Union\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22.

It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.Could the collective energy caused by this event be the thing to awaken the dormant X-gene in human characters including\u0026nbspJames Howlett (Wolverine) and\u0026nbspMarie D’Ancanto (Rogue)?If so, the events of the Avengers films\u0026nbspcould be the catalyst to pave the\u0026nbspway for the X-Men’s arrival in the MCU.

And it now has a folding screenThe Samsung Galaxy Z Flip is the South Korean manufacturer’s second folding phone. The first was the Galaxy Fold, which was essentially a tablet that folded in half to be the size of a regular smartphone. Great if you want a tablet that’s pocketable.But the original folding phones of 20 years ago had a different purpose: to offer everything a regular phone did but in a much more pocketable form factor. And that’s what the Z Flip is aiming to do, as well.When it’s folded, the Galaxy Z Flip is the size and shape of – and everyone I’ve shown it to has said this first – a make-up compact. This doesn’t mean it’s only aimed at women, for sure, but it fits any bag or trouser pocket with ease. The shiny, gloss-black finish is highly attractive and also comes in a similarly opulent purple hue. The smooth feel, the manageable size and the curved edges make it highly tactile, something you can roll effortlessly through your fingers. Even the hinge, with the etched-in company name on the end, is pleasing to the touch.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOpen the lid and you suddenly have a large-screen phone, the 6.7in screen stretching across the entire inside face. Unlike almost every other smartphone, there’s a raised ridge around the entire display. That’s because although the screen itself is glass – yes, foldable glass! – to protect it, there’s a plastic film stretched tight across the glass and the ridge is what anchors it in place.Run your finger across the display and it mostly doesn’t feel any different to a regular screen. Until you hit the middle. There’s a crease there, which is unmissable to the touch. If light falls on the display, the crease is also visible. As you close the screen, the light coming from the crease is brighter.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

When you’re watching a video, there’s no image distortion as you might imagine. It looks like a regular OLED smartphone screen: sharp, colourful and vibrant.There’s a small screen on the outer case of the phone, next to the dual cameras. This tiny screen shows the time and some other notifications when you tap the little display twice.There’s a fingerprint sensor on the Galaxy Z Flip, situated in the power button positioned on the right edge. It’s fast and accurate.Opening and closing the phone requires a certain dexterity. You can’t flip it violently open like Captain Kirk opening his Communicator. I mean, you can, but it feels dangerous, like the thin phone might snap in two. It wouldn’t, but it’s part of the way you feel you need to handle the Galaxy Z Flip with kid gloves. It’s also not waterproof, as many flagships are these days – and the £1,300 price tag tells you this is a flagship.But the bottom line is this is a very enjoyable phone to use: the pocket fit is just great – it takes time to get used to how little space it takes up. The display is attractive and bigger than an iPhone 11 Pro Max, for instance.Performance is good, with a decent, though not quite top-level, processor ensuring that everything happens fast. The phone feels responsive and powerful.It also has good battery life, running for a full day with ease and charging quickly enough. It is wireless-chargeable and even has Wireless Powershare, where placing another phone against the folded Z Flip will charge the other handset. It works with any wireless-chargeable phone, from any brand or other gadgets such as AirPods Pro or Samsung Galaxy Buds.Cameras are a crucial part of every smartphone and the Galaxy Z Flip has three. On the display there’s a single 10MP lens which peeps out from the display, at the top in the middle. On the outer case there are two 12MP cameras, one wide and one ultra-wide. Other top-flight cameras often feature more than two rear cameras but the two here are perfectly good, just no match for the leaders in this respect, the iPhone 11 Pro and Huawei Mate 30 Pro.You can use the rear cameras for selfies, as well as the inside one. To see what the lens is looking at, you close the phone, double-press the power button and a preview appears on the little external display.This is a fascinating phone, offering something tangibly different from the rest of the phones out there, which are invariably flat slabs of glass and\u0026nbspmetal. It is easy to use and a great deal of fun.Inside Samsung’s pivotal struggle to deliver Galaxy FoldAfter just a week or so of use, the novelty of being able to put a big-screen phone into a small pocket has not worn off.But there are also compromises. It doesn’t feel as solid as most other phones – though those need to be protected in cases. Samsung has thoughtfully included a two-piece transparent case which clips on to keep the phone scratch-free.Will it last as long as other phones? The hinge is solid and feels like it will be long-lasting. But the display’s protective screen is less hardy and may sustain scratches.Samsung Galaxy Z Flip proves that a folding phone is an enticing prospect and, although there are concerns about durability, this phone largely succeeds.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The government will start a consultation on whether to grant local authorities more powers to tackle the issue.

Witnesses had told MPs that in some cases pavement parking caused disabled, vulnerable and elderly people to feel trapped, leaving some “afraid to leave their homes”.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A worker makes her way along rows of daffodils, removing any rogue varieties, at Taylors Bulbs in Holbeach, Lincolnshire.

This will look at a variety of options – including giving local authorities extended powers to crack down on this behaviour.”Huw Merriman, who chairs the Transport Select Committee, said there was “much to praise” in the DfT’s announcement, but warned that previous government reviews had not succeeded in improving roadside conditions. “This government has signalled an intent to finally deliver change. We now need a detailed timeframe from the Department for Transport to ensure this happens,” he said.Drive-thru coronavirus test station opens in UK car parkMan shot dead in row over parking spaceHowever, the AA has said that a total ban may have “unintended consequences”, potentially leading to more widespread “parking chaos”.Jack Cousens, head of roads policy for the AA, said: “We absolutely agree that people who park in an anti-social way should be penalised. Many drivers in narrow streets are tempted to partially park on the\u0026nbsppavement\u0026nbspso emergency services and refuse trucks can pass.”“An outright ban could lead to unintended consequences with\u0026nbspparking\u0026nbspchaos becoming more widespread. A better solution would be for councils to make a street-by-street assessment and where\u0026nbsppavement\u0026nbspparking\u0026nbspcould be allowed it be clearly marked and signed,” he added.

Within the communities that WaterAid works, they talked to women about their periods. The result is a revealing snapshot of traditions passed on from mother to daughter, as well as women’s own, often innovative, solutions..226 Nowana from Zambia, 45, fills a pouch with powdered cow patties that she uses during her period\u0027I mainly use cow patties to manage my periods, occasionally I use a piece cut from an old blanket. I only use a blanket if am home and not intending to go anywhere. But the cow patties I use at any time whether I am just home or I am travelling to different places.326 Powdered cow patties and the pouch Nowana would use during menstruation\u0027I would prefer pads to cow patties if I had a choice. They are easy and already made, they are disposable and don’t require a lengthy process like the one I go through when using cow patties.\u0027426 Hilary from London, 27, uses reusable sanitary pads to manage her period\u0027The environment is a big factor for why I use reusable sanitary pads. It’s about reducing waste. I use a combination of different reusable sanitary pads, cotton or bamboo, when I am on my period. A group of women in India makes some of them as a means of sustainable income. It is important to me that they are made of natural materials because I find it most comfortable and eco friendly. Fortunately, I am in the privileged position to think of comfort when it comes to sanitary towels.\u0027526 A reusable sanitary pad Hilary would use during menstruation\u0027I buy these pads mainly from independent stores, most of them are online only, that focus on sustainable products. Most regular stores don’t sell them. They are about 9 pounds for one towel, though the price differs depending on size and absorbency. 626 Lepera Joyce frpm Uganda, 23, showing her goatskin skirt which she uses when she is on her period\u0027Our village is a pastoralist community we have many cattle, goats and sheep. After slaughtering them, we keep the skins for use as bedding, clothing and also for managing periods. 726 The goatskin skirt which Lepera Joyce uses to manage bleeding when she is on her period \u0027I use this goatskin skirt because it’s always available it’s our traditional sanitary pad.\u0027826 Steph from Australia, 27, uses an IUD as well as tampons and pads to manage her period\u0027I have an IUD to help manage my endometriosis and polycystic ovary syndrome, which in turn helps manage my menstrual cycle as well.\u0027 926 IUD Steph would use during menstruation\u0027The Mirena means that I don\u0027t get a regular period, which is exactly what I was hoping for. Instead I have maybe 2 days of very light bleeding a month, it is quite random at the moment, but I don\u0027t find this difficult to deal with. I almost always experience pain before the bleeding starts, so I can predict my needs quite well. For any bleeding I do have, I use pads and tampons as needed. I also have some prescribed pain medication to help ease any symptoms that my cycle may cause.\u00271026 Munyes, 44, from Uganda\u0027During my period I find it easy and very normal to make a hole in the ground and sit on top of it for blood to drain in it. Whilst growing up, the mature women including my mum taught us the different methods of managing our periods, but I preferred this method of making a hole in the ground. 1126 Sangita from Nepal, 32, holds up a finished reusable sanitary pad\u0027Ready made pads are costly and if you do not dispose of them properly it will pollute the environment.\u0027 1226 A reusable sanitary pad made by Sangita\u0027When I got to know about the menstrual pad making training, I was curious. I never knew that there are ways to make homemade cotton pads in a well-managed way. The training was two days. The first day was mainly theory where we were told about menstrual hygiene management behaviour, measurement for the pad making, preparing paper cutting drafts. The next day was the practical where I made two cotton pads. Besides pad making, the training was useful because I gained knowledge on menstrual hygiene management. Before this training, I used to be very shy while talking about menstruation. But now I am not shy anymore because menstruation is a natural process,\u0027 says Sangita 1326 Limpo from Zambia, 22, cuts cow patties to size for use during menstruation\u0027I was born here and I have been living here all my life. My (extended) family lives in Kembi and we have all grown up here. I use cow patties to manage my period. I started using them along time ago just from the time I started having my period. I collect cow patties from the grazing areas for cattle in the plain and they are readily available. Sometimes I collect dry ones and other times I collect semi dry ones depending on the season. If it is wet season, I collect cow patties and stock them somewhere to make sure they are completely dry before use. In a dry and hot season like now, I find them already dry and all I do is pick and use.\u00271426 A cow patty on top of the cloth Limpo would useLimpo, 22, \u0027I do not put the cow patties directly on my skin, I wrap it in a cloth and place it nicely to capture the flow without staining other clothes. I like this method because cow patties soak up a lot of blood before they are completely soaked. I go about doing all sorts of things without any trouble.\u0027 Mongu District, Zambia, August 2018.1526 Claire from Manchester, 40, uses a menstrual cup during her period to reduce waste\u0027The one thing with the Mooncup is that it is more hassle. It needs boiling to clean it properly. We have a ‘Mooncup pan’ in which I boil it and sometimes I have to rush into the kitchen to stop someone from boiling an egg in it.\u0027\u0027I don’t find the moon cup as convenient to empty when I am out and about. I’d only be able to do that if adequate facilities are available, since you do end up with blood on your hands.\u00271726 Elizerbeth Chisale from Malawi, 54, teaching her grand-daughter, Mary how to make a sanitary cloth locally known as nyanda1826 Tamala from Malawi, 23, also uses a piece of cloth called nyanda during her period \u0027Cleaning the nyanda can be problematic for us and our families, particularly with issues of hygiene and sanitation.\u00271926 Nyanda, a small piece of cloth used as a sanitary pad in Kapyanga, Kasungu, Malawi2026 Women from Kapyanga sharing menstrual hygiene experiences, Malawi‘If married, our husband is not supposed to see any piece of cloth that we are using, so the rags are carefully secured in a small plastic bag which we hang on a top corner close to the ceiling in the bedroom this we do to ensure that our men do not have any close contact with that bag, even when we are not on our period. 2126 Doris from Zambia, 19, holds lint cotton she uses during menstruation2226 Saba from Islamabad, Pakistan, 18, cutting a cloth to use during her period\u0027I use cotton cloth to manage my periods. I get the cloth from home, from the clothes that we used to wear earlier and are now old and rough.\u00272326 A piece of cloth to be used as sanitary pad by Saba\u0027My mom told me to use cloth during my periods. I cannot afford to use sanitary pads.\u00272426 Lydia from Tanzania, 26, uses cotton sanitary pads when she is on her period\u0027I use non-reusable pads from a brand called HC. I find them very comfortable because they are naturally cold and I experience very serious menstrual cramps. When I put them on, the cold helps to take away the pain and I feel comfortable and more relaxed. I just buy them from a shop at a price that I can afford.2626 A sample of sanitary pads, known as cottons, sold in the shops and used by some women or girls, who are wealthier, mainly in urban areas of Burkina Faso\u0027With cotton, I feel more comfortable. Cotton is good but the only issue is that it can run out and that you can’t afford to buy more.\u0027From menstrual cup to cloth, menstruation skirt or homemade sanitary pad, WaterAid highlights the many and varied ways in which women around the world manage their periods.

I never knew that there are ways to make homemade cotton pads in a well-managed way. The training was two days. The first day was mainly theory where we were told about menstrual hygiene management behaviour, measurement for the pad making, preparing paper cutting drafts. The next day was the practical where I made two cotton pads. Besides pad making, the training was useful because I gained knowledge on menstrual hygiene management. Before this training, I used to be very shy while talking about menstruation. But now I am not shy anymore because menstruation is a natural process,\u0027 says Sangita 1326 Limpo from Zambia, 22, cuts cow patties to size for use during menstruation\u0027I was born here and I have been living here all my life. My (extended) family lives in Kembi and we have all grown up here. I use cow patties to manage my period. I started using them along time ago just from the time I started having my period. I collect cow patties from the grazing areas for cattle in the plain and they are readily available. Sometimes I collect dry ones and other times I collect semi dry ones depending on the season. If it is wet season, I collect cow patties and stock them somewhere to make sure they are completely dry before use. In a dry and hot season like now, I find them already dry and all I do is pick and use.\u00271426 A cow patty on top of the cloth Limpo would useLimpo, 22, \u0027I do not put the cow patties directly on my skin, I wrap it in a cloth and place it nicely to capture the flow without staining other clothes. I like this method because cow patties soak up a lot of blood before they are completely soaked. I go about doing all sorts of things without any trouble.\u0027 Mongu District, Zambia, August 2018.1526 Claire from Manchester, 40, uses a menstrual cup during her period to reduce waste\u0027The one thing with the Mooncup is that it is more hassle. It needs boiling to clean it properly. We have a ‘Mooncup pan’ in which I boil it and sometimes I have to rush into the kitchen to stop someone from boiling an egg in it.\u0027\u0027I don’t find the moon cup as convenient to empty when I am out and about. I’d only be able to do that if adequate facilities are available, since you do end up with blood on your hands.\u00271726 Elizerbeth Chisale from Malawi, 54, teaching her grand-daughter, Mary how to make a sanitary cloth locally known as nyanda1826 Tamala from Malawi, 23, also uses a piece of cloth called nyanda during her period \u0027Cleaning the nyanda can be problematic for us and our families, particularly with issues of hygiene and sanitation.\u00271926 Nyanda, a small piece of cloth used as a sanitary pad in Kapyanga, Kasungu, Malawi2026 Women from Kapyanga sharing menstrual hygiene experiences, Malawi‘If married, our husband is not supposed to see any piece of cloth that we are using, so the rags are carefully secured in a small plastic bag which we hang on a top corner close to the ceiling in the bedroom this we do to ensure that our men do not have any close contact with that bag, even when we are not on our period. 2126 Doris from Zambia, 19, holds lint cotton she uses during menstruation2226 Saba from Islamabad, Pakistan, 18, cutting a cloth to use during her period\u0027I use cotton cloth to manage my periods. I get the cloth from home, from the clothes that we used to wear earlier and are now old and rough.\u00272326 A piece of cloth to be used as sanitary pad by Saba\u0027My mom told me to use cloth during my periods. I cannot afford to use sanitary pads.\u00272426 Lydia from Tanzania, 26, uses cotton sanitary pads when she is on her period\u0027I use non-reusable pads from a brand called HC. I find them very comfortable because they are naturally cold and I experience very serious menstrual cramps. When I put them on, the cold helps to take away the pain and I feel comfortable and more relaxed. I just buy them from a shop at a price that I can afford.2626 A sample of sanitary pads, known as cottons, sold in the shops and used by some women or girls, who are wealthier, mainly in urban areas of Burkina Faso\u0027With cotton, I feel more comfortable. Cotton is good but the only issue is that it can run out and that you can’t afford to buy more.\u0027“Period products are essential products. Toilet paper and soap are freely accessible but because of sexism, period products\u0026nbspare not. When people are not able to access them, their lives are severely impacted. If you come on your period and don’t have a tampon or pad, it is not just that moment of panic, it’s the constant shame of leaking.”Ms Edlin, who is the founder of the charitable project Bloody Good Period, said she has talked to a woman who was forced to grab a tablecloth hanging on a stranger’s washing line to cope with her period due to not being able to afford products.The campaigner argued there is a massive stigma around\u0026nbspperiods due to\u0026nbspwomen’s bodies being deemed dirty and unhygienic. \u0026nbsp“If you go into a restaurant and there is no toilet paper, you go and tell the waiter,”\u0026nbspshe added. “It needs to be as casual as that to ask for period products.”How one teen’s period poverty campaign sparked change for schoolgirlsPeriod poverty is a widespread issue in the UK – with 49 per cent of girls having missed a day of school due to periods and one in 10 women aged 14 to 21 not able to afford period products.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We would be really hopeful this would be inspirational for other countries, including the rest of the UK. According to the research we have done, 91 per cent agree free products would help girls and young women participate in after-school activities.”Ms Primo said the bill sends a signal that issues which affect women and young girls are being taken seriously, and marks a key step towards creating a more gender-equal\u0026nbspsociety.Her comments come as Kate Forbes, the Scottish finance secretary, argued it is “unacceptable” that women have to fork out so much for period products. Ms Forbes lent her backing to the legislation.Tampon tax scrapped on all sanitary productsAmika George, who successfully campaigned for the government to provide free period products in schools and sixth form colleges, said she hopes the rest of the UK follows Scotland’s lead and makes period products free.“We are starting to see a shift in the way periods are being perceived,” said the 20-year-old, who launched the Free Periods campaign in 2017. “If it’s not prioritised here by government, we will certainly be looking into it.”\u0026nbspShe added: “It’s a human rights issue. Universal access is important because it will ensure that the needs of all genders are met in public places. There is such abject poverty in the UK, and wherever there are difficult choices to be made in families of how money should be spent, period products fall to the bottom of the list of priorities. Where it affects young children who end up missing school because they can’t afford to buy them, we know that the consequences of this are long lasting and can affect the entire trajectory of their lives.“While campaigning, and having had a number of conversations with school nurses, we know that girls have been really reluctant to admit they can’t afford pads or tampons. That’s a direct result of the stigma around periods, combined with the stigma around poverty. Girls would be reluctant to even admit to their friends that they can’t afford period products, and that’s a huge shame.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Or fully grown adults wearing replica football shirts  Or better still, bottled water — the real environmental scandal of our time.But cigarettes aside, Rishi Sunak’s first Budget as Chancellor ticked all the right boxes.In parts, quite a lot of parts, it sounded like a moderate Labour Budget.By which I don’t mean the kind of thing the wretched John McDonnell might have delivered — free unicorns for the poor and all people who earn money to be shot etc.I mean the Labour Party when it had an ounce of common sense.There was good populist stuff in there, especially the pledge to mend the potholes.I can’t be the only bloke who has had to fork out for a new tyre because of a hole in the road the size of the Isle of Wight.A lot of the Budget was, reasonably enough, directed at battling coronavirus.Help for businesses and sick pay for those who miss work and wouldn’t normally get it. And pretty much a blank cheque for the NHS.All of this was necessary, but it meant that much of the good stuff in the Budget got overlooked a little.This Government was brought to power by the votes of former Labour supporters in the North andthe North East.Parts of the country which, in the past, Conservative governments have left to rot.It took a lot to get those people to vote Tory — and they won’t do it againthere isn’t substantial investment in infra-structure for our northern towns and cities.The Chancellor addressed this. He announced a massive increase in capital spending.Some £billion will be spent investing in infrastructure.That’s the highest level in real terms since Clement Attlee’s excellent Labour government  years ago.We don’t know where it’s all going yet.If it gets swallowed up by the largely daft HS rail scheme, that will be a mistake.Sunak, though, knows the North East. He knows we need big investment to make these places attractive to business and to those who might move there.He knows too that we need to disperse high-paying jobs to the regions.So there’s going to be a new economic campus in the North and , civil service jobs moved from the capital to the regions.Excellent. This is what Boris Johnson means by “levelling up”.For too long London and the rest of the UK have been effectively two separate countries.So, the cigarettes apart, this was a fine Budget which should reassure those new Conservative voters that this government WILL look after their interests.And the latest opinion polls  Tories on  per cent.Labour way down on even its pathetic election share.So far, Boris and Rishi have not put a foot wrong.But here in the North we’re still watching, gentle-men. And hoping this is just a start.Fiddling with the constitution to ensure that he can remain president until . . . .That means he will have been president of his country longer than that chap he quite admires, Joseph Stalin.And will be  years old when he finally stands down.If he does stand down then.Unless it was with a qualying clause such as “hasn’t got very much”.The poor bloke has presided over a string of botched initiatives as a minister.I wouldn’t wish to be rude, but my suspicion is that a plaster garden ornament – a gnome with a fishing pole, or a heron – would do the job better.The hoarding of non-perishable food items, such as crates of Jack Daniel’s and tinned pies. You can’t be too careful.I suppose I also understand people buying hand sanitiser – asit had suddenly occurred to them that having clean hands might be a good idea.But what’s with the toilet paper  Is that really your first thought at a time of crisis  And the amount of the stuff people are buying!Lordy,that’s how many rolls they need, I think Covid- is the least of their worries.It’ll be the same when Armageddon comes, when the nukes are flying hither and thither.All the supermarkets will be stripped of vanilla-scented soft ply.“If I’m going to meet my maker, I will do so with a very clean arse.”They usually keep a bucket, or something, of the stuff outside the front door. It’s blessed by the monks, I think.Anyway they’ve discontinued the practice for a while to prevent the spread of this singularly annoying virus.And people are saying – well,it’s holy, it can’t possibly be tainted with flu virus, can it There’s one born every minute, isn’t there THE Labour Party is continuing its long and exciting journey from being a government in waiting to being a small organisation for the terminally deranged.Their latest act has been to suspend the last remaining sane member of the party, the excellent Trevor Phillips.He’s a lelong campaigner against racism – but has been suspended for being Islamophobic.He has never been remotely Islamophobic.If Phillips had been leading the Labour Party at the last election, we’d probably have a Labour government now.Instead, it was led by a rabble of anti-Semitic, far-left loons obsessed with identity politics and Palestine.I’M still not sure we’re doing the proper coronavirus checks on people flying back from their bloody skiing holidays in Italy.There are reports of many passengers receiving no checks at all.Surely anyone who has been to Italy should have been advised long ago to self-isolate – and inform the authoritiesthey feel poorly.I think we will regret not having done this.Well done British Airways for cancelling all flights to Italy. But will the checks be done on people travelling home by train It all seems terribly haphazard.

Both of those measures are aimed at preventing onward transmission.The third intervention, which will be introduced when the number of cases is starting to rise sharply, is to isolate those people who are most susceptible to developing serious illness, such as the elderly and those with underlying health issues.Stopping large gatherings this week would only have reduced the peak of the epidemic, when it arrives, by less than five per cent.If we banned people from attending football matches, fans might well watch the games in the pub instead where they may be more likely to be infected.For schools, we would need to shut them for at least eight weeks.What we know is, that for the first couple of weeks, the children might stay at home but people would soon adapt their lives.Parents might start to look after children in groups, which would defeat the purpose, and you would have taken key workers out of the front line to stay home with kids.If a child is in school, teachers will encourage them to wash their hands properly, which is critical.From my own experience, children at home in the holidays are a lot less likely to wash their hands so often.The idea of preventing visits to care homes has been raised.It wouldn’t matter whether it was coronavirus or seasonal flu — all care homes discourage visitors who are sick.Detailed work has gone into balancing the needs of the elderly.  Telling somebody who is , lives at home and doesn’t have support, not to come out is dangerous.We need to maximise the protection for them at the epidemic peak, which will come somewhere between ten and  weeks.Taking an elderly person away from others for such a long period could have a very damaging effect on their mental well-being.When we supported people ing from Wuhan in China into isolation we were ultra-cautious during our containment phase and asked people to isolate for  days, to check to see whether they developed infection.Our evidence isyou are infected you will usually show symptoms in five to seven days.Now. we are focusing on people who have symptoms we are dealing with people who have had the disease. After seven days and,they are feeling better, they will have built up some antibodies and will be safe to go back out.They won’t be infectiousthe symptoms have gone.There has been a lot of discussion about the notion of herd immunity but that conversation has gone a bit awry.Anybody who has been infected will build up antibodies and we think they will be immune.While the virus remains stable — and there isn’t a new strain — we don’t think they will get infected again during this season.Having an immune population is generally a good thing. But that is a natural by-product of an epidemic — it is definitely not the main feature of our planning. AS we face the biggest crisis for a generation in the fight to beat    Covid-  — following official advice is vital.Every area of our society is to be hit as the virus begins to peak.And advice is changing quickly, so here we bring you some key information across four of the very important areas.Do not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital.Testing is not neededyou are staying at home.The elderly  and those with underlying medical conditions such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease, cancer, MS and COPD are at increased risk.Use the   online  serviceyou feel you cannot cope with symptoms at home,your condition gets worse or you do not get better after seven days. Only call you can’t get help online.If you are staying home  keep at least two metres  from  others.Sleep alonepossible. Regularly wash  hands with soap and warm water for at least  seconds.Drink plenty of water and take  paracetamol and ibuprofen to help with your symptoms. If  self-isolating, don’t leave the house for a walk or go to public places or schools.Use  www.nhs.uk  coronavirus for info.HELP is there for workers who get the virus or have to self-isolate — but it ies.Some firms, typically bigger ones, offer full pay for those who test positive, and somestaff have to stay at home.Other companies provide the minimum statutory pay of £. a week set by Government.The good news is this is now from day one — until new coronavirus laws it was not until day four. The advice is to not go to workyou have a cough or a fever.Some such as store staff or drivers cannot. Brits who can work from home — such as office workers with a laptop — will be asked to do so.Those on a zero-hours contract can also get sick pay so long as you’ve earned an average of at least £ a week before tax over the past eight weeks.The self-employed need to apply for benefits.Many supermarkets have already put limits on essentials such as anti-bacterial gels, wipes, dry pasta,  UHT milk and  tinned veg.It is reasonable to have enough goods to last you a week while in self-isolation. Online delivery slots have been dficult to come by but it is worth booking ahead.Tesco and other companies let you sayyou are self-isolating on your order. Drivers cannot come into your home.TV cleaning expert Aggie MacKenzie recommends for a family of four for a week: A bottle each of bleach, handwash, disinfectant, washing-up liquid plus soap, eight kitchen rolls,  eight loo rolls.THE Government is now advising against all but essential travel to Northern Spain and telling British cruisers over  they should not sail.Disneyland Paris closes tomorrow until the end of the month. Walt Disney World, Florida,  and Universal Orlando are also shutting, as is Disneyland in Calornia.Airlines are reducing their flying schedules and some — including easyJet — are now offering passengers the chance to delay, rebook or cancel trips without any fee.Cruise lines including Disney, Costa, Princess, Viking, Saga, Cruise and Maritime Voyages, Celestyal and Virgin have cancelled cruises and other travel companies are suspending tours and trips.Malta says UK travellers will have to self isolate for  days on arrival.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailThe chair of the competition watchdog has welcomed a new law aimed at bringing down the price of school unorm.Lord Andrew Tyrie has told the Mirror that the Competition and Markets Authority has been asking the government to step in for years. He says the new law could help keep down costs for hard pressed families.A private members bill proposed by Labouraposs Mike Amesbury, which has secured government backing and is likely to become law, will force ministers to issue guidance to schools on the costs of unorm. In practice, that could mean ordering schools to stop relying on single suppliers of branded gear - a practice Mr Amesbury branded a monopoly. Tough-talking former Tory MP Lord Tyrie backed the change, saying: For many parents, there is only one place they can go to buy their child’s school unorm – because the school has made a deal with a single manufacturer or supplier.  These deals mean that parents have less choice, and may well face higher prices or poorer quality products as a result. That’s not good enough. It’s the job of the Competition and Markets Authority to make sure that people in the UK enjoy the benefits of competition and choice. And on this the CMA has been working hard for several years to make sure that hard-pressed families aren’t worse off. His remarks come after the new law passed its first hurdle in the Commons. The progress is a victory for parents and our sister paper the Sunday People after a Labour MPaposs Private Memberaposs Bill was backed by the government. Mike Amesburyaposs EducationBill passed its second reading unopposed, will now undergo detailed scrutiny in Parliament - and could take effect by the new school year. Lord Tyrie agreed that the law was necessary as years of guidance has not been enough to stop parents being ripped off.He said: Every year we hear complaints from parents about not being able to choose where they can buy school unorms. This suggests that the voluntary guidance from  doesn’t go far enough. By giving this guidance legal force, parents should have more choice and freedom to shop around and find the best deal for them.  Lord Tyrie set out three steps for schools to help reduce the price of unorms for struggling parents these include giving businesses the chance to compete so parents can shop around, reducing the number of items of unorm that are bespoke or need to be branded and making it easier for families to hand unorms down within the family or to other children such as by holding unorm swap shops every term. He explained: The larger the number of bespoke items, the more likely that schools will resort to exclusive agreements which harm competition and raise prices. Parents should not have to pick up the tab for this. Buying an unusual blazer is likely be more expensive than a navy blue one. But choice and competition can make both more affordable. He added: There is a risk that choice and competition is reduced, and the prices rise, where schools insist on bespoke unorm items. In these cases, we’d like schools to always use more than one supplier to avoid giving one business undue power over pricing.Where using a single supplier is unavoidable, schools should put the contract out to competitive tender to get the best deal and not stick with the same supplier for years on end. They can and should run regular competitions to appoint the best value provider.This helps families get better value for money. But branded clothing items often cost more money, so we want schools to think deeply about the hit to parents’ pockets before insisting on these.In parliament Mr Amesbury highlighted a damning Childrenaposs Society report which put average unorm costs at £ a year for secondary schools and £ for primaries. Tory MPs hotly disputed the figures, saying the Schoolwear Association had put the cost of compulsory items at just £ per pupil. One firm told the Mirror costs could be even lower - as it supplies a set including cardigan, jumper and trousers for under £. The Department for Educationaposs own research in  put average total expenditure on unorm each year at £.The regulatoraposs chair said that opting for cheaper unorms would not necessarily affect quality and it was more important to give parents the power to choose. Just because something is cheaper, it doesn’t always mean it will be lower quality, he said. But taking away the ability for parents to choose whether to buy a £ pair of trousers or a £ pair isn’t reasonable.Kids grow and clothes get torn, it’s part of being a parent, but parents should be able to decide what they buy and from where, and they shouldn’t have to pay through the nose.And he insisted that there was still a place for independent school clothing shops.The knowledge and experience of specialist suppliers will always be valued.  What we expect is healthy competition between all shops, Lord Tyrie said. That can give consumers real choice. Specialist and smaller suppliers need to be able to compete by emphasising their service, quality and price. Schools Minister Nick Gibb said he was pleased to back the new law adding: In future, when itaposs back to school time, families [will be] finanically reassured, not burdened.  It is a subject that crosses party lines and which will positively improve the lives of families across this country. Labour shadow education secretary Angela Rayner added: Parents have reported that theyaposve had to cut back on essentials like food to cover the cost for theirschool unorm.

It could take months before le s to normal. The coronavirus has already caused the cancellation of major sporting events, concerts and hundreds of flights. Local and mayoral elections have been postponed for  months. Many businesses will struggle to keep afloat as people stay away from shops, transport hubs and entertainment venues. This will be an especially anxious time for the self-employed and millions of sht and part-time workers who do not have the comfort of guaranteed sick leave and sick pay. The emergency measures announced in the Budget were a necessary first step but we may soon find they are insufficient. The Government’s approach may also need to change as the virus continues to spread. The priority should be to protect those most at risk and ensure the health service can cope with the exceptional pressures.  We should also remember those who could end up being unwitting victims. If schools close, millions of children will go without free school meals. Homeless people with symptoms of coronavirus are being turned away from shelters.

However, the joyful news has also been bittersweet as Charlie is constantly in their thoughts. The couple had to endure an agonising five-week wait to undergo a blood test which would tell themunborn child had the same mutant gene as Charlie, and another two weeksapos for the result.  It is mixed emotions. We always think about Charlie and we hope that he’s happy with us having another baby, but we’ll never forget him and love him just as much – always have and always will, Connie continued. Baby Charlieaposs case received worldwide attention in  when his parents fought a bitter legal battle to have him transferred from Great Ormond Street Hospital to the US for treatment. He was born with a rare genetic disorder, that caused progressive brain damage and muscle failure.  His parentsapos campaign attracted huge public support and among those to intervene were the Pope and US President Donald Trump .But despite this, they lost and Charlie was taken off le support on  July ,  aged just  months and  days. The couple became engaged in June , after Charlieaposs father fulfilled a promise made to his son hours before he passed away that he would always look after his mother.  Connie and Chris, a postman, say their grief will never die and they still visit their baby sonaposs grave almost every day. It was at his resting place, ten minutesapos walk from their home in Bedfont, south west London, that Connie decided to tell Chris that she was pregnant again. She says she had considered waiting until Christmas, but decided instead to take her blue pregnancy test with her on a visit last November, and hid it at the bottom of her bag. Chris said: After everything we’ve been through, I’m just looking forward to the simple things people take for granted – birthdays and taking our child to their first day at school. We just hope we can give this baby the best le possible. The couple donapost yet knowthey are having a boy or a girl, but say that after all they have been through, they donapost care as long as the baby is healthy.

Twitter user Betty Jatkins said: It is absolutely appalling and disgusting.

I feel truly sorry for NHS staff who will have to deal with the deadly aftermath.  She later added:I am still appalled that BBC thought it was appropriate to broadcast the comments of people at Cheltenham yesterday, who obviously thought coronavirus was a joke. Those people will be spreading the virus, endangering the lives others and increasing stress workload for the NHS.Another Twitter user replied: I totally agree. They came across as selfish,arrogant idiots.  Cheltenham organisers have come under fire for letting the annual event, which an estimated , people will have visited, to still go ahead. But Cheltenham racecourse’s managing director, Ian Renton, insists they took advice from the UK Government before making the decision to remain open. He told talkSPORT: We have been liaising closely with the government over the last fortnight and during the festival as well.

On Twitter, Prof Costello said: #xCDoesn#xt this herd immunity strategy conflict with WHO policy  After the announcement of this being a pandemic, Dr Tedros, Director General WHO, said #xThe idea that countries should sht from containment to mitigation is wrong and dangerous#x.#xD Prof Costello said the Government was arguing that allowing a proportion of the population to catch the virus and gain immunity #xCwill block a second peak in several months#x time#xD. But he tweeted a series of questions showing scepticism for the policy, including: #xCWill it impair efforts to restrict the immediate epidemic, and cause more infections and deaths in the near term  Evidence suggests people shed virus early, and those without symptoms may cause substantial spread...#xD He also questioned whether #xCcoronavirus cause strong herd immunity or is it like flu where new strains emerge each year needing repeat vaccines  We have much to learn about Co-V immune responses.#xD He said there was also an argument to see what happened in China, where the epidemic there has been contained #xCafter  weeks of intense national effort#xD. He added: #xCWithout an all-out national mobilisation plan for social distancing, are the UK government behavioural and nudge strategies really evidence-based to flatten the peak  Or simply based on models #xD Prof Costello suggested that #xCshouldn#xt we go all-out to snuff this UK epidemic out, with national mobilisation at all levels, using all possible preventive measuresand worry about herd immunity when we have more evidence #xD He continued: #xCVaccines are a safer way to develop herd immunity, without the risks associated with the disease itself.

That in itself becomes a protective part of this process. “This is quite likely, I think, to become an annual virus, an annual seasonal infection.” He added that the aim was to allow “herd immunity” to develop in the UK while protecting the most vulnerable from it. Some experts have questionedherd immunity is possible. Dr Nicola Rose, of the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, a Government body responsible for ensuring that medicines work and are safe, said it was too early to predict whether heard immunity would have any immediate benefit.  She said: “I thinkthe virus goes through a population, they may start to develop their own immunity, but it is too early to know what that looks like. “We are a long way from what we would technically call herd immunity.” Hanneke Schuitemaker, a professor in virology at the Amsterdam University Medical Centre in the Netherlands, said: “We may indeed see waves and we really don’t know whether there will be herd immunity or not in the near future. “We are trying to contain the outbreak as much as possible - this then gives us time for vaccines to become available so you would be able to get into a situation, like with flu, where you have a vaccine for the vulnerable population available in the future.” The current UK measures are that anyone with a cough or fever is advised to self-isolate at home for seven days. The devolved government in Scotland has advised against gatherings of more than  people. Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, said the measure had been taken to relieve pressure on the emergency services, not to slow the virus.  The next stage of the UK coronavirus battle plan would see the elderly told to stay at home and avoid socialising for up to three months during the summer in the hope of cutting deaths by a third. Entire families will also be quarantinedone member has a cough or fever. In other developments: *A patient who was suffering from coronavirus has died in Scotland, the country’s chief medical officer has confirmed. Dr Catherine Calderwood said: “I offer my deepest sympathy to their friends and family at this dficult time.” She said the patient had been being treated by Lothian Health Board, and was an older person who had pre-existing health conditions. *Health Secretary Matt Hancock has ordered anyone feeling unwell not to visit care homes. Advice issued to councils and care providers today said residents who feel unwell should be isolated in their rooms.  *A London Underground driver has tested positive for coronavirus. The man, who works on the Tube’s Jubilee Line, has been off work this week after ing from holiday in Vietnam. An internal message to staff said the driver, based at the North Greenwich depot, had been self-isolating. * Radio ’s Big Weekend will not go ahead.

Prince Charles and Camilla have postponed their spring tour and the Queen has suspended public engagements amid fears over the coronavirus pandemic. The -year-old monarch has called off plans to visit Cheshire and Camden, north London, as a “sensible precaution” after consulting medics. Charles, , and the Duchess of Cornwall, . Charles was due to fly to Bosnia and Herzegovina on Tuesday to commemorate the th anniversary of the genocide with engagements in Sarajevo and Srebrenica, before meeting Camilla in Cyprus on Wednesday for a three-day stay. It would have been the first official royal visit to Cyprus in  years. The tour was due to end with a four days of engagements in Jordan, highlighting the refugee crisis in the country. But a spokesman for Clarence House said: “Owing to the unfolding situation with the Coronavirus pandemic, The British Government has asked Their Royal Highnesses to postpone their spring tour to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cyprus and Jordan.” While the Queen, who will turn  next month, was due to visit the Bentley Motors Factory in Crewe, and the Jodrell Bank Observatory and Square Kilometre Array Global Headquarters in Macclesfield on March .  She was also due to visit Camden on March  but full details of the trip had not yet been released. A spokesman for the Queen said: “As a sensible precaution and for practical reasons in the current circumstances, changes are being made to The Queen’s diary commitments in the coming weeks. “In consultation with the Medical Household and Government, Her Majesty’s forthcoming visits to Cheshire and Camden will be rescheduled.” Other engagements for the Queen will be reviewed on an “ongoing basis”, officals added. A senior palace source said both the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall remain in good health and were saddened to have been advised to cancel their spring tour which they were very much looking forward to. Their team will now turn their attentions to determining whether Charles and Camilla can use the time to carry out some engagements in the U.K. The biggest travel insurance provider AXA UK is the latest to restrict cover for claims around the coronavirus outbreak.  While the insurance giant will still sell travel cover, any new policies won’t now pay outyour trip is cancelled or disrupted due to the virus. A statement on the firm’s website says that any new policy purchased, or new trip booked covered by an existing policy, after pm on March ,  will not cover any cancellation claim in relation to the coronavirus. This comes hot on the heels of a list of insurers who have limited or changed the travel cover they offer for those affected by the virus, including Aviva, the Post Office and InsureandGo. Other insurers have temporarily suspended the sale of travel insurance including LV, Admiral, Churchill and Direct Line. They all stress that existing policies will still work, but they are not currently taking on any new customers. This appears to have been prompted by the World Health Organisation declaration yesterday that the coronavirus was a pandemic. And a flood of people trying to cancel planned trips. Travel insurance cover has always ied widely with dfering levels of cover, exclusions and complex terms and conditions. So it’s important to read a policy carefully to find out what is covered and what you can make claims for. Gareth Shaw, had of money at Which , said: “Our concerns are being borne out with a large chunk of the insurance industry, including the biggest travel insurer AXA, suspending new travel insurance policies and putting coronavirus restrictions on existing ones. “Anyone planning a holiday should get insurance as soon as they book. If you haven’t already booked insurance and are travelling soon we urge you to seek appropriate cover immediately from a reputable insurer.  “It’s now even more urgent that the government, insurers and the travel industry work together to tackle the huge challenge posed by coronavirus, as the industry depends on people having the confidence to travel knowing that they will be covered.” Online grocer Ocado has banned its delivery drivers from stepping into people’s homes amid fears of coronavirus. Drivers have been ordered to leave shopping on doorsteps evencustomers are not self-isolating to reduce the risk of infection. Households will be informed when their items are being dropped off and after a knock on the door or ring on the bell, drivers will leave.

The Glaswegian monster, , who died in , never revealed where victim Keith Bennett, , was buried and relatives hope the cases could hold clues. Terry Kilbride, whose brother John was also killed by Brady, previously insisted: “There must be something in those cases.”Brady took his evil secrets to the grave as he died in “distress” gasping for air, the Daily Record reported.But with his final words, he ordered that two locked Samsonite briefcases should be taken from his bedside and handed to his solicitor Robin Makin. He had already insisted they should not be opened until after his death. The revelation at Brady’s inquest in September  gave hope of new clues to locate the body of Keith Bennett – the only victim of Brady and Myra Hindley never to be found. Keith’s mother, Winnie Johnson, died in  without knowing her son’s final resting place. But at the inquest his brother Alan, , insisted the child killer’s death had not meant the “end of the search”, adding: “Let Keith and the other victims be in our thoughts.”  Terry Kilbride, , whose brother John was another of Brady’s five victims, also previously said: “There must be something in those briefcases for him to go to those s to hide them away. “It’s all the hope we have for finding Keith.” And Terry West, , brother of victim Lesley Ann Downey, added: “I would like to know what’s in those briefcases. “Fingers crossed there might be ­something that would finally help us to find Keith’s body.”  Brady and Hindley were jailed for le in  over the killings of John, , Lesley Ann, , and Edward Evans, . In , Brady confessed to the murders of Keith and Pauline Reade, . That same year, he was admitted to Ashworth high security hospital in Merseyside and given the alias Ian Steel, the inquest heard. By the time of his death in May , he was an invalid. He suffered from emphysema, brought on by heavy smoking – a habit he kept up until it was banned at the hospital in . Five-and-a-half hours before he died on May  , he was found to be “laboured in his breathing and agitated”. But he summoned his remaining strength to make a final request. Dr Thomas said: “He asked for his solicitor to be notied and requested his locked briefcases be removed from his room.”  He was declared dead at .pm. The inquest heard he died of heart failure brought on by lung disease. Dr Thomas said Brady was a paranoid schizophrenic with an underlying “narcissistic and “anti-social” personality disorder, adding: “He was also thought to suffer from a number of deviant sexual ­disorders, to include sadism and paedophilia.” Brady would not engage with psychiatrists or take anti-psychotic drugs. He would verbally abuse staff and demand a move to a mainstream prison, but was refused.  Dr Thomas also dismissed Brady’s -year “hunger strike”. He said the prisoner was fed by a nasogastric tube up his nose but also took solid food and drinks. The doctor added: “Clinical teams regularly sought to bring an end to his reported ‘hunger strike’, recognising he was regularly accepting diet and fluids, alongside or substituted for his NG feed.

Sheaposs often praised for her hands-on approach to being a royal mum.  She told Express : “Kate’s parenting style can easily be described as modern. Alongside her own values, she’s obviously researched the best ways to bring up children in today’s society.“She displays a lot of parenting techniques that are current in the world of child psychology.” When speaking to George and Charlotte, Kate is often spotted getting down to her childrenaposs eye level and she often does this when greeting children he doesnapost know too. “She understands the importance of being on a level with children and not towering over them,” Ms Mercer said.  “This has been a trend in the last few decades, as psychologists have explained that it has many benefits. “It removes the fear of the parent while utilising eye contact and connecting with the child on their level. “It enhances communication, understanding and ultimately demonstrates love.” Ms Mercer added: “This demonstrates that the Royal Family does evolve with the times.  “When Charles was a boy it would have been completely out of character for the Queen to crouch down to talk to him or for her to show any type of affection in public.” But Kate is never afraid to show affection when out with her three children. “Ultimately there’s love, care and affection in the way Kate is raising her children,” Ms Mercer said.

Georgia Elisabeth Carney, , was stung by speed cameras multiple times on the M near Warrington, Cheshire, between junctions  and , where the speed limit had changed from mph to mph. In the space of two months last summer, she was caught travelling in excess of the mph limit  times - twice at mph.At Manchester Magistratesapos Court, Carney - who puts on beauty courses at salons - said a driving ban would cause her exceptional hardship because she wouldnapost be able to carry all her gear on public transport, reports the Manchester Evening News.

Magistrates accepted her aposspecial reasonsapos argument. Carney was hit with a £, fine and ordered to pay £ court costs. She was allowed to keep her licence, despite amassing  points - three per incident - for the offences. Carney already had six points. Defending Carney, lawyer Nicky Johnson told the court many other drivers were caught speeding on the same stretch between June and August .  “I understand this might cause some alarm considering the large number of offences in a two month period, and this may raise concern in the face of repeat offending with no regard for the restrictions in place,” Mrs Johnson said. “In the face of it, she wasn’t aware of the fact she had fully flouted the speed limit because of a delay in her receiving the summons. “The reason for that is because the vehicle she was driving in all of these offences is a leased vehicle, which she has been the registered keeper for, for a period of two years. “All the summonses were sent to the lease company and not directed to her in the first instance. That caused a delay.  “Regrettably, after further enquiries at Audi, they received a number of summonses and sent them back to the relevant road traffic unit, who then sent it to her mother’s address.” The court heard the bulk of the summonses arrived at the same time. Carney was not aware any offences had been committed. Carney was said to be ‘absolutely horried’ when she started receiving court letters. Mrs Johnson said: “Since the offences occurred, she was offered by one of the summons to take part in a road traffic speed awareness course, and she completed that in December last year. “She was proactive. “The majority of the speeds are under mph, had the speed limit been in place, it would have been fine. “Some are over mph, two of which are mph, which is mph over. “She accepts these occasions were when she was in a rush to get home from work and she apologises for that.”The self-employed beauty and nail technician puts on training courses across Greater Manchester and Cheshire.

The -year-old was pulled for more than a mile after getting entangled in the rope. Three teenagers deny murder. PC Andrew Shaw said his partner got out of their unmarked BMW when they came head to head on a country lane with the Seat towing the stolen bike.

As third and fourth in line to the throne, the Cambridge kids are very dferent to their friends - but according to other parents at their school theyaposre just like everyone  as soon as that bell rings. Both kids attend Thomasaposs Battersea, with George in Year  and Charlotte starting in Reception last September. Despite the initial excitement, Kate, William, George and Charlotte are apparently now just treated like everyone  at the school, and nobody gives them a second glance. But that means George and Charlotte are reportedly not allowed to have best friend, just like the rest of the kids, in line with the schoolaposs rules. Speaking about the school on Loose Women, journalist Jane Moore explained why Charlotte wonapost be allowed to have a aposbest friendapos at the school. She said: Itaposs a really great little school actually for the reasons I think that it really focuses on kindness, itaposs a really big thing in that school and the pastoral care is amazing. Thereaposs a policy thatyour child is having a party, unless every child in the class is invited you don’t give out the invites in class, which I think is quite a good thing as you don’t feel excluded.  There are signs everywhere saying be kind, that’s the ethos of the school. They don’t encourage you to have best friends. Thomasaposs offered a wide and ied curriculum , focusing on seven key areas of learning - Personal, social and emotional development, Communication and Language, Physical development, Literacy, Maths, Understanding the world and art and design. The schoolaposs website states: We believe that the Early Years Foundation Stage is fundamental in instilling positive dispositions towards learning.

A major overhaul of planning laws was announced on Thursdayas part of government efforts to deliver , new homes a year. Full details will be published in a white paper in the summer. However, it is expected that those who own detached homes will automatically be able to extend upwards by up to two storeys without obtaining planning permission. The move would eliminate the need for homeowners to pay planning fees and allow work to be done quicker, without waiting months for a decision, provided the extension is within a certain size. A consultation will define who exactly will be able to do so, with new laws in place as soon as the summer. Some limits are likely to remain in place for listed properties. In a bid to cut red rape, it is also expected the local authorities will be given new powers to use compulsory purchase orders to build on land which developers have failed to use. Announcing the measures, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said that home ownership seems like a dream out of reach for too many.  The simple truth is too many will be priced outwe donapost build more homes, he said, adding that the government is prepared to take aposbold actionapos to finally solve the housing crisis. We must think boldly and creatively about the planning system to make it fit for the future, he continued. The shake up aims to increase the number of houses in the UKaposs towns and cities by building upwards rather than on the green belt.

As they came together in what should have been a space filled with love, a gunman opened fire and  lives were lost. Brenton Tarrant is accused of carrying out the murders on March , . He has pleaded not guilty to all the charges against him and is due to stand trial this May. In an attack broadcast live on Facebook, a lone gunman armed with semi-automatic weapons targeted Muslims attending Friday prayers in the city. It was New Zealandaposs worst peace time mass shooting. Since then, New Zealand banned all military-style semi-automatic weapons and assault rles. And while the country is still recovery from the terrible events on that day  months ago, the stories of the heroic actions of those in the firing line is inspirational. Between  and  people had gathered at the Al Noor mosque for Friday prayers. A gunman marched into the building at :pm and opened fire, shooting dead the first man who had greeted him by saying hello brother. As gun shots rained down on the congregation, Naeem Rashid desperately tried to do all he could to save his fellow worshippers. The -year-old charged at the gun man and was shot. He tragically died later from his injuries. But his heroic actions gave others inside the mosque a precious few seconds to take cover or escape. Naeemaposs devastated we, Ambreen Naeem, said as soon as she heard about the shootings she knew her husband would have put up a fight. She explained: When I heard about the shooting in the mosque I was sure Naeem​ would not surrender easily to the terrorist because this is how I knew him. That day I lost two pillars of my home... exposing me and my two sons to the harshness of love. Following his death, Naeem was awarded the Nishan-e-Shujaat medal - the highest gallantry award a Pakistani civilian can receive. Naeemaposs teenage son, Abdullah, revealed a heartbreaking memory of his time with his father before his death. He added: Despite his lively and humorous side, in tough times he would be right there by your side. One night I was extremely sad, after consoling me he told me to close my eyes and imagine the happiest moment. I never told him this but it was just our family on the beach all by ourselves just relaxing in the sunshine. After leaving the Al Noor mosque the gunman then drove to the Linwood Islamic Centre. He was unable to find the front door to the building and began to shoot at worshippers through the windows. As he fired indiscriminately into the crowd, another hero emerged, Abdul Aziz Wahabzada. The -year-old Afghan refugee has been widely credited with stopping the attack. He grabbed a credit card reader and ran out of the mosque. Abdul hurled the credit card reader at the gunman as he was ing to his car to get another weapon. The shooter managed to get another gun from his car but Abdul was determined to do all he could to save lives.

China has sent ventilators, masks and some of its experts to Italy to help them battle the deadly illness, as their death toll rises at a terrying rate, and scientists have been sharing information around the globe. Despite the common enemy, dferent governments are dealing with it in very dferent ways, largely due to the stage of the spread they are at. China and Italy are among the countries where the death toll is already in four figures, so have some of the most extreme restrictions in place. The UK The UK has now officially entered the aposdelayapos stage of our plan to fight the spread.Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Thursday that England, Scotland and Wales have moved on from the aposcontainapos stage, warning that many more families will lose loved ones.As of am today, a total of , people had been tested. Ten patients who tested positive in the UK have died.  Anyone who has come into contact with a person diagnosed with the virus is being asked to self-isolate for  days, eventhey have no symptoms. This involves staying indoors and avoiding contact with anyone  at all times. Anyone who has any cold symptoms, eventhey are mild, are also being asked to self-isolate - but for seven days. Schools are remaining open, but many companies are asking their staff to work from home.  UK residents are being asked to wash their hands for at least  seconds using soap regularly. America The advice in America is very similar to that in the UK, with people being urged to wash their hands, avoid close contact with people and stay at homesick. Anyone who is sick is being asked to wear a facemask when around other people.President Donald Trump has suspended all travel between Europe and the US, except the UK, for  days.He has said the US will monitor the situation to determinetravel could be reopened earlier.  Mr Trump said we are marshalling the full power of the government and private sector to protect the American people. Italy Italy has been the worst hit country in Europe, with coronavirus claiming the lives of more than , people. As a result, the whole country is in lockdown and a national quarantine has been imposed. People are being advised not to go outside unless itaposs absolutely vital, restricting the movement to work, health and other essential reasons. The country has closed almost all shops except food stores and pharmacies.  Bars, restaurants, Gyms, schools, museums and hairdressers have also been closed. Spain Parts of Spain are in lockdown, with the country officially in a two-week state of emergency. Nightclubs, pubs and discos in Ibiza and Majorca have been ordered to close, along with gyms and sports facilities, casinos and game rooms as doubts are cast on Britonsapos spring and summer getaways. The Balearic government has also ordered bars, restaurants, theatres and cinemas to reduce their capacity by at least a third.  Residents have been instructed to stay at home for the next  days. Drastic measures are being taken by the regional governments in Barcelona and Madrid. The state of emergency was declared by Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez  after Spainaposs death toll jumped to  and infections increased to ,, the fth highest total in the world and the second highest in Europe after Italy. The state of emergency allows Spain to confine infected people and ration goods, and bring in the military for ious rolesneeded. Madrid is forcing restaurants, bars and non-essential shops to close from Saturday. Only supermarkets and pharmacies will be allowed to remain open. France Elderly people and anyone with health issues are being told to stay at home. Nurseries and schools will be closed for  days in some areas.  Major sporting events have been cancelled and visits to retirement homes have been banned. President Emmanuel Macron said forthcoming local elections would still go ahead and public transport would continue to operate. The state will take on the salaries of those who have to work from home and taxes due in march will be postponed. China As the worst hit country in the world, China is taking an aposiron gripapos approach, which has seen tens of millions of its . billion people quarantined. However early signs show the tough restrictions are working, with the daily number of new cases beginning to drop.

Picking up on the left of the penalty area, he squared up Paul Watson but could only swerve his effort wide four minutes before the interval.Just a minute later, United looked in as Shankland stood up a ball for McMullan to attack in the six-yard box but Daniel Harvie was able to get back in and clear off the line with Doohan stranded.Harkes was at the centre of what United did well in the opening moments of the second period, forcing a corner with his deep cross and making a late run into the box in an attempt to race onto Bingham#s through ball.On  minutes, Dillon Powers, useful at set-plays all night, found Mark Connolly at the back post with a deep free-kick but the Irishman#s header across the box had no takers.Just after the hour-mark, Kelly fired a dipping free-kick over the bar for the hosts # their first chance of the half.On  minutes, Sam Roscoe acrobatically hooked a half volley over the bar as Ayr grew into proceedings once more.Harkes was again clear for United as the goal opened up for him moments later. Played in by McMullan on the left of the box, the American could only slash wide with just Doohan to beat.Entering the final quarter of the game, United were still struggling to break down a rigid Ayr defence.Haring through surrounded by a glut of white shirts, Shankland perhaps should have slipped in a freer Peter Pawlett, only just off the bench, but elected to go it alone and was crowded out.Boss Robbie Neilson erred on the side off caution by replacing McMullan with Robson on  minutes after the winger went down with cramp.Drinan smashed an effort wide for the home side two minutes later, before Jordan Houston tested Siegrist with a header.Drinan again powered a drive just over the United crossbar with nine minutes remaining before Harvie fizzed an effort wide.In the final minute, Drinan could only drag a shot across the ground and straight into the grateful arms of Siegrist as third-placed Ayr went for the kill.The Tangerines, too, pushed for a late winner late on but it never came as they enter the final round of fixtures still out in front.Ayr United XI : DoohanHouston, Bell , Roscoe, Harvie Kerr , Muirhead McCowan , Kelly, ForrestDrinan.Subs not used: Hare-Reid , Smith, Gillespie and Murphy.Dundee United XI : SiegristSmith, Watson, Connolly, ReynoldsMcMullan , Powers, Harkes, Appere Bingham , Shankland.Subs not used: Deniz , Sporle, Glass, Freeman and Neilson.Referee: David Munro.Att: , ."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/03/2.51292315-1-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/03/2.51292315-1-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/03/2.51292315-1-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/03/2.51292315-1-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"broughty ferry health centre closing for a week due to coronavirus","story":"Broughty Ferry Health Centre has closed with immediate effect until next week after several patients reportedly tested positive for coronavirus.In a statement published this evening, NHS Tayside said the measure was being taken as a precaution, and stressed that the risk to other patients and workers at the centre was low.The Brown Street centre will continue to take phone calls from patients, and will ert locals who need GP appointments to other surgeries or to telephone consultations.It will reopen on Thursday at the earliest.

He was being interviewed for the Northern Goal podcast.Reacting in real time on the north of Scotland football show, Cormack said: “My reaction to that is, it’s a sensible thing to do.“The joint group of the SFA and SPFL are talking to the Government and health authorities as well.“It was inevitable, whether it was Monday or today.“I just think we need to take a deep breath, take stock of the situation and hopefully this is a -day or -day thing where isolation helps to break the spread of the virus.”Atlanta-based Cormack – who was to fly back to the United States today – is confident the SFA and SPFL have taken the decision based on talks with politicians and medical experts, and not in response to other countries announcing postponements.Cormack added: “I imagine they’ve made this decision on their own.”There are worries a prolonged shutdown could hit some Scottish clubs in the pocket, with dire consequences.Cormack says the Dons are on a strong footing and it’s important the burden of mass gatherings, like at football matches, is taken off the emergency services.He added: “At this time it’s important to have calm heads and leadership.“We’re in a fortunate position at Aberdeen where we’ve got no debt and cash in the bank.“I don’t know the inidual circumstances for the other teams, but this is an important part of the year because it’s when season tickets go on sale and money starts to come in.“It’s important the SFA and SPFL get with everybody to see where everyone is.“But we have to go through this. The only way to take the burden off of the healthcare system is to have people isolated.”The chairman, like everyone  at the present moment, didn’t have an answer to the secondary concern of how the Scottish Cup, which Aberdeen are still in, is decided, as well as the final Premiership standings,the season ends here. He said: “It’s a good question – but how long is a piece of string  How long does this thing go on for ”All Aberdeen’s first team and staff, having spent the last few days in relative isolation at Cormack Park, can do now is wait out this indeterminate period.Cormack, meanwhile, should now be on his way back across the Atlantic.The journey home has posed problems, with the US Government banning arrivals from the  Schengen Area European states.Cormack, who feels his latest trip back has been worthwhile, said: “I’ve been back for three weeks now. What’s been really helpful is finalising some of our strategy on and off the field.“Some of these new initiatives about fan engagement and atmosphere.”"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor january 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,in  The Argyllshire Advertiser ran a story entitled #Skate park pipe dream a reality for Lochgilphead#. Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"ormsary man in oman endurance event","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAn Ormsary man is about to embark on the challenge of a letime as he cycles over ,km in a bid to be crowned BikingMan Oman .Lindsay McCrae, , will be one of only  cyclists to take part in BikingMan Oman, part of a series of ultra-endurance cycling events where competitors test their limits of strength and stamina.In , Lindsay bought a road bike through his employer#s cycle to work scheme and what started out as an active commute with a few local races thrown in for fun, soon became an opportunity to challenge himself in some of the toughest races on two wheels.His first big win came in the gruelling City to Summit duathlon from Edinburgh to Ben Nevis. The race was a half marathon of road running, km ride through Glen Coe then back on foot for the final off-road marathon summitting Ben Nevis and finishing in Fort William.Bitten by the cycling bug, he went on to win Revolve  at Brands Hatch race circuit, completing  miles and ascending , feet in  hours. Adding a second-place finish in last year#s BikingMan Portugal event against some of the sport#s top athletes means Lindsay has truly made his mark on the endurance scene.Lindsay said: #In my first few races I just wanted to see how I would get on but now I#m definitely in it to win it. I think I#m just stubborn and that#s what keeps me pushing on when other people take rest breaks.#Lindsay, who works in sales technical support for an aquaculture equipment company in Inverness, fits his training around his job, spending one to two hours on a turbo in his garage three or four times a week, with longer rides of two to five hours at the weekends. His father#s greenhouse in Ardrishaig proved to be a useful training venue to shelter from the elements over the Christmas holidays as he prepared for his biggest challenge yet.The BikingMan Oman race starts in Muscat, Oman#s capital city, before heading out on the Arabian Peninsula, through the Hajar Mountains, across the Ash Sharqiyah Desert and along coastal roads back to the capital. The competitors will climb over m during the race, that#s the equivalent of climbing Ben Nevis almost seven times.Unlike cyclists on the Tour de France, BikingMan athletes are unsupported so must carry all their food and equipment with them.For Lindsay, one of the biggest challenges will be the weather. #Temperatures at the moment are around - degrees but can reach higher which can be dficult to manage on the steeper sections of the course. That#s where my nutrition and hydration strategy will need to be spot on.#But in case it all sounds like hard work, Lindsay highlights one of the main benefits of his high-octane adventures: #The best part is definitely refuelling after the race. I will burn about , calories over the -hours of my target time, so my recovery will mainly involve eating cakes and other calorie rich foods.#Lindsay grew up on the Ormsary Estate and attended Lochgilphead High School. His family still live in the local area and will be following his adventures closely over the five days of competition.The race takes place from February  to  and Lindsay will cover ,km in a bid to take the title."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

There were, however, large sections of the stages still swathed in snow and ice, making conditions changeable to say the least.Lochgilphead#s Alister MacArthur was back in the forests, after a two-and-a-half year break, in the MR Motorsport prepared Talbot Sunbeam. Co-driver Claire Tilley, from Craignure, Mull, had only completed one event prior to this in the car and that was on tarmacadam and mostly in the dark of Mull Rally. Gravel, snow and ice would be a whole dferent concept in the powerful rear wheel drive car.The car has seen development over the past season and the five stages ahead that day would be as much a test as a genuine attempt to score points.However, after a relatively clean run through the  miles of Stage  # the stage that claimed a large number of competitors due to the slippy conditions # thoughts quickly turned to getting up the leaderboard and grabbing as many championship points as possible.The crew had made it to the afternoon sitting in th place overall and a very quick run through Stage  saw them climb to st. Drama nearly robbed them of a great result when the alternator stopped working and the battery started to go flat in the last  miles of Lochletter , with Alister switching off all but the bare essential electric components to try and make it to the finish. Finish they did and in nd place overall and third in Class . A brilliant start to the new season.Also heading north to Inverness to compete was Ian Parker, whose normal seat in the MkII had been withdrawn as the car wasn#t ready. He had a late call to co-drive for Linzi Henderson in her Ford Fiesta but they were one of the unlucky crews to slide off the road in Stage , only a mile from the start, spectacularly attempting to knock down some trees in the process.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was out in the Subaru Impreza of Graeme Sherry in what is slowly becoming a weekend habit # one which has his mother watching nervously from the wings.

member for Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale has resorted to Freedom of Information requests in a bid to get answers.A row erupted last month between the Conservative-led administration at Scottish Borders Council and the SNP government at Holyrood over funding for a replacement school.Claims by council leader Shona Haslam and education portfolio holder Carol Hamilton that the Scottish Government had rejected a plea for help was angrily refuted by both Ms Grahame and the Cabinet Secretary for Education, John Swinney.It emerged that no formal request for financial assistance had been made to the Scottish Government ahead of the claims being made.And it was several days later that Councillor Haslam eventually sent a letter - not in her role as council leader but as a ward councillor for Tweeddale East.Details of funding for a replacement Peebles High have remained sketchy with pound million being required to plug the gap between an expected pound million insurance pay out and the estimated demolition and rebuild costs of around pound million.Over the past few weeks Christine Grahames attempts for further clarication over funding from the council leader has been met with the cold shoulder.Ms Grahame told us: \"I have asked a number of follow-up questions to establish how plans for Peebles High would be progressing, however Councillor Haslam has now responded to say that she is not prepared to answer my questions.\"At the heart of this is the question of getting a proper replacement for Peebles High School that serves the school community properly.\"The issue should never have been made party political and I remain hugely frustrated that Councillor Haslam decided to issue a press release attacking the Scottish Government on February , apparently before any request was even made.\"How does trying to score cheap points against the SNP with a factually inaccurate press release serve the school community or indeed foster a co-operative approach between the council and the government \"It is behaviour that, frankly, should be beneath a council leader.\"Although Scottish Borders Council claim their decision to impose a record hike in council tax from next month is to help fund a new replacement school in Peebles, it is expected that money will still be required from Holyrood.But government officials have yet to receive any request from Newtown St

Four years later, she married her half-cousin, Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, and in June  they had a son, James.In , her second husband was murdered.

She sought the help of Queen Elizabeth I of England, but Elizabeth thought she was a threat to her own throne and she imprisoned Mary in a series of English castles and manor houses.In , after more than nineteen years in custody, Mary was beheaded for plotting to assassinate Elizabeth.What will you see The house sits in attractive gardens which are home to some of Jedburghrsquos famous pear trees, descendants of the original pear trees planted around Jedburgh Abbey in the early s.Inside the towerhouse, a display of paintings, artefacts, and textiles associated with Mary explores not only her le and times, but the cult that has grown up around her.The period feel inside the house has been preserved with thoughtful design, which allows the story of Maryrsquos le to be told in an engaging way.The Rogues Gallery introduces the iniduals in the drama of Maryrsquos le, while the Last Letter Room reveals her final thoughts before her execution.VisitingThe museum is situated on Queen Street, near Canongate car park, where parking is free.

Keith Mitchell picked up the ball on the left and released McFadyen down the left flank, from where he produced a fine low cross which substitute Donald McCallum struck low into the Neilston net with his left foot to make it -.But with some  minutes to play and the Pupils cruising, Neilston halved the deficit, a visiting striker gambling on Ferguson’s kick, and blocking it, the resulting break of the ball landing in his path for an easy finish, providing a leline to the men from East Renfrewshire.But their hopes of an equaliser would quickly fade, after a Neilston player-coach – already booked on the touchline for dissent ­– was sent off for a foul on Mitchell within a minute of entering the field of play.The same player then proceeded to throw a running punch as he left the field, before both teams became embroiled in an on-pitch melee.After the fisticuffs fizzled out, the game of football resumed and a healthy Kintyre Park crowd watched a settled final  minutes of action as the Pupils did enough to seal a welcome three points, over the team they had beaten on the road in front of the BBC Scotland cameras a month previously.Finally, midfielder Ryan Gilchrist, enjoying a regularto first-team action, was given the man-of-the-match award, with the creative energy of McFadyen another highlight for the Pupils.Tomorrowthe Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils travel to Busby on league duty, with kick-off at pm.

Aside from the occasional draught which we could dodge by retreating to the back room, it was wonderfully toasty. This was in large part thanks to generous neighbours above and below whose central heating kept us permanently cocooned.In the country, as I quickly learned, in winter there are two main subjects of conversation: weather and warmth, but the greater of these is warmth. Hoolet, like many villages around here, has no gas supply, so central heating runs either by electricity or oil. The topic of electricity bills leads to much sucking in of breath, although there was one couple whose house somehow escaped the notice of the electricity board.Only when they sold up and the new owners found they werenrsquot being charged did it become clear why there had always been such a blazing array of Christmas lights in this particular garden. Rumour has it that, years earlier, a woman in this area greased a palm and had her meter erted to a lamp-post. It took a while before the extraordinarily high reading was finally noticed and an investigation began. Soon she was tracked down, along with her cannabis plants.The day is approaching when wersquoll all have to switch to renewables, but in the meantime our radiators drink oil. Every few days I check the gauge on the tank in the garden, half-closing my eyes as I pull out the pin and watch it drop one inch, then two. Since it can take over a week between ordering and getting a refill, you have to estimate how long it will last. If nothing , becoming aware of every drop of oil you use does mean that, while itrsquos the least environmentally friendly of fuels, it is never squandered. One friend is so thrty her grandchildren have renamed her house The Baltic.Long before, and after, they became fashionable, everyone around here wears a gilet. People only come to their doors in a tee-shirttheyrsquove been interrupted in the process of layering. I was watching a western the other night and saw a tobacco-spitting rancher on his porch, rle under his stained armpit. What caught my attention was his long-johns, the sort that reach from ankle to chin to wrist, with buttons down the front. Theyrsquore exactly what I need.Other than the relief of seeing the orange lights of the oil tanker arriving in the pitch black of a winterrsquos morning, there is nothing interesting about oil. Our other source of heat, however, is wood-burning stoves, and on this subject I could win Mastermind. We have two, which possibly saved my husbandrsquos le. When the Beast From the East descended on Hoolet, he was left with a gaping hole in the kitchen wall where the boiler had been taken out moments before the blizzard started. The heating engineers fled to get over Soutra Hill before they were snowed in, and his ordeal began: two log fires and two hot water bottles to get him through five days until the roads reopened. When he went into the kitchen to cook dinner, he had to wear hat and gloves as well as his puffa jacket.There is nothing more comforting in the cold than a roaring fire. In rural parts this is not a lestyle choice but an absolute necessity. Of an evening we get through about five logs, which is enough to keep a large room really cosy. When we started out, we were so ignorant wersquod never even heard the phrase ldquokiln dried and ndash Irsquom going beetroot just thinking about it ndash we bought logs in bags from BQ. Now, having found a good supplier, and with our own woodstore, the first thing we notice as we drive around the area is other peoplersquos woodpiles.Some are works of art, high as a gable end and stacked so expertly theyrsquore as solid as drystane dykes. A few keep them in a ramshackle heap, out in the open, where they soak up the rain. Quite apart from the level of emissions wet wood produces, which is why itrsquos high on the governmentrsquos hit-list, it is far less efficient, generating less warmth and more smoke. Butyoursquore patient, green wood dries out ndash Irsquove heard you should wait two years for anything yoursquove cut down yourself. My father would have scoffed at that, as hersquod bring the car to a sudden halt, nip out and drag a huge storm-tossed branch into the boot ndash ldquotidying up the countryside as he put it. Back home, he stoked the flames so high we had to push the furniture back against the walls and open the living room door.The other day we had a delivery of ash, dumped in front of the house in a crate big enough to hold a wild boar. As the lumberjack was in bed barking like a sea-lion, it fell to me to deal with it. I was well on my way when Lazarus rose from the duvet to check on the proceedings and pointed out that I was laying them sideways rather than end-on. As the sun disappeared and clouds gathered I started again. By this time a neighbour had spotted me, and helped me finish the job.The sense of satisfaction in having it all safely stored, shortly before snowfall, was incalculable. Thatrsquos the thing about wood. The connection between you and the trees yoursquore burning creates a new respect and understanding. For a start, freshly chopped logs give off a delicious scent. And each one is dferent ndash whorled, fissured, misshapen, or neatly wedged like a giant slice of cake. If you chose to count the rings yoursquod see how many years had gone into making a blaze that lasts only a few hours."},{"url":null,"title":"can-anyone-see-happy-ending-ferry-tales","story":"We cannot know what effects will linger from the experience of the past few months and those to come.

The tourist board punts it as ldquoScotland in miniature but a better tag might be ldquoLike Vancouver Island, but closer.: Further ferry delays fearedNot only do Scots make good use of it, we recommend it, and indeed the rest of Scotland, wherever we go in the world. Yoursquoll have a great time, we tell people. To that we should add ldquoas long as you go at the right time.As far as travelling to Arran goes, now is not the best of times. It emerged this week that due to a fault with the mooring equipment ships can no longer berth safely in bad weather. According to CalMac the repairs could take up to six weeks, which runs right into the peak Easter holiday period.Why will it take so long  Because CalMac needs to source spare parts. If the parts were so essential one might imagine they would be held in stock, but that is to assume a level of efficiency that is proving beyond the service operators and their ultimate bosses, the Scottish Government.The latest problems take place against the backdrop of spiralling costs and y delays in the delivery of two new ferries. Vessels that should have cost pound million are now priced at more than double that, and they will not be in operation till  at least.Gavin Fulton, chair of Arran Ferry Action Group, has described the situation as ldquoa shambles. He told The Heraldrsquos reporter Martin Williams that patients on the island were having to spend up to five days on the mainland just to get to a hospital appointment and back.ldquoThings are going from bad to worse for us and there is no contingency plan, he added. ldquoThere is no word of chartering a boat, or to buy one abroad. It is a case of waiting  months for a new ferry and we have to put up with it.Mr Fulton is not alone in his despair. Another essential route, at the Rest and Be Thankful, is prone to closure due to landslips, forcing drivers on a -mile detour. It was announced recently that more millions are to be spent on repairs rather than a reroute of the A. Iain Jurgensen of the Argyll and The Isles Tourism Co-operative said it was ldquostaggering and irresponsible to keep spending public money on patching the problem rather than sorting it out once and for all.: Anger as services haltedIt is not just rural areas that are suffering from the lack of a joined up transport system in Scotland. Rail travel between two of the countryrsquos biggest cities is expensive, unreliable and overcrowded. Bus services across the country y wildly in price and efficiency. In Glasgow the subway does not operate on a Sunday evening. Too often the only way to ensure getting somewhere on time is to go by car, and even then good luck with the potholes.Of course there have been successes, chief among them the Queensferry Crossing. Leaving aside recent closures due to snow and ice the bridge was delivered with only a slight delay, again due to weather, and under budget, something of a miracle for large projects.Yet the Queensferry Crossing aside, Scotlandrsquos transport is too often in reverse or going nowhere fast.Part of the problem is that the subject has become politicised, alongside much  in Scottish le. Take the recent Queensferry Crossing closures. Instead of having a rational discussion about them, the row became another proxy war over Scottish independence. Criticising Scotlandrsquos transport, like questioning educational attainment or NHS waiting times, is seen as ldquotalking Scotland down.It would be funnyit was not so ridiculous. When you travel to another country you donrsquot give two toots of a horn who built what road and when, or who runs the ferry service.: Time to end monopoly of ownershipAll the traveller wants is a reliable service that will take them where they want to go at a reasonable cost both to themselves and the planet. That is what Scots desire as well, and it is not too much to ask.Transport is such an obvious building block for any successful country it should be above political bickering. Even given the problems of geography, it should not be beyond our ability to build a national transport infrastructure that works for all the people most of the time.Since nothing broadens the mind on transport like using the system, herersquos a suggestion. If more of our MPs and MSPs were to venture outside the Central Belt they could see the problems for themselves. Perhaps, once this latest spell of disruption is over, some of them could try commuting from Arran for a spell, or venture beyond the Rest and Be Thankful.Donrsquot forget to send us a postcardand when you arrive."},{"url":null,"title":"BUDGET SKETCH  Chancellor finds forest of magic money trees  Watch out  Boris ","story":"Mr Sunak, when seen on his own, looks a regular sized Chancellor. But put him beside someone of average height and build and he appears tiny. Like Stuart Little tiny. You see it when he walks up Downing Street beside another Minister, orhe is being interviewed one to one and the director cuts to a wide shot. On Sky News at the weekend he made the normally petite presenter Sophy Ridge look like the  foot woman, about to attack.Delivering his first Budget yesterday he seemed perfectly at ease. He looked taller, too. Perhaps he had been given a box to stand on, or maybe that is the sort of confidence a bespoke suit gives a chap.Mr Sunak has not been in the job long, having come to the position after the previous incumbent jumped ship in protest at Number rsquos proposed takeover of the Treasury. Dominic Cummings, the PMrsquos chief aide, was all for installing Larry the cat as Chancellor. In the end, Mr Sunak got the job.Among his tasks yesterday was to show that he was a man, not a mouser, and his own man at that. Before he could get to the juicy part of the Budget, handing out the ribbon-wrapped goodies to all his new pals on the Tory backbenches, he addressed the coronavirus crisis.The Commons heard that one fth of the working age population might need to take time off work . That is a lot of people sitting at home watching Phil and Holly on This Morning.Now, you may have been under the impression these last ten years that the UKrsquos finances amounted to whatever spare change could be found down the back of the sofa in  Downing Street. Money was tight, and it was vital to balance the books, so austerity ruled, spending was slashed, and those on benefits had to be squeezed till their pips squeaked. No one wanted to do this, you understand, but as a former PM said, there was no such thing as a magic money tree.Well, it turns out Mr Sunak has discovered a forest of magic money trees. He shook this one, then that one, showering cash left, right and centre. Speaking of left and right, Mr Sunak decided he was going to merge all three positions into one and make Labour redundant. It was the Conservatives, he said, who were ldquothe real workersrsquo party and ldquothe party of public services. Just to further annoy comrade Corbyn he boasted, Blair-like, of delivering ldquoa peoplersquos Budget.The closest the Chancellor came to a half way decent gag was when he abolished VAT on digital books, including ldquoworks of fantasy like John McDonnellrsquos Economics for the Many. Sitting opposite, the man who would have been Chancellor had Labour miraculously won the election, laughed and felt in his pocket ashe was going to reprise his Maorsquos Little Red Book joke of five years ago. A rubbish joke then, age had not improved it.The Chancellorrsquos main rf, one that he ed to again and again, was that the Conservatives were ldquogetting it done. It was the bossrsquos line about Brexit, or was it Cummings who had coined it  Either way, the Chancellor said it so often and with such relish it was ashe had adopted it for his own.

The past is another country in which every Friday night was fun night, getting wrecked on white wine spritzers and meeting women themselves a little worse for wear.Some  years on, meeting potential partners is far more problematic.

As John Donne almost said, ldquoNo man is an island. And he needs someone to go to the Grosvenor with on a Saturday night with.But itrsquos not easy. As well as the lack of opportunity to meet people, you have to battle against your own torpidity. After a while youget used to your own routine.Then therersquos the fussiness you develop over the years. I once went on a blind date and discovered the meeting to be utterly pointless the moment I noted the femalersquos shoesndash worn for a lunchtime coffee. Therersquos another issue with being single and ageing. The passing years offer experience, a knowing of what you need in a partner, and this knowledge can be inhibiting. Realising you want someone who is intelligent, challenging and fun ndash but also someone who is serious, thoughtful and kind is a heavy boulder to shove. Realising blondes certainly assert themselves on the eye , and that yoursquore a sucker for high cheekbones and a cheeky glint is daunting.Yes, Irsquom asking a lot. And to add to that list I just donrsquot feel comfortable with women bigger than me. So, prospective partners have to be able to limbo under a size  bar.There are notes of optimism, however, to bring to this rather cynical partner quest. Having mutually split with my long-term partner , Irsquove since learned where I truly went wrong:yoursquore going to be with someone for a very long time you should assume they would love to be married. Eventhey never offer the slightest indication of such.Can I commit  Irsquod like to think so. So where to begin with this search to find a we Itrsquos been claimed that more than  per cent of marriages begin online these days, according to figures supplied by the Statistic Brain Research Institute. Thatrsquos good, isnrsquot it Well, Irsquom not so sure. It all seems like HMDI cable connection love. I prefer some form of personal interest to predicate the meeting. I quite liked the high school ldquoMy pal fancies your pal arranged dating, and I thought the premise of the early lonelyhearts agencies to be absolutely sound.My education into this world began in the Kelburne Cinema in  when I watched Carry On Loving. I liked this world. All you had to do was wander into the Wedded Bliss dating agency, the little high street love shop run by Sid Blissand thebig-hearted Sophie Plummett , who would flick through a box of cards and pick out someone whorsquos exactly your type.I recall at  wonderingSophie could pick out someone for me.Fty years on, Irsquom wondering exactly the same thing, except that the personal finger of selection has gone and electronic algorithms, not Sophie, will be used to make the selection. No, Irsquom not keen on this online business at all. Yes, I know seven million in the UK alone are registered. But how can a list of preferences predict chemistry I tell myself to shut up. And havenrsquot the likes of Sharon Stone, Melanie Sykes and Ulrika Jonsson gone online to find a special friend  If nothing , this suggests there are some interesting women out there.Time to start. The first place has to be Tinder, doesnrsquot it  For one thing, the phone download is free. All you have to do is swipe in the direction of the female of your choice, hope that yoursquore her choice and arrange a meet. And before you can say ldquoCongratulations, yoursquore taking her up the aisle.Or are you  For me, the reality of Tinder turns out to be something rather dferent. I wonder, ldquoDo I look as old as some of the women Irsquom swiping away  What a frightening thought.What I also find hard to comprehend is why someone would post pics of themselves with a Bambi nose superimposed, or little devil horns, or cartoon whiskers. Christ, I donrsquot want to go out with a Hanna-Barbera cartoon.What you also learn is that some of the women are eastern European and, rather surprisingly, seem keen to have a much older, rather well-off boyfriend. Perhaps I should be wary.What I do like about Tinder, however, is that people are fairly obvious as to their requirement. I like the women who say, ldquoNo hook-ups, which means they donrsquot want a one-night stand.Yet a Psychology Today profile of Tinder suggests Irsquom more likely to meet a short-termist on Tinder. ldquoSome of those iniduals motivated by such social pressure and instant gratication are also more impulsive, less likely to be faithful and committed, and more interested in having sex for casual reasons, claimed the writer.Irsquove also discovered another possible Tinder problem. One PR company recently created male Tinder profiles, ensuring the name, picture and age remained unchanged, but changed the job title.Claiming to be a builder, they said, nearly doubles your chances of a being Liked. Now, I can hammer home a decent metaphor, mix up a decent simile but I canrsquot treat a damp patchfor the le of me.What I canrsquot nail is a Tinder match. At the last count, Irsquod counted up -odd likes and there are females Irsquove liked the look profile of. But the problem is we donrsquot like each other. It makes me wonder how an app which can have  pages about me on my filendash and million users ndash canrsquot match me up. Surely Sophie Plummett would have pulled someone out of the hat Itrsquos time to look online again. And be optimistic  A survey carried out by dating site Badoo found that people in Glasgow had the best chance in Scotland of landing their Saturday night date. But thatrsquos not love. Thatrsquos a lumber.It seems the problem with internet dating is it represents the paradox of choice. Danish philosopher Soren Kierkegaard once wrote of ldquothe dizziness of freedom. He could have been thinking about the huge volume of internet dating options out there, the anxiety that so much online choice can create. He could have been thinking that, while choice has soared, personal connection has dissolved.Psychologist Michael Rosenfield has underlined this problem. He suggests that finding an online partner is all about learning, narrowing down your criteria,just in case you seek ldquoa same-sex partner, or a partner who is a vegetarian mountain-climbing Catholic.Well, I donrsquot, as it happens. But isnrsquot this all a bit soulless  Does tossing more algorithms at a robot really increase our chances  Or at the end of the day, do we simply connect or not  How can we work out what we want in a partner ndash even when we can never be exactly sure until we meet that person.And letrsquos go back to Glasgow. Online dating company Eharmony says itrsquos ldquothe most single city in Scotland. However, the reasons are not encouraging. ldquo per cent of Glaswegians have given up on finding love completely,  per cent feel overwhelmed by the modern dating landscape and  per cent think theyrsquoll be single forever.Wow. Thatrsquos depressing stuff. The company cites lack of confidence and low self-esteem as playing a major factor. Well, that doesnrsquot apply personally but I have to admit Irsquom edging towards ldquothe  per cent who worry their age is having a negative effect on their search for love.The survey goes on to cite negative past relationships as a factor, and meeting the wrong people on bad dates. ldquoIn fact, a quarter of Glaswegian singles have not had a relationship in over  years.Oh, dear. The allotment beckons. Or having to sign up for a singles holiday in Machu Picchu where Irsquoll meet lots of sturdy women in combat pants and open-toed sandals.I try another internet dating service. Itrsquos called Ourtime and within a couple of hours of filling in the forms I have  likes. I donrsquot knowthatrsquos good or bad. I do know it will cost pound. a month to find out who fancies me. Then therersquos Elite. Which isnrsquot very. Itrsquos claimed to be the dating agency for professionals. I try that one too, but what is a professional  Elite seems to think itrsquos hairdressers or care workers.The website also seems to disregard geography. I declared I wanted to meet someone within a -mile radius and up pops Sandra from Craigavon and Maisie from Nottingham I know. If I were really that keen on finding love Irsquod open my arms to Maisies. I need to widen my outlook. I need to be positive and, like the other singletons, remind myself I live in a city thatrsquos been spiritually blessed by a love saint. St Valentinersquos remains are to be found in St Francisrsquos Church in the Gorbals. And didnrsquot Glasgow proclaim itself to be the City of Love in . That has to help What  can I try  My friend Liam suggests I try Thursday nightsat Waitrose and try to connect over a nice piece of haddock. But then he suggests I follow St Val into church. ldquoGo to mass to meet women, he enthuses. ldquoThere are loads of singles.

This could suggest top ups in later budgets and hence a need for more tax or more borrowing.On the economic forecasts, he said: ldquoProjected growth rates averaging barely over .% a year for the next five years are feeble, frankly.ldquoAnd they are indicative of an economy that is not in a robust position to deal with shocks like the coronavirus.Mr Johnson branded the Budget an ldquoodd affair.He said it was ldquoreally two budgets rolled into one, adding: ldquoThere was the normal Budget setting out medium term tax and spending plans.ldquoAnd then there was the emergency Budget aimed at dealing with immediate potential consequences of the coronavirus.ldquoThe latter made the former a rather odd affair.Another of the watchdogrsquos conclusions is that by , spending per person for most public services will be ldquowell below what it was in , when David Cameron took office and former a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats and at a similar level to what it was during austerity times.Their conclusion states: ldquoOutside of health, spending per person will still be % lower, and around % lower once you account for the spending that is simply replacing EU funding.Ben Zaranko, research economist at the IFS said: ldquoTaking the Government figures at face value, day-to-day spending on public services is set to increase now and be almost % higher by  than it was in . If we put that into per-person terms, to account for the growth of the population, it is set to be almost exactly the same in   as it was in  , so we will be back where we were before the era of austerity.ldquoIf we strip out health, real terms spending will be % lower in  than it was  years previously.Meanwhile Labourrsquos shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the budget did not go far enough to help those in poverty or who are vulnerable, criticising the lack of investment for social care.Speaking yesterday in the House of Commons, McDonnell said it wasunclear what additional support is being provided and added: ldquoThe majority of people who do receive social care are older, disabled or vulnerable people.

In fact the figure is closer to pound,. What she did not say is there are good demographic reasons for this given the sparse population and the need to provide essential public services over a wide rural area. Another factor which muddies her comparison is the fact that Scottish Water is not privatisedand therefore contributes to the anomaly.

Others are cancelling plans and spending more time at home, other than essential work or grocery trips. Others still are cancelling holidays abroad.The one thing in common to these proactive approaches is that they arent making these changes to protect themselves - theyre doing it with their thoughts on their elderly relatives.And the one thing we all have in common is that we surely all know someone who is particularly vulnerable to severe illness should they catch the coronavirus. That,nothing , must be the uniting factor that pulls us through this crisis.Because, despite being told that this will be the worst health crisis in a generation, petty discord is still being created. Following yesterdays COBRA meeting, Nicola Sturgeon gave a public briefing about where we are and what the next steps will be.Commentators wound themselves up at the fact Ms Sturgeon went ahead before Boris Johnson had a chance to give his national briefing, these commentators sniping asshe was a prime ministerial understudy, rather than the leader of a country.This really isnt the time for constitutional squabbles. A well kent journalist called the First Ministers actions \"a borderline coup detat\". Things have certainly taken a turn for the mundane since the days of the Rum Rebellion.A so-far relaxed Boris Johnson put a fine point on it during yesterdays post-COBRA briefing. \"I must level with the British public,\" the prime minister said, \"Many more families are going to lose their loved ones before their time.\"This is, incidentally, from the same prime minister who was only in the last few days showing a cavalier attitude to handshakes, despite having a pregnant partner at home.In the coming days and weeks it is likely that people will be asked to work from home. Large events will be cancelled its possible that schools will be closed. There will be claim and counter claim, back and forth, about whether our respective governments are doing enough to stem the outbreak. There will be disputes about whether they are working effectively together.In a more minor way, social distancing will be expected - staying two metres or so away from other people, avoiding unnecessary trips out. There will be grumbling, at best, and lonely isolation, at worst.The crisis will show just how much we rely on unpaid care work to keep things ticking over. Grandparents, who fill so many of the childcare gaps, will have to step back from their duties for their own protection. The slack pulled by those of us who have caring responsibilities for older and elderly relatives will be stark.School closures, of course, have a much broader impact than exams being cancelled. Exams, while this is stressful for young people who are relying on results to steer choices that will shape their futures, can be rearranged.What of the pupils who take free school meals or attend breakfast clubs or holiday lunch clubs - for them education comes with a literal side serving, and one that is vital to making ends meet in straitened homes.There was concern expressed by a medical expert that cancelling sports matches will only serve to push people to gather in pubs to watch games.In a political climate where the focus is on the inidual, we will have to radically alter our thinking to focus on the collective good during this crisis.We will need to be willing to sacrice our pleasures - sports, the cinema, theatre and gigs. When stocking up on those extra tins, there must be a pause to consider whether we really need as many as were taking or are we leaving someone who is more vulnerable without.On Facebook groups have already sprung up encouraging those who are willing and able to commit to making food drops to elderly and vulnerable people in their communities. From disaster springs a bit of hope.The early narrative that said we shouldnt worry too much because coronavirus \"only\" seriously affects the elderly and those with underlying health conditions has been roundly criticised with its quiet assumption that the elderly and the vulnerable have less value than those with robust health and youth.We need to go a step further and really prioritise choices that will put prioritising the worst affected groups to the fore.As social distancing takes its toll wersquore going to need community to get us through."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-council-tells-woman-must-apply-keep-pink-door---single-complaint","story":"Council chiefs ordered the North Berwick homeowner to submit retrospective planning proposals for the colour refresh - designed to fit in with other homes in the area which have entrances painted red, yellow and blue.:Scottish council spends more than pound, on flights despite declaring climate emergencyBut the decision clearly irked one local, who complained the home - located in Dirleton Avenue - was in the picturesque seaside townrsquos conservation area.The complainant argued that, given the homersquos historic status, any move to change the frontage would have to be subject to council approval.However, the homeowner, who has not been named, pointed out the door is not visible from the street because of high hedges and its corner location.And she said she had been told by planning officers that they had only received one complaint about the colour of the door.Applying for planning permission for the paintwork, which is described as coral, she said: ldquoI had no idea that I needed planning permission for this and assumed it would be okay as there are many other strong coloured front doors in our local streets.ldquoOur door was chipped and neglected and I was aiming to make it appear smarter ndash it very much ties in with my design aesthetic and these colourful front doors are becoming increasingly popular in both conservation areas and outwith.As well as producing photographs of other properties with boldly painted doors, the applicant points out that one neighbouring house has pink rendering on its walls.:Whisky and cheese pairings among projects given Scottish Government food fundingShe added: ldquoWe invested considerable money in upgrading the front door and the gilded lettering and have received many compliments.The planning application is being considered by council officers."},{"url":null,"title":"first-scots-mp-self-isolates-showing-coronavirus-symptoms","story":"Dr Lisa Cameron announced the move on social media in the early hours of this morning.She said she had been forced to cancel her constituency surgeries on medical advice.Dr Cameron, , had been in a debate with Tory mental health minister Nadine Dorries, who was diagnosed with the virus on Tuesday.Dr Cameron, the MP for East Kilbride, Strathaven and Lesmahagow since , later reported feeling fatigued and developed a dry cough and swollen glands.She wrote on Twitter: ldquoApologies for such short notice but after two NHS consultations tonight the out of hours doctor has confirmed I must self-isolate for one week.ldquoHope to be feeling better soon.

As does everything , come to think of it.In SNP press release after press release, in speech after SNP speech, we are told there is only one direction of travel ndash onwards and upwards. :New poll published on Scottish independenceCome good times or bad, boom times or busts, rain or shine, nothing can ever be admitted to arrest the cause of independence, far less set it back. There is only forward motion.Which brings us to the coronavirus.Talented though the media mavens of SNP HQ may be, it is hard to put a positive spin on a traumatic pandemic.Most inconveniently, there are some things which are not in the business of boosting the Yes vote after all.But what dference will it make We are still only in the foothills of the outbreak, and the global economy has already been knocked sideways and le for millions disrupted.Far, far worse lies ahead.So it might seem indelicate to bring politics into the equation. But in truth politics never leaves the equation. It is a constant choice about how we live.:New indyref poll - Fewer than three out of  want another vote before In our small corner of the world, the virusrsquos impact on independence is already under discussion. One fellow scribbler this week suggested it would do the cause ldquono favours.SNP MPs duly pushed back on the idea that a pan-UK response with a whf of the Blitz spirit to it would undermine the case for going it alone.Some, no doubt, will also be pondering how the virus might reconfigure the electorate given the most vulnerable voters are also those most opposed to independence.But I believe most of our politicians, both at Holyrood and Westminster, will simply have the same instinctive concerns about friends, family and society as the rest of us, and do their best to help the country get to the other side of a grim summer.That said, I fear the virus will be more than a match for Nicola Sturgeon, Mr Johnson and their respective public services.People, in their distress, will look for someone to blame. But as the diseasersquos rapid spread has blind-sided the planet, I donrsquot think either leader will be seen as especially culpable. However, I do think the independence debate will change in both the short and medium term.For one thing, Ms Sturgeon can now drop the dim pretence about a second referendum this year.Boris Johnsonrsquos refusal after the general election and the lack of relevant powers at Holyrood always meant Indyref was a non-starter before the  Holyrood election, and possibly for some time after that.Yet to maintain a symbolic flicker of hope, and to avoid getting blamed by her own side for dropping the ball, the FM has kept diminishing herself by insisting it is still a live possibility.That can now end. The outbreak means Indyref this year is logistically and politically impossible.Besides ruling out a campaign involving hundreds of thousands of voter contacts, the virus has become every governmentrsquos Priority One.The public will not stand for money and manpower being erted into naked politicking while it rages.And despite the protestations of SNP MPs against columnists, the independence cause will suffer.Not necessarily because it will look like a bad fit for times of crisis. But because it will look like a decidedly second-order issue.Ms Sturgeon hasnrsquot been able to deliver Indyref so far, but she has been shrewdly fostering a sense of inevitability about it happening.She steadily built momentum, and was set to capitalise on it in .That is about to change.The Yes movement is entering a stall. No marches, no campaigning, no way to spin independence as an answer to the great issue of the day.That loss of hard-won momentum and a slide down a shell-shocked nationrsquos list of priorities will change the Scottish political landscape.However, that does not mean the SNP Government will be greatly disadvantaged at next yearrsquos election.The Scottish Tories, after all, had been planning to hammer the SNP on their -year record in office.But the virus throws a spanner in the stats they intended to deploy.The usual ammunition ndash fresh AE waiting times, treatment guarantees and exam results ndash wonrsquot be there.Instead, there will be a gigantic aberration, a freak lurch in the data arising from a natural disaster.Voters may remember the one-off failures like faulty hospitals and half-built ferries, but the Tory line that the SNPrsquos record has been on a steady downward track will struggle.Nor will Jackson Carlaw be able to credibly claim he could have handled the pandemic better. It will dwarf everyone.The question for a re-elected SNP would then become when is the right time to restart its old conversation When is the right time to say that independence is again the priority It may be a long time indeed."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11150885.jpg?type=article-full","title":"scots-ferries-fiasco-lifeline-island-replacement-seven-years-late","story":"Plans to replace the ageing ferry serving Islay have not yet even gone out to tender - four years after the Scottish Governments transport agency said it would actually have been built.Islay islanders believe the fiasco delays to building two ferries at newly nationalised Ferguson Marine have had a knock on effect on the progress of what transport minister Humza Yousaf said two years ago would help support its growing economy.The dual fuel replacement Arran ferry Glen Sannox and her sister - Vessel  - were due to enter service in mid- but the calamitous contract has doubled in price - and is now estimated at poundm - while work on the vessels will not be finished until at least  - four years late.: First Ministers \"great regret\" over state of Scotlands busiest leline ferryIt was five years ago, that Ferguson Marine in Port Glasgow was handed the pound million contract to build the two ferries.Last year distillers on Islay said they were facing major problems in transporting whisky over to the Scottish mainland because of a capacity crisis on the ferry links.CalMac, the taxpayer-owned ferry operator, has traditionally served Islay with two vessels, the MV Finlaggan and the -year-old MV Hebridean Isles, one of the oldest in the -vessel Scottish fleet.According to an eight-year-old Transport Scotland plan, the estimated timing for replacing MV Hebridean was up to , and sources have said the two vessels do not offer the capacity Islay needs to service its whisky and tourism sectors.The new ferry to complement MV Finlaggen is to have a clear focus on freight and sufficient passenger accommodation to meet anticipated demand.But according to the latest Transport Scotland estimates, a shipbuilding contract for the new Islay vessel is not expected to be awarded until the Autumn of this year, with the first phase of the tender not being initiated till the summer of this year.:First Minister intervention call over parlous state of Scotlands busiest ferryIn , Transport Scotlands Vessel Replacement and Deployment Plan had stressed that the MV Hebridean Isles should be the next ferry to be replaced.And two years ago Mr Yousaf in a statement titled \"Islay ferry pledge\" said that officials were investigating potential designs.Islay Community Councils ferry committee has raised its concerns about the delays with ministers complete with a dossier of issues that have beset the route from the Argyll and Bute mainland hamlet of Kennacraig to the island.It said thatthere had not been the delays in building Glen Sannox and her sister Vessel , the replacement ferry might even have been place in  - six years later than planned - but it now fears it will not be delivered until the middle of .Ferry committee chairman Jim Porteous said: \"A key reason for the delay has been the Ferguson Marine debacle and the delay in completion of the the ships at their yard.\"The side launch of the CalMac ferry Hebridean Isles at Selby in the s.The committee said that in September  alone, a peak time for the Islay route,  sailings were cancelled due to a redeployment of one of the Islay vessels to support the Arran service.

They will be hosted by Caledonian Maritime Assets Limited , the taxpayer-funded company which owns ferries and other infrastructure used by publicly-owned operator CalMac, which will also be represented with Transport Scotland officials.Jim Anderson, director of vessels at CMAL, said: ldquoWe are working closely with all parties to develop the specication for a vessel that meets requirements and supports the islandrsquos economic activities.\"In , there were , crossings by commercial vehicles between Islay and Kennacraig on the mainland in ,  or .% more than the year before.

Not to be outdone, Grêmio played three games on one day in , against Aimoré, Santa Cruz and Brasil de Pelotas, all in their state cup.“Thirty-four players were involved and three of them played more than once,” Amadeu adds.In England, Everton once played three matches in two days in , writes Tim Lawrence — in the Lancashire Cup against Blackburn on Christmas morning followed by an annual exhibition against Ulster FC in the afternoon, winning both.

Van Morrison – Tupelo Honey, lesser known song from the Belfast Cowboy that in all the times I have seen him live, he has naturally never played!. The Waterboys – Whole of the Moon - just a wonderful anthem of my youth and still such a great song today, took me a long time to realise the lyric was a comparison between two people, “I see the crescent, you see the whole of the moon”. Sam Baker – Broken Fingers, a Texan who “got caught up in someone ’s war” after terrible injuries learned to play the guitar again and wrote this song about the process, read the back story before listening.. Dr Feelgood – All Through the City – first live band I seen in Belfast at  years old, had a huge impact on me and after all these years, Jim Bolan thank you for taking me!. Foy Vance – Two Shades of Hope – a wonderful singer songwriter from our wee country, and what a song!. Linda Rondstadt – Your No Good - I have probably bought this album times in dferent formats, loved it from no age.. David Bowie – Heroes - A song and artist who came alive for me when I went to Live Aid with John Connor in , best performance of the day .

His mother had told him to run to her brother’s house to find refuge: the military had already come in the night and killed his father and his brother, and he was likely to be in similar danger. That night, the military forced his mother to sign over ownership of their family farm to the state.Eskander had been imprisoned for four months in an underground prison in Ethiopia without his family’s knowledge, almost one hundred miles away from their farmstead in Dima. Dima is in the Ethiopian regional state of Oromia, the homeland of the Oromo people: a large minority ethnic group who have been subject to political oppression, cultural suppression and the victims of internment and state violence. He had been taking part in a student protest at the technical college where he was studying electrical engineering, carrying a placard that read Stop Killing Oromo People, when the military arrived and opened fire on the protest group. Between forty and fty of the students were arrested and taken to a military camp. From there, he was sent to the underground prison where he was beaten with sticks, cut with knives and tortured with hot metal bars. His body is still marked with the scars from this torture. All of this happened in , and the following year, after he’d lived in hiding with his uncle for five months, his mother sold her possessions to raise funds for Eskander to escape Ethiopia to the relative safety of South Sudan.In April  he left Ethiopia. This was only the beginning of a decade of turmoil that saw the teenage college student progress through his twenties working for two years without pay on a building site in Sudan, imprisoned in Libya by people smugglers, crossing the Mediterranean in a plastic dinghy, being subjected to a brutal assault by a group of men in Italy, living in a bus station near Milan and spending time in Direct Provision in Monaghan before finally boarding a bus to seek a new le of safety in Belfast in April . He claimed asylum, but refugee status and the stability that comes with it has not yet been granted.All of this was written in a statement he’d made for the Home Office through an interpreter. It will form part of his application to be granted five years leave to remain. He sat in silence as I read it all in a coffee shop on the Ormeau Road along with our running coach at Annadale Striders, Michael McKnight. We had gotten to know Eskander well in the preceding year and his positivity and enthusiasm for running had won us over. The scale of the horror he’d been through was until then unknown to us. After he arrived in Ireland, a doctor in the south suggested that running would be a good way of helping to manage the trauma of his experiences, and he was a natural.“I ran my first race on St Patrick’s Day, , in Dublin, with no training,” he told me, “and I ran eighteen minutes for k. I wore thin shoes from Lidl.”He was a natural and he stepped up his training while living in Monaghan, winning many races, and the medals and trophies he won adorn his bedside table in his small room in Stranmillis, along with newspaper cuttings about his athletic achievements. His dedication to running is unwavering, and to those who know his story his successes have been inspirational. He has been on the podium of many road races in the north, including the Laganside k and the Armagh International k, and has matched the course record time at Ormeau Parkrun. The week after he matched the record, dragging me along with him to a personal best of under sixteen minutes, the two of us ed and he was treated like a celebrity: I was approached by several people excitedly asking “do you think Eskander can break the record this time ”For all his talent on the road, it’s cross-country racing where he really shines. At the McConnell Shield race in Ballyclare, one of the north’s oldest and most prestigious races, he put in a stellar performance against some of our best runners. When I crossed the line at that race, Paul Lawther, an original Annadale Strider, and a one-time NI record holder at every distance from m to ,m, immediately said to me with sheer delight: “Did you see what Eskander just did ” He had put a ten second gap on the field in the last four hundred metres, beating two Northern Ireland international athletes. Recently, he finished in second place overall at the prestigious NI and Ulster Senior Cross- Country Championship.It would appear that this is barely scraping the surface of his potential. Michael McKnight has talked with Athletics NI officials about Eskander’s talents and the international representation that could easily follow. Eskander himself dreams of running for Ireland at the European Cross-Country Championships.“I want to make a story for Belfast, for athletics and for Ireland,” he told me.For any of that to happen he needs to negotiate the dficult process of gaining refugee status. He often jokes with me that next year he’s “going to Kenya to train withEliud Kipchoge”, but when it comes down to it he says that what he really wants is “independence and safety, to be free from distress and to be able to breathe in peace again”.Eskander’s gentle manner belies the deep effects of the events of the last decade, of the toll they have taken on his body and mind. He tells me that he continues to require medication to manage the effects of the trauma, to cope with depression and to allow him to sleep. He feels that this is his last chance to make a le for himself he is committed to studying several days each week in Belfast Met, developing his spoken and written English. He tells me that he cherishes his friends and the sense of community he has found in Belfast, that he has been accepted to continue with his study of electrical engineering that was ended abruptly at the time of his imprisonment, but it depends on the Home Office’s decision. He tells me with increasing desperation that he hopes the Home Office will give him another chance at le."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"invest ni host 319 visits by investors but only 14 came to west of","story":"ONLY  visits were made to the West Belfast constituency by potential inward investors, hosted by economic development agency Invest NI, compared to  in South Belfast new figures reveal.The figures for   also show that East Belfast received  visits, while North Belfast had  visits. West Belfast is continually at the bottom of Invest NI inward investor figures for the city.West Belfast MP Paul Maskey told the Andersonstown News that he has already requested a meeting with the newly appointed Invest NI CEO Kevin Holland to discuss his concerns and how the agency has “treated West Belfast over the years”.“It is clear that these figures highlight the inequalities in certain areas,” he said.“Invest NI have a history of igoring areas like West Belfast over the years and I will be stating that quite clearly at the meeting. Thankfully the unemployment rate in West Belfast has reduced in recent years, but it could be further reducedInvest NI stepped up to the mark and brought potential investors to this part of the city.“I will also be raising with them about their lands in West Belfast and what they plan to do to ensure they are used and developed to assist future investors. I will be insisting the new CEO recies this ongoing inequality as a matter of urgency.”SDLP representative Paul Doherty said that with signicantly less inward investment visits taking place here than in other parts of the city, West Belfast is yet again “being left behind”.“We want to see all of Belfast prosper, but this is simply unacceptable given the level of high unemployment and ongoing disadvantage experienced by the people of West Belfast.“I will be calling for an urgent meeting with Invest NI to seek clarity on why West Belfast continues to receive unfair treatment. Invest NI has a responsibility to target areas of need and I will be making it clear to them that they must ensure that West Belfast is given greater priority going forward.”The local rep said it is understandable why Invest NI have come under pressure to change the way they operate.“These figures are testimony to that. This isn’t a one-off either, we have seen similar figures year in, year out which are consistent with the decline in investment and jobs in West Belfast and a constant flow where,” he said.“At present, we have companies in West Belfast who are eager to expand and provide those all-important and much-needed employment opportunities. We also need to harness the potential of the talented workforce that already exists in West Belfast, and it is key that Invest NI assist companies in making that a reality.“I have met with some talented entrepreneurs in West Belfast in the last number of months and they too are understandably frustrated at what they see as constant missed opportunities of bringing investors to this part of the city where they can engage and pitch the potential of this area for investment.“We need to showcase West Belfast. The continued growth of Huhtamaki, based just off Kennedy Way, is further proof that West Belfast can be a great place for businesses to locate, but it is vital we build on that. Invest NI need to develop stronger relationships with all stakeholders in the West in order to grow current businesses such as Huhtamaki, who can continue to grow and employ more people.”A spokesperson for Invest NI said: “Invest NI and the  local councils are actively working in partnership to help grow investment and the economy in every part of Northern Ireland. Investment comes in many forms and a set of figures about the number of inward visits is not reflective of the work that is going on.“For example, nearly  per cent of Invest NI’s offers are to companies outside of Belfast, with recent investments in Derry such as the  jobs being created by Alchemy Technology Services, the  jobs being created by Fintru, the  jobs being created by Danske Bank, the  jobs being created by Terex Corporation as part of a £ million investment in a new facility in the city and expansions by Computershare and Axa.”“Addressing the point that over  per cent of inward visits go to Belfast – this should be viewed in context. The vast majority of visit programmes start in Belfast before going to other locations, or in some cases the investor has no time to visit specic locations so are hosted at our HQ in Belfast. What is more relevant is that over the last five years, nearly  per cent of investors chose to locate their project outside of Belfast.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"new inquest sought","story":"RELATIVES For Justice are to ask the Attorney General for a fresh inquest into the circumstances surrounding the death of republicanprisoner Francis Dodds.From St Katherine’s Road in St James’, Francis Doddswas sentenced to four years imprisonment in March  for possession of explosive material.

The post-mortem report determined that the cause of death as coronary thrombosis.Mr Dodd’s sister Joan Nolan told the Andersonstown News that any information from those who were in prison the same time as her brother would be of great help to her family’s case.“I was  when Francis died, there were six of us and Francis was the only boy. I had gone to Canada and was in Canada when Francis died. I didn’t get home for the funeral and Canada was just a nightmare then,” she said.The Dodd’s family, supported by RFJ, say Francis’ death may have been avoidedhe had been removed from Long Kesh for thorough medical examination. Joan described her brother as very much a “joker” and “young at heart”.“Francis left behind a we and four children. He would have been a very proud father with his daughter getting her -Plus and going to St Dominic’s Grammar School.“Unfortunately I’m the only one left of the family, any fresh information would be very beneficial to the family, he was my brother.”Speaking on behalf of RFJ, caseworker Paul Butler said Mr Dodds had been complaining of chest pains for several months before his death.“The prison’s medical officer had attended to him on six dferent occasions in the weeks before his death. Moreover, in April and May  – four months before he died – Francis had been taken to Lagan Valley and Royal Victoria Hospitals in relation to pain in his left foot which was also discoloured and obviously a circulation problem.“The hospital had recommended that he be referred to the Royal Victoria Hospital for an arteriogram. This is a procedure that examines the arteries to seethere are any blockages. The prison governor refused to allow this and unfortunately Francis was ed to Long Kesh and no arteriogram took place before he died.”Former prisoners can contact RFJ on   or email paul.butler@relativesforjustice"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"rising star alanna gives hope to those in distress","story":"A SPRING Ball is set to take place at the Devenish Complex with all proceeds raised from the night going towards the vital work of mental health awareness charities.‘Stand By Me’, the brainchild of local man Daniel McGinley, will take place on Friday, March  and will feature an array of vocal talent including the launch of ‘Hidden Hope’, the new album and single from rising Twinbrook talent Alanna Flynn.A songwriter since age of , Alanna told the Andersonstown News how music has always been an important part of her le and how songwriting helped her through her own struggles with mental health.“I have always wanted to make an album for charity and the reason why the proceeds raised from it and the single will go towards Suicide Awareness and Support Group is because I’ve struggled with my own mental health,” she told us. “I went through a really dark period of time, I know what’s it like to be in a dark place. Music has been my escape in a way and that has really helped me to where I am today.“Music and songwriting really helped me, I always found it hard to open up, talk about my feelings and emotions. I found that writing it down was a way to get how I was feeling off my chest.”Alanna said she hopes her music will go some way to helping people in distress amidst the suicide crisis in the city.“I would never want anyone to feel like they don’t have someone to talk to. The suicide rates just keep going up and up every year. Mental health, struggles with mental health, is a sickness, it’s a sickness you can’t see but it’s there. Everybody’s mental health struggles are dferent. With the release of the song, the album, I hope when people hear it it gives them a bit of comfort, to hear that there is always hope”.Alanna will be attending as well as performing on the night of the ball along with fellow artists Joleen Burns, Leah Hawkins and Second Nature.“Invitations have gone out to MPs from across the city to attend and whoever shows up is showing their support for this cause.”Alanna spoke of the pressures facing young people as they prepare to leave school for the next chapter of their lives.“For your entire le you are being looked after by your mummy and daddy and then, all of a sudden, it’s like you need to know what you want to do with your le. A lot of pressure is put on you, you’re made to do your UCAS form in school, there were people who didn’t want to go to uni when I was at school. I got accepted to go to Liverpool for Performing Arts but when it came to it I didn’t want to go, as much as I would’ve enjoyed the experience I just knew it wasn’t for me. Young people look to drugs, to alcohol, to feel better as they don’t have all the answers at that stage in their le.”She continued: “I do think we need more resources in our mental health services. This Ball is a way to help those charities that are helping others. It will be a positive night and a chance to hear that there are people that you can depend on. There will be people speaking about their own experiences but ultimately it will be an uplting night. A big ‘ball’ of happiness for everyone on the night.“I’d like to thank Supervalu in the Dairy Farm and ver Photos along with other businesses who helped get the album made and for their support and I’m looking forward to people hearing it.”• The Stand By Me Spring Ball will take place on Friday, March . Tickets are priced at £ which includes a three-course meal and champagne reception. For those not wanting to partake in the meal, £ is payable at the door. Tickets are available from the Devenish reception or by contacting Danielmcginley@gmail.Alanna’s Hidden Hope will be available on iTunes, single priced at £..Proceeds raised on the night will go towards Suicide Awareness and Support Group and PIPS Charity.

We think it comes from animals. It seemed to be localised in this Chinese wet market , it#s likely an animal was infected with this virus and it gave a human the virus.That has allowed the virus to spread very, very efficiently.It#s just this fact that it can be transmitted really well and unfortunately it does cause severe disease.That has allowed it to take hold in countries like China, South Korea, Iran, Italy and likely in the UK.Why has Italy been so badly affected Dr Bamford: We don#t really know. It could have happened to anyone, likely it will be a part of bad luck, under testing, under awareness in the population, or simplythere was more flights connecting to China.Will there be a change of approach now it#s been declared a pandemic Dr Broadbent: It doesn#t really change anything.The word pandemic doesn#t mean anything, it#s only used by the World Health Organisationwhen they don#t think world leaders are taking enough notice of this. It#s more of a political move than a scientic move and it#s really to make sure world leaders take it seriously.What are the symptoms of coronavirus Dr Bamford: The main symptoms are a sore throat, a fever, you probably wouldn#t be feeling very well, quite cold-like.You have a cough as well and this could transpire into dficulties breathing.We know that while anybody can get infected by the virus, there#s quite a big iation in the symptoms.What happensthere#s a confirmed case Dr Broadbent: If your symptoms are mild, you#re asked to self-isolate.Your family may also have to self-isolateyou live with people. Then you#re basically told to keep a good eye on your symptoms.If you start to experience shortness of breath, struggling to breathe, that#s when you have to get back in touch with . If it becomes an emergency situation and you#re incredibly struggling to breathe then that#s when you ring the ambulance and you have to make sure you tell them you tested positive.How can you prevent the spread Dr Broadbent: People are probably sick of hearing it, but they do need to practise good hand hygiene, washing your hands, avoiding touching your face is really important.What is herd immunity Dr Bamford: The idea is thatyou are infected , there will be a period afterwards where you cannot be infected.For it to have a real effect, you would need a sizeable amount of the population to be infected, probably %.That will lead to a considerable number of deaths, so I think that really isn#tof stopping the virus.The best way to get herd immunity is through a vaccine.Are face masks useless Dr Bamford: Face masks aren#t recommended.aren#t completely useless because surgeons wear them, dentists wear them.But they#re under very controlled conditions, so it#s not really recommendedpublic to wear them.How long will it take for a vaccine to be available Dr Broadbent: There are several tests that need to be done before they can made public. The fastest that could really happen is a year to  months. If that does happen, that would be remarkable.Is the media coverage balanced  How concerned should we be Dr Broadbent: I think we do have to be concerned, we#re in uncharted territory here.This is an entirely new situation... so I understand why the press want to keep covering this to keep everyone up to date.I know there is some press that might be labelled as fear-mongering, which isn#t great, but for the majority, this will be a very mild illness.We need to try and make sure the people that catch this virus are young and healthy and can deal with it and we protect our vulnerable people.Should there be an all-island approach to containing the virus Dr Bamford: What the Taoiseach recommended is what is being recommended from the World Health Organisation, so he didn#t say anything that wasn#t sensible.I think the UK will have to take that approach at some time, it#s a question of when, not .Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Expectant mums have also raised concerns that they may not be allowed visitors following labour.We all have to do our bit and it might seem like a small issue in a very serious situation, but they are all things that our mummies are telling us, she said.As a result of the concerns being raised by Daisy Foundation members, the organisation is also offering support to mums across Northern Ireland as the response to the spread of coronavirus moves into delay phase.New mums, babies and children are physically in a low risk category but that isn#t necessarily the case with their mental health, continued Jess.When you have a brand new baby for the first time, that can be a very dficult and anxious time and we are hearing that NHS classes are being cancelled.It#s not okayyou are pregnant and you can#t access your planned antenatal education or you can#t access the support that you need as a new mum.As a short-term emergency provision, we#re offering antenatal classes and our other usual Daisy classes in a live, interactive online forum.This means that no mummies have to miss out on that vital support at a time when they are extremely vulnerable, eventhey can#t get out of the house.Read More Coronavirus: Slowdown for the hospitality industry leads to cost-cutting in Northern IrelandBelfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

If you have any of these symptoms, however mild, stay at home and do not leave your house for seven days from when your symptoms started. This applies to everyone.“If you develop symptoms common with coronavirus, this action will help protect those close to you such as older family members, those with underlying health conditions or a weakened immune system, and others in our community.”Those experiencing a continuous cough and or a high temperature should stay at home for seven days from the onset of the symptoms.Dr Hyland said that, while self-isolation can be frustrating, there are certain steps that can be followed to make the process easier.These include:Plan ahead and think about what you will need in order to be able to stay at home for the full seven days should you be required to.Talk to your employer, friends and family to ask for their help to access the things you will need in order to successfully stay at home.If there are other people living in your home, stay at least two metresaway from them and use your own bathroom facilitiespossible and sleep alone.If your symptoms worsen during home isolation or are no better after seven days, seek medical advice by phone.The PHA has stated that those who are self-isolation with mild symptoms will not be tested.Belfast Related ContentVideoCoronavirusCoronavirus: Decision not to close Northern Ireland schools based on #clear scientic evidence#The First and Deputy First Ministers jointly insisted yesterday that the Executive chose not to close Northern Ireland#s schools based on scientic evidence.CoronavirusCoronavirus: Northern Ireland Hospice in funds plea to Executive to ensure services not disrupted The head of the Northern Ireland Hospice has said the organisation faces an unprecedented challenge as the coronavirus crisis escalates.CoronavirusCoronavirus: Sport goes into lockdown in bid to halt spreadSport in Northern Ireland is facing up to a lockdown this month and beyond due to the coronavirus with a number of sporting bodies postponing matches and suspending fixtures indefinitely.VideoCoronavirusUK and Republic split on coronavirus response with Northern Ireland caught in middle of mixed messagesThe British and Irish Governments have both insisted they are dealing with coronavirus in the right way after they announced radically dferent approaches to tackling the pandemic.CommentOpinionTom Kelly:Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar need common approach tocoronavirus threatRemember the song about Simple Simon  The one were he says and you do  ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Almost inevitably, either at the Ulster Hall or the King#s Hall or further afield, he would seek me out, put his arm around my shoulder and say, #Well Jimbo, we got away with that one again and now the winners can celebrate and the losers can please themselves#, Mr Neilly told the congregation.He had much to celebrate. He was a sportsman, a sports fan, a sports aficionado, a promoter, an entrepreneur, a splendid judge of horse flesh, dog flesh and when it came to boxing, man flesh, a connoisseur of fine art and fine wines, but what he celebrated most was his family.He always said that his greatest cause for celebration was the day that he married his beloved Frances.Frances, being very astute, would say that it was a very close run thing between the wedding day and the day that he scored four points at Croke Park to help the Tyrone minors win the All-Ireland Championship title.She said that the wedding just about got there by a very short head.Mr Neilly recalled the day Mr Eastwood came to the BBC with a very modest proposal to get boxing on the television. We met more than  years ago and there hadn#t been much in the way of boxing, he said.The s was a barren era for boxing here but after the Moscow Olympics in , he had a good look at one or two people whom he thought had potential - Hugh Russell in particular who had a bronze medal, and Barry McGuigan, who should have had a medal.He came to the BBC in Northern Ireland with a very modest proposal and said he would start promoting boxingthe BBC would provide the pictures.There was a lot of debate about it and one or two people weren#t very keen because boxing was a bit #poo-poo#.The then head of programming Cecil Taylor, said yes we#ll go for it and that#s how the whole thing started.Mr Neilly also retold a heart-warming story Mr Eastwood#s son had shared with him during his final days as his closing remarks were met with a round of applause by the congregation.Not that long ago a few of the family were sitting around him in bed and his eyes opened and he eased himself up and unprompted and unrehearsed, for no reason whatsoever, he came out with the immortal line, #the show must go on#, Mr Neilly said.Of course, the show must go on and, of course, the show will go on but it will go on, alas, without one of its brightest stars. Rest in peace.In a statement earlier this week, Mr Eastwood#s family said his passing had brought great sadness to the family as well as the whole community in Holywood, where he was a very visible resident for the past  years.All who knew him will miss his remarkable charm, they added.Mr Eastwood was laid to rest at Redburn Cemetery in Holywood following the service.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.RegisterAlready have an account Log in Belfast   Related ContentNorthern IrelandGrand niece leads the political tributes to Barney Eastwood Alliance councillor Sorcha Eastwood has paid tribute to her grand uncle Barney as a giant of a man who showcased the best of Northern Ireland in his role as a boxing promoter.,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadBarney Eastwood funeral hears how boxing lost #brightest star#Northern Ireland care home residents #dehumanised#, rooms had barcodes on doors instead of namesDUP man#s son told PSNI #he didn#t want to walk past Fenians#Winston Rea lawyers come off case citing #professional conflict issues#Tribute met with applause as legendary boxing figure BJ Eastwood is laid to rest,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Auditors from energy watchdog Ofgem have deemed this irregular spending, which is expected to hit a total of £m by the year  .In , there was a massive spike in applications to the scheme which the RHI inquiry was told was partly due to information being shared with the renewable energy industry.The then Department for Enterprise discussed possible tarf cuts to the scheme with firms in the biomass sector in the summer of that year.One civil servant told the inquiry  he thought there should have been less promotion of the scheme as officials already knew the cost for that year was twice the available budget. Ex-DUP MLA Jonathan Bell, then the minister responsible for RHI, told the inquiry that officials had not informed him of the spike in applications.It was told that one adviser said we could fill our boots as the scheme was being paid for from the Westminster budget, rather than Stormont#s.The forecast cost of the RHI scheme in   is £-m, thanks to cost controls which were put in place in . Before these changes were introduced the total cost was expected to be around £.bn, more than twice the scheme#s estimated cost of £m when it was set up in .Those who may face criticism in Sir Patrick#s report this week have already been given the opportunity to respond to his findings.The Monday following his publication, Sinn Fein Finance Minister Conor Murphy will face questions from MLAs in the Assembly.In total, the Executive#s legal bill for the inquiry is estimated at £.m, with the overall cost of the nearly year-long investigation put at £.m.The RHI scheme was launched by then economy minister Arlene Foster in  and was meant to encourage businesses to switch from fossil fuels to renewable sources.But the low cost of the wood pellet fuel compared to the generous subsidies created a burn to earn scenario where boilers could be operated purely to make a profit from the scheme.Belfast Related ContentGalleryNewsDissident given le for killing prison officer Ismay undertook weapons trainingDissident killer Christie Robinson was hell-bent on killing a prison officer and underwent weapons training to prepare himself for murder.Irish League LivesIrish League Lives: Legendary keeper George Dunlop on calling time on his own glittering Blues careerBig Ivan Little takes a fair share of stick about his television gaffe many years ago when his vocabulary expertise failed him in his pronunciation of the word phenomenon.NewsDisgraced youth group leader jailed over park sex actThis is the disgraced former youth group leader who has been jailed after being caught on video committing a lewd sex act in front of three teenage girls. was delighted to take Carl The Jackal Frampton, World Champion Boxer and NICIE patron to visit Glengormley High today.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh Carl_School_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh Carl_School_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh Carl_School_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh Carl_School_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh Carl_School_.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   was delighted to take Carl The Jackal Frampton, World Champion Boxer and NICIE patron to visit Glengormley High today.\"SportOpinionCarl Frampton:My integrated education came through boxing and it allowed me to develop lelong friendships with CatholicsIn some ways, Northern Ireland has moved forward and in others it has stood still and that#s why I#m so passionate about the development of integrated education across the land. sundayleThug who attacked teen with samurai sword jailed for nine yearsA man who attacked a teenager with a samurai sword has been jailed for nine years.sundayleCourt translator appears in dock himself to admit growing cannabis plantsA Northern Ireland court service interpreter has appeared in the dock himself to admit growing cannabis. from Brazil, accused of causing the road death of Ballycastle man Francis Wilsonthrough careless driving.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_IMG_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_IMG_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_IMG_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_IMG_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_IMG_.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   from Brazil, accused of causing the road death of Ballycastle man Francis Wilsonthrough careless driving.\"sundayleSouth American student charged with causing death of Co Antrim dad-of-three by careless drivingA South American student has been charged with causing the death of a Co Antrim dad-of-three by careless driving.,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadBarney Eastwood funeral hears how boxing lost #brightest star#Northern Ireland care home residents #dehumanised#, rooms had barcodes on doors instead of namesDUP man#s son told PSNI #he didn#t want to walk past Fenians#Winston Rea lawyers come off case citing #professional conflict issues#Tribute met with applause as legendary boxing figure BJ Eastwood is laid to rest,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Bots don’t work for anything but the most basic request. “However, they have surprised me in the end with their generous refund and of course I will keep that in mind for future bookings.”In a statement, Opodo said the issue arose when one of their hotel providers listed the hotel in their inventory by mistake.It said: “Our investigation has shown that one of our hotel providers mistakenly listed this hotel in their inventory. “We have since liaised with our hotel provider and this property has been removed, and the customer has received a refund for his hotel booking.“We recognise the inconvenience this caused and that on this occasion we haven’t met our own expected high levels of customer service. “We have contacted the customer to process a refund of his flights as a gesture of goodwill.”After having both flights and accommodation refunded in full, John’s confidence in the company has now been restored.He said: “I feel a lot better now that they refunded me both the hotel and the airfare, and I would probably use them again nowthey were best on price.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I try not to think about it – it’s  feet,” added Sandra.Sharon is keen to give something back to the charity that were so helpful following the death of her husband, Liam, five years ago.“I’m doing it is because my husband was in the City Hospital and he actually died in the Cancer Centre. “I’m want to give back because I had first-hand experience of how good they were.“They have a desk set up on the bottom floor so you can have a chat to someone. On the wards they provide tea, coffee and magazines.“I had a wee room I could have slept inneed be. They have a lot of extra things that you wouldn’t normally have for families that are up there quite a bit.”“That they were there to chat to you was the main thing, especially in Belfast because you can be a bit isolated. The money can be spread between it and Derry, so it’ll go to benefit local people.”Both women work at St Patrick’s College, Dungiven, where Sandra is a cleaner and Sharon a SEN assistant. They said the school has backed them since the fundraising began.“The school have been very supportive. They held a non-unorm day just before Christmas and we’re getting some proceeds from a run in January.“We have about pound, so far and we’re very grateful.”HopefulSharon and Sandra are hopeful that continued support for the charity will sustain the improvement in cancer services over the last few decades.Sandra said: “I lost my mother and father four months apart and my first husband  years ago to cancer. “Things have changed a lot – back then you were on your own. Nobody talked about it.”This is not the only fundraising drive the two friends have run and they have both taken an active role in promoting and supporting the services that helped them.Sharon said: “We did a sponsored walk, which was Sandra’s idea, the year my husband died and we presented the Cancer Centre with a painting of Benbradagh, so it’s up there now. “The walk involved the community, whereas now I wanted to do something I didn’t have to ask others to do with us, something we could do ourselves and they could donate.”To donate to Sharon and Sandra’s effort, visit their Just Giving page at https:www.justgiving fundraising Sharon-McElhinney. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Following the decision, the applicant Clanmil Housing Association, said it was ‘very disappointed’ and would consider the full range of options moving forward. The application was for the erection of a four-storey building comprising of  two-bedroom apartments with rooftop amenity space, new access arrangements from Victoria Road, servicing and drop off provision, bin stores, cycle parking, landscaping and associated site works. The Council’s planning department recommended that committee members approve the application with an officer saying it was entirely compliant. googletag.cmd.push It was described as possibly the most dficult regeneration site in the city, which was originally given planning approval in . It sits m below the level of the Victoria Road and is boxed in by the River Foyle and perimeter walls with limited accessibility. The application received a total of  representations,  objections and one letter of support. Of the total,  related to the amended design which incorporates a glass tower separating the two blocks. In the report it is noted that the primary objections to this development are no parking provision for residents and the adverse impact of congestion on Victoria Road caused by vehicles turning in and out of the site. googletag.cmd.push Developers proposed that there would be no parking on site, aside from operational parking, such as bin lorries and emergency services. CCTV monitoring and barrier operation would be automated for -hour operation. Planning officers said it will reinvigorate riverfront land and put an end to anti-social behaviour at the site. The natural brick was chosen to better complement the stone finish of the historic Ice House - which sits adjacent - and provide a contemporary building as recognition of the industrial heritage of the wider area. Around two stories of the building would be visible from the Victoria Road and you would see the building from lands opposite on the Foyle Road. ‘Eyesore’ Speaking at the meeting, Hugh Hegarty from the Victoria Park Residents Group raised a number of objections. He described the design as a horric brutalist East German style eyesore . He said pollution and parking problems would be exacerbatedresidents were to park on Spencer Road and Duke Street. Mr Hegarty believed Clanmil Developments would later apply for parking spaces. A lack of space in the area has already resulted in hazardous parking on Victoria Road. He envisaged problems at the site with numerous couriers and taxis arriving. The local resident questioned how it would work allowing only one vehicle on to the site at a timeother vehicles were waiting. Mistakes have been made in the past with the BT building and others near Derry’s riverfront and he hoped the planning committee wouldn’t be remembered for this carbuncle. In response, an agent representing Clanmil said the development would go some way to reducing the housing demand in Derry with around , people on the waiting list. He refuted the suggestion of a future application for car parking saying that was absolutely not the case as there will be a zero parking solution on site and people would manage deliveries. Housing applicants would be made aware that there is no car ownership in this scheme. It is a highly accessible location with bus stops and train travel nearby, he added. The agent also contended that the design respects the history of the site, the city’s shirt factory heritage and complements existing buildings. Congestion  Above: Artists impression of the building from Foyle Road. Alliance Councillor Philip McKinney who is a lorry driver said it would only take one heavy goods vehicleto block the Victoria Road and there would be massive tailbacks. “At the best of times it’s absolutely horrendous, it would only take one timed delivery to go wrong and traffic would be down past the Everglades Hotel.” He was assured there would be no disruption to traffic on the Victoria Road and told there’s enough room for one vehiclethe barrier was down. SDLP Councillor Angela Dobbins said she normally had brilliant things to say about Clanmil but on this occasion believed that the no parking clause discriminates against disabled applicants. “Disability Action will have a lot of issues with this development.” She added: “You’re saying, people can have an apartment with lovely views overlooking the Foyle as long as they’re not disabled or have complex needs.” In terms of parking on Duke Street and Spencer Road, she said it has a one hour parking restriction and askedresidents would be expected to park after pm. The Ballyarnett Cllr suggested Clanmil needed to be educated. While acknowledging a “housing deficit”, she said, people need quality housing, a quality le, quality access and disabled people should have the same rights as everyone . A Clanmil representative said a range of accommodation is needed and people with complex needs are allocated houses by the Housing Executive. Refused Meanwhile, Sinn Feacutein Councillor Patricia Logue, said no distinction should be made between applicants and homes are allocated on a points-based system. “Those with the highest points are given first offer and refusal.” Disabled tenants may have carers who have to visit them three times a day. She warned that Clanmil could be taken to the Equality Commission over the scheme as some people need a car and can’t be treated dferently to those who don’t. Chair of the committee, Christopher Jackson, echoed her views saying those waiting years on homes shouldn’t have to choose between a home or their car. People Before Profit Councillor Shaun Harkin voiced the need for housing but believes it has to be done right. He said: “Representatives are trying to create a more accessible city and district for those with disabilities.” He wasn’t convinced about the aesthetics of the building and insisted that the beautul riverfront must be regenerated appropriately. “It looks to me like a car parking facility, I don’t mean to insult the designer.” Picking up on Cllr Logue’s point about carers, DUP Alderman Hilary McClintock said people want letime homes but don’t know when their circumstances might change. Cllr Dobbins proposed that members do not accept the planning officers’ recommendation and refuse the application on grounds that it is contrary to access and movement and because of the design. “It does not allow people with disabilities to be included in a social housing scheme,” she concluded. Seven councillors voted in favour of her proposal, none against and there were four abstentions. The application was therefore refused. Afterwards a Clanmil spokesperson said: “Whilst we acknowledge the thinking of committee members, this city centre scheme could help address urgent housing need in the Waterside area. “This decision is therefore particularly bad news for families who desperately need a home. “We are considering the full range of options available to us and will decide on a way forward shortly.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This reduces the release of destructive greenhouse gases into the atmosphere making our skies cleaner and it’s also half the price of sending food to landfill.By encouraging everyone in the family to get involved inrecyclingwe can create a cleaner, greener more sustainable place to live.”The council said that last year over  tonnes of food and garden waste wererecycled, which is a % increase from the previous year.A council spokesperson said: “Making an effort torecycleitems like uneaten bread, egg shells, fish or meat bones and peelings from fruit and vegetables can really help our environment.“Simple steps like keeping the food caddy in the kitchen, convenient for scraping uneaten food from plates and dishes can make a big dference.“People are also reminded that they can reduce the amount of waste that they are producing by planning meals ahead and buying fewer goods in bulk.

Yes, I’m talking about youBUT did you actually stop to HEAR the reply or is it just a ‘saying’ you churn out, a habit you say when, in actual fact, most of the time you say it, they say it and neither of you answer. Was nursery good today , What did you do today  are questions I hear most days from parents collecting children from nursery and school. BUT most of the time I actually think WHY ASK as two minutes laterthe parent is not actually talking or listening to the child.So what’s the point of asking  If you really are interested then take the time to listen. Don’t bother asking how are you your really don’t want to know. Yes, this does sound a bit harsh. I know I sound tough. BUT the simple truth is we do need to listen to each other more, be more aware of how our friends, family and, of course, our toddlers and children feel. How we feel is important, it links directly to our self esteem, our self confidence, our willingness to try new things, our ability to cope with problems, our ability to manage upsetting and worrying situations, our ability to form and maintain friendships whether we be two years old or . It involves understanding and being aware of our feelings and how to manage feelings of sadness, loneliness, anger and hurt. It is only by talking about how we feel that we learn to manage these feelings, find a way to overcome them so they don’t drown us, make us feel alone and unable to cope. We hear and see lots of messages in the media about mental health, about the importance of talking and listening to each other, but it is a two way street. If you are feeling down, your toddlers tantrums are getting too much, you are worried sick about the mounting bills, your boss is being unfair and expecting too much or you simply feel lonely, you must speak up and say. How can your family and friends helpthey don’t know -you paint on a smile then close the door and the tears come  In school this week, I had to teach pupils, aged six and seven, about being aware of how they feel and can make others feel. These discussions you can have at home, even with younger children, simple discussions about playing together, not leaving friends out, sharing, kind hands, what to dosomeone has no one to play with, what they could do or saysomeone in their class looks sad. What should they dothey hear someone being mean, someone being picked on, orsomeone makes them feel sad, breaks their toy, paints over their picture etc. I finished the lesson with a simple, ‘what nice thing did you do today.’ You can try this as a family at home. I had so many lovely answers, I played with Sophie, I made Jack laugh, I gave Matthew a turn of the ball, I wonder what nice things you and your children will talk about at tea time today It is important to remember your toddler and younger pre-school child when thinking about feelings too, talking about how you feel when they eat up all their tea, do a nice picture, play nicely with their baby sister etc. But to also talk about when they made you feel sad, when they didn’t tidy up, or cross when they shouted at you. This encourages an awareness of feelings and also enables them to learn about and name dferent emotions. Simple songs such as ‘If You Are Happy And You Know It’ can also have lines such as If You Are Sad Cross etc. Looking in the mirror together and making emotional faces can be fun too. Or make happy plates - happy faces on one side and cross or sad on the other and talk about what makes them feel this way. And, of course, books, talk about the characters how did Baby Bear feel when Goldilocks broke his chair and ate his porridge, how did Spot feel on his first day at nursery So that’s you, your family and friends sorted, but what about the person you don’t know  I know we can’t be responsible for everyone butwe share the message that feelings matter, support mental health awareness, then we can make a dference to each other and through a smile to that other person. The person who felt weighed down and your smile bought them a little bit of happiness, a little lt in a dark day, a thought that people do care, For, in the words of Mother Teresa…Every time you smile at someone, it is an action of love, a gt to that person, a beautul thing.So IF you’ve time to listen then ask how are you  If you are in a rush, say, sorry, I do hope you are good, or sorry, you know where I amyou need me, or big smiles to you or let’s catch up soon - do call me BUT don’t be in a rush every time and DO call! As for your toddlers and children and coming out of school, talk, listen, talk, listen TALK, LISTEN!Remember talk to your doctor, health visitor or your child’s teacheryou are worried about yourself, your child or someone  and, of course, visit Sure Start which offers lots of supportive services for families with young children. Plus many of the wonderful community services in Derry may be able to recommend a group or support service for you - just ask! You may also consider, Mental Health Service nidirect website.

Michael McMullan sat down with him to chat MacRory and also dug up a few insights from others on Lockharts days in the blue, white and black. Our sport coverage is brought to you in association with TJ Hamilton Cookstown Leader and perfectionist were two of the words the  edition of Magheras school magazine, The Patrician, used to describe MacRory winning captain Sean Martin Lockhart.In school tradition at the time, every senior  member would have a short synopsis penned about them. Lockhart was described as one of the most complete colleges players for a long time.“He was as solid as a rock, as youd imagine and he was always on the dangerman,” adds Padraig McKaigue who, with no previous goalkeeping experience, played behind him for both Derry minors and Maghera.McKaigue also points to a roasting Lockhart dished out to current Cavan minor manager Mickey Graham in an Ulster minor semi-final.Damian McErlain, who played on the  team with Lockhart, rated Magheras full-back line that year – John Heaney, Niall Farren and Micheaacutel Kelly – as the best he has played with or managed.“Nobody will ever appreciate how good they were,” he states.And then there was Lockhart. McErlain remembers the No Fear t-shirt Sean Marty would often wear and the jovial Niall Farren giving him plenty of stick for wearing it.“You can practice, practice, practice – Ill still beat you,” read the slogan on the back. It was made for him reckons McErlain, who played at centre-forward. His battles with Lockhart at least once a week at training were savage.“Some days you just never got a ball,” McErlain remembers. “Then, youd have a good day and hit - or something. You knew about it the next day – he took to you like a days work.”Now,  years after captaining Maghera to a -point final win over St Colmans, Lockhart leads Maghera into another final against their Newry rivals.Thenearly didnt happen. Lockhart had initially planned to leave school after fth year to become an electrician. There were also murmurs of a route into accountancy.“I would never have saw myself as a teacher or a manager. Back then, I had a job in an accounts office,” Lockhart recalls, but now there are no regrets.“Its a flash,” said Lockhart, of his memories. “I am talking to you about this years final...that was our year and I cant believe it is  years.”Back in the day, the careers room was the hub for pre-game meetings. Adrian McGuckin would address the  with a detailed and pristinely bound portfolio, specially commissioned for every game. It had everything from bus times to warm-up details. From a team list to a synopsis of the other teams strengths and weaknesses. There was a plan for playing with an extra man or having a man sent off. Every base was covered.Now, that corner on the second floor of the three-storey building houses the school staffroom. The faces have changed, but constant murmur of football chat competes with the aroma of hot tea.Lockharts MacRory career spanned three and a bit seasons. In , as a fourth year, he was added to the  towards the end of the campaign. The following year, he was corner-back. They needed two games to get over a St Patricks Armagh attack that had the bustling Des Mackin on the edge of the square.“Dessies gonna get you,” came the chants in the direction of Seanie McGuckin, who would win the battle. The final was a dferent story against St Colmans. Mackins county minor team-mate Diarmuid Marsden missed a penalty, but the Violet Hill men still took the cup, on their way to a Hogan title.In , Seanie McGuckin was now the fulcrum of the attack, leaving Lockhart to wear the number three jersey. Maghera went one better with St Patricks Armagh in the Athletics Grounds. Lockhart gave away height and weight to full-forward Conor McGurgan, but not much  in assured performance.Another masterclass, as McKaigue put it, came against Pat Spillanes nephewin a landslide win over St Brendans Killarney to set up a date with St Jarlaths Tuam and a chastening - to - defeat.It was a team that included Michael Donnellan, Padraig Joyce and Tommy Joyce, John Divilly, Declan and Tomas Meehan.“We had no specic plan to go for goals, but we were encouraged to go for themthey were on,” reveals former Donegal player John Haran, who was on that Jarlaths .“If you ever watch that game on video, Maghera actually had a lot of possession and missed a lot of chances. History is cruel, as it looked like an easy win.”Full-forward for Jarlaths was underage superstar John Concannon. He scored - that day, but failed to reach the same inter-county heights as the rest of the crop. Harans St Eunans team-mate Kevin Winston lashed in the first goal, before the Concannon show kicked in. It was a humbling hour for Lockhart.”All through that year, there was a chant  youll never beat Sean Lockhart but after  minutes hehad skinned me, scored - and the chant just stopped.” googletag.cmd.push  MacRory and Hogan champions. It was his last chance at a Hogan Cup medal. The following year, , he was one of six players, including starters David ONeill, Mark Diamond and Fintan Martin, who were overage for the All-Ireland series. Panellists Sean McPeake and Dominic Lynn, who wouldve been in contention, were also ineligible.The MacRory would be his last hurrah. In the quarter-final against St Macartans Monaghan, with Lockhart now as captain, goals from David ONeill and Mickey Gribbin put them on their way.Six days ahead of the semi-final, Maghera – with eight starters missing – defeated St Jarlaths Tuam, who had  of the Hogan winning team on view, in a low-scoring challenge game in Aghadrumsee. It was the perfect ending to the preparations.“We had a strong upper six and a strong lower sixth group. We were coming off the back of winning the Rannafast and there was great character in our team with a never say die attitude,” Lockhart feels. “We played Abbey . They had John McEntee, Tony McEntee, Enda McNulty and Aidan ORourke at a snow-swept Armagh.”Leading - to - at the break, Maghera had to face the elements in the second half but a Mark Diamond thunderbolt ot the net, into the driving snow, quashed any Abbey hopes. Now preparing for the final as a manager, Lockhart can now fully appreciate the support structures from his playing days.“Back then, as a player, you are in a wee bubble and Adrian protected us and he kept our feet firmly on the ground“Now as a manager, you have to organise food, travel, promotion and the media, so you see the whole package. But one thing you do see, you see the impact on the school. As a player, you thought it was about us in the team. It didnt go totally to plan for Lockhart in .“I remember breaking my finger the year before the final. I was playing pool with a few of my mates and we were just messing about.”It didnt matter, the final was a walk in the park. Colmans got the first point of the game, the only time Maghera were behind all year. That was as good as it got for the Newry side. They failed to score for over three quarters of the game and Lockhart – who also kicked a point - was left to lt the cup.It wasnt long until he received the call from Derry senior manager Mickey Moran. Within three years of leaving school, he would pick up an All-Ireland U medal and was full-back on the last team to win the Ulster SFC, in .He never gave Tony Boyle a kick in the Ulster final and combined with a performance on Padraig Joyce later in the year, he picked up an all-star.It was a baptism of fire in the early seasons as an inter-county defender. He vividly remembers a league clash with Clare and a tough afternoon marking Gerry McInerney. Lockhart has never forgotten the name.“I was wing-back and he scored - off me and skinned me. The older boys, like Henry Downey and Kieran McKeever, came over and said Sean Marty, you have made the county, your learning starts now.“I went back into full back and you had to educate yourself. You had collective training and there was the inidual work yourself. I had plenty of battles with boys after it.”Over the next week, Magheras defenders dont need to look any further for advice on how to curb the St Colmans attack.As our conversation finishes, Liam Kielt appears on the scene. After a brief, general, natter on football, his former Corn na nOacuteg manager enquiries about the Newry challenge. Lockhart recites a litany of names and dangers.“They have a good forward line,” was the sweeping statement centred on next Tuesdays taskThe preparations had long since begun. The  school magazine wasnt far off the mark. Leader. Perfectionist. And so the cycle continues. googletag.cmd.push   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

While parking availability can determine what parking style a motorist must use the research also highlighted preferences with  per cent of respondents selecting parallel parking over  per cent who chose perpendicular parking. Most annoying parking habitsParking scenarios can be tricky to navigate, and other drivers’ behaviour can have a huge impact on it, increasing the stress levels of motorists. When asked what motorists found to be the most annoying parking habits of other drivers the following where revealed as the top five:- Hogging two parking spaces - Parking in a disabled space when they had no disabled sign and weren’t a disabled driver - Parking too close to your car - Blocking you in so you can’t get out of your parking space - Blocking an entrance so you can’t get into your home or place of work  Commenting on the research, CEO of easytrip Ireland, Colin Delaney said: “While advanced technology has made parking hassle free for many there will be times that parking becomes stressful.“This could be down to parking preference spaces not being available or other drivers’ behaviour. “We would encourage drivers to take their time when parking and seek out a parking space they are comfortable with parking in. “It’s important to be considerate of other motorists needs and this includes parking between the white lines, not on them. Not parking in a space that is not dedicated for their use, whether that be a disabled, family or electric vehicle space, and not parking on double yellow lines. “Ultimately it’s about being considerate of others and making driving and parking less stressful for everyone.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Decisions taken by council to date has been to cancel the planned St Patrick’s Day spring carnival celebrations in Derry and Strabane, the cancellation of all travel and attendance at conferences by council staff and members and the introduction of proactive measures to protect and reassure staff and users. Members attending the meeting were also informed of the proactive contingency measures being put in place to protect vital council services. googletag.cmd.push In view of this, members agreed that council should close two of its public buildings with immediate effect, to allow vital services to continue in anticipation of other facilities being forced to close at a future date. The main civic council offices in Derry Road, Strabane and the Brandywell Sports Centre building will both close from this evening at pm for operational reasons, to allow these buildings to be available and fit for purpose to provide essential public services over the coming weeks. The Glenside office located behind the civic offices on Derry Road will remain open to the public and Derry Road staff are being relocated to alternative sites including Glenside, Strahan Road or the Civic offices in Derry’s Strand Road. googletag.cmd.push Members at the briefing heard that the closure of the buildings would allow council to carry out essential services such as waste management, the registration of births, deaths and marriages, cemetery provision and financial services, during this challenging time. Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council Cllr Michaela Boyle reassured the public that council is taking a very proactive role in its contingency planning to mitigate against the impact of COVID- and the decision to close the two centres was made in the best interests of people in Derry and Strabane and the safety of council staff. She said: “By closing these two buildings and making them sterile zones it will allow us to provide a reduced but essential level of service provision. The Council has a duty of care to its staff and the public and this is a very responsible approach to a very fluid situation. We will continue to work with our statutory agencies and partners in terms of contingency planning and reviewing all Council service provision and Council organised events on a regular basis. Any changes to services or events will provided as soon as any decision is made.” The Mayor also confirmed that she has cleared her public diary and has decided to cancel the Mayor’s monthly Tea Dance. Mayor Boyle said this decision was also made in the interests of the health and safety of the attendees, the majority of whom are older persons. She said: “The monthly Tea Dance is a hugely popular event for members of our older community across the city and district. In view of their age and the risks associated with this virus, it was felt that we needed to cancel this event for the foreseeable future. Council members will meet with senior officials tomorrow to consider progress and to further monitor the situation. The council will continue to liaise with Governments and statutory agencies, including the Public Health Agency and the Department for Health, on advice and guidance in relation its emergency contingency planning.  Members of the public with any queries are urged to contact the Council directly on    or follow us on Twitter and Facebook.

We are grateful not only for their monetary contribution but also for how they have committed to ensuring the series helps promote the region on the world stage he began.We are confident their support will also help lever additional finances going forward. This of course is also testament to the work of the Union, the hosts Bready CC and also Eglinton CC who will facilitate New Zealand training sessions during their stay here. We must also recognise the ongoing support of Cricket Ireland for cricket in the region and their backing for staging such high profile games in Bready. googletag.cmd.push OpportunityMayor, Michaela Boyle echoed those sentiments and suggested that this was an opportunity to show the sporting world what the North West has to offer.“The Cricket World Cup finalists coming to Bready for a competitive senior international is exciting news not just for cricket fans but for the wider sports fraternity in the North West.“I am delighted that Council have been able to support this high level fixture through the National Event Fund and I would like to congratulate Bready Cricket Club and the North West Cricket Union for their tireless work to secure these games.“This is one of the biggest sports fixtures to ever take place in our Council area.

With her fresh complexion, sparkling eyes and ready smile, few would believe that Mrs Jean Kelly is  years old.Secretly enjoying the fuss, Jean appeared happy to be sipping tea from a bone china teacup and saucer at her birthday party, which was attended by family, friends and staff members.While Jean grew up in the Roaring Twenties, it wasnrsquot all flappers and jazz bands around Lisowen mdash the townland outside Saintfield which was her home.Born Jean Stewart, she lived with her grandparents and attended Doranrsquos Rock National School, a small two-room country school between Saintfield and Crossgar.When she left school she went to work at the Montalto Estate in Ballynahinch, which was owned by the aristocratic Clanwilliam family.Youngest son Malcolm takes up her story.He said: ldquoIt wasnrsquot long after she began working there when one fine evening she was pushing her bike along the Creevyargon Road toward home, exhausted after a dayrsquos work when she met a young man walking toward her in the other direction.Malcolm explained the young man was so taken by Jean that he offered to push the bike for her.ldquoThe young man was my father, Hugh, and within three years they were married, said Malcolm.Hughrsquos family were dairy farmers from the Creevyargon Road. When the couple got married Jean gave up her job at Montalto, as was customary in those days.Jean and Hugh were to be blessed with six children, three of whom mdash Malcolm and his elder sisters, Irene and Anne mdash are still alive. Two of the children died in infancy and another daughter, Margaret, passed away a few years ago.Jean has been a widow for over  years but her fabulous tapestries and hours spent volunteering at local charity shops are testimony to someone who enjoys being busy. One of her finely embroidered pieces hangs proudly in the nursesrsquo station at Spa Nursing Home.Some years ago, Jean visited northern France and sewed the magnicent medieval monastery of Mont-St-Michel, set in the bay of St Malo where Normandy and Brittany merge.She is also a keen local historian and is particularly knowledgable about Betsy Gray and the Battle of Ballynahinch in .Jean also enjoys John Wayne films, including Rio Bravo and She Wore a Yellow Ribbon, and the musical Seven Brides for Seven Brothers which starred Howard Keel. She is also a great fan of country music legend Jim Reeves.Jean has been a resident at Spa Nursing Home for almost four years and son Malcolm says she could not he happier. ldquoThe staff are very good to her, he remarked..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th March 2020 Call.jpg","title":"Call for investment in Ardglass harbour  ","story":"THE importance of the Ardglass fishing industry to the district and wider South Down economy was highlighted at a meeting at Stormont last week.Fisheries minister Edwin Poots met with South Down MLA Colin McGrath and local councillor Dermot Curran to discuss planned improvement work at the port, including deepening the harbour to facilitate larger herring and mackerel vessels.The local politicians highlighted the need for additional investment in the harbour and its infrastructure and called for the port to receive its fair share of funding to enhance the fleet.Mr McGrath described Ardglass as a ldquostrategically important harbour for the Co Down fleet, highlighting its crucial role in driving the South Down economy and its location as a central hub for processing fish.The MLA said further investment was ldquocritical to allow Ardglass harbour to expand with appropriate slipways provided to allow larger vessels to dock safely.ldquoSuch work should be undertaken in concert with efforts to expand Kilkeel harbour and ensure that our local fishing fleet is enhanced ahead of Brexit, Mr McGrath continued.ldquoSouth Down has a proud association with the fishing industry. It is beyond time that we invested in this important part of our economy, creating new jobs and bringing new opportunities to local people.Cllr Curran mdash who invited Mr Poots to visit Ardglass to see the port at first hand mdash said such a visit would provide an opportunity for the fisheries minister to see that the development of the harbour is ldquoessential for the day-to-day lives of people in the village and the economic prosperity of South Down.He said that the local port is home to a large fishing fleet which lands some of the largest quantities of prawns in Ireland. In addition, Cllr Curran explained that Ardglass is the only all-weather harbour between Howth and Bangor.ldquoThe main economic activity in Ardglass is the fishing industry and although it is reasonable buoyant at present, harbour improvement is needed to sustain it., Cllr Curran continued.ldquoThis improvement is required to facilitate the large fish and prawn boats as they have encountered issues with access.Cllr Curran explained that due to their size, a number of vessels have scraped along the sea bed at low tides entering the harbour, causing damage to their hulls which can result in vessels being out of commission for repairs. leading to a loss of earnings.ldquoSome of the larger boats now bypass Ardglass and go where, mainly to Belfast, he continued. ldquoThis results in a loss of landings and additional transport costs to the local fish factories.Cllr Curran added: ldquoIf Ardglass harbour is not deepened, it could potentially lead to an economic collapse for the fishing industry in Ardglass and that is something no one wants to see happening.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is supporting plans to regenerate Ardglass harbour to help secure the future of the villagersquos fishing industry and has provided financial support to a harbour development group which has drawn up a series of proposals.The money was designed to help the group complete a business case aimed at paving the way for a number of projects including deepening the harbour to accommodate larger herring and mackerel vessels and to upgrade berthing facilities for local trawlers.The Ardglass group is also keen to relocate trawlers to the an area known locally as the Saw Pit at the harbour which it wants to deepen in order that vessels are able to put to sea when they want and not have to wait on the right tidal conditions.The provision of a dedicated repair facility for vessels is also a key aim for the new group as currently trawler skippers have to take their boats to Kilkeel or Portavogie which reduces the time they can spend at sea earning a living.Another key plank of the grouprsquos vision for the future is converting property at the harbour to provide a new hub offering essential office and training space.

discover whether the bid has been successful.The funding secured to date has been provided by the Heritage Lottery Fundand Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs .Since the s, the sprawling forest park was the demesne of the Annesley family, who created a beautul landscape and a nationally and internationally important -hectare arboretum.The proposed development project aims to create a new vision for the historic Castlewellan demesne, delivering what is being described as a ldquoheritage-led destination to connect people with their built and natural heritage.Council officials and local politicians are keen to see the picturesque forest parkrsquos Arboretum, Annesley Garden and Grange Buildings redeveloped to help increase the number of visitors and provide the area with an economic boost.Officials say the focus is on improving amenities and the interpretation of the parkrsquos natural and built heritage.A recent economic appraisal recommended the development of what is being described as a welcome centre in the walled garden area designed to provide access via a lt to its upper floor, with the council keen to play a leading role, alongside the Forest Service, to help transform the parkrsquos fortunes and make it even more popular.At Mondayrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee, it was

Park.Philip Campbellrsquos side displayed a ruthless streak when they brushed aside their giantkilling neighbours to book their place in the Easter Monday showdown for the third year in a row and they can now prepare for a massive derby clash with Celtic Bhoys.First half goals from twin terrors Daniel Taggart and Declan Dowie sent Ballynagross on their way and Eoin Rooney smashed in an unstoppable third midway through the second half to finally kill off a game Strangford side.In a competitive opening, Ballynagross used the width of the pitch to get at Strangford and with just two minutes gone Dowie had an effort cleared off the line after a cross from Rooney threatened to cause damage.Five minutes later Rooney had an effort hacked away to safety by an alert Conan Hynds as Ballynagross threatened to run riot.However, Donnie Ritchie started to get a few tackles in and his physicality in the engine room enabled Strangford to mount a few attacks of their own, using Conall Magee and Eoin King as willing outlets.Darting runs from Hynds and Ritchiersquos no-nonsense approach was just the ticket for Strangford and with  minutes gone Patrick Kerr had the ball in the back of the net only for it to be harshly ruled out for offside.Two minutes later at the opposite end, Cultra again saved from Rooney and followed that up with another good stop to deny Dowie.Strangford were becoming increasingly confident as teenage defenders Fionn McFaul and Thomas Fitzsimons settled into the job and with Ritchie and Hynds rattling a few cages, Niall Hyndsrsquo side started to look the part.However, they were left crestfallen in the th minute when Dowie broke free on the right and crossed for Taggart to flash a ing header into the net, somewhat against the run of play.It was a cruel blow for Strangford, but things were about to get worse, much worse.Referee Aide Sharvin who had a good game, had the whistle in his mouth to blow for half-time when the influential Connor McCarron sent Dowie clear and with the Strangford back four caught flat-footed, he lobbed the ball over Cultra with the last kick of the half to make it -.Strangford knew they had no choice but to throw caution to the wind after the break and that they did, but Aaron Beattie and Conor Marron gave absolutely nothing away at the back for Ballynagross and chances were hard to come by.Ballynagross were now able to hit Strangford on the break and with  minutes gone Cultra pulled off a stunning save to deny the overlapping Tom McNeill and then John Shields on the follow-up.With  minutes gone King blasted wildly over the top for Strangford before Ballynagross were denied what looked a stonewall penalty when Cultra emptied Rooney as he darted into the penalty box, but the referee waved play on.Ballynagross were not to be denied their third goal and with  minutes gone Shields played a delightful ball into the path of Rooney and from the right hand side of the box he unleashed a vicious volley that had goal written all over it from the moment it left his boot.Strangford still refused to throw in the towel and apart from a double save from close in by Cathail Arnold, they never really threatened, despite seeing their fair share of possession.Ballynagross could have won by a bigger margin, but Cultra stood big and tall and kept the final tally down with several more good saves.Ballynagross: Cathail Arnold, Tom McNeill, Deaglan Craig, Connor Marron, Aaron Beattie, Conor McCarron, Cormac Byrne, John Shields, Daniel Taggart, Eoin Rooney, Declan Dowie.

For winning rider, Daire McConville, from Portadown, it was an eighth winner between the flags.Twelve went to post in the Bluegrass and Dengie - mares maiden race and here we had a smooth winner in Ballela in the colours of Banbridge owner, Liam Cosgrove, who bought the horse back in August .Trained at Katesbridge by his brother, Gerry, the winner was ridden by Mark OrsquoHare in what was his only ride of the day.Going by Gerry, the winner, who likes any going, will now be sold.Interesting that Liam, who bred Apinchofluck, now owned and trained by Gerry Quinn, the former jockey, fell early in the race.Second place went to Mullaghmore Wave, trained by Alan Fleming, no longer the private trainer to Barry Connell, with Res Judicata third.Eleven went to post in the Irish National Hung chase committee six year-old and upwards maiden race for novice riders and here, Tardreee, in the colours of Templepatrick owner, Wilson Dennison, was sent into a long, clear lead and was always well clear as he came home by  s from Gigiplan Two Seven, ridden by Cathal McCormick, on his second local ride of the day.Red Lion, owned and trained by Co Antrimrsquos Richard Irwin was third. The winner is trained at the ownerrsquos estate by Colin McKeever and was ridden by Ballymenarsquos Paddy McGuigan for his second success. To me, he is a rider that deserves to get more rides than he does at at present.Largest field of the day was the  runner Albert Bartlett maiden race and as a result of a  start, all riders received a two-day ban.Victory went to Oscar Elite, trained in Wexford by Cormac Doyle and ridden by his stable jockey, James Hendrick, the combination winning from the Warren Ewing-owned and trained Here We Have it, ridden by Jordan Gainford, now riding the majority of his winners.There was a dead heat for third between Tommyrsquos Oscar and Pasvolsky, Chumlee and Dan Nevin were unlucky to be carried out by a posse horse when still in the lead.Six of the  entries went to post in the Dennison Commercials four year-olds auction race and only three finished, victory going to Greenrock Abbey, owned and trained by Wexfordrsquos Denis Murphy.Monkstreet was second ahead of Bolamore Bridge. No less than  horses took part in schooling after the last race.Among the best turned out in all races, courtesy of Glencairn Stables, were locals Robyn McCluskey, from Dromara and Sam Dickson, both involved with Colin McBratney yard at Raffrey.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Of those who received the benefit,  per cent were unemployed.Universal Credit began in  and has been gradually rolled out across the country. It was designed to simply the benefits system for working age people by merging six separate benefits into one payment.But features such as the -week wait, the -child limit and the benefits cap, as well as public spending cuts, have been associated with a rise in rent arrears, food bank usage and child poverty.Local homelessness charity, Llamau, has expressed concern for young people who are being enrolled on the scheme.Joe Payne, head of vale services and family mediation for Llamau, said: ldquoPrior to the introduction of Universal Credit, a young person may have claimed Job Seekers Allowance or Employment Support Allowance but this is no longer an option.ldquoUndoubtedly, the five week waiting time and a very low National Minimum Wage for people under  is going to cause young people untold hardship and in a lot of cases, spiralling debt.A Department for Work and Pension spokesman said the increase in  to -year olds claiming Universal Credit is lsquoin line with expectationsrsquo as it has been rolled out to every job centre.Jane Hutt, AM for the Vale of Glamorgan, said: ldquoI am concerned at the rise in the number of claimants, particularly young people, who need to access Universal Credit.ldquoCare leavers in particular are being disadvantaged by the changes. I do not believe the concerns that have been raised by claimants, by employers and by organisations advising and supporting people affected, including those who are in employment, have been addressed and I will continue to raise them on behalf of my constituents.The government has committed to ending a four-year benefit freeze in April this year, meaning millions of people will see their payments rise by the same rate as inflation.Councillor Kathryn McCaffer, Vale of Glamorgan Council youth champion, said: ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council is working with a range of partners to mitigate any adverse impacts and offer a iety of support to young people in financial dficulties. Those classed as Not in Education, Employment or Trainingcan access the Inspire  Work programme, which provides financial help to pay for the likes of work clothes, training and travel costs.ldquoVulnerable tenants are protected from debt through the direct payments system. Currently around  per cent of tenants have this system in place, which allows a portion of Universal Credit payments to be made directly to the council to cover rent.ldquoThis year, the council has been able to secure over pound, of additional income for tenants by helping them secure backdated claims, ensuring the correct benefits are being received, assisting with appeals, and helping secure the best tarfs for utilities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

How do those people then stay, snuggled in snoozy paradise for hour upon hour until their alarm gives them a nudge and they arise rested and ready for a new day  I have never been a good sleeper, even as a child. If anything at all is playing on my mind, I never lose my appetite, but I will lose slumber. I have friends who similarly suffer. I use the word suffer quite deliberately, because lying there in the dark at am it can feel like everyone  is snuffling softly but for the wide-awake person, it can feel horrendous. As the time ticks closer to the alarm and still sleep will not come, it can feel quite anxiety-inducing and so the vicious circle whizzes, fizzes and flies through your brain making sleep feel further and further away.But, as this is a lelong way of living for me and I am overwhelmingly a lsquocrack on kinda womanrsquo, I have developed ways to use this time effectively. I listen to podcasts, and have learned about biohacking, how broccoli defends itself and the many twists and turns of the Brexit negotiations whilst the street snoozes. I catch up with messages . I also think a lot. I just lay there in the dark and puzzle though story ideas, events from the day and issues facing friends, family and myself. In a twisted way, this time and opportunity has become quite precious to me. I donrsquot know when  in the day Irsquod have the time and space to just ponder, muse, consider and percolate. It is during this time that I have considered my earlier point about jealousy.

Rather than adhering to a nationally prescribed learning program, schools and practitioners will be able to make decisions that best meet the needs of specic learners.As well as contributing to the framework, St Josephrsquos has also introduced their own bespoke curriculum, and is one of only  Curriculum Innovation Schools in Wales.The St Josephrsquos curriculum is based on findings in child development and cognitive science, with staff undertaking extensive learning on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop.Lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social and physical development, whilst also providing a detailed knowledge and understanding of the world, both past and present.The school has also benefitted from signicant on-site works, including the refurbishment of all classrooms, a complete reconfiguration of the Foundation Phase learning spaces and a state of the art new-build Nursery.Staff regularly deliver learning experiences outside of the classroom, as the schoolrsquos grounds include a playing field, wooded area, pond, orchard, wildflower meadow and polytunnel.The implementation of the schoolrsquos ambitious curriculum has seen standards improve year on year. Last yearrsquos National Reading Tests saw the average child in St Josephrsquos score within the top  percent of the country, with similarly high standards achieved in mathematics.Headteacher, Gareth Rein said: ldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos. Everything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.Cabinet Member for Education and Regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning.

The short list of potential locations for e-bike stations includes Penarth Town Centre, Cogan Train Centre, Penarth Train Station, Llandough Hospital, The Esplanade, Cosmeston Country Park, Cardf Bay Barrage, and Pont-y-Werin Bridge.The scheme hopes to encourage people to switch from their daily car journey to e-bikes, saving on average g of CO for every  kilometre travelled.The average round trip from Penarth to Cardf is km, which would save ,g of COused daily.Nextbike Managing Director, Krysia Solheim, said the Penarth scheme would be great for those who commute into the capital.ldquoWe know from our research that a lot of commuters already cycle from Penarth into Cardf, said Ms Solheim.ldquoE-bikes will make that journey easier and quicker than ever before, which will hopefully persuade more people to switch from four wheels to two on a daily basis. Picking up an e-bike instead of jumping in the car is also a great way for people to reduce their own personal carbon footprints to help our communities tackle climate change.ldquoPenarth will play an important part in leading the bike share revolution in Wales - itrsquos an exciting time - and we want the community to be as involved as possible.\"Councillor Peter King, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, said: ldquoFeedback from the Nextbike consultation was overwhelmingly positive, with many residents hoping to see the expansion of the scheme to the wider Vale.ldquoHaving declared a climate emergency last year, and having recently proposed a pound.m investment into tackling environmental issues, the Nextbike scheme will be a leading example of our commitment to tackling climate change and improving the wellbeing of our residents. We hope this will inspire the launch of similar schemes in future.The Nextbike project is being funded by Section  sustainable transport contributions. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The aim is that these virtues help to form them.With such a vast space at its disposal, the school ensures that children are given a rich and versatile experience.In the orchard, pupils pick fruit from pear, apple, plum, and damson trees which they use in cooking lessons during the autumn.They also grow  dferent kinds of fruit, salad, and vegetables in a polytunnel.Earlier this year, St Josephrsquos Primary was awarded a gold award in the UNICEF Rights Respecting School programme.The award is granted to schools which show a commitment to promoting childrenrsquos rights and raising awareness of these amongst young people.It recognises efforts to place the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child at the heart of a schoolrsquos policies and practice.ldquoAlongside our work on rights is the fact that we want our children to be aware of their responsibilities, said Mr Rein.ldquoYes, they have rights to be heard, but they also have a responsibility to listen to others.St Josephrsquos was the first school in Wales to develop a pupil parliament.Every child is a member of the parliament, and elected representatives from eight student groups form a cabinet which has decision-making powers.ldquoThe school parliament is a vehicle for the pupils to have a voice, so they can decide how the school can be a better place, how the local community can improve, and how we can help the UN to achieve their global goals, continued Mr Rein.ldquoSo the children are looking inward ndash at themselves and how the school environment can improve ndash and looking outward at how we can develop better links with the parishes and the areas of Penarth and Dinas Powys.ldquoOur Eco Ministry has been involved in a project to tidy beaches and pick up plastic, and our Healthy Schools and School Mission team have given food to local foodbanks.St Josephrsquos Primary is one of  innovation schools which have been chosen to contribute to the Welsh Governmentrsquos new curriculum framework, which will be rolled out to every school in Wales by . As part of the new framework, schools are required to design their own curriculum based upon the needs of specic learners, rather than adhering to a national learning program.St Josephrsquos curriculum is lsquoresearch-ledrsquo, meaning it is based on findings in child development and cognitive science.Teachers have undertaken training on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop, and lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social, and physical development.Mr Rein said: ldquoWe want our children to develop physically in terms of their gross motor skills, their fine motor skills, and their locomotion skills.ldquoWe have apparatus on which they can hang, climb, and swing, to build up their core strength.Mr Rein called the schoolrsquos curriculum lsquoreally ambitions.rsquoldquoWe are one of sixteen innovation schools in Wales helping to implement the new curriculum and develop special projects to do with the curriculum, he said.ldquoWe have taken that on by focusing on a knowledge-rich curriculum, so that we develop childrenrsquos knowledge, skills, and give them fantastic experiences.ldquoWe have taken good, rich materials from lots of dferent places, and developed some of our own, which we have implemented to a high standard.ldquoBehaviour in the school is exemplary partly because we have spent a long time asking what good teachers do.ldquoWe practice together as staff, so our teachers are working at a high level using a very well-researched curriculum.In last yearrsquos maths reasoning test,  per cent of pupils at St Josephrsquos scored higher than the national average, and  per cent of pupils scored above average in the National Reading TestldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos, said Mr Rein.ldquoEverything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.The schoolrsquos curriculum has recently been praised by cabinet member for education and regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, who said St Josephrsquos had done a lsquobrilliant job.rsquoShe said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning.ldquoIt encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
