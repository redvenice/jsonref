With Netflix offering both time and cash, is that true anymore? It’s remarkable how many “unfilmable” books have been, well, filmed. With this week’s news that Neil Gaiman’s sprawling comic-book series The Sandman has been acquired by Netflix, fans have been excited, if tentative, no doubt remembering the long history of attempts to adapt the 75-issue story that was often dismissed as too difficult to get on screen.As Gaiman once said: “I’d rather see no Sandman movie made than a bad Sandman movie.” Multiple scripts were written throughout the 1990s, there was a TV show in 2010, a film in 2013, an attempted rewrite of that film in 2016 – but none of this means that Netflix’s latest literary project is doomed to fail.For “unfilmable” is often just code for “we tried and it didn’t happen”, an excuse for all the films trapped in development hell, such as John Milton’s Paradise Lost (Bradley Cooper was once lined up to play a hunky Lucifer), and the long-awaited adaptation of Cormac McCarthy’s Blood Meridian. “Unfilmable” can also mean “we tried and did a terrible job”. Stephen King’s Dark Tower series is not unfilmable, but the 2017 take starring Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey might make you wish it was. Or the maddening works of William Faulkner, most recently put on screen by actor James Franco, who took time off from insisting he can write novels to ruin someone else’s by directing, adapting and starring in As I Lay Dying in 2013 and The Sound and the Fury in 2015. Or Ayn Rand’s Atlas Shrugged: three films and three terrible decisions came in 2016 when reviews for part one (“sits there flapping on screen like a bludgeoned seal” declared Rolling Stone) did nothing to dissuade the great minds behind it, who turned their backs on the free-market to supply two sequels in the face of no demand. (Part two: “The film’s excruciating unwatchability transcends politics” part three: “Cut-rate to the point of incoherence.”) And unfilmable can even apply to books that prove to be brilliant on camera: the new TV show of Joseph Heller’s Catch-22, the Wachowski sisters’ take on David Mitchell’s Cloud Atlas, Paul Thomas Anderson’s 2015 film of Thomas Pynchon’s Inherent Vice.For many of the books that Hollywood once clinked together its last coppers over, Netflix is barrelling in with a cash cannon and letting it rain. Because unfilmable also means “unaffordable”. Aside from The Sandman (which is being billed as the most expensive TV show DC Comics has been involved in), Netflix has scooped up books that promise to be CGI-heavy (The Witcher, out later this year a Roald Dahl animated series).Unfilmable also works as a stand-in for another euphemistic label: “uncommercial”, which often just means “with subtitles”. This once got in the way of books such as Gabriel García Márquez’s One Hundred Years of Solitude, which the author insisted for years must be told in Spanish and would not work as one feature film. As one of his sons said earlier this year, when announcing Netflix was making a Spanish-language serial: “In the current golden age of series, with the level of talented writing and directing, the cinematic quality of content, and the acceptance by worldwide audiences of programmes in foreign languages, the time could not be better.”So has TV ended the age of the unfilmable book? Is any book truly limited to the page? Perhaps unfilmable now simply means books often declared “unreadable” – so a lot of modernist novels that are heavy with lyricism, ambience or internal dialogue: James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, Djuna Barnes. Or the obvious, impenetrable contenders with Matryoshka doll plots: Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace, Gravity’s Rainbow – Pynchon again – and Dhalgren by Samuel Delany. Or books with footnotes: House of Leaves by Mark Z Danielewski, Pale Fire by Vladimir Nabokov. (Though the recent AmazonBBC production of Good Omens, another Gaiman vehicle, proves it is possible to translate narrative meanderings on screen.) We’ll have to wait and watch."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c9879425193abc4eb4bdddb6d61d520720151f1/0_0_4630_2779/master/4630.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=013200f948ef3f8c3ccf568d1f629477","title":"google facebook investigated over dominance of uk digital advertising market","story":"Competition watchdog to investigate potential abuse of power and control of user dataThe UK competition watchdog has launched an investigation into the way Google and Facebook collect and exploit personal data and have used their power to dominate the £13bn UK digital advertising market.The Competition and Markets Authority’s wide-ranging investigation into online advertising will focus on the sector’s two biggest players, Google and Facebook, and look at whether “consumers are able and willing to control how data about them is used and collected”.The CMA said it planned to examine concerns about how online networks were using people’s personal data – Facebook has faced heavy criticism and scrutiny over both the Cambridge Analytica data scandal and its role in the dissemination of “fake news” – including “whether making this data available to advertisers in return for payment is producing good outcomes for consumers”.The CMA chair, Andrew Tyrie, said: “Much about these fast-changing markets is a closed book to most people. The work we do will open them up to greater scrutiny, and should give parliament and the public a better grip on what global online platforms are doing.”Last July, Facebook was fined £500,000 by the information commissioner – the maximum possible amount at the time – for a lack of transparency and failing to protect users’ information in relation to the Cambridge Analytica scandal.By 2020, Facebook will be bringing in an estimated £3.8bn in UK advertising spending – £1bn more than this year – and only slightly less than the value of the entire commercial TV market (£4bn).The CMA’s chief executive, Andrea Coscelli, said: “The market study will help us further lift the lid on how major online platforms work, especially how they collect and use personal data, how they monetise their content through digital advertising, and what this means for competition. The findings from this work will be used to influence the direction of policy and regulation in the digital sector.”In March the chancellor, Philip Hammond, called on the CMA to review the digital advertising market after recommendations made in an independent report for the Treasury by Jason Furman, who was Barack Obama’s chief economic adviser.The report concluded that a formal market study should be launched into the UK digital ad market which is “dominated by two players and suffers from a lack of transparency”.Last year, the world’s two biggest advertisers, Procter \u0026amp Gamble and Unilever, threatened to withdraw advertising from Facebook and Google’s YouTube unless the the social networks cleaned up the “swamp”.The review by Furman, now a Harvard professor, said a new digital markets unit should be set up in Whitehall staffed by people with technological expertise and equipped with the powers to set and enforce greater competition.The shadow culture secretary, Tom Watson, said: “For far too long, the digital market has been dominated and distorted by data monopolies.“Tech giants have thought themselves untouchable, unaccountable, and above the law. This is a necessary step towards bringing big tech to heel. Next, government must introduce strong safeguards and updated competition laws to ensure that online platforms work for everyone, not just the chief executives of Silicon Valley.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8967b82fa193026fb90d0ac4fd30a8be0ca78f45/271_4_4142_2485/master/4142.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ebe1ed6f9d907e22d9e8037cb0749bbf","title":"zdenek hrib the czech mayor who defied china taiwan","story":"By refusing to expel a Taiwanese diplomat, the Prague mayor has joined the ranks of local politicians confronting contentious national policiesZdeněk Hřib had been Prague’s mayor for little more than a month when he came face-to-face with the Czech capital’s complex entanglement with China.Hosting a meeting with foreign diplomats in the city, Hřib was asked by the Chinese ambassador to expel their Taiwanese counterpart from the gathering in deference to Beijing’s ‘one China’ policy, under which it claims sovereignty over the officially independent state of Taiwan.Given recent Chinese investments in the Czech Republic, which have included the acquisition of Slavia Prague football club, a major brewery and a stake in a private TV station, the fledgling mayor could have easily agreed. Prague city council had, under the preceding mayor, signed a twin cities agreement with Beijing that explicitly recognised the one China policy.Instead, Hřib refused and the Taiwanese diplomat stayed.The episode is a rare case of a local politician defying the might of a global superpower while making a principled stand against a national government policy that has promoted Chinese ties.It also adds him to the ranks of mayors who have confronted contentious national policies, including US Democrats such as Bill de Blasio of New York and Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles, who have opposed the anti-immigration drive of the US president, Donald Trump, and declared their fiefdoms sanctuary cities.Closer to home, Hřib’s conduct invites comparison with the late mayor of Gdańsk, Paweł Adamowicz, after whom he renamed a Prague street following Adamowicz’s murder in January. Adamowicz offered his city as a haven for refugees and adopted liberal positions at odds with the hardline policies of Poland’s conservative Law and Justice party (PIS) government.Hřib has since gone further, demanding Beijing officials drop the clause stating Prague’s support for the one China policy in the 2016 deal and threatening to scrap the arrangement if they refuse.“This article is a one-sided declaration that Prague agrees with and respects the one China policy and such a statement has no place in the sister cities agreement,” Hřib said in an interview in Prague’s new town hall, close to the city’s historic tourist district, which draws an increasing number of visitors from China.“The one China policy is a complicated matter of foreign politics between two countries. But we are solving our sister cities relationship on the level of two capital cities.”Hřib, a 38-year-old doctor who spent a medical training internship in Taiwan, is challenging the Czech president, Miloš Zeman, who has visited China several times, installed a Chinese adviser at his office in Prague castle and declared that he wanted to learn “how to stabilise society” from the country’s communist rulers.The dispute has catapulted the unassuming Hřib to household name status in Czech politics, helped by Prague’s position as an international cultural draw and its outsize share of national resources.Hřib’s rise from obscurity is striking because Czech mayors, unlike their US and Polish counterparts, are not directly elected. He became mayor of a coalition administration after his Pirate party, a liberal group with roots in civil society, finished second in last October’s municipal elections.He says he is merely adopting the policy of his party and its two coalition partners in taking decisions that are cooling Prague’s relations with Beijing.In March, his administration restored the practice of flying the Tibetan flag from Prague’s town hall, reinstating a tradition begun in the era of the Czech Republic’s first post-communist president, Václav Havel, that was dropped by the previous city administration. At the same time, in a move tailor-made to infuriate Beijing, Hřib hosted the visiting head of Tibet’s government-in-exile, Lobsang Sangay.An official visit to the Taiwanese capital, Taipei, followed. During the visit, Hřib criticised China for harvesting organs from political prisoners belonging to the Falun Gong movement.Threats of retaliation came soon afterwards. A planned tour of China by the Prague Philharmonia in September is in jeopardy after it rebuffed Beijing’s demands to repudiate the mayor.Iva Nevoralova, the orchestra’s spokesperson, likened the request to the actions of Czechoslovakia’s former communist regime, which pressured artists to denounce Havel’s dissident Charter 77 movement as the price for being allowed to perform.Speaking to the , Hřib questioned whether Prague’s arrangement with Beijing was a fair relationship and criticised China’s “social scoring” system for good citizenship. He suggested that investment from Taiwan, with its western-style democracy and record of technological innovation, offered greater benefit.The mayor has won praise for restoring the Czech Republic’s image as a champion of human rights and self-determination at a time when its politics have been dominated by the populist messages of Zeman and Andrej Babiš, the anti-immigration billionaire prime minister.“It is empowering to see that a mayor of Prague can have a principled position, despite large portions of the Czech political establishment being co-opted by the narratives spread by the totalitarian government of China,” said Jakub Janda, executive director of the European Values thinktank, which monitors anti-western influence in Czech politics and beyond.Jiří Pehe, the director of New York University in Prague, said Hřib was using the mayor’s office to reassert the values of Havel, who died in 2011. “Everyone in this country knows that when you support Taiwan and Tibet, you’re saying exactly what Havel used to say,” said Pehe. “This was intentional on the part of the Pirate party as soon as he took over Prague. They are saying that the Czech Republic has a special history of fighting against communism and you should respect it.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91115607aef07967ab5c39da7a11666b38e3d675/431_94_4811_2886/master/4811.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec419333407e245a8c2acb7d286bade9","title":"avoided private education not everyone so lucky adrian chiles","story":"There’s nothing worse than objecting to fee-paying schools while sending your own kids to one – but I have to admit I did itAt about 5pm on the hottest day of the year I was to be found clambering reluctantly into my little-used black tie attire. Ahead of me was an evening way out of my comfort zone: a leavers’ ball at a reassuringly expensive boarding school luxuriating in pastures green somewhere to the north-east of London. When you live on the western flank of the city, that’s an awful long way round.I am the worst kind of hypocrite when it comes to private education. I can boast – and I do boast – about my state education. But my school was in a relatively middle-class community outside Birmingham I wanted for nothing there. When my dad made some money, a plan was hatched to send my brother and I to something called, mysteriously, a “prep” school. We went to visit it. It looked like the kind of stately home we would be dragged round if we had people staying. We weren’t keen. We were ushered around by someone who, forbiddingly, called himself a “master”. At one point he said: “Yes, we push them very hard here.” My brother and I had heard enough. We fought tooth and nail over most things, but on this we were united. We moaned and sulked and threatened a sustained campaign of domestic disobedience. Sense was soon seen and we remained where we belonged, in a perfectly good state school.As for my kids, they went to the local state primary school and then, at 11, to a nearby fee-paying girls’ school. It wasn’t my idea, but I didn’t push a better one. Don’t judge me – or, actually, do judge me. Throw stuff at me in the street if you like, for parents such as me, the ones who cannot defend private education but then send their kids there, are the worst.Anyway, back to this leavers’ ball. The leaver in question was my friend’s son, who I care for very much. Walking through the gates felt like walking on to a location for a film in which every boarding school cliche had been overdone. There was a beautiful old building with an imposing clock tower eyeing the scene. Across an immaculate cricket pitch stood a splendid marquee, in front of which, parents and their now come-of-age sons and daughters gaily clinked glasses.I hugged our boy and he said: “See that clock face? If you hit it with a six you have to pay to repair it, but you get a whole year’s fees paid!”I said he should have bunged a visiting bowler a few quid to loop him a couple of dollies down the track to see what he could do. Greatly to their credit, this ruse had occurred to neither him nor his friends.I suppose I should regale you with tales of braying toffs brimming with entitlement. Maybe I could, but it wouldn’t be fair. Everyone I spoke to was charmed and charming, interesting and interested. At one point, a couple of nice ladies waved me over.“Mr Chiles, what on earth brings you here?”I explained and, for want of anything else to say, I told them we’d had a right old schlepp getting there from Chiswick. “Have you come far?” I ventured.“Bermuda,” they said.I couldn’t really think of much to say to that.• Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and  columnist"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c6dc585afbbdf160383709b5f72f082f41a60ef/0_214_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28313a6336245c51e7cef349dbad63cf","title":"brexit party meps uk brexiteers opening european parliament","story":"On Tuesday, Brexit party MEPs decided to take a stand against the undemocratic EU they’d been elected to democratically. Rather than do something frivolous such as returning their wages, they decided to turn their backs at the playing of the European anthem during the parliament’s opening ceremony, a move only slightly classier than mooning.When the 29 Brexiteers were elected to the European parliament, many were concerned that they wouldn’t represent the UK properly. And yet here they were on day one already crapping themselves for attention – and as such were representing the UK better than we possibly could have imagined. Shortly afterwards, Nigel Farage tweeted proudly “The Brexit party has already made its presence felt”, and he’s right, in the same way that a toddler smearing spaghetti on the walls of a fancy restaurant while repeating every swearword they know will grab the attention of their parents. Who knows what the party has in store next, but we should probably set our faces to apologetic cringe mode just in case. From the get-go the new MEPs have been looking for aspects of the EU “gravy train” to get outraged by while chugging down the gravy. Annunziata Rees-Mogg got the ball rolling a few weeks ago by tweeting disbelief that she had been given an iPad to do work on. A real “woman gets given work device to work on by work” shocker.What must the EU think of us at this point, based on the crop of clueless idiots we’ve sent to represent us? A woman so posh the first of her three names is Annunziata accepting paycheques but getting all hoity-toity whenever she is offered a pen, and a former lads’ mag supremo thinking the height of extravagance is having a parliament building at all, ganging up with 27 other absolute Widdecombes to remind everyone of Nazis in the Reichstag.Even the Lib Dems – who were meant to be our grownups – decided to arrive wearing “Bollocks to Brexit” tops, which, even if you agree with the sentiment, isn’t an obvious choice of clothing for your first day on a job. Maybe next time, instead of a profanity T-shirt, try wearing a nicely ironed tie?The shenanigans at the European parliament might not be the worst of it. When EU leaders look at the UK – a nation they told not to waste the extra time it has been given to sort this mess out – they see a leadership contest unfolding between one terrible foreign secretary who compared the EU to a Soviet prison and a slightly worse foreign secretary who compared the EU to Hitler. Both of whom are insisting that they’re so good at diplomacy that a new deal with the EU is all but guaranteed. From the inside, the contest feels a bit like watching drugged-up, half-crazed monkeys fighting for control of a clown car you’re in the back of.

This is the plot of A Very British Coup, a 1982 work of fiction by former Labour minister Chris Mullin that centres on the rise to power of plain-speaking Harry Perkins. Election euphoria has given way to turmoil and crisis. With Perkins deemed irretrievably unpopular, the media demands he stands aside for a more “moderate” colleague. At this moment, agents of the British state – supposedly impartial servants of the elected government – take the opportunity to strike.Now, there is not a single person in Corbyn’s circle who fears for his health he has a more vigorous fitness regime than most 20-year-olds. If Corbyn was “frail”, as briefed, his performance in the bearpit of prime minister’s questions would reveal it. Strikingly, the concerns about Corbyn’s health seem to merge with political objections to his agenda. “He needs to have a grasp of the domestic agenda in the 21st century, rather than living in the past,” one civil servant is quoted as saying.Park what you think about Corbyn for a moment. Britain is supposed to be a democracy. In a democracy, the civil service has to be studiously neutral. In the code they are supposed to follow, officials are told: “Ensure you have ministerial authorisation for any contact with the media”, and “act in a way which deserves and retains the confidence of ministers, while at the same time ensuring that you will be able to establish the same relationship with those whom you may be required to serve in some future government”. Briefing a newspaper about the unsuitability of the leader of the opposition is a flagrant violation of this code.Corbyn has written to the cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill, to ask for an independent investigation. Some commentators have asked why Labour is helping to keep a news story centring on Corbyn’s ill health running. But again: park your political sympathies. This threat must not be met with silence.Some critics of the contemporary left believe that it is conspiratorial. It is certainly true that there exists within it a strand of what could be called “conspiracism”, which holds that power is wielded by shadowy iniduals, rather than understanding capitalism as a system of competing power relations. This conspiracism is usually misplaced, and has its roots in the fact that socialism disappeared for a generation, re-emerging suddenly, without deep-rooted ideological or institutional underpinnings. It’s certainly not the case that establishment manoeuvrings are Labour’s sole block on power: for example, the party’s failure to clarify its Brexit stance risks severe self-harm.Yet sometimes conspiracies do exist, driven by self-preservation on the part of the powerful. Who would deny the Hillsborough cover-up was a conspiracy? What of collusion between the police, security services and loyalists in the murder of Catholics in Northern Ireland? Senior civil servants, clearly hostile to the left, breaking the civil service code to brief the Murdoch press ahead of a possible election is just as surely a conspiracy.There are two further reasons for the hostility towards Corbynism. The first is that the Labour leadership has an extra-parliamentary theory of change: it believes winning an election is insufficient, that mobilising people – through protests, direct action, strikes – plays an important role, too. The second is what can be described as the “anti-imperialist” tradition of key Labour figures, who believe western foreign policy is frequently dictated by economic self-interest. Both of these positions scare very powerful people. But again, perhaps you object to them, too perhaps you object to hiking taxes on the rich, or increased public investment, or the expansion of public ownership. It is irrelevant. The civil service is there to execute the policies of the elected government. If it reveals itself to be politically motivated, then this critical pillar of democracy must be questioned by us all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d381701b90ad4046f7d5d0cd9bc911ed644e548/0_136_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3827a0fc7e91d63845c16ac591fef320","title":"kimono western culture kim kardashian west","story":"It’s no surprise that Kim Kardashian West appropriated kimono to give sex appeal to her shapewear line, writes Akemi JohnsonThe two Asian women painted on the façade of the Irish pub outside the US military base in Okinawa, Japan, wore kimono. They lounged on a white-sand beach. Their black hair was coiled atop their heads, and their garments were falling open to reveal bare legs and cleavage.Never mind that the real women in that area didn’t dress like that. Instead of kimono and up-dos they sported colored contacts, blonde hair extensions, fake tans, and jeans. Never mind that kimono are ankle-length and high-necked, covered-up. To the artist or bar owner, the picture that would draw men inside, the epitome of desire, was the woman in the kimono – and an erotic style of kimono that doesn’t exist.It’s no surprise that Kim Kardashian West appropriated kimono to sell underwear. In the Western imagination, Asian women have long been sexualized, and an emblem of the Asian woman is the iconic Japanese gown.When American troops invaded Okinawa in April 1945, the specter of the sexualized Asian woman already existed. “The pigs and chickens are okay,” one marine told a Chicago Daily Tribune reporter, shortly after the American landing, “but I’m disappointed in the girls. They’re not what they told me.” Implying a surprised disgust, the reporter goes on to describe local women bathing and washing their clothes in a roadside trough.These were women caught between opposing forces on a battlefield, tasked with fighting for their lives amid a “typhoon of steel”. And yet these American invaders saw them only in sexual terms, evaluated alongside livestock.This viewpoint continued in the aftermath of the battle, when Okinawan survivors were traumatized and destitute. “Hubba! Hubba!” reads a caption in a US military souvenir booklet produced just after the war. The photo is of an Okinawan woman dressed in worn clothes and sandals, her baby strapped to her back.Maybe Kardashian West’s attempt to name her shapewear line Kimono was a marketing stunt – with the backlash, how many of us have now seen her nude bodysuits – or maybe the word seemed to offer up the exoticism, the sex appeal, she was looking for.In Japan, the kimono means something very different than in the West. In the country today, kimono are formal wear. Often made of silk and costing upwards of a thousand dollars, a kimono is attire for a wedding, a graduation, or other special occasion. It connotes not sex, but tradition and elegance.Japanese Americans also joined the #KimOhNo outcry, but for those of us of Japanese heritage in the States, the kimono can have a more complicated symbolism. My own relationship to the style of clothing began as a toddler, when my mother first dressed me up in a mini kimono-like garment. When I was in third grade, my great-grandmother, who had immigrated to the United States from Hiroshima, visited my school to demonstrate the tricky process of putting a kimono on.Years later, studying abroad in Kyoto in college, my first time to Japan, I tried on an authentic kimono myself, when my classmates and I rented them for a day. “It looks better if your geta are too small,” the Japanese woman dressing me said. Wearing too-small shoes was just one way the kimono-wearing experience was physically restrictive. In the tight column of fabric, I tottered around the city’s historic streets.To the tourists who snapped photos of me that day, I may have looked like a traditional Japanese woman, a titillating figure straight from the pages of Memoirs of a Geisha. But I knew to the natives of the city even the classic Japanese gown wouldn’t cause them to see past my mixed-race face and American ways. Even wearing a kimono, I wasn’t truly Japanese.The Japanese American artist Judy Shintani has a series called “Deconstructed Kimonos”. Shintani transforms kimono by cutting away patterns in the fabric, reducing them to shreds. “My alterations reflect the loosening connection to my ancestry and culture,” she writes, and she evokes the intense pressure Japanese Americans felt to assimilate during the second world war. After Pearl Harbor, her family and many others, including mine, made bonfires out of anything deemed Japanese. Into the flames went Japanese scrolls, books, and kimono.As a symbol of Japanese American culture, Shintani’s shredded kimono feels fitting. Ravaged by a life in America, it, as Shintani writes, “is reduced to a skeleton, a web” – yet still retains the outlines of its original form.This is what America has done to the kimono. Kardashian West may have announced her intention to rename her brand, but the story of the kimono here has already been rewritten.Still, just the other day, a Japanese American friend gifted me a bright pink, tiny jinbei for my infant daughter. A mixed-race, fifth-generation Japanese American, my daughter will wear the cotton, kimono-like onesie to a summer obon festival. I imagine that, years from now, she can look back at a photo of herself in it and decide what the garment means to her."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6db05025678b7439daa8a22f9bb6abe5e4a25cb/0_128_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2952b477ccb3633ad7d123858ec0fab","title":"soho unhealthiest place in britain other pleasures","story":"Soho has been ranked as the unhealthiest place to live in Britain – shock news that sends bears hurtling into the woods and the pope saying his rosary: in other words, no shit, Sherlock. Too many opportunities to get boozed up and fill your belly with calorific takeaways, and very few parks and green spaces in which to counter the excess and choking pollution, do not a Swiss sanatorium make.Nobody goes to Soho to get healthy, despite the recent arrival of the odd green-juice bar. They go to live the life of the flâneur, to soak up the psychic energy that generations of incomers – from 17th-century French Huguenots to the proprietors and staff of numerous Italian and Chinese restaurants, from music-hall artistes to struggling writers and artists – have imprinted into this tiny network of streets and alleys.But the milieu that causes dysfunction also provides its cure, as Thomas de Quincey discovered some 200 years ago. In Confessions of an English Opium-Eater, the writer recalls having a funny turn and being ministered to by Ann, a sex worker of his acquaintance: “One night, when we were pacing slowly along Oxford Street, and after a day when I had felt more than usually ill and faint, I requested her to turn off with me into Soho Square. Thither we went, and we sat down on the steps of a house, which to this hour I never pass without a pang of grief and an inner act of homage to the spirit of that unhappy girl, in memory of the noble action which she there performed.”The “noble action” was to fetch him a glass of port wine and spices from one of the area’s many hostelries, which revivifying draught enabled him to continue his vital researches into the transformative powers of laudanum and to bring us one of the earliest and most astute examples of addiction literature.For those of a certain cast of mind, to walk around Soho now is to walk among ghosts. At one end, just down from Liberty’s department store and the garish delights of Carnaby Street, stands the water pump that John Snow isolated as the cause of an outbreak of cholera in 1854, transforming our understanding of the spread of disease and the public health procedures that could mitigate it at the other, now defunct establishments such as the Hungarian restaurant The Gay Hussar, the Coach and Horses pub – gone only in the past fortnight – and the Colony Room Club, where foul-mouthed hostess Muriel Belcher served endless drinks to the likes of Francis Bacon and George Melly after the pubs had shut up shop for the afternoon.And yet we might balk at placing too great a premium on the “health” of an area, or at least put forward different ideas of what might constitute healthy. Soho would indeed score pretty low on the fresh-air index, but it would certainly go through the roof when it came to personal liberation for confirmation, ask any member of the gay community who found a safe haven on Old Compton Street during the more repressive 1970s and 80s. It’s why the Admiral Duncan pub, bombed by a neo-Nazi in 1999, refused to remove its pride flags when they were deemed to contravene planning regulations several years later.The threat, then, might not be the absence of bucolic pleasures – for those, you can jump on a train from nearby Charing Cross and be by the seaside in a couple of hours – but the homogeneity caused by sky-high business rates and the encroachment of chain restaurants and bars. A sanitised Soho – devoid of the roiling masses, the late-night dramas, the rubbish and detritus of near-24-hour city life – would be a poor thing indeed, however much it might send the area shooting up the clean-living ratings.And as much as the recent survey’s top-rated spot – Great Torrington in north Devon – undoubtedly boasts its own enchantments, the ability to drink a cappuccino from Bar Italia at 3am while watching a posse of drag queens make their way exhaustedly, but still fabulously, to the night bus sure ain’t one of them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59db3337c95c5103a7510db1f650ba4adef2cc27/0_0_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5f61464eb4b63c93d1f62d7d02625b6","title":"the guardian view on assisted dying the law is flawed","story":"MPs need to look again at legislation which currently allows no humane option for the families of a terminally ill patient“The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilised community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others,” wrote John Stuart Mill in his essay On Liberty, which has come to underpin liberal thought. The philosopher went on: “Over himself, over his own body and mind, the inidual is sovereign.” Though this standpoint is accepted in many parts of the law, in one crucial regard it is not: a terminally ill and suffering patient cannot be offered direct help in dying with dignity at a time or place of their choice. Those who break the law by assisting can face up to 14 years in prison.This threat hangs over the grieving families who travel from the UK to Switzerland for an assisted death: one each week. There are thought to be scores of cases in Britain where the terminally ill take their own lives in awful circumstances. The issue is one that brushes everyone we all have to experience the death of people about whom we care deeply. We all have to contemplate our own death.At present the director of public prosecutions, an inidual who holds office for a term of five years, effectively acts like a judge: deciding whether or not a person is guilty of hastening the death of terminally ill patients who wish to spare themselves and their loved ones from the final, crippling stages of degenerating health. It is the DPP who determines, via their own guidelines, whether or not a family member was motivated by compassion rather than pecuniary gain whether or not the assistance was minor whether or not they had reluctantly helped.This cannot be right. Courts need laws that draw the boundaries clearly between what is right and what is wrong. It cannot be up to the DPP to decide. In 2015 lawmakers rejected a private member’s bill which would have allowed “competent” adults with fewer than six months to live to seek professional help to kill themselves. Yet the issue has not gone away. Last November the supreme court dismissed an emergency application to hear a right-to-die case challenging the legal ban on assisted dying, but said that the matter was of “transcendent public importance”. On Thursday parliamentarians have a chance to restart that conversation with a Commons debate.Not only is public opinion moving ahead of the law in the UK, but parts of Europe and the United States have shown that it is possible to regulate rather than prohibit. A humane option in this regard is needed as the nation’s population of older adults is growing. There are important considerations about how, if the law was changed, vulnerable people could be insulated from insidious pressures and how trust in the medical profession could be maintained. Lawmakers are the right people to find the balance between personal autonomy and how paternalistic the state should be towards its citizens in this regard. A law that is near-impossible to implement, ethically and practically, ought to be looked at again by MPs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/304d0e087810e4968a898f9c79605329523ba3ec/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21b17e9b2da686bd7e072e51832f39ae","title":"ashes to ashes 20 how womens cricket developed to embrace new formats","story":"Ahead of this summer’s Women’s Ashes tour, Kalika Mehta takes a look back at the tournament’s history, from its unofficial beginning in the 1930sAlthough women’s competitive cricket dates back to the foundation of the Women’s Cricket Association (WCA) in 1926, it wasn’t until eight years later that an England team set sail for Australia for their first “unofficial” Ashes tour.With the hosts refusing to pay travel expenses, the team consisted of players who could afford the considerable £80 – nearly £5,000 in modern-day terms – charged by the WCA. If that didn’t rule out a large enough section of society, married women were also barred from selection – on the grounds that it would not be appropriate for them to be away from home for a six-month tour.The youthful team – all were under 25 – set off for Australia with a squad of seven teachers or future teachers, two secretaries, an art student, a lawyer, a nurse, and three “ladies of leisure” – plus Myrtle Maclagan, who was employed by the army.Having agreed to not smoke, drink, gamble or find themselves “accompanied by a man”, England’s players were also far more prepared than their Australian counterparts, who only began searching for players 28 days before the first Test was due to begin.Unsurprisingly, England romped to victory. All-rounder Maclagan sent down a searing spell to earn figures of 7-10 and rattle out Australia for 47 in the first innings – picking up the first five-wicket haul in a women’s international in the process.Maclagan followed that up with another impressive milestone, hitting 72 of the visitors’ first-innings score of 154. Though the home side were more resilient with the bat at the second time of asking, England comfortably knocked off the required 32 runs to secure a nine-wicket win.The second Test at the historic Sydney Cricket Ground followed much the same pattern. Maclagan’s century in England’s first innings was the highlight of a match that saw the visitors requiring just 10 runs in the second innings.Although this eight-wicket victory sealed the series, there was no trophy for England captain Betty Archdale to raise in triumph – the WCA’s founding constitution, set out in 1930, proclaimed that “no member of any affiliated club shall take part in any cricket challenge cup or prize competition”.England retained the Ashes on home soil in 1937 after a drawn series and the second world war put paid to the scheduled 1939-40 Ashes it wasn’t until the winter of 1948-49 that England’s players set out for Australia once more. This time around, the hosts were much better prepared. The team were fitter and more skilful, and the crowd of 17,025 across three days in Adelaide – still the highest for a women’s Test in Australia – cheered on a comprehensive 186-run victory, which gave the Australians a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.Australian all-rounder Betty Wilson – who turned down three marriage proposals during the  of her international career in order to continue playing cricket – was the undoubted star of the Test. Her brilliant knock of 111 – ended by run-out – was followed by a six-wicket haul, then 3-39 in the second innings.Although the following Tests were more competitive, two draws earned Australia’s women their maiden Ashes series victory. Scoring 268 runs and picking up an impressive 16 wickets across the three matches, Wilson stood head and shoulders above the rest of the players. But still no trophy.It took 34 more Tests and more than 64 years for England and Australia’s women to have something to fight over. In 1998, a miniature bat was burned in a wok in the Harris Garden at Lord’s on July 20, and the ashes were placed in a small wooden trophy.Also in the wok was a copy of the WCA constitution and rulebook – the WCA was finished, having voted to merge with the newly formed England and Wales Cricket Board, and it seemed only right that its “no prize” rule go up in smoke.England were unable to break Australia’s dominance at that stage, however, and the Southern Stars retained the Ashes until 2005 (which some will remember as a good year for the men too).In 2013, the Ashes changed from being Test-only to consist of one Test, three one-day internationals and three T20 Internationals. Six points were awarded for a Test win, or two points for a draw, with two points awarded for a limited-over win and one for a draw.Although the Test match in 2013 was drawn, England triumphed in two ODIs and three T20s to win the home series 12-4 and reclaim the Ashes. A second – but closer – series win followed in Australia, less than six months later, before the format was tweaked in 2015 to reduce a Test win to four points Australia have won then retained the Ashes since.While so much of women’s sport struggles to emerge from the shadows of the men’s game, or strives to emulate it, the Women’s Ashes has always forged its own path, with four-day Tests – an option often discussed for the men’s game – and now an exciting multi-format competition that has opened up new audiences.But it would be nothing without the players, and these days those players come from all walks of life. Cricket Charity Chance to Shine has introduced 4 million state school children to the game since 2005, 2 million of whom are girls, and NatWest has partnered with the charity to ensure this important work continues.

Queues are much shorter at major attractions such as Niagara Falls, so why not take a Hornblower Niagara Cruise, a ride on Niagara Helicopters or a thrilling MistRider zipline ride? The spring weather is ideal for bike tours of Niagara’s wineries, distilleries and craft breweries, such as Niagara Oast House Brewers.If you would like to see where maple syrup comes from, around March is the time to join a Sugar Bush tour to see how the trees are tapped or find a pancake festival in April to enjoy the end product. This season is also a good time to go hiking before the crowds come out and the weather heats up. The Bruce Trail (Unesco biosphere designated) stretches from the Niagara Escarpment to Tobermory, 500 miles of scenic trails, while you don’t even need to leave Toronto to hike the forested slopes of the 16 hectare (40-acre) High park.Summer unofficially starts on the third weekend of May with the Victoria Day holiday marking Queen Victoria’s birthday. It’s the start of cottage season, when all roads lead to Georgian Bay, Muskoka or Lake Simcoe, for barbecues, watersports and weekend partying at Ontarians’ seasonal residences. With the weather hot and humid, Ontario has endless supplies of water to cool off in paddle or cruise around the 1,000 Islands near Kingston, sail on the Great Lakes, or enjoy a canoe or kayak adventure on one of the many lakes or rivers in Muskoka. Whitewater raft just 90 minutes from Ottawa, along the Ottawa River or take a LeBoat cruiser along the Rideau canal to Kingston.Don’t miss the waterways of Algonquin park – Justin Trudeau spent his childhood summers here. Like living life on two wheels? Then Manitoulin Island on Lake Huron in Northern Ontario is the place to be, with over 800km of road-biking routes.Summer is the peak season for festivals – starting with the major fun around Canada Day on 1 July anywhere in Ontario, and then you have choices that range from the Niagara wine festival to TIFF (Toronto international film festival), taking in Nuit Blanche art projects at major art venues, and even music and food truck festivals. Let’s not forget Glengarry Highland Games, the Whitchurch-Stouffville strawberry festival and the Toronto Summerlicious food festival, where more than 200 restaurants offer specially priced set menus, among many others.As the leaves start to fall, enjoy the abundance of colours in Ontario’s thousands of miles of forest. Allow two weeks for a proper fly-drive tour from Toronto of highlights including Niagara, Blue Mountain, Muskoka, Algonquin park, Ottawa, 1,000 Islands and Prince Edward County. September and October are also prime times for spotting the northern lights ride the Polar Bear Express  from Cochrane to Moosonee for your best chance of catching this natural phenomenon.In Ottawa, this is a good time to visit the National Gallery of Canada, the city’s premier art collection, or the fascinating Canadian Museum of History, the most visited museum in the country. Take a cycle tour to explore the capital’s many interesting neighbourhoods such as Byward Market and Centretown, indulge in a craft brewery tour or a food tour (or both!). Overindulgence in good food and drink peaks around Canada’s Thanksgiving in October. Major events to look out for include the Blue Mountains apple harvest festival, Bala cranberry festival, and Kitchener-Waterloo Oktoberfest. Many small towns have their own homely harvest and pumpkin festivals, complete with family fun such as traditional music and ploughing matches.As the snowfall peaks, ice hockey fills the TV schedules but it’s even more fun to get out and enjoy the winter wonderland for yourself. This is the time of year when the mist and spray off Niagara Falls freezes on the rocks, adding to the spectacle. For skiing, Blue Mountain is Ontario’s largest resort and great for beginners. Resorts in the Blue Mountain region or Muskoka, such as the luxurious JW Marriott Rosseau, Sherwood Inn, and Cedar Grove Lodge, or Deerhurst in Huntsville offer activities including cross-country skiing, skating, snow shoeing, snowmobiling and dog sledding, with a whole menu of spa treatments to ease any tired muscles.Ontario’s many spas include award-winning ones in Niagara and Prince Edward County, perfect for a break at any time of year but even cosier when the weather is chilly outside. At St Anne’s spa, 90 minutes from Toronto, you can even get wrapped in hot chocolate. For festive festivals, look out for Winterlude in Ottawa, with ice-carving, skating and curling the Icewine festival in Niagara Falls (which also celebrates its food), Winterlicious in Toronto (more seasonal culinary delights!), and Sault Sainte Marie’s Winter Carnival Bon Soo, complete with polar bear swims (where you swim like one, through an ice hole, rather than with one).Discover more of what Ontario has on offer all year round with Canadian Affair."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ad5a896eb4935a5b666ccdff67338c37e6b85fd/0_109_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=686073bd5b0c4a376e790b918d857a2f","title":"visit wales 12 of the best welsh beaches","story":"The coastline of Wales is dotted with more than 100 beaches, many of them award-winning.

The second day of strike action follows a walkout last week, with union members saying the school has not done enough to help teachers deal with poor behaviour.The NASUWT union, which has 18 members on strike, said not enough progress had been made at a meeting with the local authority on Tuesday.Chris Keates, the general secretary of the NASUWT, said: “Unfortunately insufficient progress was made at the meeting towards addressing our members’ concerns and, therefore, the strike action planned for Wednesday 3 July will proceed as planned.“There will be no picket at the school on this occasion as the members will be having a private meeting to review the position, discuss all of the outstanding issues which remain to be addressed, and consider the next stage in the dispute.”After last week’s strike, the headteacher, Satnam Dosanjh, sent a letter to parents saying pupil behaviour was “well managed” and the school environment “continues to be safe for both pupils and staff”.Dosanjh wrote that while there had been “isolated incidents of knife possession in school”, they were extremely rare. Panic buttons that were fitted in the school were later removed after teachers claimed that no one responded to them when pressed, according to the Birmingham Mail.The school in South Yardley, east Birmingham, more than doubled in size in 2016, expanding from a primary school to an “all-through” school with pupils ranging in age from three to 16.It has been rated outstanding by Ofsted since 2012, and a report last year praised it for its “exceptional ethos, care and quality of education”. The report highlighted that many of the pupils had had a disrupted education, some with no prior experience of formal schooling.The NASUWT is calling for the school to introduce risk assessments for inidual pupils, knife audits and training for staff.Councillor Jayne Francis said Birmingham city council took all concerns regarding safety very seriously but that visiting council officers had not found any immediate safety concerns at the school. “Issues reported by the trade unions regarding Starbank school have been listened to and actioned,” she said. “Regrettably, we anticipate a very small number of teaching staff from NASUWT to still take action. We are deeply disappointed with this outcome and with the distraction from the students’ education which this causes.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031a767a117d6b264da5c7c854616ce2dccbffcd/0_0_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aea9d1b980899dd8e1f71b74fd161b9e","title":"ten common myths about bike lanes and why theyre wrong","story":"From congestion to cost, there are many entirely misguided arguments in circulationCycle lanes have been in the news recently, as have the many often entirely misguided arguments that opponents use against them.For all the (slight) progress in some UK cities over mass cycling, we are still at a stage where a leaflet from a local branch of the party of government (see below) will state falsehoods about bike lanes as if they were the undoubted truth.So perhaps it’s time to demolish 10 of the most common myths about cycle infrastructure. Do by all means suggest more in the comments below.This is perhaps the most common myth, possibly because critics confuse what feels like it’s true with what actually is true: the assumption that if you take some road space from motor vehicles, you get more traffic jams – as with (a commonly used parallel) forcing water down a smaller pipe.But fluid and traffic are not the same thing, as shown by 60 years of governments trying and failing to road-build their way out of congestion. The idea of induced demand – more road space brings more cars – has been known for decades, and it also works in reverse. This is especially so with bike lanes, which are such an efficient use of the same space that they can often mean the same amount of space carrying more people overall.Yes, traffic jams have worsened in some cities where bike lanes have been built, but studies show this is largely down to other factors, for example the growth in the number of Uber-type private hire vehicles and Amazon delivery vans.Most compelling of all, of course, is the fact that motor vehicles cause the congestion in the first place, and the only real way to reduce traffic congestion is to have fewer of them on the roads.It seems that on Twitter you’re never more than 10 minutes away from seeing a bike lane critic post a photo of an empty cycle route with the triumphant message: “See?!” Often this is just a cunningly timed picture, but other factors are at play, not least the efficiency of cycle lanes, which means any “traffic” tends to rapidly bunch up at red lights.Around the world, in just about every city where proper cycle routes have been built, many more riders start using them. One classic example is Seville in southern Spain, where the recent construction of 50 miles of bike lanes led to an 11-fold increase in rider numbers.The myth-busting here comes in two parts: first, it’s not as true as some argue, and second, where it is an issue, this is a sign that you need more safe cycling routes, not fewer.But yes, poorer people and those from minority ethnic backgrounds do ride bikes. Transport for London statistics show the ethnic mix of the city’s cyclists roughly matches that of the population. In the US, the group most like to cycle (or walk) to work are those from households with incomes of less than $10,000 (£7,930) a year – ie the very poor.The other thing to stress is that the more obviously safe the cycling in your town or city, the more erse and mixed the people on bikes. Without proper infrastructure, cycling becomes something of a specialist pursuit, mainly restricted to what you might call the hobbyists – people with the more expensive bike, the greater confidence and the willingness to mix it with motor traffic.The converse is seen in places such as the Netherlands and Denmark: while “cyclists” – people who have a drawerful of Lycra and an interest in gear ratios – do exist, they’re a different breed from the mass of everyday transport riders, who in socioeconomic terms encompass more or less everyone from royalty downwards.A series of barely connected bike lanes, such as in London, might be fine for commuters but people who make more varied journeys – for example those (disproportionately women) who need to go to work via a school and back via a shop – require a coherent network, including the other half of the safe-cycling equation, tamed backstreets, where cars are reduced in number and travel at slow speeds.Some of the noisiest opponents of recent London bike lanes have been inidual business owners, who argue that a separated bike lane and any loss of parking will be fatal to their enterprise.In broad terms, however, this is completely wrong. Towns, cities and inidual high streets are changing in how they compete. The growth of internet shopping means they must appeal more as destinations, which is hard to do amid wall-to-wall traffic.Studies have shown that shop owners tend to overestimate the proportion of customers who arrive by car, and that consumers on bikes often purchase more in the long term.Perhaps the most comprehensive study of the real-world impact of cycle lanes, undertaken in New York City, found businesses on streets with separated bike routes grew on average more quickly than those without. In contrast, I know of no evidence that points the other way.A surprisingly common charge – surprising in that it has absolutely no basis in logic, let alone reality. Sure, some elements of cycle lane design might seem new to Britons – for example, “floating” bus stops where passengers cross a cycle lane to reach them – but when they’re designed well there is no evidence they cause danger.More basically, there’s no getting away from the fact that motor vehicles are much, much, much more dangerous. On average each year in the UK between zero and two pedestrians die after being hit by bikes. About 400 a year die after being hit by motor vehicles, including more than 60 struck while on the pavement.As cannot be repeated enough, this is not about cyclists being somehow morally pure. It’s just physics. It’s possible to kill or maim someone if you are a 100kg-ish bike-and-human combination travelling at 12mph, but is extremely unlikely. In a 1.5-tonne SUV at 35mph, it is hideously easy.This is such a silly idea it’s baffling that it still needs regular debunking. People break road laws, on all forms of road transport, and if anything they do so more often on average in motor vehicles.See also: “My 85-year-old granny has two plastic hips and walks with a Zimmer frame – how do you expect her to ride everywhere?”The most tempting response to this is a deep sigh: no one to my knowledge has suggested that if you build safe cycling routes, that will be the only form of transport on offer, let alone compulsory. And while there’s a wider case for removing private cars from urban areas, even if you build cycling infrastructure then roads and cars – as well as buses – will still exist. They will also move more freely for those who really need them.Regarding heavy loads: again, no one says all road freight must vanish. But it’s also worth noting that cargo bikes or trailers, especially with electric-assist, can carry heavy loads – even that hypothetical fridge. Some tradespeople, even supermarkets, already use cargo bikes, particularly in big cities where distances are shorter and parking scarce. More widely there is huge potential scope for “last mile” deliveries, especially of Amazon-size packages, to be moved from vans to cargo bikes.The slightly trite riposte is that at one point even the Netherlands was not the Netherlands. In the early 1970s the Dutch had some of the worst cycling casualty rates in the world, as roads used for decades by cyclists were filled with more and more cars. This prompted a mass protest movement, the result of which was 40-plus years of building safe infrastructure. Ultimately, it’s about political will.See also: “But the NetherlandsDenmark are flat.” Yes, they are, though a classic Dutch headwind can feel like riding up a steep incline. But this is also by no means a deal breaker, especially in the e-bike era. Bristol, for example, has relatively high rates of cycling for the UK, and it’s not exactly flat.See also: “Ah, but LondonEdinburghyou name it are old cities with narrow streets.” This is perhaps the most desperate plea of the lot. It’s not as if Amsterdam or Copenhagen are Milton Keynes.Amazingly, this does get said, often accompanied by the curiously enduring myth that cyclists “don’t pay for the roads”.As Chris Boardman, the cycle campaigner turned cycle tsar for Greater Manchester, noted last month, his planned revamp of the region would cost £1.5bn and would deliver 1,800 miles of safer cycling. That might sound a lot, he said, until you remember that the government has agreed to spend £1.4bn improving a single roundabout in Bedfordshire. So yes, by transport standards, cycling is an absolute bargain.This is, in effect, the message of the critics: not this, not now – let’s try to get away with unambitious schemes without proper infrastructure, which will never change much.You could write a whole column – even a book – about why this is absurd, but it’s always worth stressing this point to the cycling naysayers: OK, what’s your solution to gridlock, pollution, a climate emergency to cities that are noisy, dangerous and unjust? They will not respond, because there is no answer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/355227d380afb0b675233291dd59e26004184671/1435_517_1518_911/master/1518.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14c4d9b274567a7f5d3a8378d895538b","title":"lottie moss outfit want ex to see you wearing sister kate","story":"Kate Moss’s younger half-sister says she is usually happiest in flat shoes and a big leather jacket, but enjoyed dressing as her ‘sophisticated alter-ago’ at the V\u0026ampAThis is the look I wore to the opening of the Christian Dior: Designer of Dreams exhibition at the V\u0026ampA in London at the beginning of the year.

Ari Aster is the film-maker who made his feature debut just last year with the chiller Hereditary, and now presents us with this fantastically sinister and self-aware Euro-bacchanal, clearly inspired by the 1973 classic The Wicker Man. And that is not the only riff. When Hereditary came out, I guessed (correctly, as it turned out) that the director was thinking about Bergman’s Cries and Whispers. I’m now going to bet 20p that before shooting Midsommar, Aster took another look at Tarkovsky’s The Sacrifice.Midsommar is an outrageous black-comic carnival of agony, starring charismatic Florence Pugh in a comely robe and floral headdress. It features funny-tasting pies and chorally assisted ritual sex, with pagan celebrants gazing into the middle distance and warbling as solemnly as the young dudes in the Coca-Cola TV ad about teaching the world to sing. It’s all set in an eerily beautiful sunlit plain, bounded by forests and lakes. This is supposed to be somewhere in northern Sweden, but was filmed in Hungary, and Aster, cinematographer Pawel Pogorzelski and production designer Henrik Svensson have collaborated on what are surely digitally assisted images: the sky and fields becoming a bouquet of vivid and beautiful blues and greens. The music from British composer Bobby Krlic (AKA the Haxan Cloak) is sensually creepy.It’s a thoroughly enjoyable film, a crescendo of paranoid trippiness building to an uproarious grossout in its final moments – of which the poster image, incidentally, gives you no clue. Once we are in that weirdly unreal Swedish clearing, the narrative turbulence clears and things appear initially as calm as a millpond. Yet there is a point to that becalmedness. It helps create the ambient disquiet.Pugh is very good as Dani, a young woman in a failing, clingy relationship with Cameron (Jack Reynor), and when a family tragedy plunges her into a terrible depression, Cameron realises that he can hardly now take the course that some of his friends had been urging: that is – dump her. So, with a heavy heart, and to his friends’ dismay, Cameron asks her along on the summer trip he and the guys had been planning: a visit to a remote rural Swedish community for the “Midsommar” festival that happens only every 90 years and is a huge secret from the rest of the world.They only know about it because Cameron’s sweet-faced friend Pelle (Vilhelm Blomgren) comes from this community and they all are to be his guests. He is very attentive to Dani and is the model of gentlemanly graciousness. This is in contrast to Cameron and his boorish buddies, some of whom are would-be graduate students, planning to write doctoral theses on pagan rituals and hoping that the “midsommar” event will provide gloriously undiscovered primary research material. And in a way it will.When they all arrive, Dani’s mood miraculously begins to lift: the strange traditions and quaint white robes are enchanting. It seems like a heaven-sent cure. But wait. The shrooms she is invited to take induce weird feelings and the village elders are a bit evasive about what precise form the ceremonies will take. It’s kind of strange that, as she dances round the maypole with the other womenfolk, Dani discovers that she can speak Swedish. And the central plain is dominated by what looks like a florally decorated crucifix with wrist-sized loops on either side of the crossbeam. Uh oh.Midsommar combines mischief with a sensual surrender to fear and a dreamlike loosening of your grasp on reality. The Scandinavian setting gives hints of the various sacrificial moments in Roy Andersson’s Songs from the Second Floor (2000) or maybe even Carl Theodor Dreyer’s Day of Wrath (1943).The juxtaposition of the bright sunshine of the film’s main event with the dreary winter snow of its opening scenes is nicely managed. It’s a clever cut when Dani runs sobbing to the bathroom, the door slams shut and you realise you’re not where you thought you were. This solstice of savagery is its own reward. It would be great if the trailer gave us some hints of the yuckiest moments, together with a booming bass voiceover: “This sommar …”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd1901e326e69c624b6cd2032fdba1bcc2e0b7fe/0_6_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6281de191a4b297c31c2e2be173180a6","title":"kim joys recipe for duck pond themed pavlova","story":"Dive into a luxury cream and coulis-filled meringue, with suitably quackers decorationIf you can make a pavlova (or even if you haven’t made meringue before), you can definitely make this decorated version.

Fluffy, yet deliciously sticky, it’s a proper crowdpleaser.175g butter, softened, plus a little extra to grease2 unwaxed lemons175g caster sugarFine salt3 eggs100g self-raising flour75g ground almondsA little milk100g demerara sugarGrease a 2lb loaf tin (ie, one measuring about 23cm x 13cm x 7cm) with butter or oil, and line with greaseproof paper. Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)350Fgas 4.Zest the lemons – if you haven’t got unwaxed (or organic) ones, give them a good scrub with hot water to remove some of the wax first, because this will give a better flavour.If you’ve forgotten to take the butter out of the fridge, cut it into cubes and leave it near the warm oven or give it a few good whacks with a rolling pin to help it on its way. (Microwaving will just melt the outside, which isn’t ideal.) Put the cubed butter in a large bowl, or in the bowl of a food mixer, with the caster sugar, a pinch of fine salt and half the lemon zest.Use electric beaters to beat the butter and sugar mix until it’s really light and fluffy, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary this should take about five minutes. You can do this with a wooden spoon, but it will take a while, because you want to get as much air into the mix as possible.Beat together the eggs in a jug, then beat them into the butter and sugar mixture a little at a time, making sure each addition is thoroughly incorporated before adding any more. If the mixture threatens to curdle at any point, add a little of the flour to bring it back to a smooth consistency.Tip the flour into a sieve and sift it on top of the butter and sugar mixture – though this is not vital, it will help to give a lighter, fluffier result, so I’d recommend it. Use a large metal spoon gently to fold in the flour with a slow, figure-of-eight motion, being careful to knock as little air out of the mix as possible.Put the ground almonds in a bowl, give them a quick whisk to break up any lumps, then fold into the batter in the same way as the flour. Gradually mix in just enough milk to thin down the batter to a consistency that will reluctantly drop off a spoon.Pour the batter into the prepared tin and gently level the top. Put in the hot oven and bake for about 50-55 minutes, or until the top is golden and risen, and a skewer pushed into the centre comes out clean, or at least without any wet batter clinging to it a few crumbs are fine.Juice both lemons and mix this with the demerara sugar and the remaining lemon zest. Leave the cake in the tin, and poke small holes evenly all over the top, then pour over the drizzle bit by bit, waiting for it be absorbed before adding any more. Leave the cake to cool in its tin before turning out.This cake is an easy one to customise: swap lemon for other citrus fruits or add a dash of gin or vodka to the drizzle or make a spiced version by bringing the demerara sugar to a boil with 100ml water, the lemon zest and a tablespoon of squashed cardamom pods until the sugar dissolves, then turn off the heat and leave to infuse while the cake bakes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18ec6a7e0a2de3dbcc1a90b024838efdff5b99f3/0_337_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b38affd624ee483f5feebd2ba3a144f","title":"how womens world cup has given a real buzz to girls football","story":"Experience of one north London school highlights impact of England team’s success For 14-year-old Keira Drummond, the best and most difficult moments of the women’s World Cup came within an hour of each other. “When England scored the equaliser, I was so happy because I really thought we would get into the final and that would have massively changed how people see the game,” she said. To her dismay, the England team crashed out of the tournament after Ellen White’s second goal was ruled offside by VAR and the captain, Steph Houghton, missed a late penalty.Nevertheless, Keira described the World Cup as the most exhilarating one yet. And she insists it has already had a huge impact on the girls’ team at Stoke Newington school. The captain, 15-year-old Davina Thakore, agreed, adding that the tournament had inspired many girls in their school and local area to play. “There’s been a good turn out for trials, tournaments and school games. There’s more of a buzz around it,” she said.The enthusiasm of the young players at the north London school is reflected across the UK. England’s women’s World Cup defeat to the USA was the most-watched British television broadcast of the year – with a peak audience of 11.7 million.Ian Bruce, a PE teacher at the school who coaches the team, said the landscape of women’s football has transformed over the last few years. “Since the women’s World Cup, there’s been a huge increase in people getting in contact. I’m getting emails every day. When I started this journey 10 years ago, I had to scramble around the school and pull girls out of lessons to ask them to play. But over the last few years, the growth of the women’s game has been amazing and the last few months, there’s a real buzz and a real energy.”Louise McGing, secretary of AFC Leyton, one of the largest women-only football clubs in the UK with more than 700 players, said the World Cup has boosted interest and participation in clubs like theirs. “We were created five years ago because we believe girls need a safe place to train, that was just for them, where they are the priority.”Bruce, who is also chair of women-only team AFC Stoke Newington, said he created it to catch the 16-year-old girls who might otherwise be put off playing football altogether. “I’d seen a lot of my best players go to other mixed clubs, but not enjoy it as much as playing it in school,” he said.McGing said that welcoming space they provide meant they’ve seen a erse cohort of players join recently, especially girls who have been harder to reach. “For the first time, we have players in hijabs, which is fab!” Historically, girls came through from mixed teams, but McGing said they are now seeing elite players coming through from girl-only squads.“We’re accessing more athletes that we didn’t have before,” she said. “A lot of girls who would have done athletics before are now trying football they’ve got the speed and stamina, and we just teach them the ball manipulation skills.”Former England player Claire Rafferty welcomes the increased interest and enthusiasm in women’s football, but said she wants to see a larger group of players and clubs benefit. “The biggest clubs are the ones that attract the biggest sponsors and thus are able to pay the players more. I’d like to see it more from the bottom up.”McGing said that the World Cup was an important step to normalising women’s football for everyone. “The World Cup showed we play just as strong a game as the men, but there’s less rolling around on the floor and less drama. It’s just about playing the sport properly.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/187059177a356d2a19f2025c102718e26a16676d/0_70_3098_1859/master/3098.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd797096be988dc0eaffbe9394473b68","title":"manchester city pay rodri release clause atletico madrid transfer window football","story":"• Spanish midfielder is set to become City’s record signing• Guardiola also targeting centre-back after Kompany’s exitRodri is poised to sign for Manchester City after Atlético Madrid announced that the Premier League champions have met the Spain international’s €70m (£62.8m) release clause. When the deal is formalised the 23-year-old will become Pep Guardiola’s first acquisition of the summer, and City’s record signing.In an official statement on their website, Atlético have confirmed that representatives for the Premier League club and the player paid the buyout fee at La Liga’s headquarters on Wednesday.The midfielder’s impending arrival means Guardiola can now focus on securing the second of his two major transfer targets. While Rodri has been bought as successor to Fernandinho as the champions’ holding player, the manager also wants a centre-back following Vincent Kompany’s departure.Guardiola’s first-choice is Leicester’s Harry Maguire, but the Foxes’ valuation of the 26-year-old – thought to be around £80m – is not matched by City. Beyond a centre-back, Guardiola is only likely to move to strengthen other areas should a player demand to leave.The right-back Danilo is one who may do so, as he is only second choice behind Kyle Walker. Should the Brazilian ask for a transfer, Juventus’s João Cancelo would be assessed by the manager as a possible replacement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e95f65673001016e5aebd71f76678e5cca89a495/0_46_1903_1142/master/1903.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58f943f2597544d66104dea9eb4414fe","title":"naby keita liverpool tour united states","story":"• Guinean has withdrawn from Africa Cup of Nations• Adductor injury originally sustained in BarcelonaLiverpool expect Naby Keïta to take part in their pre-season tour of the United States later this month despite aggravating the injury that curtailed his debut campaign at Anfield.The Guinea midfielder has withdrawn from the Africa Cup of Nations having suffered a recurrence of an adductor injury in the defeat by Nigeria last week.

It has also changed how people see the sportIt’s changed my (male) partner’s view of women’s football. He didn’t know much about it before and assumed the women’s game must be somehow “less exciting” because it’s not as popular, but he’s really enjoyed watching the World Cup with me – even if I get a bit vocal sometimes!He’s also become a big proponent of equality for the Lionesses and thinks women’s football should be put on level standing with the men’s game. He’s even taken to social media to call for more coverage of the women’s leagues, fair pay and more funding for the sport. I’m so proud of him! I’m hoping the success of our amazing Lionesses will mean they are given the respect they deserve. It means a lot to a girl who was told at school in the early 1980s that she couldn’t play football because it was a ‘boys sport’. Jen, South YorkshireWe usually get together in a boozer to watch the England men’s team, but this is the first time we’ve watched a women’s match together. The whole tournament has been an opportunity to be with friends and send mild abuse to my American in-laws! I’ll be over in California with them for the final on Sunday so, against my natural instincts, I’ll be supporting USA. Andy Bartlett, LondonThe tournament has changed my perception of the women’s game completely. Prior to the tournament I’d have struggled to name more than a few of the England squad, but now some of them are among my sporting heroes.We travelled to Nice to watch England’s opener against Scotland and for the last month I have arranged my social life around watching the games. My levels of excitement and nerves have reached a level not far off those experienced during last summer’s World Cup. I’m already making plans to attend some Women’s Super League games next season – something I had never previously considered.Before long, this World Cup will be seen as a significant turning point in women’s sport and the fight for gender equality in football. I’m thrilled to have experienced it so closely along the way. Grant, 29, LondonThe tournament hasn’t been a massive change for me. I’ve been a fan since the 1970s, when I played in a competitive league as a young girl. But I’ve finally gotten a few male friends to take it seriously. They’ve appreciated the lack of theatrics as a whole (some still happen, but not to the degree of the men’s game). I’m hoping USA win so my team can thumb their noses at our ridiculous president! Julie B, MinneapolisWatching the World Cup has without a doubt changed how I see women’s football. The game is better than the men’s game! Although a little slower, accuracy of passing is better, there are fewer fouls and fewer histrionics. This season I’ll definitely attempt to watch more Manchester United women’s games. They’ve only had one season and have been promoted to the same league as Manchester City, so it’ll be interesting to see how they compare with the men. I’m a season ticket holder at Old Trafford and will now make more of an effort to support the women. Harry Bloom, GlossopThis World Cup has changed how I view football, let alone the women’s game! I used to follow Liverpool as a kid, but went off football as I grew up. The games are so stop-start and and the players are spoilt and are paid obscene amounts of money. I started watching the Women’s World Cup to encourage my kids and now I’m hooked.It’s all so easy to watch and so relatable. Most of all I love seeing what bodies like mine can do – it’s amazing to see a female body used for strength and power instead of boring old sexiness. It feels like real, interesting people out there playing the game. And every player has an inspirational story to tell about overcoming difficulties and prejudice. How can I pick one team to support when they’re all so engaging?For the first time, I finally understand the attraction of football. These teams have shown me what a fantastic game it is – the skill, passion, strategy and endurance. It means my daughters can see what their female bodies can do. The World Cup has given them dozens of strong, tough role models who can show them the way forward. Sarah Hames-Clarke, Bolton-by-BowlandI’ve always loved the Women’s World Cup. This year, however, there’s something more in it for me as it feels like the most erse tournament I’ve ever seen. That matters to me because I walked away from football because I didn’t feel like I belonged. Basketball was practically shoved down my throat when I was a kid but when I discovered “soccer” – thanks largely to the Mia Hamm craze of the late 1990s – I was in love and convinced I’d found my sport.But then I enrolled in an elite private high school and was the only black girl on the field. I left tryouts full of shame, convinced I had no business being there. No one made fun of me, but there was an embarrassment and loneliness that was unbearable and I was already anxious about being a black girl from the wrong side of town in the predominantly white, upper-class environment. I never returned to the game and it’s something I’ll regret for the rest of my life.I am thrilled at how many black women and women of colour are at this World Cup. From the powerful story of the Reggae Girlz, to Wendie Renard and, of course, Crystal Dunn. The feeling of joy I get seeing this representation is indescribable.There are very few occasions when women are celebrated at an equal or comparable level as men. As a 29-year-old from US, I’ve seen women fight to be taken as seriously as men in music, business, the culinary field, writing, film and, of course, sports for nearly 30 years. But in that time I’ve also witnessed my country celebrate our women’s national team with genuine fervour and respect.This tournament has given us the chance to see women become national heroes and to be taken seriously not for their appearance, but for their grit and talent. Regardless of who wins, I think it’s been a tremendous success for the women’s game and a great moment in the march towards gender parity.

We are encouraged to think of this most modern discipline as a sophisticated, perhaps even cutthroat world, where promotional and sales whizzes compete to be the best of the best in the battle to market various symphonies in sweat‑wicking polyester and cheap leather.In which case, why does the appearance of halfwitted naivety continue to dog these 360-degree thinkers? This week alone, Adidas and Arsenal have had to shut down a social media initiative after its promise to tweet pictures of its new kit with fan Twitter handles on it saw the official Adidas account posting pictures of Arsenal shirts with racist or deliberately offensive messages on the back. Then, on Tuesday, Nike were forced to withdraw a special edition Air Max Fourth of July shoe after their own brand ambassador Colin Kaepernick reportedly voiced concern to the company at their decision to emblazon it with the so-called Betsy Ross flag, a 13-star Revolutionary War version of the stars and stripes. This flag dates back to a time of oppression and racism, but – more importantly – has been co-opted by far-right groups including the American Nazi party and the Ku Klux Klan, precisely for that reason.We’ll begin with Adidas, who were Monday’s Idiot McIdiotfaces after their official account tweeted out Arsenal shirts emblazoned with messages we might broadly euphemise as “non-inclusive”. Or as they ended up putting it: “As part of our partnership launch with Arsenal we have been made aware of the abuse of a Twitter personalisation mechanic created to allow excited fans to get their name on the back of the new jersey. Due to a small minority creating offensive versions of this we have immediately turned off the functionality and the Twitter team will be investigating.”Let’s hope that’s the Adidas Twitter team, and not the team from actual Twitter, whose investigative philosophy is a resolute “no stone turned”. But some investigation of the Adidas marketing department might also be beneficial, given it appears to employ the last people in the entire country not to realise that in the social media era throwing questions open to the floor always ends badly. I mean, have you seen the floor of the internet? It is positively running with various forms of toxic waste. It’s a mistake to ask it for the answer to anything except the question: “What is the most offensive thing you can think of saying in response to this question?”That said, Adidas’s boo-boo is absolutely dwarfed by the Nike one, just in terms of scale. Naturally, there will be those eternal conspiracists who declare archly that the entire Betsy Ross flame war was started on purpose by Nike for publicity. Fraid not. It’s one thing to generate controversy and free advertising via stoking a culture war with a relatively inexpensive online campaign. But to design and manufacture a product, get it all the way to stores, then recall it after private internal conversations with one of your highest-profile brand ambassadors is, if we’re realistic, a highly inefficient sort of marketing conspiracy.Still, it’s done now and, given this is America, I don’t need to tell you a huge amount of shit is being completely lost by people. The Arizona governor, Doug Ducey, has declared he will rescind funding for a $184m Nike factory proposed for his state. “Words cannot express my disappointment about this terrible decision,” fumed Mr Ducey, somehow finding words, in a series of tweets. The former presidential candidate Herman Cain confirmed an enduring reputation for understatement by declaring: “Just so you know how this works now: Nothing can happen in America anymore if Colin Kaepernick doesn’t like it.”But the daddy of them all remains the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, who naturally weighed in on this priority issue for the nation. “If we’re in a political environment where the American flag has become controversial to Americans,” he stated, “I think we’ve got a problem.” You do have one, Mitch. Several big ones, to be accurate, though it feels weird that a shoe prompted this realisation as opposed to, say, children dying in shameful conditions in US custody at the border with Mexico. This is, after all, a week in which you also called basic protections for immigrant children in detention camps “way to the left of the mainstream”, and threatened to block a bill guaranteeing basic care for them.On the one hand, the row is arguably not the biggest loss for Nike, given that all of “those sort” of Republicans had supposedly already vowed never to wear Nike again the minute the knee-taking Kaepernick was appointed a brand ambassador. You may recall extensive pictures and social media videos of them cutting the swooshes off socks and burning their own shoes and so on. On the other, how on earth did this one get this far? Does no one in Nike’s presumably vast marketing department realise that flags are a vaguely touchy issue in American politics, be they confederate ones or various others?For all the political capital to be made by political capitalists, though, it goes without saying that the biggest loser is Betsy Ross, the Philadelphia seamstress who has been dead for almost 200 years, but whom a large number of wingnuts are now encouraging you to imagine has been disrespected by having her notional Nike sponsorship removed. A humbling few days for the sports marketers of the universe, all things considered, who might be advised not to rush their next moves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c889edbae34f3d256c4ddeb87f1f2238a77862f/0_0_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d513c8fc7de5a0040942f402104765f7","title":"netherlands v sweden womens world cup 2019 semi final live","story":"Phil Neville said that he thinks Sweden will prevail today, meaning England will face Holland in Saturday’s third-place playoff. If he’s right, then expect pained groans to be the soundtrack at the stadium in Lyon today, because there are far, far more Dutch fans than Swedes. The last time anywhere in France was so orange, The Cure got so excited they played a concert there. Seden have made two changes to the side that shocked Germany. Lina Hurtig replaces the suspended Rolfo, while Nathalie Bjorn comes into midfield instead of Elin Rubensson. Martens is fit enough to start for the Dutch, as expected, but Shanice Van de Sanden has paid the price for her disappointing performances in the tournament so far and been replaced by Lineth Beerensteyn.Hello and welcome to the clash of the in-your-face outsiders. Holland and Sweden came into this tournament without fanfare, ranked eighth and ninth in the world respectively, but here they are duelling to decide who takes on the United States in Sunday’s World Cup final. Will it be Holland, who are appearing in this tournament for only the second time in their history but who are reigning European champions even if they have stuttered since gaining that crown? Or will it be Sweden, who are contesting their fourth World Cup semi-final, three years after reaching their first Olympic final? I don’t know, that’s what we’re here to find out. It’s on! Maybe the Americans would prefer to face Sweden, since they already beat them 2-0 in the group stages. That, as it happens, is the same score by which Holland beat Sweden when the countries last met – in 2017 – but the Swedes have improved since then under the management of Peter Gerhardsson and have also found a groove in the course of this tournament, following up their defeat by the US with deserved victories over Canada and Germany. But ace winger Fridolina Rolfö picked up yellow cards in both those games so she is suspended for this one that’s a shame because her conniving with Stina Blackstenius was especially dangerous. The Dutch will still have to be way of Blackstenius, though, as well as a a powerful Swedish collective. The Dutch have hit a rhythm as they have advanced through this competition and they, too, have a couple of top-notch mischief-makers, as Lieke Martens and the prolific Vivianne Miedema work slickly together. But Martens has been suffering with toe trouble in the run-up to this game and if Holland are below their best, then Sweden might just spring another surprise.

He has always fiercely protected his privacy while building up a business empire that includes the Spectator and the Yodel delivery company.The brothers are famous for owning the Channel island of Brecqhou, where they have built a gothic-style castle, and their long-running dispute with many residents on the neighbouring island of Sark. They have clashed with local politicians and other residents in the tiny crown dependency over the decades, while helping to abolish one of the world’s last remaining feudal systems. After successfully bringing democracy to the islands they subsequently closed down their businesses when voters failed to back their preferred candidates.Clermont-Tonnerre acknowledged that his play, which does not mention the Barclays by name but features two wealthy Britons who live in a castle on Brecqhou, was partly inspired by the lives of the brothers.But he defended his right to freedom of expression and said the play had been commissioned to explore the issues around the continued existence of medieval Norman law in the Channel Islands, while ruminating on the nature and future of capitalism.Barclay had asked for €100,000 (£90,000) in damages for libel and violation of privacy and sought to have the work banned from being performed.The court instead ordered Barclay, 85, to pay €6,000 in moral damages to the playwright, as well as €5,000 to each of the three theatre companies involved in producing the play for infringing their right to show the work. He was also ordered to pay €35,000 in legal costs.Barclay’s lawyer has said he is likely to appeal against the ruling, which also requires him to pay to publish a statement announcing his defeat in four French newspapers and magazines.Barclay and his twin brother have owned the Daily  since 2004. Their media outlets have backed Brexit and they held a party at the Ritz in honour of Nigel Farage to celebrate the 2016 EU referendum result.Morice’s colleague Missiva Chermak-Felonneau said: “It has to be noticed that this well-reasoned decision is of critical importance for the freedom of artistic creation.”The court case could become an example of the Streisand effect, inadvertently drawing attention to a previously obscure play which has been critically acclaimed but only played in small theatres. Further performances are scheduled for early 2020 in cities across France."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/876ce9afc9d94544332f965c57b1197eb0506e50/0_173_5228_3138/master/5228.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0effd5eeee9e639e71a6d70a8bcd8188","title":"readers glastonbury highlights","story":"From your favourite headliners to surprise delights, you’ve been sharing your top moments from a scorching weekendThe experience was like being taken into a vortex of sound and light with no way out as they transitioned seamlessly between haunting tracks on their most recent album (Free Yourself and Eve of Destruction were especially memorable) to classics like Hey Boy, Hey Girl and Galvanize.They flashed images of both old and new (robotic figures interspersed with black-and-white images) in a hypnotic way, with repetitive elements, so that the audience was truly engrossed and the atmosphere electric. The 3D imagery made you feel as if you were part of it. Light and dark moments in the music and the show took you through a waterfall of emotions, while the beat keept you in ecstasy. A truly unforgettable show, perhaps the best I have seen at Glastonbury. Satya, 26, GloucesterI was really nervous about going to Glastonbury because I’d never been to a festival before – I was there with my parents to celebrate my forthcoming 18th birthday. We waited at the Pyramid stage all day on Friday to see Stormzy, and saw some amazing performances from Bastille and George Ezra. We’re used to watching the headliners on TV so it was quite surreal!I’d decided I wanted to be near to the front for Stormzy but I never thought I’d be so close. His set was absolutely incredible, and all of his singers and dancers were amazing. The highlight of the night – and the whole festival – was when Chris Martin came on for Blinded By Your Grace. It was unforgettable, and I felt like I’d had a real “Glastonbury moment”. Seeing two such different musicians come together really showed me just how amazing the festival is. Megan, 17, LiverpoolAn old litter-picking volunteer with a white beard, dreadlocks and a Lancashire accent, who introduced himself only as “that guy”, did a short set at the open-mic in Strummerville on Saturday afternoon. He had a drum machine and a bass guitar, with which he played some remarkably funky tunes, before adding his own unexpectedly brilliant vocals, most notably in a song I assume was called Put It in the Bin Please, in which he pleaded with the audience in increasingly irate tones to correctly dispose of their rubbish. We’d only gone up there for a snooze in the shade of the trees but came away with a proper Glasto highlight. Russell Carswell, 32, LondonJeff Goldblum’s soundcheck! Warm fuzzy comedy from the king of smooth: guess the animal pattern pants, guess the animal sound, and then the surreal banter with the BBC journalist! When she asks, “When are you going to start?” Jeff casually replies, “Well, I think I already have” to an uproarious, loving crowd. Thanks for an amazing memory Jeff! Gary McKillion, 43, BarnstapleThe IICON stage was absolutely incredible. Obviously I loved the music, but I couldn’t believe how amazing the stage design was. It looked like something out of a dystopian future: proper way to listen to electronic music. Zach, 25, BristolThe Killers absolutely smashed it! We’ve seen them several times, including last year at TRNSMT, so I was initially a little underwhelmed when I saw the lineup … But it was their best performance by far, they put so much effort into it and it was flawless.Being our first Glasto with the kids we were fully prepared for meltdowns, but the children (Holly, eight, and Charlie, five) threw themselves into it and didn’t complain once, despite the heat and all the walking. Seeing them dancing their wee socks off at sunset to Liam Gallagher and the Killers made for such beautiful moments.The Kidzfield is a paradise, they got a photo with lovely Dynamo, who completely captured their imaginations! They spent hours doing arts and crafts, going potholing, playing in forts, and getting decorated with rainbows and glitter. They were really on board with the green focus at this year’s festival, even though they are very young, they recognise the importance. Edwina McNulty, GlasgowSeeing Michael Eavis singing Elvis songs on the Avalon Cafe stage was probably the sweetest moment of Glastonbury. In a relatively intimate setting was the man who made this all happen, singing his heart out at the age of 83 and clearly loving every minute of it. It only got better when Emily joined him for a duet of Something Stupid. Neither have particularly brilliant voices but the music world owes them everything. An utterly charming moment. Simon Donohue, 47, ManchesterThe Acoustic Brass Off on the Truth Stage on Thursday night was an absolute blast, with lots of catchy covers and a great atmosphere. Dat Brass began on stage, belting out Cry Me a River and several other tunes. They then waded into the crowd, where they joined forces with the New York Brass Band for some more fun, playing Thrift Shop and Get Lucky. Double sousaphone equals double fun! Matt, 29, LondonFrank Turner on the Avalon Stage on Friday night. I’d not seen him live before but the energy and desire to put on a great show were incredible. Jonny Ford, 50, LiverpoolThis is about my 25th Glastonbury and the highlight this year was wandering around with my 13-year-old daughter, Cliodhna, on Sunday night. We went to the top of the Ribbon Tower in the Park, which I’d never done before. It’s just fantastic. The whole of gorgeous Glastonbury is laid out before you, a million lights twinkling. All three of my kids have been coming since they were little. We all love it and I hope we’re all there next year at the 50th Glastonbury, as I’ll be 50 too. Jane O’Hara, 49, CharlseworthMy friends and I agonised over whether to see her or the Cure. Halfway through the first song I knew we’d made the right choice. She is the Glasto performer that 2019 deserves: singing and talking about being an outsider, acceptance, joy, sexuality, confusion. She dazzled with on-point choreography, confidence and pitchperfect delivery. It was theatre, dance and music – a real show, a triumph. It helps that she’s very funny, exudes warmth and can build a rapid rapport with the crowd with her slightly off-kilter English. It was a shame so comparatively few people were there to see it. But it gave the show an intimate feel and even a little space to dance. Andy McGrath, 30, StreathamIt was the first time I’ve seen the Cure live – WOW! An amazing performance from a band who showed you really don’t need the bunting and the special guests, just a huge catalogue of amazing songs performed brilliantly by superb musicians and a singer with Robert Smith’s ability to mesmerise. solarevolutionWatching Jorja Smith with my 14-year-old daughter, her eyes filled with happy tears as she looked across at me and mouthed: “This is the happiest I’ve ever been.” In front of us were five 21-year-olds from south Wales at their first Glastonbury. They too were teary, hugging us and telling us how much they wanted to bring their daughters to Glastonbury when they were older, saying how wonderful it was to make such special memories. I’d stewarded that day between 3am and 10am and was knackered! But as the sun (finally) began to dip beneath the horizon the world stopped just for a moment and it was the most beautiful place in the world.

It was started as a way to keep Caryl’s musician friends from going off to London and Berlin, and has continued to help DJs and music producers build a reputation. “That is genuinely what gives me joy: seeing these people have the opportunities that maybe they wouldn’t have done without having a bit of a leg up from us,” Caryl says.One of the joys of running a radio station serving a local community is the reciprocal learning process. Caryl, who wrote about dance music before starting KMAH, thought he knew everything there was to know about the Leeds music scene. “As soon as we started the station, I realised I hadn’t even scratched the surface. There were so many scenes and micro-scenes, and people playing all sorts of weird and wonderful music … I like to think we were at least one part of that breeding ground, helping people develop their own ideas and chat and parties and whatever else.”The hyperlocal grassroots nature of northern radio culture that has been its strength is also its potential downfall. MCR Live was one of the north’s more commercially facing independent stations, and focused on balancing its scheduling between well-known and local DJs. This worked, to an extent: the station had a podcast with DJ Shadow that went to No 1 in the Apple Music podcast charts. However, it was recently announced that MCR Live would cease broadcasting and change to a different format. Rhys Hancock, who worked as the executive producer and head of content for MCR Live, says the station could not meet its budget requirements because of brands’ unwillingness to invest money in stations outside of London. It is these brand partnerships that support stations including NTS, which has collaborated with Adidas, Carhartt, Johnnie Walker and Uniqlo.“It’s quite hard to sell these radio stations to brands, because they don’t want to work with radio,” Hancock says, saying that companies want to work with “subcultural brands”, some of which just happen to be radio stations like NTS. “A lot of that kind of money that Jӓgermeister and Heineken will spend will be spent in London.” As he puts it: “Manchester is not quite there yet in terms of having that kind of brand power.”Nonetheless, the founders of Melodic Distraction are optimistic about the future of independent radio in northern England, citing the spirit of collaboration between the stations that keeps the scene alive. James McElhone, the station’s co-founder, says: “When you’re talking about elements of competition, I think the fact that we’re geographically specific removes that. We’re all really happy to push each other forwards.”This collective spirit was demonstrated after KMAH was broken into in 2016 and had all of its broadcasting equipment stolen. “We thought that was going to be the end of everything,” Caryl admits. A JustGiving page was set up to help the team raise the money to replace the stolen gear, and within 30 days, the people of Leeds had donated double the required amount. Caryl and his co-founders donated the excess to a local homeless charity.Because of the sheer enthusiasm around these stations, new ones are still popping up. Leeds’s Sable Radio is taking its first baby steps, having only started broadcasting in December last year. Broadcasting only a few days a week for a couple of hours at a time, founder Baile says: “I guess with anything in the arts, the difficulty is funding, but we’re kind of happy for it to just be slow and organic.”While London stations have more investment and larger platforms, their northern counterparts have not been deterred from putting down their roots. It is that inimitable northern soul that keeps independent radio alive outside London, and will continue to do so for as long as there are people willing to commit time, energy and love – qualities that will outlast any brand partnership."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a71f2b373acafa5f121109769cf8d0a9be4a9f5/0_0_3500_2333/master/3500.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e63b89df31f93588a9747e0178808053","title":"group of biologists tries to bury the idea that plants are conscious","story":"Environmental crisis clouding scientific objectivity about plants’ feelings, says botanistThe gardening gloves are off. Frustrated by more than a decade of research which claims to reveal intentions, feelings and even consciousness in plants, more traditionally minded botanists have finally snapped. Plants, they protest, are emphatically not conscious.The latest salvo in the plant consciousness wars has been fired by US, British and German biologists who argue that practitioners of “plant neurobiology” have become carried away with the admittedly impressive abilities of plants to sense and react to their environments.Bothered by claims that plants have “brain-like command centres” in their root tips, and possess the equivalent of animal nervous systems, the critics counter there is no proof of sentient vegetation or structures within plants that would grant them what the neuroscientist Antonio Damasio has called “the feeling of what happens”.Taiz told the : “Our criticism of the plant neurobiologists is they have failed to consider the importance of brain organisation, complexity and specialisation for the phenomenon of consciousness.”The broadside drew a robust response from the University of Sydney’s Monica Gagliano, who conducts research on the cognitive abilities of plants, including perception, learning, memory and consciousness. She said the criticisms failed to take account of all the evidence and focused only on work that supported the authors’ viewpoint. “For me, the process of generating knowledge through rigorous science is about understanding the evidence base behind a claim,” she said. “Where is their experimental data? Or are we expected to just accept their claim at face value?”Taiz draws on work by the US researchers Todd Feinberg and Jon Mallatt, who explore the origins of consciousness by comparing simple and more complex brains in animals. They conclude that while animals ranging from insects and crabs to cats and monkeys have sufficient brains to be conscious, other organisms fail the test. Those organisms include plants, Taiz argues.The debate is shaping up to be the biggest botanical bunfight since the Romantic era when plant biologists argued for more than a century about sex in plants. As the purists argued nothing so obscene would be happening in flower beds, extremists on the sex side envisioned plants not only having sex but being full of lust and passion.Taiz believes the rise of plant neurobiology is driven by the environmental crisis that poses an ever-increasing threat to life on Earth.“They want to raise people’s consciousness about plants as living organisms and reach them on an emotional level. I’m very sympathetic to the motivations, but it is clouding their objectivity. They have to be prepared for the fact that plants may not have consciousness,” he said. “It’s bad science. It takes the whole scientific enterprise and reduces its credibility.”But Gagliano is having none of it. “If we think we already know how things are and fail to continuously question our own assumptions, but construct our claims on a system of beliefs we are dearly attached to, then we are in deep trouble and miss the opportunity for true scientific discovery to occur.“Miserably, this opinion piece seems yet another missed opportunity, one that makes strikingly no headway towards a better scientific understanding of what consciousness is.”Where the debate leaves Prince Charles, who not only talks to his geraniums but positively instructs them, is unclear. “Far be it from me to criticise Prince Charles, or anyone else for that matter, for talking to their plants,” Taiz said. “I would indeed be concerned, however, if they ever talked back.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf4e303285161fad0c3d4a7c3e924e751667741b/0_0_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=021fb721b2212a5b5aea6275acb0e8aa","title":"tell us has your camhs record affected future employment","story":"As part of an investigation into the issues people who have completed treatment face we would like to hear your experiences Hundreds of thousands of young people pass through the UK’s Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (Camhs) each year.

At balmy Chester-le-Street they defeated New Zealand by a massive margin, thereby securing their semi-final slot at Edgbaston next Thursday against either India or Australia.England won very comfortably by 119 runs in a match remarkably devoid of tension. It was not a perfect performance. There was the reassuring bonus of another brilliant start via the bats of Jason Roy and Jonny Bairstow, who struck another hundred, just as fluent as the one against India in their other “quarter-final”. But then England lost their way in the last 20 overs of their innings. In that time they mustered just 111 runs for the loss of seven wickets, chicken feed by modern standards. Nonetheless their total of 305-8 proved more than adequate.Yet beyond that batting blip there were those moments that trigger thoughts that England’s ultimate goal is within reach, some of brilliance, some of outrageous good fortune, the sort that so often seem to accompany a side on a roll. Most of them happened in the field, where England benefited from two obvious strokes of luck. Henry Nicholls was given lbw to his first ball from Chris Woakes but, after consultation with his partner, he declined to review. The replay demonstrated that the ball would have sailed over Nicholls’s stumps.More significant was the dismissal of Kane Williamson, who never fails. Ross Taylor drove straight and hard the ball flicked the outstretched fingers of Mark Wood and hit the stumps with the Kiwi captain stranded - and out for 27. This is the equivalent of dismissing Virat Kohli cheaply. Without him at the helm the New Zealand side was neutered.But there was brilliance too. Jos Buttler, ing to his left, held a superb one-handed catch down the leg-side to dismiss Martin Guptill, who has often troubled England. Only a curmudgeon could mumble, “Well, he’s got gloves on, hasn’t he?” after that. Bob Taylor, Alan Knott and Jack Russell would have been proud of that one. Soon after Taylor was run out when attempting a second run. It was a misjudgment on his part but maybe he had bargained that the fielder was only Adil Rashid. Maybe he forgot that England’s weakest fielder is also their most improved as Rashid gathered and sent the perfect throw back to Buttler.With the Kiwis 69-4 and anxious not to do immeasurable damage to their net run rate the contest was just about over. Tom Latham played his only significant innings of the tournament so far but this only brought minor respectability to the total. However it was sufficient to make Pakistan’s prospects of overtaking New Zealand in the table remote. Apart from Latham only an obstinate streaker delayed the stroll to the semis.So it did not matter that from 30 overs onwards the England innings had stuttered badly. It resembled the managerial career of Ole Gunnar Solskjær at Old Trafford last season, starting absolutely brilliantly, ending up in grim decline, yet producing a reasonably satisfying outcome, one that would have been acceptable before a ball had been bowled - or kicked.Roy looked most vulnerable against the first delivery of the match from the left-arm spinner, Mitchell Santner, which somehow squeezed past his leg stump for four byes. Then he began to time the ball exquisitely, as did Bairstow. Williamson shuffled his bowlers rapidly but this did not make much difference. After ten overs England had 67 on the board with Bairstow’s cover drives skimming over the fielders in the circle and Roy’s pull shots finding distant boundaries.Roy reached his half-century in 55 balls, Bairstow in 46. In the 19th over Roy departed amid much self-disgust after driving straight to Santner at extra cover, but this did not cause much deceleration Joe Root stole his singles while Bairstow effortlessly purred to another century. But after Root’s dismissal batting suddenly became a trial, which had frustrated batsmen staring at the surface as if it was some kind of treacherous chameleon.Root had gloved a hook shot against Trent Boult and curiously requested a review. This type of dismissal is often disparaged as “a strangle”, which is a mistake. The leg-side catch has been a regular occurrence in this tournament against fast bowlers who can conjure surprising bounce. Mature batsmen recognise that this type of dismissal is not a consequence of bad luck, but bad judgment. No doubt that will eventually be the analysis of Root.Bairstow followed in the next over, bowled off the inside edge and the slide had started. The promoted Buttler holed out to mid-off Ben Stokes kept mistiming the ball to fielders he summoned a new bat, which made no difference, before being caught at long-on for 11 off 27 balls, an aberration on his home ground against some of the cricketers he knew as a youngster. Until yesterday Stokes’ batting in this tournament has been exemplary.England were grateful for a canny innings from Morgan and a little late flurry from Liam Plunkett and Rashid which dragged the score past 300. In the end this was more than enough."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc6ee67c2ac2ca53a09015d10cfa1d2b6de0f67a/0_26_3376_2025/master/3376.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8be7c03b0a2970d41c8a48420550021c","title":"england new zealand cricket world cup 2019 live","story":"Well that was such a convincing win as to become almost a nonevent. It’s not that England were flawless – they got bogged down in the second half of their innings – but from the moment the fledgling partnership between Ross Taylor and Kane Williamson was, somewhat fortuitously, ended, the outcome was never in doubt. England had some luck – with the toss, with the conditions, with a couple of the dismissals – but they were focused and impressive in the field, which has been the most pleasant surprise about a campaign that has sometimes stumbled. And Roy and Bairstow remain a cut above as an opening partnership. On to Edgbaston, a happy hunting ground, they go, for fun and frolics against Australia or India, for their first semi-final for 27 years. They and we should be buzzing.New Zealand are, likely as not, heading to Old Trafford for the other semi, and in as downbeat a mood as semi-finalists can be. They bowled tightly, as they have for most of the tournament, but desperately need to address their batting woes, and have become progressively more dependent on their captain as the tournament has gone on. They’ll almost certainly qualify, and if Bangladesh bat first against Pakistan at Lord’s on Friday, New Zealand are through before that match starts (ask someone else to explain the maths).Right, that’s us done. Thanks for your company and many emails, and join us again tomorrow when either Afghanistan or West Indies will get a rare and welcome win. Bye.Trevor Bayliss has also been chatting, and he praises the players’ inclinations to speak up confidently in the dressing room. He admits Sri Lanka was a departure from their previous style, but is particularly encouraged by how the bowling has come on as the tournament has progressed. He says Archer has added to the pace dimension, and Wood being injury-free and full of confidence has also helped. Rob Key wonders whether day games have made a difference, with the ball skidding on less than in day-night games. “Could be the case,” says the coach, who will give the team a few days off before reconvening for Edgbaston.Jonny Bairstow, named man of the match after his third consecutive century against New Zealand, speaks:“We’re really pleased to get over the line after a tough few weeks. We’ve got a couple of days off, it will be an important time to get away, get refreshed, and rest up. There’s bound to be a bit of soreness, then we’ll meet up two or three days before and go again.” England move up to third, so as things stand are set to play India in the semi-finals, depending on how their and Australia’s final games go.45 overs: New Zealand 186 all out (Southee 7*), target 306. Rashid continues, to a drunken soundtrack of Sweet Caroline from a well-refreshed crowd. He turns one sharply into the advancing Boult’s pads but the unorthodox tailender was way down the track. Unorthodox or no, he picks up Rashid’s next delivery with aplomb, thumping it high to the onside boundary for four. But it’s the last runs of the day as next ball Boult advances, swings and misses, and Buttler whips the bails off with – as the review confirms – Boult out of his ground. England have won! They’re in the semis!“How much have New Zealand’s woes been partly self-inflicted in this match? A kind of ‘Hava-Kiwi’ if you will,” quips Tommy Marlow. They were unlucky at the start to be fair, but have been just a bit limp.44th over: New Zealand 181-9 (Southee 6, Boult 0), target 306. Wood bowls his ninth over and gets a third scalp, bowling straight at the stumps at pace, which is enough to get rid of Henry. He concedes only the one from the over, and has 3 for 34 from nine. He’s now the fifth most prolific wicket-taker of this World Cup.Henry steps back, prods, misses, and the stumps are clattered. Textbook. Wood has a third wicket.43rd over: New Zealand 180-8 (Southee 5, Henry 7), target 306. Rashid hurries through another over, which is a decent one, with some nice variety and the odd googly, one of which deceives batsman and keeper alike, gifting New Zealand a bye. Encouraging, as he needs to bowl himself into a bit of form.42nd over: New Zealand 176-8 (Southee 4, Henry 6), target 306. A few emails asking whether Jason Roy is fielding, and I’m pleased to report he is. Wood continues to pound in – you can’t fault England’s intensity – and concedes only one from his eighth over.41st over: New Zealand 175-8 (Southee 4, Henry 5), target 306. Morgan funks it up a bit – as Uptown Funk blasts out of the PA – by giving Rashid another go. He needs a bit of a net. These two tail-enders trade singles for a bit before Rashid rips an encouraging leg-break past Henry’s outside edge.40th over: New Zealand 171-8 (Southee 2, Henry 3), target 306. Wood sends a pleasing outswinger past Santner’s outside edge before pinning him in front. Henry is off the mark with a confident cover drive for three. It could easily have been four but it’s a measure of this England side’s eagernessfoolhardiness that Joe Root absolutely hares after it to e and cut it off. England have absolutely throttled New Zealand here. They need 135 from … ah, let’s stop this pretence eh.Santner misses an attempted leg-glance, it raps the pad and up goes the finger. The batsman reviews, but to no avail. He’d shuffled a long way across his stumps and it was banging out leg stump.39th over: New Zealand 166-7 (Santner 12, Southee 1), target 306. Bairstow continues to rub his shoulder gingerly out in the deep, as the seventh wicket goes down, Santner messing up his hook shot off a cross-seamer. Southee, who can give it some welly with the bat, is the new man in and he gets off the mark straight away with a leg glance. Santner adds another, and after the expensive aberration of the previous over England are back on track. New Zealand “need” 140 off 11 overs.Latham miscues a pull off a short, slower ball from Plunkett and gloves it through to the keeper. This game is pretty much done.38th over: New Zealand 164-6 (Latham 57, Santner 11), target 306. A productive over for New Zealand. Latham clips Woakes for four through the onside despite the best ing efforts of, I think, Morgan at midwicket. Santner also helps himself to four with a nice back-foot drive over extra cover, which has Bairstow over-exerting himself sprawling on the ropes. He looks in a bit of pain as a result.“It seems to be received wisdom now that Dhoni just gave up on Sunday,” writes Andrew Cosgrove, “and played out the end for the run chase. It didn’t look like that to me, he was swinging along, he was just missing a lot (he’s been looking past his best this tournament, untidy behind the stumps and not the go-getter with the bat that he used to be).” Yeah he’s still a finisher, but not the finisher of old, though I wouldn’t write him off just yet. Being devilishly difficult to get out is still a massive asset.37th over: New Zealand 153-6 (Latham 50, Santner 7), target 306. Latham hacks Stokes to mid-on for a single to reach his 50, which will lift his morale for a semi-final for which his side will be a lengthening-odds underdog. It’s not been pretty, but it’ll help. Stokes is enjoying his bowling practice too, and discomfits Santner with an attempted yorker speared into his shins.Are New Zealand the PSG of cricket?” wonders Paul Harnett. “Flatter to decieve, India will have them beat before a ball is bowled.” Well they’re not a wholly owned colony of an undemocratic petro-state for a start. And they don’t really have a Neymar figure.36th over: New Zealand 151-6 (Latham 49, Santner 6), target 306. This is like the fifth day of a drawn Test match at the moment. Woakes is doing a decent job of being accurate and stingy, and Latham and Santner are playing for their averages, though the latter briefly enlivens proceedings with a lofted chip through midwicket for three, which is well cut off at the boundary by Wood, who induces jitters by sprawling around on the deck in a manner ill-befitting of such an injury-prone player.“Re: this NRR headache,” says Keith Johnson in Noo York, “if teams tied on points have had matches that result in a No Result, then toss the NRR and make it head-to-head result based. Kiwis haven’t beaten anyone in this tournament and their NRR surely would have suffered losing to India by 100+ runs (which I think is a compliment to NZ about right now!). Cheers!” Yeah there’ve been times during this tournament where I’ve almost pined for the old Super Six format, whereby points got carried through from games against other qualified teams. But you can usually rely on the ICC to replace stodge with stodge.35th over: New Zealand 147-6 (Latham 48, Santner 3), target 306. “So there will be no attempt to chase as now and we are in the Doni phase,” harrumphs Ian Copestake. “So Why Don’t You Just Switch Off Your Television Set and Go Out and Do Something Less Boring Instead?” Like just follow it on the OBO? Another tight over from Stokes, and Ian’s got a point. New Zealand aren’t exactly busting a gut for this, but nor are they being allowed to.34th over: New Zealand 146-6 (Latham 47, Santner 3), target 306. Woakes returns for his second spell, and begins it with an optimistic lbw shout against Latham, who was well forward and not in any danger. Latham is also deceived by a scrambled-seamer that rears up against his top edge but lands safely. He makes amends with a well-timed on-drive down the ground for four. And then there’s a long delay caused by a streaker on the pitch, that great symbol of bawdy English repression. The cameras aren’t showing, obviously, but whoever they are, they’re pretty agile, as the last delivery of the over is delayed by an age, and when it comes Latham flicks a single“Who’d you rather?” asks Stephen Cottrell in an email arrestingly headlined “Shag, marry, kill?” “Hard to believe as an England fan I’m thinking about this, but what do we want in the semis! Unlikely to happen, but Aus at Edgbaston please. India will be better next time out don’t want to face Starc, Lyon and JB at Lords with the slope again thanks!”I think England might end up facing India, who’ll be more fired up than they were last Sunday, though I’ve called Australia as tournament winners ever since they pulled their ODI series back to 2-2 in India in March. Let’s face it, it’s going back Down Under.33rd over: New Zealand 139-6 (Latham 41, Santner 2), target 306. England continue to show willing in the field, Woakes picking up, swivelling and throwing in an ambitious but admirable run-out attempt from extra cover, though his throw isn’t accurate enough. Stokes keeps it tight too, mixing up his lengths while maintaining accuracy – is he England’s man of the tournament thus far?32nd over: New Zealand 136-6 (Latham 40, Santner 1), target 306. Archer’s getting the kind of pace and bounce that was nowhere to be found at this stage of the England innings. And New Zealand can eke out only a single from the over. That’s drinks.Some NRR enlightenment, I think – first, from Akshay Shah: “Of course, its possible. By my rough calculation (attached), if NZ lose this by 150 runs, Pak should need to beat Bangladesh by a mere 396 runs.” While Alec adds: “I looked at this before because there was some confusion. Net Run Rate works by adding up all the runs scored and ided by overs faced (or would have been faced if they’d not been bowled out) and takes away runs conceded ided by overs bowled (or would have been bowled if not bowled out). So effectively you can multiply the net run rate currently, by the number of games played to work out how many each team need to score. Ie if NZ lose by 150 runs (to get their NRR to zero) then Pakistan need to win by 300 runs (to get their NRR to zero). Of course 300 runs could be scoring 400 and bowling Bangladesh out for 100 or bowling Bangladesh out for 100 and then scoring their runs in 15 overs.”Not gonna happen is it, which personally I think is a bit of a shame. If the tournament had just started two weeks later, we’d be getting all 1992 about Pakistan.31st over: New Zealand 135-6 (Latham 39, Santner 1), target 306. Latham’s New Zealand’s last hope now, but he’s slowed up too over the past few overs. He flicks a single round the corner to leg, Santner gets off the mark with a drive on the off before Latham slightly miscues a hook from a short Stokes delivery but gets away with it and gets a single. But three from the over is not much use to New Zealand.“Just wanted to send some love to the DJ (DJs?) working at the Riverside today,” trills Jesse Linklater. “There hasn’t been a single time that the music playing between overs or after wickets has made me want to top myself. Which can’t be said for many other cricket ground music people working elsewhere in this tournament.” Yeah I’ve noticed an upgrade today. Did I catch the glorious Ain’t Nobody earlier?30th over: New Zealand 132-6 (Latham 37, Santner 0), target 306. Archer begins his second spell with a wide but other than that is pretty searingly accurate. Ian Smith is getting very rueful about New Zealand’s performances of late, and that’s the thing with a tournament this long. You can play yourself out of form, and they’ll cut a limp contrast as semi-finalists with the sort of sprightly approach they took into the last four in 2015. They, and the game, miss Brendon McCullum.“Sitting on a beach in Sicily,” humble-brags Steve Perrin, “My (English) wife keeps trying to show interest then dropping off to sleep while my Sicilian friends refuse to believe that cricket is a real thing. Still, it’s a nice day.” I’m sure it is. Have some fine seafood for me.29th over: New Zealand 130-6 (Latham 37, Santner 0), target 306. Stokes is introduced for the first time, and to immediate effect, De Grandhomme holing out a loosener to Root on the boundary. A single and a wide are the only scoring strokes from a fine first over. England may have been a little lucky, but they’ve been pretty damn tight in the field today too.“So it’s pretty obvious, we know which way this game is going,” says Moneeb Hafeez. “Can someone (with better maths and cricket knowledge) work out if it is even possible for Pakistan to catch New Zealand’s net run rate? It’s the hope that kills you......should we just let it die now?” I’m gonna outsource this one to You The Public for the moment, what with my various other multi-tasking duties. Ben Stokes gets his first bowl of the innings and, whaddya know, strikes straight away, De Grandhomme somewhat lazily hoiking to deep midwicket where Root takes a comfortable catch. Stokes is as Stokes does, that Botham-esque ability to get wickets with indifferent balls shows itself.28th over: New Zealand 128-5 (Latham 36, De Grandhomme 3), target 306. Wood continues, and the screw continues to tighten. Decent pace, decent line, and that’s enough at the moment. Only two from the over again, and New Zealand just can’t get enough, which is now blaring out of the PA.“Folsom Prison Blues perhaps a reference to England getting out of jail?” suggests Olly Horne. I presume they’ve got Hurt lined up if all goes pear-shaped for England, and they’ve certainly Walked the Line at times this summer.27th over: New Zealand 126-5 (Latham 36, De Grandhomme 2), target 306. Plunkett almost strangles De Grandhomme down the legside, the new man attempting an unconvincing flick, and then beats him outside off with a slower ball. De Grandhomme can bat so this is impressive stuff from Plunkett. Only two from the over.26th over: New Zealand 124-5 (Latham 35, De Grandhomme 1), target 306. Wood strikes to end a pesky partnership, with Neesham playing on. New man De Grandhomme is greeted with a zinger into his pads, before getting off the mark with a single. That’s an excellent over.“Am hoping that if Plunkett keeps getting his specials through the announcer will take pity on NZ and play the Echo’s refrain ‘Spare us the Cutter.’” With Wood, I’d have thought this would be a more appropriate Bunnymen refrain:That’s an important breakthrough. Neesham chops on, trying to cut when he didn’t really have enough room. Wood is properly involved in this game.25th over: New Zealand 123-4 (Latham 35, Neesham 19), target 306. Some uneven bounce from Plunkett down the legside with one that barely bounces it all, but so far down leg that it’s called wide. A modest diet of ones takes the partnership beyond 50 before Latham cover drives beautifully for four. Root can’t cut it off, and eight off the over will perk New Zealand off. We’re halfway through the innings and New Zealand need more than seven an over.24th over: New Zealand 115-4 (Latham 30, Neesham 17), target 306. Even more speed, as Wood comes back for Root, which is a widely applauded move in the commentary box. A leg-bye a two, a three (a particularly well-timed clip through midwicket from Latham) and a single are milked from the over. These too have stealthily added 46 off 44 balls. This game has a way to go yet. (And they’re playing Folsom Prison Blues on the PA system, one of the more unusual but welcome choices of between-overs music. Its significance?)23rd over: New Zealand 108-4 (Latham 25, Neesham 16), target 306. Pace is indeed back, with Plunkett, who tightens things back up again, conceding only four. Which leaves New Zealand needing 198 off 27. “I wonder how Moeen is feeling at being dropped so late in the World Cup campaign,” ponders Damian Burns, “especially after declaring it his job to get Kohli out in the  last week. Should England win today, do you think he’ll get back into the side for the remaining games?” Probably not, to be honest, because his batting hasn’t been sufficiently reliable, even though he’s bowled ably enough. Though it’s such a long tournament that form can fluctuate considerably from stage to stage. A few weeks ago we were marvelling about West Indies’ pace attack after all, and assuming Jos Buttler would be England’s most destructive batsman.22nd over: New Zealand 104-4 (Latham 22, Neesham 15), target 306. Root’s rattling through his overs faster than I can type, but he might want to take a bit more time over them if he’s going to drop the kinds of long-hop that Neesham can easily clatter square on the off for four. I’d change it up a bit now, bowler wise, if I were Morgan.21st over: New Zealand 97-4 (Latham 20, Neesham 10), target 306. Rashid has a half-hearted lbw appeal against Latham but it was going down leg, and Latham responds with a fine straight drive off the back foot that goes all the way for four. Assorted ones and twos make it another expensive over.“As a foreigner trying to puzzle things out,” writes David Peterson, “can you explain why the Guy who Runs the Guy Out, gets no credit on the scorecard, while every other sort of dismissal seems to be treated differently?” Some scorecards do now refer to the runner out, but there was a time when no newspaper, no Wisden, nothing, would mention it. It’s a fair point David.20th over: New Zealand 87-4 (Latham 11, Neesham 9), target 306. Root’s tidier than Rashid so far, and concedes only three singles from his second over.“Best way to keep the kids occupied is to ask them to restructure a cricket scorebook into a third normal form database design,” advises Adam Dawson, for which thanks. I’d offer even more thanks if I knew what you were on about, mind.19th over: New Zealand 84-4 (Latham 10, Neesham 7), target 306. We have spin at both ends now, as Rashid replaces Plunkett. His radar is a little bit awry initially and he yields nine runs, including an easy cut for four from Latham off a pretty ropey long-hop outside off.“I knew Williamson and Taylor were renowned for their likelihood of run-outs when batting together, but this brings it to a whole new level!” yelps Jack Jorgensen. “I must admit that type of dismissal always leaves a very hollow feeling. Amplified in this case by it being Williamson (and NZs chances) that has to go.” They started this tournament so well, but they’ve looked a more timid side as it’s gone on, and Pakistan must be kicking themselves for starting so poorly.18th over: New Zealand 75-4 (Latham 5, Neesham 3), target 306. Spin for the first time, not Rashid but Root, who gets to twirl at the two new left-handers. They milk him for some ones and a two.17th over: New Zealand 70-4 (Latham 2, Neesham 1), target 306. New Zealand are the authors of their own misfortune here, as Taylor is run out coming back for a second after a glance to fine leg, though it’s a fine throw from Rashid. And only two from the over. England now, officially, on top. We might even want to tell our cricket-agnostic relatives that England are “winning”. Though we might want to hedge our bets.New Zealand are of course still well placed to qualify, assuming they don’t lose their last seven for about 20 now. And it being incumbent on Pakistan to absolutely pulverise Bangladesh on Friday, which, given Bangladesh’s properly competitive performances throughout the tournament, seems unlikely. But even if that one at Lord’s on Friday is a dead rubber, it’ll still be worth watching, and those MCC members inclined to swerve it might want to have a long, hard word with themselves. Or at least give their tickets to those that aren’t.Has Taylor paid the price for a foolish return run here? He has. There was never really a second run there and Rashid’s return throw to Buttler, is easily converted by the keeper. New Zealand in bother now.16th over: New Zealand 68-3 (Taylor 27, Latham 2), target 306. Calamitous misfortune for New Zealand, as Taylor’s straight drive is very lightly deflected onto the stumps by Wood’s fingertips, leaving Williamson at the non-striker’s end out of his ground. Wood celebrates with some sort of baby’s-dummy mime (not a patch on his rocking horse capers, for my money). Taylor is then given the hurry-up straight away with a jaffa past his outside edge but responds with a well placed and executed pull in front of square that the fielder can only fumble into the ropes. He the man now, with the new batsman in, Latham, currently out of sorts. Though he gets off the mark with a confident shot for two.Has Wood deflected the ball onto the stumps to run out Williamson here? HE HAS! We need ultra-edge to determine it though, as the batsman is out of his ground after Taylor drove hard at the bowler who thinks he may have edged it onto the stumps. A lengthy examination determines that Wood got a fingertip to it, and England have a vital dismissal, and another fortunate one.15th over: New Zealand 61-2 (Williamson 27, Taylor 22), target 306. Five from Plunkett’s latest over, as this pair continue to look unruffled. “I think England may have missed a trick here,” reckons Stephen Cottrell. “I think Rashid could have got through 4 overs for virtually nothing in overs 10-18. If Kane and Taylor stay together they can milk him and maybe even look to target him a bit later in the innings. Here comes the fear, hot on the heels of his old mate Hope.” How come Fear comes out for a pint so much more often than Hope, who’s always working late? All of which has given me both a pessimistic earworm, and a more hopeful one?14th over: New Zealand 56-2 (Williamson 26, Taylor 19), target 306. Wood’s finding some decent pace in the circs and hurries Williamson up with a short one that the batsman has to glove away awkwardly. A well-run two is followed by the least convincing run-out appeal ever from Morgan as the ball is hurled into the stumps with the batsman several yards home. We’re heading for middle-overs-meander territory at the moment. Who’s winning? Nope, still not getting anything …13th over: New Zealand 51-2 (Williamson 25, Taylor 15), target 306. Plunkett gives Williamson enough room to cut for one, and they take another following a fumble by Morgan at point. Four singles from the over, which New Zealand will be happy enough with at this juncture.“Family uninterested in cricket? Pah” snorts Julian Menz. “Try living in Sweden. Sat in the garden with the family, OBO and TMS on the go. Every time a cheer goes up, my daughter asks if England have scored, the father-in- law asks if it’s still the same game that started hours ago, and my wife glares at me for disturbing the otherwise bucolic peace.” Still, you’ve got a vaguely functioning government over there, so that’s something.12th over: New Zealand 47-2 (Williamson 23, Taylor 13), target 306. Big cheers go up as Durham’s own Mark Wood is introduced in place of Archer, though none greet his first ball, which is an ugly wide down leg. The paceman then has a strangled lbw appeal at one speared into Taylor’s pads but it’s going down the legside. Williamson seeing it like a football and takes advantage of the pace to cut for four off the back foot. Apart from the wide, it’s not a bad over, but this pair look pretty set already. They’ve added 33.11th over: New Zealand 40-2 (Williamson 18, Taylor 13), target 306. Plunkett, the master of the middle overs, gets his first bowl, replacing Woakes. He yields three singles, but generally does his job well, stemming the flow a little.“Just saw Tom Levesley’s bit on his kids renaming cricket positions,” emails Kanishk Srinivasan. “Surely cow corner must have given them a real laugh? Anyone up for signing a petition to rename it hamburger pocket?” Another thing that might help is turning kids’ fascination with numbers – particularly big numbers – into an inculcation into the joys of staring at a cricket scoreboard. Figures all over the shop.10th over: New Zealand 37-2 (Williamson 17, Taylor 11), target 306. Rashid saves at least two run with a fine ing stop from Taylor’s flick to square leg, but no one can stop the next one, beautifully driven through the covers for four by Taylor. That’s what this pair can do with even a smidgeon of width. They’re running the singles well too. Archer’s getting more pace off this pitch than anyone else has today but maybe time for a wee rest? New Zealand end the first powerplay in slightly healthier nick than they might have imagined 10 minutes ago.9th over: New Zealand 28-2 (Williamson 16, Taylor 3), target 306. Taylor hesitantly dollies up a slower ball from Woakes that doesn’t fall too far from the bowlers’ grasp as he attempts the return catch. Taylor then adds a single before Williamson creams a cover drive to the boundary and adds a clipped two for good measure. ENGLAND NEED TO GET HIM OUT ALREADY.“In response to David Lombard I would suggest a recourse to metaphysics,” writes David Lombard, optimistically. “It is the only way: Winning and losing should be thought of as an antagonistic duality that, like the fight between good and evil, must be overcome through achieving emptiness in the sense of recognizing them as not being reality but two opposing principles that might (albeit rarely in ODI) end up perfectly balanced in a state of infinite tension. This is sure to separate the cricket fan from the rest.” 8th over: New Zealand 21-2 (Williamson 10, Taylor 2), target 306. Taylor hooks and misses at a steepling lifter from Archer, which feels like a statement of intent from both bowler and batsman, but bowler’s winning this duel at the moment, conceding only one from the over. To dampen English optimism, can I just say that Williamson and Taylor being together in an NZ 300+ run-chase is bringing back memories of being up in the middle of the night 16 months ago OBO-ing this one.7th over: New Zealand 20-2 (Williamson 10, Taylor 1), target 306. More parsimonious excellence from Woakes until Williamson deflects a full-ish ball between the keeper and the very wide solitary slip, Joe Root. Definitely deliberate, and excellent.“Like David Lombard I’ve got a family totally uninterested in cricket,” says Tom Levesley, channeling my life, “but I’ve managed to engage my 9 and 11 year-olds by playing true or false for cricket positions. They still don’t believe me that backward point is a position and silly mid anything is always funny. They’ve even started inventing their own – deep fried square leg a constant favourite. As for who’s winning the cricket, they don’t really want to know so contempt is the only fair response.”6th over: New Zealand 16-2 (Williamson 6, Taylor 1), target 306. Archer gets in on the act, taking Guptill’s wicket courtesy of Buttler’s superb left-handed catch, which brings Taylor to the crease. “The old firm are back together again,” trills Ian Smith in the commentary box, “Celtic and Rangers, Liverpool and Everton, Exeter and Argyle,” an analogy that only really works if Williamson and Taylor really, really hate each other and are consumed by conspiratorial thinking about the other’s antics. Three singles and a wicket from another fine Archer over.A magnificent catch! Guptill gloves down the legside and Buttler springs athletically to his left for a brilliant take low-down. As good a catch as a keeper has made in this tournament.5th over: New Zealand 13-1 (Guptill 8, Williamson 4), target 306. England’s pressure forces Guptill into a foolhardy single off Woakes but Plunkett isn’t quite on it and at the stumps quick enough for the run-out. Guptill finds his groove with a lovely straight drive for four. A better over for the Black Caps.“In response to David Lombard (over 2) the CricViz app is great,” tweets BW Campbell, “and has a handy ‘who’s winning’ on the front page. Yours, following from Glasgow while my lovely wife and father are in Chester-le-Street. Not bitter...” Personally I like the enigmatic mystery of not being able to forensically prove who’s winning, and just speculating."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51f09ae0f56819815d686739dec01c149b0d4613/437_774_7149_4290/master/7149.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d388211c60fe258db6535955a8b80982","title":"katherine ryan interview comedy single mum glitter room","story":"The queen of the caustic punchline talks about plastic surgery, embarrassing her daughter – and turning her life as a single mum into a sitcomKatherine Ryan is busily scrolling through a neighbourhood Facebook group when we meet. “Someone’s dog attacked another dog today which was sad,” she says, “but mostly people are just selling things.” However, her days in north London might be numbered. “I’m just ready to be a bit country,” she explains. Back in 2007, when she arrived in the UK, Ryan headed straight for Crouch End, where a gaggle of fellow Canadian comics had already settled down, and where she now spends her days mooching around in a velour Juicy Couture tracksuit she bought when Paris Hilton was at her peak.But the 35-year-old is now ready for a change. Her itchy feet are particularly understandable when you consider just how much has happened in the last 12 years. Previously a staff trainer for the Hooters restaurant chain in Canada, Ryan arrived in London with her then boyfriend, didn’t think she’d stay long and flitted between London and her tiny home town of Sarnia, Ontario. Her comedy career was in its infancy (“I was definitely doing an impression of Sarah Silverman”) but watching the likes of Sara Pascoe made her fall for London’s standup scene, and put down roots in the city. She worked a 9 to 5 job, had a daughter, Violet – who is now 10 – and became a single mum when her relationship with Violet’s father ended. “I didn’t even have a phone when she was born. A poor mum is a good mum,” she deadpans.However, Ryan was also slowly ascending from open mic nights to panel shows such as 8 Out of 10 Cats and on to her current position as Gen Y’s answer to Joan Rivers. She’s best known for caustic punchlines verging on the unsayable, and gigs on programmes like (the fairly mean-spirited) Your Face Or Mine?, where couples have to decide whether they’re more attractive than one another. In a meta twist, she also presented the UK reboot of Rivers’ gilded doc series How’d You Get So Rich? Ryan once quipped that the late comic “got exactly what she wanted from that final surgery – to stop ageing”.We are snatching an hour at the Ace hotel in London amid Ryan’s busy schedule, ostensibly to talk about her new Netflix special, Glitter Room, but Ryan is soon giving her opinion about everything from Cardi B (“She’s just like, yeah I was a stripper – I love the fact that she’s so open”) to her tiny, “unethical” teacup dogs. She’s got an animal rights event lined up straight after, and is a big fan of the kind of canines her mate Danny Dyer describes as “dogs that shiver and piss from their eyes”.Ryan is warm, lightly cynical, and a bit of a magpie – she marvels at our waitress’s luminescent makeup, and is herself dressed in a diamanté-studded denim jacket and black tutu with big, Lady Gaga-esque sunglasses by her side. She is unusually interested in the harried freelancers hunched over their laptops in the hotel lobby, a situation she can relate to as well as the Netflix special – her second, following 2017’s In Trouble – she’s currently writing a sitcom for the streaming service. The Duchess, a “heightened version” of her life, will, she says, offer something a bit different from the sadcoms that have dominated TV in recent years. “My character is a bit of a fish out of water – she’s this brash, disruptive, North American mother who doesn’t act like you would think a mother would act. And she’s happy about being a mum! I don’t feel like it’s a drag. I think you can still be taken seriously, you can still be fashionable, you can still have fun,” she says, before pausing. “Do you think we should sadden it up a bit?”However, even if the tears are few, there’s a realism that’s never far from the surface with Ryan’s work. In both her sitcom and Glitter Room – previously seen on tour and in the West End – her hyperbolic, cutting gags often centre on motherhood, and single motherhood in particular. “The Glitter Room is Violet’s bedroom,” Ryan explains. The show is “about how proud I felt when I bought us our first property ever, a tiny flat. We decorated it to be really feminine, yet still in 2018 builders would notice that I was alone and be like, ‘That’s so sad, where’s the man?’ Or ‘You don’t want all those flowers – no man will want to live here.’”In her own experience, there’s still a sense of judgment around single motherhood, even within showbusiness, where she says she’s constantly asked, “Who’s watching your daughter?”, or “How have you explained your dirty mouth to her?”“Single dads are like sexy heroes,” she says, a subject she expands on live. “But if you’re a single mum there’s still a stigma.”The special was filmed in LA, where Ryan is less known than in the UK. “It really felt like proving myself, like you would do at an open mic or a comedy club,” she says. “But I think that’s always the way it should be. I’ve seen shows where you can tell people have been laughing at a comedian’s jokes for a while and they shouldn’t have been. I think you always want to be able to show up and be treated really fairly – ruthlessly even – by an audience and that’s the only way you’re going to know if you’re really funny or not”.Ryan compares having been a single mum to being in the Brie Larson hostage film Room, “except at least in the film the mum had someone bringing her groceries”. While she and Violet are supremely close, Ryan is also careful to give her daughter as much privacy as possible, and refrains from posting pictures of her online.Meanwhile, there is a chance Ryan may move home – and that wouldn’t be the only change in her life right now. While filming the upcoming series of Who Do You Think You Are? back in Canada (“I was just like, please do not let my ancestors have slaughtered the indigenous population, please!”), she ran into her high school sweetheart, Bobby, whom she hadn’t seen in 20 years. “I genuinely have always loved him, always,” she says. “I don’t know if that’s the nostalgia of your first love and being 16, but he walked in and I was like, wow. Then I just slept with him for an anecdote. I thought, he’ll go back to his friends and tell them and have a laugh, I’ll tell my friends, they’ll have a laugh, but no, I just really liked him.” She pauses, before adding a pained “Uh oh!”Bobby’s still in Canada so they’re taking things slowly. However, Ryan feels conflicted about the whole thing given her current projects. “It’s annoying because I have the special coming out where I’m going, right I’m not going to have a boyfriend again until I’m in my 60s. I also don’t want to abandon people. I’ve spent all this time talking to women who feel there is this culture that’s like, ‘She has all these cats and she says she doesn’t want a boyfriend but she’s lying, she’s incomplete.’ I hate that, because I felt very happy and very complete.”In any case, she isn’t about to start extolling the virtues of being coupled up. “Men are like dolphins – best enjoyed on holiday,” she quips in Glitter Room, and she’s still keeping Bobby “under review” she says. “I’m like, whatever happens, I don’t want to be in love, I don’t want to be in a relationship and I don’t want to get married.” Then she bursts out laughing and flashes a sardonic smile."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2c3f675ca11bd6a4a8df6d92252350117d3c18a/0_221_4242_2545/master/4242.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aff2ba5e76481b9fb4053ff9f08d8ce3","title":"phoebe waller bridge defends fleabag from poshness criticisms","story":"Writer says defining series as being ‘for posh girls’ undermines storyPhoebe Waller-Bridge has responded to criticism that Fleabag is “for posh girls”, insisting such arguments “undermine the story” and that people from a wide range of backgrounds relate to the show.While the programme has been widely acclaimed, some observers have said its main character’s privileged circumstances mean it should not be seen as universally relatable. In April, a  article argued that while Fleabag is “a work of undeniable genius”, those who did not recognise themselves in it were being drowned out.Asked what her reaction was when people describe her as being privileged, Waller-Bridge said it was “absolutely probably true” that many people do not have the same opportunities she did to be able to make “their Fleabag”.But she took umbrage with criticism about the substance of her work as related to her background.“To criticise a story on the basis of where the author had come from, or how privileged the author is, undermines the story,” she told the podcast How to Fail with Elizabeth Day.“I’ve never pretended that I’m not from a privileged position, I really know that I am … I was perfectly set up to have success in the world.“I suppose some of the criticism is that it was ‘just for posh girls’ and what I loved was that people were sending me photos of tweets ... There was one guy saying ‘I’m a disabled 42-year-old man living in Hull and I am Fleabag’. And it was like ‘Yes mate!’ because that’s always what I’m striving for … That people feel like it is a human story.”Waller-Bridge was educated at private schools and descends from titled nobility on both sides of her family. She also attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, one of the most prestigious such institutions in the UK.However, she said she had “really, really worked for it” and that her privilege in itself had not created Fleabag, though she conceded the tale was told through the prism of a middle-class family.“I created Fleabag, but from a point of place in my life where I was able to sit and write, and I was able to take the time, and I was around people who could support that,” said Waller-Bridge, who also wrote Killing Eve.“I like to think that whatever life I’d lived, wherever I’d been born or brought up, I would still have written if I had been given the encouragement, and actually that’s the thing that I care about, encouraging people to do it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f849ebea0930d551d6c630f21b09f7687425b9a/0_297_3784_2270/master/3784.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a2d54f4406020f500e7dd8edc0a4e36","title":"egypt urges christies to delay statue sale","story":"Egypt’s ambassador to UK fears statue of Tutankhamun was looted from Luxor templeEgypt is renewing its demands that the London auction house Christie’s delay a controversial sale of a statue of Tutankhamun, fearing it was looted from a Luxor temple.The brown quartzite statue of Tutankhamun with the face of the ancient god Amun is expected to raise more than £4m at auction at Christie’s on Thursday, a day after other Egyptian artefacts were auctioned from the same lot.Egypt’s ambassador to the UK, Tarek Adel, called for Christie’s to delay the auction, arguing that further investigation was needed “regarding the legality of trading in these items, the authenticity of their documents, and evidence of its legal exportation from Egypt”.The Egyptian embassy said it had requested documents last month from Christie’s to show the object’s provenance. The auction house, it said, replied to confirm it had the documents, but provided no proof and did not show any documentation to the embassy.Egyptian officials raised the alarm after the listing was made public, concerned that the 28.5cm-high statue was removed from the Karnak temple in Luxor. The statue “looks like it came from Karnak”, said Zahi Hawass, Egypt’s former minister of antiquities.It shows the young pharaoh Tutankhamun with the facial features of Amun, “a device used to align the ruling ing with deities”, according to Christie’s description.The listing adds that the statue was acquired as part of a lot from the Munich-based dealer Heinz Herzer. Last December, Italy’s leading court forced the Getty Museum in California to return an ancient Greek statue by the sculptor Lysippos to Italy, after the museum paid Herzer almost $4m for it in 1977.“It is hugely important to establish recent ownership and legal right to sell which we have clearly done. We would not offer for sale any object where there was concern over ownership or export,” Christie’s told the  when contacted to comment on the original listing.The auction house later confirmed sale on 4 July would go ahead and said they they had been in touch with both the embassy and the Egyptian ministry of antiquities about the sale.“We have provided extensive information about the Amun Head including our full cataloguing. We have also invited them to meet with us to review the work and discuss the provenance and accompanying documentation. They have not yet taken us up on this offer but we remain happy to welcome them to discuss this object and our processes,” Christie’s said. Adel disagreed. “The sale of such precious Egyptian artefacts is a huge shame and reflects a deep lack of respect to our efforts to stop this happening,” said Adel. He added that the auction house was ignoring “moral and ethical considerations related to the preservation and protection of cultural rights and properties worldwide”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95fd60d3066b50e9afefe28a51239838f14cc680/0_0_5333_3200/master/5333.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e6683b090ba242c2e28ca2446d125c6","title":"eu top jobs explained who is coming in and what is their role","story":"From Ursula von der Leyen at the European commission to Christine Lagarde at the ECB, your guide to key EU jobsby  Daniel Boffey in BrusselsJob spec: Established in the 1957 treaty of Rome, the president of the European commission leads the EU’s executive branch, chairing a cabinet of 28 commissioners known as the college, and setting the bloc’s policy agenda over a five-year term. The commission president designate is nominated by the 28 heads of state and government, but they must be elected by a simple majority in the European parliament to formally take on the role. Von der Leyen will be the 13th commission president, and will be the first woman in the post if parliament supports her in a vote in mid-July.Job spec: The 2007 Lisbon treaty created the current role of a full-time president, appointed by the leaders, who serves a two-and-a-half-year term, with a one-time possibility of renewal. The president represents the EU on the world stage and chairs summits of the European council, the body on which the 28 leaders sit to give the EU its political direction. The Belgian prime minister, Charles Michel, who is in a caretaker role as negotiations over a new government continue, will be the third such president of the European council. The convention is that the role is filled by former heads of state and government.Job spec: The ECB is responsible for the monetary policy of the 19 EU member countries that have adopted the euro and acts as central supervisor of their financial institutions. Headquartered in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, the bank has been responsible for monetary policy in the euro area since 1 January 1999.The bank’s president is technically “first among equals” on the governing council that sets the eurozone’s interest rates, but every word issued by the incumbent moves the markets. Mario Draghi’s commitment to do “whatever it takes” to save the euro in large part saved the currency.The role demands specialist knowledge. Although Lagarde is not an economist, her experience as the outgoing managing director of the International Monetary Fund and as a former French finance minister is regarded by the leaders as being sufficient for the role. The post is filled by the European council after consultation with the eurozone group and the parliament.Job spec: The president acts as the speaker of the house, chairing debates in the plenary and ensuring parliamentary procedures are followed. They also represent the 751-strong chamber to the world. The term is for two and a half years, which can be renewed once. To be elected, a candidate must win an absolute majority of the valid votes cast. Technically, the election of a president is decided by the MEPs, but the heads of state and government, as key members of their political groups, have a heavy say. The new president, Sassoli, is a member of the Socialists and Democrats group, which lost out on the commission presidency.Job spec: The idea was that the holder of the post would shape and execute the EU’s foreign and security policy and lead the EU’s diplomatic corps, the European External Action Service.

He said the person asked if he was lost and then suggested he leave.Magid suggested his physical appearance made “people feel uncomfortable”.He added: “MEPs don’t reflect the people that they represent, Europe-wide and I know i’m gonna stick out like a sore thumb.”However, the European parliament said no member of staff was involved in the incident. “We investigated the matter immediately after our attention was brought to it and can safely say that no member of parliament staff was involved,” a spokeswoman said.Magid was attending the opening of the new five-year session of the parliament.During a chaotic first day, Nigel Farage and his Brexit party MEPs turned their backs during the playing of the European anthem at a ceremony to mark the opening of the parliament.As a saxophone quartet and opera singer performed Beethoven’s Ode to Joy in the Strasbourg chamber , the 29 Brexit party MEPs turned away from the group to face the back wall.Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat MEPs took their seats wearing yellow “bollocks to Brexit” T-shirts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/760dc7d92c6d39a1bf7587cb1ebdeab0a2fef3cf/55_125_2861_1717/master/2861.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf919786b42ff5631f9faa3b33a7ba31","title":"nicki minaj to headline music festival in saudi arabia","story":"Saudi government accused of hypocrisy for requiring women attending to wear full-length robeNicki Minaj will perform in Saudi Arabia, it was announced on Wednesday, as the ultraconservative kingdom sheds decades of restrictions on entertainment.The female rapper is known for her outlandish, provocative style and hits like Anaconda, where she raps about her “big fat” backside. Her lyrics are often laced with profanities and her skin-bearing music videos often include twerking. Christian groups criticised her 2012 Grammy awards performance, which included dancing priests and an exorcism.Saudi organisers announced she would be the headline act at the Jeddah World Fest on 18 July. The concert, which in line with Saudi laws is alcohol and drug-free, is open to people age 16 and older and will take place at the King Abdullah Sports stadium in the Red Sea city.Reactions on social media ranged from shock and joy to criticism and disappointment. In a profanity-laced video posted on Twitter and viewed more than 37,000 times, a Saudi woman wearing a loose headscarf accused the Saudi government of hypocrisy for inviting Minaj to perform but requiring women who attend the concert to wear the modest full-length robe known as the abaya. Most Saudi women also veil their hair and faces.“She’s going to go and shake her ass and all her songs are indecent and about sex and shaking ass and then you tell me to wear the abaya,” the Saudi woman says. “What the hell?”Saudi organisers said the concert will be broadcast globally and covered by MTV. Other performers include the British artist Liam Payne and the American DJ Steve Aoki. The kingdom is also promising quick electronic visas for international visitors who want to attend.Over the past several months, the kingdom has seen performances by Mariah Carey, Enrique Iglesias, the Black Eyed Peas, Sean Paul, and the DJs David Guetta and Tiesto.

She travelled to Strasbourg on Wednesday to meet MEPs from her centre-right political family, the European People’s party.In that short meeting, she introduced herself to MEPs, speaking in her native German, as well as fluent English and French. Brexit was one of a handful of questions put to the new commission president designate. Von der Leyen, a close ally of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, told MEPs the Irish backstop was a necessary part of the agreement with the UK.She faced more questions from central and eastern European MEPs, who complained they had been excluded from the EU package deal on top jobs which had awarded positions to nationals from Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Belgium.Von der Leyen will be relying on the votes of the European People’s party to make up her majority when MEPs vote on her appointment later in July.The 60-year-old former gynaecologist, who studied at the London School of Economics, would be the first woman to lead the EU executive in its 62-year history.While she has won plaudits for her wide-ranging experience, her appointment has been heavily criticised by Socialist and Green MEPs.The election of the Socialists’ candidate, the Italian MEP David-Maria Sassoli, as European parliament president for a two-and-a-half-year term, came as a consolation. He won a narrow majority, prevailing over a Czech Eurosceptic, the Greens and the radical left, after two rounds of voting.In his victory speech, Sassoli paid tribute to British MEPs and described Brexit as “painful”. He said: “With all due respect for the choices made by British citizens, this is a political transition that has to be pursued in a reasonable way in a spirit of dialogue.”Despite this gain for the left, Socialist members of the European parliament were still smarting that EU leaders had rejected their candidate, Frans Timmermans, the first vice-president of the European commission.His appointment had been fiercely opposed by Poland and Hungary, two governments that are embroiled in a dispute with the EU over violations of the rule of law. Timmermans has been leading talks with Warsaw and Budapest on behalf of the EU, a difficult job that has made him the target of hostile coverage in the state-dominated media in those countries.Hungarian government spokesman Zoltán Kovács said the “Visegrád Four”, which also includes Slovakia and the Czech Republic, had demonstrated their growing strength and influence over the direction of the EU, in part, because they had “toppled Timmermans”.Kovács also boasted of the defeat of Manfred Weber, the centre-right candidate to become European commission president, who was the first choice of the German chancellor.Socialist MEPs meeting in Strasbourg on Tuesday reacted with fury when reports emerged of the Von der Leyen compromise, largely because of the defeat for their candidate who has been the EU flag-bearer for the rule of law.“It is unacceptable that populist governments represented in the council rule out the best candidate only because he has stood up for the rule of law and for our shared European values,” said the Socialist MEP leader, Iratxe García.Socialists and Greens were also unhappy that EU leaders had ignored the Spitzenkandidaten process favoured by the parliament, where candidates declared themselves before the European elections.The Spitzenkandidaten process is a method by which the European Parliament seeks to influence who is appointed as President of the European Commission\u0026nbsp- a role held from 2014 to 2019 by Jean-Claude Juncker.Under the process, each political grouping in the European Parliament proposes one \u0027lead candidate\u0027 to take the role. The presidency subsequently goes to the political party winning the most seats, or the one that brings together the widest coalition of support for their candidate.However, this is not a formal process set out in any treaty or constitution. The candidate for the role is nominated by the European Council, made up of the leaders of the EU member states. They are able to ignore the Spitzenkandidaten nomination and to chose someone else. The appointment has to be subsequently ratified by the European Parliament though, and therefore choosing an alternative candidate risks provoking conflict between the institutions.The Von der Leyen appointment “has generated a lot of unhappiness”, one source said, citing “fury” over failure to give Timmermans a big job, but also the German minister’s “chequered” history.“The other fury is that Ursula von der Leyen is already a compromised defence minister in Germany because of her defence contracts,” the source said. In 2018, the German Bundestag launched an investigation into suspected nepotism and errors by Von der Leyen in the awarding of contracts. The minister admitted last year her department had made mistakes in allocating contracts worth millions of euros to external consultants.The defence ministry has long been known as the “ejector seat” in German politics and Von der Leyen has generated negative reviews from army chiefs.Her appointment was part of a package that included proposing Christine Lagarde for the European Central Bank. The Belgian prime minister, Charles Michel, will take over from Donald Tusk as president of the European council. The Spanish foreign minister, Josep Borrell, will be the EU’s foreign policy chief.The Dutch Green MEP Bas Eickhout tweeted that the “very disappointing deal” was old Europe at its worst. “A backdoor deal with candidates emerging to please the national leaders from Germany, France and Spain. This is not the change that was promised to European voters,” he said.In an olive branch to MEPs, Von der Leyen said she “truly believes” in the Spitzenkandidaten system and heaped praise on Weber, the defeated candidate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8a953d867a6401adccd879470e7329c02b4cd23/0_109_1180_708/master/1180.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9bf03fca5e56c821eefc391aec5def91","title":"volcano erupts in italian island of stromboli","story":"Fire crews tackle fires started on west coast of Sicilian island enveloped by smokeA volcano on the Italian island of Stromboli has erupted, throwing ash high into the sky and enveloping the popular tourist destination in smoke, the National Institute of Geophysics and Vulcanology (INGV) said.Rescue services said Wednesday’s eruption on Mount Stromboli had started fires on the western side of the small Mediterranean island north of Sicily. Fire crews were being called in from nearby locations and a Canadair firefighting plane was already in action. There were no immediate reports of injuries.Michela Favorito, who works in a hotel near Ficogrande, on the east side of the island, said: “We saw the explosion from the hotel. There was a loud roar.“We plugged our ears and after this a cloud of ash swept over us. The whole sky is full of ash, a fairly large cloud,” she said.Tourists often climb to the 924-metre (3,000ft) summit of the volcano and peer into its crater, from which small lumps of molten rock are regularly blasted into the sky. It was not clear if anyone was near the crater at the time of the blast.According to geology, Stromboli is one of the most active volcanoes on the planet and has been erupting almost continuously since 1932.Fiona Carter, a British tourist on the island of Panarea, 17 miles (27km) from Stromboli, said she heard the blast.“We turned around to see a mushroom cloud coming from Stromboli. Everyone was in shock. Then red hot lava started running down the mountain towards the little village of Ginostra,” she said.“The cloud got bigger, white and grey. It enveloped Ginostra and now the cloud has covered Stromboli entirely. Several boats set off for Stromboli.”Stefano Branca, an INGV expert, said there had been a “paroxysmal eruption” on the island, which happens when high-pressure magma explodes from a shallow underground reservoir. “These are events of great intensity and quite rare,” he said.The island was the setting for the 1950 movie Stromboli starring Ingrid Bergman and, with other islands in the Aeolian archipelago, has become a favourite location for holiday homes for the rich and famous."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3945792.1562178977!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit is the uk having a tantrum says higgins","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGerman chancellor Angela Merkel welcomes President Michael D Higgins for meeting at the chancellery in Berlin on Wednesday. Photograph: Markus SchreiberAPPresident Michael D Higgins has described the UK’s departure from the European Union as Ireland’s closest neighbour having a “tantrum”.The President was speaking in Berlin on Wednesday at the start of a three-day state visit to Germany, on which he is being accompanied by his wife Sabina and Tánaiste Simon Coveney.Mr Higgins was received with military honours at Bellevue Palace in Berlin where his German counterpart Frank Walter Steinmeier said he hoped the next British prime minister will be motivated by Brexit realities rather than “fantasies”.Mr Steinmeier said Ireland “need not worry” about Germany’s support in this critical period because Berlin had “always stood firmly at Ireland’s side”.Looking to London, and the Tory leadership contest, the German president added: “I hope there is no increase in the fantasies of people who support a no-deal Brexit, and that those who have secret sympathy for this variant don’t overlook the consequences”.Mr Higgins said he was “very grateful and reassured” to have the support of Mr Steinmeier and the German federal government on Brexit and the Border.“The solidarity offered to our island at this difficult time is deeply appreciated and will help to contribute to the bedrock of our shared European journey.”Shared valuesAfter holding talks, the two presidents urged the EU institutional leaders to expedite work on pressing issues beyond Brexit. They also committed to closer bilateral co-operation on issues of joint interest such as human rights, climate change and migration as well as the United Nations and multilateralism.Later, during lunch at a two-star Michelin restaurant hosted by Bord Bia, Mr Higgins said he hoped that Irish food exports would not be adversely hit “as our nearest neighbour continues to throw a tantrum”.Later at a state dinner, Mr Higgins recalled a millennium of colourful personalities in German-Irish relations – from Sligo-born Lola Montez, whose affair with Bavaria’s King Ludwig I cost him his crown in 1848, to Berlin-born sculptor Imogen Stuart, who settled in Ireland in 1951.“While we speak a different language, we share values and principles which allow us to speak with a resonance and respect, not only on the fundamentals we agree, but on the nuanced differences we can equally discuss,” he said.In his toast, Mr Steinmeier joked that he was “somewhat jealous” of Mr Higgins’ popularity, whether cheered by the “big men of the Irish rugby team” or immortalised as a tea-cosy.He said his country had much to be grateful to Ireland for, from taking in hundreds of children during the first and second World Wars to assisting with the road to unification of Germany during the 1990 Irish EU presidency.“For all of that we Germans are – and remain – thankful to you,” he said.TeasingMr Higgins extended an invitation to Mr Steinmeier to visit Ireland, which he accepted.During the first visit of an Irish president to Germany since 2008, Mr Higgins visited the Brandenburg Gate, a Cold War frontier until 30 years ago, with Berlin’s mayor, Michael Müller. The President later laid a wreath at the Neue Wache memorial while a soldier played a rendition of Der Gute Kamerad (The Good Comrade).In the afternoon, Mr Higgins paid a courtesy call on chancellor Angela Merkel. Pulling up in a 6.6m bulletproof Maybach – just delivered to the German government – the chancellor teased her guest in English: “Impressive car, a chancellor doesn’t get anything like that.”Over at the Bundestag, in the middle of a packed schedule, parliament president Wolfgang Schäuble offered his Irish guest an afternoon coffee pick-me-up. Mr Higgins said he was fine: “I keep moving, you see.”On Thursday the state visit continues in Leipzig with Mr Higgins delivering a keynote address about the future of Europe and an “Other Voices” concert in Berlin."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3945149.1562136761!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"new dawn for european politics as next leadership team nominated","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAfter three days of unprecedented deadlock and whisperings, agreement has been reached on who should take the coveted top jobs in Europe.

A report by the London School of Economics (LSE) into children’s attitudes towards the internet found they overwhelmingly wanted a ‘grand erasure’ of their online footprint to stop childhood mistakes affecting their future.The research, which was funded by the Information Commissioner\u0027s Office, also found that children were generally trusting of tech companies in the same way they are of their schools.LSE researchers reviewed more than a decade’s worth of studies into children’s understanding of their online data and also conducted focus groups with more than 160 secondary school-age children.Professor Sonia Livingstone, who led the research, said children were generally “outraged” when they learned how much of their personal information is being hoarded online and wanted “a fresh start” when they turned 18.She said: “They say ‘whatever I do before I am 18 should be wiped off’ as it shouldn’t have any effect on them as an adult. They want a kind of grand erasure because they talk about the importance of making mistakes and just being kids trying things out.”The Government is currently looking at a range of new measures to better protect children online including imposing a legal duty of care on tech giants and introducing an Age Appropriate Design Code, which will mean social media giants will have to assume users are children if they can\u0027t age verify them.Duty of Care white paperMost social media companies have a minimum age of 13, but due to the lack of proper age checks the study found children as young as nine said they had profiles.The study found that children generally took instructions they received online on “face value” and often didn’t understand how tech companies were commercially benefiting from the information they handed over. As a result, they found it “puzzling” that internet companies often asked them to give out details they did not see as relevant to the service.The children interviewed were also shocked to learn that material they thought they had deleted could still exist online and wanted “delete to mean delete” when it came to social media.Other features children wanted from tech companies were a way to see which other companies their details had been shared with and “child-friendly mechanisms” to edit their information.Prof Livingstone said the children were generally mystified as to why tech companies were interested in personal information they saw as quickly going out of date as they grew up.She added: “Creepy is a really common word that they use. It’s creepy and sinister that all that data is being kept.”Duty of Care CampaignEurope\u0026#39s most powerful woman lived in London for a year under an alias to escape the Baader-Meinhof gangMorris

But the French exchange is becoming a thing of the past, according to a British Council report which found that red tape is partly to blame for its decline.Sending children on exchanges has “fallen out of fashion” in part due to the “safeguarding culture” and Government red tape, according to Vicky Gough, schools advisor to the British Council.Guidelines from the Department for Education state that English families that host foreign pupils should undergo Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks and for this reason many schools and local authorities are put off, she said.“Because the regulations say parents should be DBS-checked, this makes people think this is a risky undertaking,” Ms Gough told the . “Some schools and local authorities don’t allow any to take place for this reason. The whole culture of safeguarding has changed”.Now just a quarter (25 per cent) of state secondaries now offer exchanges, down from 29 per cent last year and 30 per cent in 2014, the British Council’s annual language trends survey found.The poll of 1,600 teachers showed that while a greater proportion of private schools organise exchanges, they have seen a steeper decline over the same time period.Just under half (48 per cent) of fee-paying schools currently offer the trips, down from 53 per cent last year and 77 per cent in 2014.“When I was at school everyone did an exchange, everyone’s older brothers and sisters had done one,” Ms Gough said.“If it’s something that has always happened, pupils have heard about it from others and seen their photos, they feel comfortable.  “But when it falls out fashion and falls out of the school’s culture, it then sounds a bit odd and risky.”Ms Gough said that exchanges may be declining faster in private schools than in their state counterparts due to the management being more “risk averse” and cautionary.At a glance | How to learn another languageShe said state schools are under more financial as well as time pressure, and may not see organising exchange trips as a priority.Ms Gough told how at in the mid 1990s, every secondary school in Durham did one or even two exchanges, but now there is only one secondary left that does it.The number of pupils taking French and German GCSEs and A-levels has plummeted in recent years.Entries for GCSEs in both subjects has dropped by 30 per cent over the past five years, while Spanish has dropped by a more modest two per cent. A-level entries are also declining, but at more gradual rate.Earlier this year, the Government set up a £2.5 million fund for schools to spend on taking disadvantaged children on trips abroad, including foreign language exchange trips. Ministers hope that the move will boost the numbers of pupils taking modern foreign languages at GCSE.Do you have fond memories of foreign exchanges from schooldays gone by?

In some cases this is accompanied by disruptive behaviour and a disrespectful attitude…At the same time, there has also been a major increase in unlicensed, invisible prostitution.”The city has raised concerns about human trafficking, money laundering and fraud, as well as controlling nuisance for residents and ensuring “visitors behave appropriately.”This month, the mayor will hold meetings with residents, businesses and sex workers and in September the proposals will be discussed by the city council, lawyers and the finance team.The red light districts are one of the most visited in AmsterdamLyle Muns, spokesman for My Red Light, a brothel collective run by sex workers and initiative of the late mayor Eberhard van der Laan, stressed that sex workers need to have a central role in the discussions.“Shutting workplaces without a good alternative would be very bad for sex workers,” he told The Daily . “But I am pleased that they are looking at new workplaces outside De Wallen, the so-called prostitution hotels.”Bert Nep, a resident of the red light district who has campaigned for change, said that voluntary policies have not worked.“Now we need a strong city government that dares to make strong policy,” he said. “Residents have called for this for a long time, and I believe they will be moved entirely from the city centre. A lot has changed in the world: you can order everything via the internet, and prostitution is no different.”He added, though, that the city still needed to ensure vacant red light windows were not filled with night spots drawing marauding tourists.“People come with the idea that anything goes in Amsterdam, and you have to stop that. The cause is overtourism, and the sort of tourism, not the prostitution.”Europe\u0026#39s most powerful woman lived in London for a year under an alias to escape the Baader-Meinhof gangMorris Dancers fury over plans to switch May Day bank holiday to a Friday as they organise march on parliament Judges are having to deal directly with rowing couples, complains family court presidentAverage male students put on twice as much weight as females in their first year of universityAsbestos found in nearly half of local authority run primary schools, new figures showPhoebe Waller-Bridge defends \u0026#39privilege\u0026#39 as she says it\u0026#39s not a fair criticism of her workSoldiers who used photo of Jeremy Corbyn as target practice have been demoted but not sacked, MoD revealsPolice arrest two Islamist terror suspects driving through LutonTourists flee hotels and \u0026#39jump into sea\u0026#39 as volcano erupts on Italian island of StromboliCockroaches are becoming \u0026#39immune\u0026#39 to insecticide, study claimsDenver culls Canada geese to feed \u0026#39needy families\u0026#39 and tackle nuisance populationComment: Watch out Boris, a no-deal Brexit could turn Theresa May into a chief Tory rebelBaby Archie Harrison\u0026#39s christening: where, when and everything you need to know about the royal serviceNikki Minaj expected to tone down performance when she performs in Saudi ArabiaIran will make next breach of nuclear deal in days by casting aside uranium enrichment limitDuke and Duchess of Sussex rule Archie\u0026#39s godparents will remain secret, as they confirm private christening plansSir Ranulph Fiennes calls on UK government to \u0026#39take a stand\u0026#39 against British trophy huntersWiltshire Council staff no longer wear fitbits, or take phones to meetings after cyber attacks in wake of Salisbury poisoningsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/07/03/TELEMMGLPICT000202672219_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"china accuses hunt fantasising faded glory british colonialism","story":"The Union Jack has featured in some anti-government protestsChina\u0027s ambassador to the UK accused Britain of interfering with a colonial mindset over Hong Kong in move that threatened to spark a major diplomatic crisis.Liu Xiaoming was summoned to the Foreign office after his comments amid a spiraling war of words over the handling of protests in the former British colony. On Tuesday Jeremy Hunt warned China of “serious consequences” if it sought to use the disorder as a pretext for a mass crackdown on the protest movement.  In a press conference called on Wednesday, Mr Liu said that Britain should “seriously reflect on the consequences of its words and deeds with regard to Hong Kong”.I tell them: hands off Hong Kong and show respect. This colonial mindset is still haunting the minds of some officials or politicians, he said.   The Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom has hit out at the British governmentSummoned to the foreign office over the remarks, Liu Xiaoming was also asked to explain the “unacceptable and inaccurate” comments after a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman described UK requests that Beijing respect a deal guaranteeing the former colony\u0027s political freedoms as basking in the faded glory of British colonialism.  Geng Shuang, a foreign ministry spokesman, said: The UK considers itself as a  which is nothing but a delusion. It is just shameless to say that Hong Kong\u0027s freedoms are negotiated for them by the British side.Tensions have risen since hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets of Hong Kong on Monday in the latest of a series of protests against a proposed law that would allow suspects in criminal cases to be extradited from Hong Kong to mainland China for the first time.The demonstration turned violent when a hard core of demonstrators stormed Hong Kong’s Legislative Council building and clashed with riot police.Mr Hunt said on Tuesday: “The UK signed an international binding legal agreement that enshrines the ‘one country, two systems rule,’ enshrines the basic freedoms of the people of Hong Kong, and we stand four square behind that agreement, four square behind the people of Hong Kong.Hong Kong was under British rule for 155 years before it was handed back to China in 1997. The handover was underpinned by a 1984 agreement between Margaret Thatcher and Chinese premier Deng Xiaoping that guaranteed protection for Hong Kong\u0027s unique British-influence political and legal system under a one country, two systems for at least 50 years. Protesters say the extradition bill would undermine the city\u0027 state\u0027s common law legal system and allow Chinese authorities to hunt down and persecute dissidents. Carrie Lam, Hong Kong\u0027s chief executive, has agreed to suspend the bill for the remaining session of the Legislative Council, but protesters want it withdrawn completely. Hong Kong police on Wednesday evening arrested 13 people in connection with storming the parliament building. Eight others were arrested for trying to steal and disclose personal information about police officers and inciting criminal activity online. Hong Kong protests: riot police baton charge and fire tear gas to clear demonstrations at parliament, in picturesThe city returned to normal Wednesday, and workers began repairing the many broken windows and removed protest signs that had covered the walls of the building for weeks. But protesters described a growing sense of despair and said volunteers had been dispatched to dissuade demoralised demonstrators considering suicide.Three people involved with the protest movement have taken their own lives in recent weeks. “I’m quite certain this political crisis will continue, because the government has so far been completely inadequate in their response,” said Dennis Kwok, a pro-democracy lawmaker, told The . “We need to safeguard whatever freedom and rule of law there is in Hong Kong on an ongoing basis and to fight for democracy.”Joshua Wong, a twice-jailed pro-democracy campaigner, said he was not involved with the group that took over the Legislative Council but said they had acted out of desperation.“I understand their intentions and it’s hard to encourage anyone to take actions that might incur 10 years in jail terms. “But I hope people can have more understanding. Two million people had already come out, but the government ignored them,” he wrote to his 221,000 followers on Twitter.Europe\u0026#39s most powerful woman lived in London for a year under an alias to escape the Baader-Meinhof gangMorris Dancers fury over plans to switch May Day bank holiday to a Friday as they organise march on parliament Judges are having to deal directly with rowing couples, complains family court presidentAverage male students put on twice as much weight as females in their first year of universityAsbestos found in nearly half of local authority run primary schools, new figures showPhoebe Waller-Bridge defends \u0026#39privilege\u0026#39 as she says it\u0026#39s not a fair criticism of her workSoldiers who used photo of Jeremy Corbyn as target practice have been demoted but not sacked, MoD revealsPolice arrest two Islamist terror suspects driving through LutonTourists flee hotels and \u0026#39jump into sea\u0026#39 as volcano erupts on Italian island of StromboliCockroaches are becoming \u0026#39immune\u0026#39 to insecticide, study claimsDenver culls Canada geese to feed \u0026#39needy families\u0026#39 and tackle nuisance populationComment: Watch out Boris, a no-deal Brexit could turn Theresa May into a chief Tory rebelBaby Archie Harrison\u0026#39s christening: where, when and everything you need to know about the royal serviceNikki Minaj expected to tone down performance when she performs in Saudi ArabiaIran will make next breach of nuclear deal in days by casting aside uranium enrichment limitDuke and Duchess of Sussex rule Archie\u0026#39s godparents will remain secret, as they confirm private christening plansSir Ranulph Fiennes calls on UK government to \u0026#39take a stand\u0026#39 against British trophy huntersWiltshire Council staff no longer wear fitbits, or take phones to meetings after cyber attacks in wake of Salisbury poisoningsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/07/02/TELEMMGLPICT000001905257_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqCHco2f1jjYcmYrb_Lt46Ut_htEfFEgfFFYuHA1RiMjM.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"cockroaches becoming immune insecticide study claims","story":"The Purdue university research found insects resistant even to pesticides they had not encountered beforeOne of the most common types of cockroaches in the UK are quickly growing immune to the best insecticides, according to a new study by Purdue University. Researchers found the German species of roaches blattella germanica can develop an immunity to toxic substances after exposure to them.Infamous for having survived a mass extinction that wiped out dinosaurs, cockroaches are once again proving their resilience in the face of man’s arms race against the pest. The study published last week found that cockroach offspring were immune to pesticides they had never encountered before. Female cockroaches have a three-month reproductive cycle where they can produce up to 50 offspring, making it easy to pass on the resistant gene. “We didn’t have a clue that something like that could happen this fast,” said co-author of the study, Micheal Scharf, “developing resistance to multiple classes of insecticides at once will make controlling these pests almost impossible with chemicals alone.”Scientists tested three different types of insecticide treatments on cockroach populations in the United States, over a six-month period. Even with a mixture of insecticides deployed, the numbers of pests kept growing. The study outlines that this resistance will especially affect urban areas and low-income residents, where antidotes to combat the roaches are not as affordable. Scharf stresses that an integrated pest management is crucial, whereby chemical treatments are used alongside traps, improved sanitation and vacuums.“Some of these methods are more expensive than using only insecticides, but if those insecticides aren’t going to control or eliminate a population, you’re just throwing money away,” Scharf said. Most will be horrified to hear this, as cockroaches are carriers of harmful bacteria, including E. coli and salmonella. In some cases the presence of the bugs can even trigger asthma in children. Appearing on earth 300 million years before mankind, and rumoured to survive a nuclear holocaust, cockroaches are clearly not planning on departing any time soon. Europe\u0026#39s most powerful woman lived in London for a year under an alias to escape the Baader-Meinhof gangMorris Dancers fury over plans to switch May

among","story":"A hiker was reportedly killed and another was injured when a volcano on the Italian island of Stromboli dramatically erupted on Wednesday.The explosion left molten lava flowing down the flanks of the volcano, setting alight bushes, trees and grass. There were reports that some tourists had thrown themselves into the sea in panic, while others jumped into boats to evacuate the tiny island, which lies off the coast of Sicily. Residents had barricaded themselves into their homes, according to Ansa, Italy’s national news agency.  The fire brigade commander of the Sicilian city of Messina confirmed the casualties to La Repblica.There was a series of violent explosions from the crater of the volcano, which dominates the island. The ash cloud enveloped the island of StromboliFiona Carter, a British tourist on the neighbouring island of Panarea, which lies about 17 miles from Stromboli, heard the eruption.We turned around to see a mushroom cloud coming from Stromboli. Everyone was in shock. Then red hot lava started running down the mountain towards the little village of Ginostra, she told Reuters.The cloud got bigger, white and grey. It enveloped Ginostra and now the cloud has covered Stromboli entirely.”We saw the explosion from the hotel. There was a loud roar, said Michela Favorito, who works in a hotel near Fico Grande, on the east side of the island.Two new lava spouts were creeping down the volcanoWe plugged our ears and after this a cloud of ash swept over us. The whole sky is full of ash, a fairly large cloud, she said.No injuries were reported but firefighters were being deployed from nearby islands and a Canadair water-bombing aircraft was also sent.Stefano Branca, from  the National Institute of Geophysics and Vulcanology, told Reuters there had been a paroxysmal eruption on the island, when high-pressure magma explodes from a shallow, underground reservoir. These are events of great intensity and quite rare, he said.Tourists watch the eruption of the volcano from a neighbouring island Tourists are drawn to its crystal clear waters, black sand beaches and the chance to climb the 3,000ft-high summit of the volcano.“I’ve never felt so much fear in my life,” one visitor wrote on Twitter, posting a photograph of the sides of the volcano on fire. Another tourist wrote: “Panic and chaos among the people present on the island.

Are you just putting the case for Remain ”After the interview in March, viewers complained that Miss Bundock was “rude and biased” but the BBC responded: “We’re satisfied that by the end of the interview Mr Martin was able to put across his argument in full.”Now however the objections have been upheld by the corporation’s more senior Executive Complaints Unit.It ruled: “It would have been easy for viewers to form the impression that the presenter held a distinct view of her own on Mr Martin’s support for leaving the EU without a deal, and the interview fell short of the BBC’s standards of due impartiality in that respect.”The statement added: “It has been stressed to the presenter that the way questions are framed should make it clear to the audience that this is for the proper purpose of impartial challenge and that a personal view is not being expressed.”Meanwhile the fallout from BBC One’s disastrous Tory leadership debate continues.New figures show a massive , viewers complained about last week’s show, with most alleging “bias against Boris Johnson” as well as favouring “contributions from the south of England”.Earlier this week The Sun revealed that the BBC had admitted presenter Emily Maitlis’s style “may not be to everyone’s taste” – then hastily deleted the jibe.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

From Pakistan to Poland, Israel to Ireland and South Africa to Switzerland, people enjoy the best of British.But there is undoubtedly more to do to turbocharge trade. That’s why we are guaranteeing that under our leadership, Britain will never join a permanent customs union and instead seek to negotiate a comprehensive Canada-style free trade deal.This means Britain will enjoy a fully independent trade policy to compete with the world’s biggest players.It is simply not good enough for a country as productive as ours to hand over its trade policy to the European Union.We intend to leave the EU with optimism and confidence. Britain can walk tall in the world with the lowest corporation taxes to attract business, a £billion boost for our armed forces and a competitive free trade policy.We will have political leadership at the heart of our team from the start of the negotiation with the EU.This will include the best and brightest, like world class negotiator Crawford Falconer. And there will be no need for a Department for Exiting the European Union.So we will fold these resources into a beefed-up Department for International Trade and Digital Enterprise.We want to be a truly Global Britain and this cannot be done on the cheap. We need to be competitive so we will increase our trade footprint overseas by doubling the International Trade department budget.So we must wrap up Brexit as quickly as possible. It’s an urgent priority and that will be our unrelenting focus until it is done.We both voted three times to leave the EU andothers had done the same we would have left by now. We don’t see Brexit as a problem to be solved but as the most amazing opportunity for our country.It is a task which will require confidence, craft, vision and attention to detail. It will require the promotion of some relationships and the resetting of others.And let us make one other thing clear: that team will never include the Labour front bench, which is hell bent on blocking Brexit.There are a few other things about our Brexit plan that readers should know. If we leave without a deal – not an ideal outcome but one that must remain an option – the full £billion orce payment will not be handed over.We will not pay a penny more than is legally required. Anyone who thinks we are going to write a blank cheque to the EU is sorely mistaken. To leave we need an experienced deal maker.Perhaps one who delivered a smooth Olympic Games in . Perhaps a deal maker who delivered £million a week for the NHS after winning a battle with the Treasury. Perhaps a deal maker who is already around the table with European leaders as Foreign Secretary.So today our solemn promise is this: We must be able to demonstrate real progress with the EU by the middle of October. If no agreement is in sight by then we will press ahead with No Deal.No one sensible wants this outcome, butit’s a choice between no Brexit or No Deal then we will never betray the democratic mandate that Brexit won in .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Imagine that!Why the sudden interest in women’s football  I’ve heard more than one person ask.Well, it doesn’t take a genius to spot the cause and effect — put women’s football on to BBC TV and people will not only watch it, they will bloody love watching it, and realise the level of talent possessed by the likes of Ellen White, Lucy Bronze and the rest of the team.It strikes me that exposure and access is the only reason that we as a nation have cared so much less about women’s football than men’s in recent years. In fact, I know this to be true. You know how Maybe you already know this too but just to recap, this isn’t the first time that our nation has fallen in love with women’s football.Cast your minds back a hundred years or so to World War One when any man fit enough to play football had been sent to fight on the front line.Back at home, it turned out that women were completely able to do so much more than stay at home looking after children.In fact they were able to not only take on the men’s jobs — they also took their places on the football field. And people loved watching them.Women’s football was absolutely huge during World War One, drawing crowds of up to , even after the war had ended.These pioneering women managed to achieve phenomenal success and recognition, and they did it at a time when such a thing would have seemed nigh on impossible. They defied society, challenged convention, cocked a snook at tradition and expectation — and changed the mindset of a nation by taking women’s football to unprecedented  heights, all within a couple of years.And they did it because the men were away fighting — and so they were allowed to.And then women’s football here disappeared completely.Why The men came back from the frontline — and they wanted their jobs and their football back.And the women  They were expected to go back to the domestic realm. And, just like that, it turned out  women were no longer considered suitable to be footballers.Apparently, the sport was condemned as “inappropriate for their bodies”. And so began a campaign against women’s football, the sport that had been appreciated by the nation. That culminated on  December , when the FA called on clubs belonging to the association “to refuse the use of their grounds for [women’s] matches”.It would be easy to conclude that they were scared of the competition.With women safely out of the way men could take their rightful place back on the pitch. Incredibly, it was not until after England’s World Cup win in  that women’s football began to be revived.In  the Women’s Football Association was formed, and in  — a full half-century after the ban — the FA allowed its members to host women’s games again.Still, though, until now the attention paid to women’s football has been pretty desultory.But that’s changed, thanks to the Lionesses and to the exposure that women’s football has rightfully  been given. And now finally, after  years, football may be coming home.England’s Lionesses are two games away from winning the World Cup, having shown skill, determination and hard work in the tournament.The way they play out from the back, the way they keep possession, the way they handle themselves under pressure is a real credit to football. The men should take note.I couldn’t be more proud and how fabulous that more than .million tuned in to watch them.To say that I’m excited for the USA game on Tuesday is an understatement.When you’re at boarding school you wear what you’re told, eat what you’re told, go to bed when you’re told. In fact, you spend your le doing what you are told.Yes, sure there is an upside to that – the one thing I craved when I came out of boarding school was independence, and it gave me a survival instinct.But there are lots of downsides, too, which is why I didn’t send my kids to boarding school.Although, on reflection, maybe I should have . . .BREAKING news – the Miss England competition has launched a  make-up free round for the first time.The idea is to support body positivity and natural beauty.For ’s contest,  entrants – including  Bethany Cammack, trolled as a teenage beauty queen –  have been challenged to submit snaps of themselves with no make-up.It is a far cry from traditional Miss England competitions, where most wannabes have been plastered with more make-up than the average Love Island girl. So I suppose, in a way, it is progress.But here’s a more radical thing. Should we  have a Miss England competition at all It’s outdated, old-fashioned and sexist.We should not rate people on their looks but on their character, what they stand for and what they do.No matter how you dress it up, the prize for Miss England goes to the best-looking entrant. With competitions like this still going on, is it any wonder young women are tortured by self-esteem and confidence issues Make-up or no make-up, it is still judging women on how they look  – and pitting them against each other.I didn’t know until now there is  a Mr England competition too, but that is just as bad.Talk about a bitter-sweet level playing field – where men are as obsessed as women about their abs  and whether or not they should be hair-free.WHAT does it say about society when men who beat up women are not jailed  It says that violence against women is often tolerated.Attacks on woman are the most socially tolerated form of violent behaviour.This week a steroid-using, drug abusing body-builder beat up his girlfriend so badly she thought she would die.She was the FIFTH partner this man has assaulted.He was not jailed as the judge  thinks imprisoning a serial domestic abuser would do “no good”.  No good  It would send a signal that it is not OK to beat up women.As this was his fth victim on record, I am sure there will be more, as he has escaped suitable punishment.He should be in jail and the judge removed from office, at the VERY least.IT’S hard not to feel  sickened by the fact Faryal Makhdoom and her boxer husband Amir Khan spent  £, on their daughter’s first birthday party.Faryal, , and Amir, , held the Amazonian-inspired bash earlier this month at the University Of Bolton Stadium – the same place where the couple held their £, engagement party and eldest daughter’s £, second birthday celebration.I’m sorry, but £, for a first birthday party  Where has  their perspective gone Of course everyone wants to throw their child a great birthday party, but a one-year-old won’t even remember the event.Wouldn’t it have been better for Faryal and Amir to have held just a small celebration and put all that money they spent – on something that lasted for just  a day – into a bank account  so that their daughter could eventually put it toward her own flat, or setting up a business when older Sleeping under canvas, even   it is dressed up as a “bell tent”, “eco-pod” or a “VIP yurt”, is my idea of a nightmare.Add to that probably more than , people, a woeful lack of loos, nowhere to hide from the beating sun and nowhere to wash – and it becomes a vision of hell.Yuck.ANYONE  do a massive eye-roll watching footage of Aaliyah, the -year-old Londoner appearing on Channel ’s  Hours In AE Not only was she there because she had just a broken fingernail, she was complaining at having to wait to see a doctor – I guess because the doctors were busy attending to real emergencies.Aaliyah, broken nails were why plasters were invented.You – and your mother, who took you to AE in the first place – need to get real.So do we.

We could end up with a version of Mrs May’s hideous Chequers stitch-up, with a few extra bells and whistles on the Northern Ireland backstop.That won’t wash, Boris. Voters have been conned twice already. They won’t fall for another blatant fudge.Worryingly, Boris has surrounded himself with Mrs May’s most loyal Cabinet supporters — ministers who connived, and failed, three times to get her botched deal through Parliament.He is listening to staunch Remainers like Health Secretary Matt Hancock.He is taking advice from Attorney General Geoffrey Cox and Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay who, for all their Brexit credentials, willingly dipped their hands in the Chequers blood. They each have a CV to protect.Bearing in mind Boris’s pathological craving for popularity, allies are also alarmed by the sudden support of old cronies and arch-Remainers David Cameron and George Osborne.None of them will tell him what he needs to hear: To save the Tories from the Farage sword, Britain must leave the EU as free traders.We cannot sign up to any iety of customs union, single market or EU court.Boris famously loves to be loved. He likes to have his cake and eat it. He hates making hard choices.But this is the biggest decision of his le and he cannot fudge it.Brussels’ greatest fear is Britain, the world’s fth-largest economy, as a free-wheeling tax haven on its western shore.It is, therefore, our deadliest negotiating weapon, and Boris needs to show his readiness to use it.He has frequently hailed Singapore’s transformation from a small, poor nation to a small, low-tax, well-educated, rich one.Against howls of protest, he backed Brexiteer tycoon Sir James Dyson’s decision to move his HQ there.Boris likes to remind us he won Mayor of London against the odds. But it is worth remembering he only did so after almost running out of steam.He needed to have his feet held to the fire with a blunt warning: “Let us down and we’ll cut your f***ing knees off.”Someone should sit down and give him exactly the same message today.THE most striking aspect of the Tory leadership contest has been the articulate energy of all the candidates – including the no-hopers.All are professional politicians whose job is to argue their case, sometimes without notes, and win over the hearts and minds of voters.It is only striking because Theresa May ­possessed none of those skills.Now we discover her Madame Tussauds waxwork has been given the heave-ho.

At worst, you’re Love Island’s head of Human Resources.What the ITV show really needs you to be, though, is the one thing you’re very obviously not — a host.Or just someone with enough wit and presence to draw attention away from the feeling I’ve had, ever since the th minute of the opening show, that this series of Love Island isn’t working.That was the moment Lucie arrived at the villa with a list of her own pre- prepared catchphrases. The public, I’d imagine, hated the presumption, but it was hardly unique to her.There’s an air of calculation and entitlement about most of this year’s contestants who, five series into its le, appear to have worked out what does and doesn’t play well with the public and are just killing time by the pool until they cash in on their performance afterwards.This doesn’t do much for the spontaneity of Love Island or the catchphrases which seem to have been replaced by those insanely annoying verbal tics that make the rest of us want to throttle everyone under the age of .Elma on Maura: “The bird has, like, ­literally lost her s**t.” Molly-Mae on Lucie: “I’ve, like, literally had her back in here.”Joe to Lucie: “You’re, like, literally a ­unicorn.” She’s, like, literally not.I think I could live with the bombardment of likes and literallys, though,it wasn’t for the overriding problem with this bunch, compared to previous series.They’re not very nice.In fact there’s a particularly ­indignant and gossipy bunch, centred round Anna, Amy, Molly-Mae and Amber and a couple of weaselly blokes , who are prepared to do their dirty work, that have given it a really unpleasant atmosphere a lot of the time.This has a knock-on effect, obviously.For the first four years, Iain Stirling’s commentary was the show’s outstanding feature.This series, it’s as manic as ever, but so flat and repetitive I’m starting to wonderI imagined the previous triumphs.This is by no means his fault. The deaths of two former contestants before the series began had already put it under huge scrutiny, and the spin-off seems to be that a small-yet-noisy chunk of the audience are now Love Island vigilantes who think it’s their duty to bombard Ofcom with complaints about anything, but mostly nothing.A great shame, as I genuinely love this show, which is normally the funniest and most ­gloriously un-PC event of the year.It still has its moments, of course.

There were busloads of them.Yet, with the honourable exception of Mark Radclfe, who’s a great broadcaster, the usual rules of presenting were suspended at Glastonbury.None of them were presentable, for a start.Genuine laughs were non-existent and nearly all critical faculties had been left at home, so they couldn’t even point out “s children’s TV presenter” wasn’t a good look for Tim Burgess, of The Charlatans, let alone hint that maybe Stormzy hadn’t had enough big hits to headline the Pyramid Stage.You’d imagine, then, that they all brought a breadth of knowledge and inside information that would illuminate the valley like , cigarette lighters being flipped on for a final encore.Jo Whiley: “Do you have any idea who might be coming out on stage with Stormzy ”Huw Stephens: “I have no idea.”But you’d imagine wrong.MEANWHILE, on recent episodes of ­EastEnders, the emaciated remains of Louise Mitchell have been found inside a shipping ­container that washed up in the Crimea, Keanu’s died after being tied to a chair and shoved off a tall building by Sharon, and new love interest Adrian Edmonson reacted to being doused in water by battering Jean Slater ­repeatedly round the head with a ­rubber frying pan and jabbing a fork into her ­buttocks.Not in broadcast episodes, obviously. Just the make-believe version I’ve got playing in my own head.Glastonbury, Jo Whiley: “Stormzy seems like the nicest guy on Earth.”Love Island, Molly-Mae: “I’m not a stereotypical social media girl.”And Drag SOS: “The Family Fabulous are travelling the country to give Britain a much needed lt.”Or yet another little needed ar*e-ache, depending on your point of view.JUST when you thought television had run out of jobs, holidays, pointless endeavours and ar*e-end-of-the-world places for Z-listers to visit, along comes this next game of Monkey Tennis.Trawlermen: Celebs At Sea, with Shane Lynch, from Boyzone, chef Antony Worrall Thompson and former England rugby player Ben Cohen, who spent ten days bobbing around the North Atlantic and throwing their guts up for the benefit of Channel  viewers.Before they reached that happy pass, though, the three of them were warned, in no uncertain terms, that one unlucky trawlerman had recently “lost his testicles after getting them tangled”.Something which, you’d think, wouldn’t hold any new horror for Ben Cohen after having to tell his we Abby what he’d been up to with the Russian dancer from Strictly.Two days into their adventure, however, he was confronted by something just as terrying, which had his voice trailing off, down in the gutting room.“I remember this monkfish coming towards me with its mouth open and teeth everywhere.“And it was a big mouth as well and I just thought . . .”Kristina  What the hell are you doing here Picture research: Marta Breese.The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “Who’s the only one of the Queen’s children not to have a daughter ”Vivienne: “Prince Philip.”Bradley Walsh: “What nickname for golfer Frank Urban Zoeller is derived from his initials ”Richard: “Tiger.”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “Which item of swimming gear is named from an atoll in the Pacic Ocean ”Andy: “Speedo.”And Bradley Walsh: “The Attenborosaurus dinosaur is named in honour of which TV naturalist ”Hannah: “Pass.”Casey Stoney: “Crucially it means Nigeria have only had  hours to prepare.

Schools wouldn’t be able to give kids what they need.Older people would have problems with their pension payments.Grieve’s plan would have brought about the very thing that he and other anti-Brexit moaners have been warning about: A national meltdown.As a spokesperson for  Downing Street said of Grieve’s Remoaner plot: “Any attempt to deny vital funding to Whitehall departments would be grossly irresponsible.”This money is for “crucial areas like schools, housing and welfare”, the spokes­person said. To cut this money off is to play politics with people’s everyday lives. This extreme anti-No Deal plan was clearly aimed at Boris Johnson.Johnson has said thathe is elected Tory leader, and therefore becomes the next Prime Minister, he will take the UK out of the EU on October  “do or die”.It would be nice to leave with a deal, he says.ButBrussels refuses to renegotiate Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement, and keeps trying to foist a bad deal on us, then we will walk away without one, he has promised.The anti-Brexit wing of the establishment hates the idea of us making a clean break with Brussels, even though .million of us voted to leave three years ago.And so they will do anything to thwart it — including bringing about a government shutdown.Grieve’s plan would hamper essential government work and potentially inflict misery on huge numbers of people.It confirms how ruthless the Remoaner set has become.There is nothing they will not do to prevent us from walking away from the EU.We now know that these people are not actually ­worried about the wellbeing of ordinary folk in Brexit Britain.That is how they have ­justied their Brexitphobic antics over the past three years — as an effort to “save” Brits from the consequences of a No Deal Brexit.Yet it is clear now that they are more than willing to make people’s lives more ­dficultit helps them achieve their political aims.That is because their ­over-arching, obsessive aim is really just to stop Brexit. It is all they care about. The Grieve wrecking-ball plan shows what those of us who believe in democracy are up against today.We are up against a political class that will do almost anything to prevent the UK regaining the independence that millions of us voted for in the  referendum.They will whip up the politics of fear. They will demonise voters as stupid, “low-information” and xenophobic.And they will let Boris know that they are prepared to mess up government spending — and by extension everyday le —he goes for No Deal without Parliamentary approval.It is a kind of political blackmail: “Do what we want or we will shut down ­government departments.”If it does make its way to debate, MPs must reject this cynical, dangerous, anti- democratic plan and stand up for the right of the next Prime Minister to play hardball with the EU.The vote for Brexit — the largest democratic vote in UK history — must be upheld, however much it offends Dominic Grieve and other moaning MPs.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

An emergency Budget. Huge sums found to keep certain industries afloat. Civil service holidays scrapped.Hunt, though, is unlikely to become PM. Andhe does we doubt even he believes he would preside over No Deal.Boris Johnson is more likely to do both — and must have a similar strategy. It was crazy that Mrs May did not.Today Dominic Grieve’s bid to block No Deal by threatening to inflict ­poverty on millions may be put to a vote. Labour may back it. Good luck explaining that to pensioners and those on benefits.No Deal remains the fallback. Let’s be as ready as we can.SIR Clf Richard and DJ Paul Gambaccini are innocent men who were ly accused and shamefully treated by the police and the BBC.But they are wrong to demand ­anonymity until charge for suspected sex offenders.Had paedophile TV star Stuart Hall not been named on his arrest he might have swatted away the three claims against him and lived on as a national treasure. Publicity triggered a flood of new accusations, proving a pattern of behaviour.Likewise for cab rapist John Worboys.We greatly sympathise with Clf and Paul. But the answer must not be an affront to open justice which risks the guilty getting away with crimes.It is for police to be less credulous as they sort fantasists from victims, to charge or clear suspects far more ­rapidly and to punish all  accusers.Secrecy is not the solution.LABOUR’S limitless self-harm continues.Taxing children for parental gts is a sucker punch for young middle-class urban Remainers — rapidly becoming Labour’s core vote — who rely on mum and dad to help them buy or rent.And the working class face punishment too. The pensions of , ex-miners, British Coal and British Steel workers will be trashed by Labour’s cut-price nationalisation of the private utilities they’re invested in.Labour detests the rich.

The DWP finally replied this week - but said it was too late to know for sure and documents may have been destroyed.    In a letter to the campaigning MP, DWP minister Justin Tomlinson said the government shared all relevant information which was requested by the review team. But he said it was up to the reviewers, not the DWP, to decide what documents they wanted to request. He added: The [DWP] would therefore not routinely share private information on claimant cases.

She also demanded an in dependent inquiry into all deaths linked to the governmentaposs social security reforms. Deputy Commons Speaker Eleanor Laing said it was an extremely important matter - one literally of le and death.

Circumstances that can trigger a probe include investigating whether there was any link to the DWP in a benefit claimantaposs death. But the Tory minister claimed it would not be right to publish them because they contain personal information. He added not all relate to fit-for-work tests, which have been undergone by millions of people claiming sickness and disability benefit Employment and Support Allowance. Mr Tomlinson said DWP officials had run a robust and thorough search to checkdocuments were shared with Dr Litchfield.  But he said: Due to theof time since the reviews were carried out, factors such as document retention policies, organisational changes and staff turnover mean that information that might help answer these queries is no longer available. Therefore, as the information is no longer held by the department, we are unable to comment on this issue any further. He added: The [DWP] does not hold or collect data on the reason for death for benefit claimants. Whilst any death is extremely distressing for the family, no causal link can be made between the likelihood of dying and the fact that someone is claiming benefits.

Sarah Elliott, , and lighting technician Paul Edwards, , tied the knot in Las Vegas on Christmas Day just hours after they met in person for the first time. The pair wore their wedding outfits at Gatwick Airport as they boarded a flight to the US. They had matched on the dating app just ten days earlier and even before meeting face-to-face they had the crazy idea to have a shotgun wedding. Ms Elliott - who later revealed her love of BDSM and sex fetish parties - said her marriage is over and she has sworn off monogamy.    The couple had been living with two of her ex-boyfriends, also called Paul, and there were claims Sarah was sacked from her job as a nanny after photos of her at BDSM and sex fetish parties emerged. One showed her walking around in a topless corset and leading around a man in golden mask at a Torture Garden event in Brighton. Ms Elliott has said she loves being a dominatrix and she has had trouble finding a man to keep up with her high sex drive.  She said she is now dating two toy boys - aged  and  - and will never settle for having just one partner again. She also said she will never date another man named Paul again. She told the Sun: “My marriage may be over but it has opened me up to a whole new world.  “I no longer believe monogamy and marriage is the be-all and end-all. “Now I’m living the polyamorous lestyle and loving it. She claims she tried to introduce her then-husband to the world of BDSM and sex fetishes, even taking him to a Torture Garden event in Brighton, where Ms Elliott was previously pictured topless.  She claims they went to a swingers’ night at Le Boudoir, a club in central London, shortly before they split, but it only further strained their relationship. Ms Elliott claims they split for good just days before their two-month anniversary after couplesapos counselling failed. Mr Edwards hasnapost commented on the split.  Ms Elliott, originally from New Zealand and now living in Crowborough, East Sussex, said her family and friends thought she was bonkers for marrying a complete stranger, so the orce did not come as a surprise to them. She had previously told how the marriage was rocky while she and Mr Edwards were living with two of her ex-boyfriends. Despite everything they had talked about having children. Dad-of-two Mr Edwards had moved from his home in Chichester, West Sussex, to be with his new we. Ms Elliott said the former couple still speak, but they have not seen each other since they split in February.

David Baker and Carol McCann, both , were spotted inside a grey coloured car parked up at Northern Cricket club in Great Crosby on a spring afternoon. Despite insisting they were actually just clearing up some spilt coke, they were later charged with outraging public decency by having sex in view of the public. Baker, from Southport, and McCann, from Crosby, both pleaded guilty during a hearing at Sefton Magistrates today, reports the Liverpool Echo.They instead described a series of unfortunate events, involving a can of coke, which led to them being found in the position. Prosecutor Sarah Egan told the court how the mum and daughter noticed Baker aposnaked, and facing the rear of the car.apos    Baker was moving aposback and forwardapos and there was a woman below him. The mumaposs -year-old daughter said to her: Mum, are they doing what I think they are doing  The mum then approached the car with a second adult, which was in the overflow car park at Northern Cricket club. As they approached the car one of the women said to Baker and McCann: What do you think you are doing  Ms Egan said: At this point Mr Baker pulled up his trousers. Ms McCann made no effort to put her clothes on. The two women took a photograph of the couple in the car. The incident happened at around .pm on April  this year. Ms McCann, a dinner lady from Crosby, told the police that Baker had spilt a can of coke over her and that  she had been trying to change her clothes.    She told police that although she was topless she had her knickers on. The court heard that the couple had known each other in their youth but bumped into each other at Goodison Park. On the day of the incident McCann had picked up Baker, who was married, at Blundellsands station. They were planning on driving to Formby. Nick Archer, who defended Baker, said that although his client admitted the offence he did not have sex with McCann in the car. He explained how when Baker opened a can of coke in the car it went all over McCann. Baker had spare clothes and decided to use the overflow car park at Northern Cricket club to get changed.    But when she started to get changed aposone thing led to another.apos Mr Archer said that although the witnesses thought the couple were having sex this was not the case. He said: It may have looked like it, but it was not actual sex. Mr Bakeraposs coke had gone everywhere in the car. She knew there was an overflow carpark at the cricket club.  It was a safe place for her to get changed.  But due to an event on that day, people decided to use the carpark. It was a number of coincidences. One thing led to another, but it was short of intercourse.  Obviously my client is full of shame and embarrassment He has had to explain it to his family. Joe Woodyett, defending McCann, said that she did not have sex with Baker on the day of the incident - but that she was ashamed and sorry for what happened. Sefton Magistrates ordered Baker and McCann to do  hours unpaid work each. They were each ordered to pay £ in costs and a victim surcharge of £.

The Kenya Airways plane was flying from Nairobi to Heathrow when the manaposs body crashed into the garden of a Clapham home just ft from a sunbather. The head of Kenyaaposs Civil Aviation Authority said the stowaway likely had access to secure areas at the main airport in Nairobi and was likely a worker there. He could have been a baggage handler, it was reported. And BBC News says the Kenya Airports Authority now says it has received fingerprints of the unidentied stowaway who fell of a KQ flight over London skies for analysis. Kenyan media said British authorities have sent the dead manaposs fingerprints to the counterparts in Nairobi in an attempt to identy him. Have you been affected by the incident  Email webnews@mirror.    CCTV from the airport was being reviewed as part of the case which has raised concerns about security. The stowaway - wearing blue jeans and a blue shirt - landed just ft from Oxford graduate John Baldock, a software engineer who was sunbathing in the garden of his rented home. Neighbours described a sickening thud, or whomp, as the body landed, leaving a crater in the lawn and smashing concrete path to bits. A neighbour said the body was intact and frozen like an ice block after it landed.  They said Mr Baldock, who is in his s, was left so shaken at the bloody scene that he had trouble speaking afterwards and he later left the home to be with family in Exeter, Devon. The stowaway was in the landing gear compartment, and it is believed he was already dead when his body plunged from the Boeing  Dreamliner as its wheels were lowered. The plane landed at Heathrow about ten minutes after the body fell at about .pm on Sunday. A bag, water and some food were found in the landing gear compartment of the plane after it completed the ,-mile flight.  A post-mortem is due to be held to determine the cause of death, which is not being treated as suspicious. Gilbert Kibe, director of the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority, told BBC Africa that it was unlikely an outsider breached security, crossed the runway and climbed into the plane without being noticed. He insisted there was tight security at Nairobiaposs Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, where the flight took off on Sunday morning for its nine-hour journey to London. Mr Kibe added: They do check every part of the aeroplane, including the undercarriage, the wheels, the breaks, the tyre condition, the wheel well that is above there. They inspect everything.  So when those checks were being done, it is not likely that person was there, otherwise he would have been seen. So at which point the person gained access, that is the mystery. He said the stowaway could have been a worker who had legal access to the airport. A source told the Sun: “It looks highly likely he was an employee as security has been beefed up and no one without a pass could get near a plane. He could have been a baggage handler or one of a number of staff given airside clearance.  “It’s possible that he could have bribed someone to get inside the perimeter but this seems unlikely and the CCTV will hold the key.” There have been a number of cases in the UK and around the world in recent years where stowaways have breached airport security. Meanwhile, a witness who saw the body fall from the plane as it prepared to land at Heathrow has told how he raced to the scene and said to Mr Baldock: It was a body, wasnapost it  The man said he was sunbathing in his garden on the bright and warm Sunday afternoon when he saw the plane and spotted a falling object. He told LBC: My friend thought it was just debris but as it got closer and closer it was clear it was a body.  He said the body fell for about  seconds and appeared limp. The man checked a flight-tracking app on his phone and worked out that it was Kenya Airways flight KQ from Nairobi to Heathrow. He jumped on his bike to look for the scene and eventually followed a police car to the property where the body landed. The man added: I just shouted at [the sunbather] aposIt was a body wasn’t it apos and he nodded. The witness gave the flight details to police, and thataposs how officers were able to get authorities at Heathrow to check the plane.  He said it was a miracle no-one on the ground was killed. A male neighbour said the tragedy could have been much worse. The body would have landed in packed Clapham Common had it fallen just two seconds later, he said. Kate Armstrong, , an au pair who lives near Mr Baldock, told the Times that she thought the falling stowaway was a drone. She said: I was doing gardening and I saw something in the sky - it looked like a drone. I didnapost think anything of it. I was in disbelief when I found out. It is believed the man was dead as he fell from the plane. He would have had to survive almost nine hours starved of oxygen and temperatures of around -C at an altitude of ,ft.

Itaposs hardly surprising that Kate often recycles her kids for important moments, as itaposs something she does herself. Since stepping into the public spotlight the Duchess has been known for re-wearing a lot of her fashion pieces - something many other royals donapost do.    Photographers have been largely impressed by her skills behind the camera, including the Mirroraposs photographer Ian Vogler. He said: He said: “It’s always hard to get a nice picture of very young children. I know from my own experiences. But the Duchess of Cambridge has done a really good job with the picture of Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis. “It’s a really charming image of a big sister proud of her new sibling.  “Both pictures are nicely lit with natural daylight the best way to photograph children. The picture of Prince Louis on his own is more formal looking but at the same time it’s very good. “Just getting such a young baby to keep his eyes open is an achievement.” "},{"url":null,"title":"lotto results live winning numbers","story":"NewsLotto results LIVE: Winning numbers for Wednesdays £ million jackpotSomeone out there dreaming of luxury holidays, homes and a glamorous new wardrobe may well find their fantasies become a reality tonightShareByAbigail OLearyUpdated:,  JUL NewsThe £million top prize is up for grabs in tonights draw \" data-chronos-request-url\"https:livecentreps-eb-prod.tm-awx v live-centre nationals-live \" data-embedded-url-endpoint\"https:www.mirror news uk-news lotto-results-live-winning-numbers- serviceresponsiveembeddedArticleUrl\" data-chronos-domain\"https:livecentreps-eb-prod.tm-awx \" data-inview\"true\"A £million jackpot is up for grabs in tonightaposs National Lottery draw.

Samantha Smith, , was left unable to care for her two young children, walk or even wash herself after being diagnosed with Ehlers Danlos Syndrome- a connective tissue disorder - in January . Last December she was given the earth-shattering news she risked losing her leshe didnapost undergo neurosurgery unavailable on the NHS. Remarkably she was able to raise the money in just four weeks and now is finally able to walk again following. Samantha was diagnosed after months of struggling with chronic fatigue, crippling pain and constant seizures. Her condition worsened by the day until last year when she was told she needed to undergo surgery.    Desperate, the former psychotherapist even began arranging her own funeral and making plans for the future of her children, Jensen, ten, and nine-year-old Brooke. Speaking about her devastating illness, Samantha said: Three months ago I was dying. I was bed-ridden and barely even conscious most of the time because of the pain and fatigue. My short term memory was non-existent. I had movement disorder, seizures and my heart was under great pressure due to autonomic dys. I went from being a businesswoman, author, columnist, and single mum to barely existing in such a short space of time. There was no care - no NHS support or knowledge. All I did was sleep and take medicine, I could barely manage an hour with my kids before falling asleep again. I would force myself to crawl up the stairs to put them to bed each night. It was petrying.    However, after embarking on an ambitious campaign to raise £,, Samantha booked flights to Arizona in February this year - and underwent le-saving spine stabilisation surgery. Four months down the line, the mum from Rochdale, Greater Mancs, is beside herself with emotion over the drastic turnaround in her health. As a result of the surgery, Samantha can now walk unaided, can take her two children to school and is working out to regain her strength on a daily basis. Speaking about her miraculous recovery, Samantha said: Since the operation, everything has done a complete u-turn. Itaposs immense. Every day I tell myself out loud aposIaposm not dyingapos. Iaposm suffering with PTSD and grieving the le I lost but Iaposm overwhelmed with gratitude for the people who have chosen to support and save me over and over. Itaposs only  weeks since the surgery but Iaposm back home living on my own with my kids. Itaposs an incredible feeling. Just being able to walk my kids to school in the morning and take them to the cinema means the world to me. I have my le back.    Samanthaaposs spinal stabilisation surgery and decompression combatted symptoms caused by two conditions - EDS and Craniocervical Instabilityand Atlanta-axial instabilitywhich meant the muscles in her neck were too weak to support her head due to the connective tissue abnormality. The ligaments and tendons supporting her spine were stretched and rendered useless. In total Samantha has had four neurosurgeries over the past two years to help manage the conditions, the most recent of which was a resounding success. Samantha is dedicating much of her time now campaigning for the le-saving surgery she had done in the States to be introduced in this country for sufferers of EDS and has set up the aposSave Samanthaapos EDS charity to help others living with the condition.    She said: I would not be alive were it not for this surgery. Nor would I be here todayit wasnapost for the many thousands of people who donated and continue to support Save Samantha campaigns. So many people are affected by this condition and could be saved with the right treatment. Itaposs not rare, itaposs misdiagnosed and misunderstood. At the moment itaposs not available on the NHS, this has to change. Some people travel to the US to have it done, which is obviously really expensive. Others canapost afford it at all.    Samantha is still suffering from EDS, Chiari and spinal instability but her condition is now classed as stable. As long as she monitors her health closely, itaposs hoped Samantha will live a long and healthy le for years to come.Follow and support Samanthaaposs journey here:  https:www.facebook SavingSamantha "},{"url":null,"title":"mum shares trick getting eight","story":"NewsMum shares trick to getting her eight kids to school with military precisionLinda Harlow, , from Surrey, said she \"sounded like a stuck record\" as she got the daily routine down to a fine artShareCommentsByDave Comeau:,  JUL NewsLinda Harlowat Holly Lodge Primary withRebecca, Ben, Daniel, Abigail, Naomi,Evie and Zachary \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA busy mum has revealed the trick to getting her eight kids to school with aposmilitary precisionapos after  years of perfecting the routine. All of Linda Harlowaposs children have attended the same primary school in Ash Vale, Surrey - with at least one child there continuously since . And -year-old Linda has got the morning and afternoon regime down to a fine art, to the envy of many other parents. But that will all stop soon when son Zachary leaves Holly Lodge Primary School, marking the end of almost three decades of packing lunches and waiting at the same school gates. So when Zachary leaves for the final time at .pm on July , it will be just as disorientating for her as it is for him, reports Surrey Live.    Linda said: In some ways it will be a relief but I think I will miss it. After  years you get used to the same routine. Her eldest, Rebecca Lamberth, is now  and first joined Holly Lodge in January . Rebecca would become something of a trailblazer for the family with Benjamin Lamberth, , Daniel Lamberth, , Abigail Lamberth, , a son Linda has lost contact with who is , and Naomi Kenton, , all following suit. The remarkable run was nearly broken when there was an almost seven-year age gap between Naomi and Lindaaposs seventh child, Evie Harlow, being born. But due to how their birthdays fall, Evie, who is now , started Reception just as Naomi left Year . Three years later Zachary, , started at Holly Lodge. Getting in and out of the house with one child can be a challenge, so with eight it had to be done with military precision, and the kids were all well trained. I sounded like a stuck record basically, said Linda.Iaposd say aposshoes on the rack, hand mummy your coats, slippers onapos. What my husband [Michael Harlow, ,] loved was seeing all the dferent coloured beakers in the kitchen lined up.    People used to say I looked like a mother duck with all her little ducklings, walking down the road. Linda said she would like £ for every time Iaposve done the walk on the school run and it would earn her a decent sum too.She has walked the half-mile route from her home or the reverse journey a combined total of more than , times. With children in the youngest years having a shorter day, at times she was walking there and back twice in a day. Holly Lodgeaposs current inclusion manager Carol Pedley has known Linda since her son Simon started at the school at the same time as Rebecca Lamberth. Mrs Pedley, , who started working at Holly Lodge in , said it was a bit of a running joke when Linda brought a new child into Reception.She said: It was just a production line. We used to see her walking up and down Vale Road for however many years doing the drop-off and then on to the pre-school. For so many years she was pushing a buggy. Those children came to school on time every day, always immaculately turned out. I donapost know how she did it. Linda has started working as a part-time leguard as she will have a bit more free time when Zachary joins Evie at Ash Manor School.All eight children have also gone to the same secondary school, where Linda is just as familiar a face.

In the lead up to her Royal Wedding to Prince Harry and in the year since, the Duchess of Sussex has dealt with numerous embarrassing outbreaks from her dad Thomas and sister Samantha. According to insiders her new father-in-law Prince Charles has been a huge source of support during some of the tougher times, which we saw when he offered to walk her down the aisle on her wedding day, and the Queen is also happy with how sheaposs dealt with the drama. A source told the Mirror: “The Queen is very fond of Meghan, as is Charles, and they both believe she has dealt with the situation in a dignied manner.    The whole family is ­sympathetic on how much she has had to deal with.” The heir to the throne has become very protective of his daughter-in-law, who he calls “Tungsten” because she is as “tough and unbending”, and they are understood to spend a lot of time together during family trips. A senior royal source said: “Meghan’s overriding view is that there is no place for her father or his extended family in her le right now. She has a strong family unit around her in Harry, with their ­adorable newborn son, and he has been very, very clear that she only wants ­positive influences for Archie.    “If anything she has developed a strong bond with Harry’s father and has discussed the situation with him. “She definitely sees Charles as a father figure, a principled man who has had his le played out in the public eye. “Despite the desperate pleas from the family, there is zero chance of a ­reconciliation at this stage.    Meghanaposs -year-old father recently used an intermediary to “reach out” to her, however she flatly refused to respond to him, saying she has been “grossly betrayed”, despite other members of the Markle family suggesting she should offer an olive branch. Meghan has had no contact with Thomas since she wrote him a letter in August last year begging him to stop launching hurtful public attacks on her and the Royal Family.

Not Coco Gauff. The -year-old reacted to her win with grace and charm, just like the defeated Venus Williams. And between them, they provided the best news of the week. We watch sport for the stories. Coco was the youngest player to qualy for the event since . Venus was the oldest woman in the draw. Youthful enthusiasm took on a woman of experience, and won in straight sets. Coco – real name Cori – was also a wildcard, just like a -year-old Boris Becker back in . Who could forget him vaulting over the Centre Court net after clinching the championship  It was a joy to hear people chant “Boris! Boris!” then. Not so much today. But most importantly, Coco was playing a woman she’d looked up to since Venus inspired her to pick up a racket aged seven. To compete against what you worship is hard, to win astounding – and Coco managed it for one simple reason. Over years of coaching she learned to focus like Venus and her sister Serena, whose picture was on her bedroom wall, urging her on. She trained, studied, suffered, strived, to be like them. And then she went on to Court One, brought her own game, and won.    Every strand of the story in that match is inspiring, but none more so than the power of having a good role model. Whether it’s Venus, Raheem Sterling, Harry Kane, or Ellen White, an adult who, win or lose, plays a good game gives youngsters a space they can grow into, and then grow out of. It’s like parenting, in a way, but on a grander, better-paid, and less-forgiving scale. Parents are always flawed, because we see them up close. An idol is distant and perfect, which is why the public get so disgusted when other pictures on bedroom walls turn out to include adulterers, gamblers, or tax dodgers. Venus Williams has known for  years the responsibility of being so admired. Perhaps that’s why after losing to Coco she made a brief appearance for the cameras to congratulate her, before retiring to punch the wall in private.    One of my idols was a chief reporter on my first local paper. She taught me how to handle death knocks, sub editors and Fleet Street drinking games. Another was my gran, who railed at Tories after Sunday lunch and baked stonking cakes. I remember being , desperate to have a purpose, and adulthood, and the ability to have a crack at all these things. They taught me how, just like Venus did Coco. Idols matter. Applaud Coco for finding her purpose, and applaud Venus for delivering it.

Vickie Harkness was convinced she was living in  and she had no idea who her friends and family were after doctors believe she developed encephalitis, a le-threatening condition causing the brain to swell, from a flu bug. Working as an outdoor activities instructor, the -year-old had always been fit and healthy but her loved ones were getting ready to saw goodbye when she remarkably started to recover. With her we Shona supporting her every step of the way, Vickie, from Carlisle, is now a competitive figure skater even though she still only has  per cent of her memory back. Vickie said: “I’d always been a fit and healthy person, then it just changed in March .    “It started with fatigue and I thought I was getting the flu, but Shona thought I might have been depressed, as I stopped laughing. Normally I find everything funny, but I stopped. It was like I couldn’t think for myself. “I kept saying things like ‘I need to send a Mother’s Day card,’ even though Mother’s Day had gone. “Shona would tell me where she was going, but  minutes later I’d phone her and ask her, ‘Where are you going ’ “I just started responding less and less. A week of seizures followed, the cause of which left medical professionals stumped. Vickie recalled: “Apparently, after I had my first seizure, I came round and Shona asked me what happened. I said, ‘I’ve just been to the moon.’ I genuinely believed I’d been there.    “A week after the seizures started I was admitted to Cumberland Infirmary in Carlisle and they performed a lumber puncture - when a large needle is used to extract fluid from the spine for testing - which came back positive for encephalitis and I was transferred to Newcastle Royal Victoria Infirmary. “They don’t know what caused it – just that my body was producing too many white blood cells. I think I got it from flu and my body was trying to fight it.” Soon after being admitted to hospital, things took a turn for the worse and Vickie’s organs started to shut down, forcing doctors to put her in an induced coma for a week. Her family and friends were told to prepare for the worst, but Vickie kept fighting - although her loved ones were warned she could be left severely disabled and probably wouldn’t be the same person. When she woke up, her short and long term memory had disappeared and she needed round the clock care. “At first, I couldn’t speak. It was like Iaposd turned into a zombie and Shona was told I’d probably need to go into a care home, but she told them the only home sheaposs going to is our home, said Vickie. “But I gradually started to improve. I remember when Shona asked me, ‘Do you want to come home Vic ’ and I nodded.    “It was so strange, because I knew when people were my friends and family, because of feeling something for them  - but I didn’t actually know exactly who they were. I knew I loved Shona, even though I didn’t know who she was. “I couldn’t control my body anymore, so had to use a catheter, and I would say strange things. The doctors asked me what year it was and I said .” After three months – with a promise from Shona and their friends that they would provide care   – Vickie was allowed to go home. She explained: “I was a really independent person and not being able to do anything for myself was awful. “I had to keep a diary of what I’d done the day before. I would read it and realise I couldn’t remember what I’d done yesterday. That was such a weird feeling. “Doctors would come to my house asking me to do things like make spaghetti Bolognese, but I’d completely forgotten how to. “I couldn’t remember anything from my childhood. It was like my memory had been erased. I used to play guitar and write little songs, but I couldn’t do that anymore. “I’d forgotten how to do the things that made me myself. The feeling is indescribable and I was embarrassed that I’d forgotten this stuff.”    Her turning point came in October , when she tried to get to the bus stop outside her home and ended up at a supermarket  minutes away – phoning Shona in tears to come and pick her up. “I decided then that I had to train my brain. I would use my sat nav to get to places and gradually do it on my own, relearning all the things I’d forgotten, she said. “I had to relearn how to tie my shoelaces and brush my teeth. I’d been taking driving lessons and had my test booked, but only recently I had to start from the beginning. I couldn’t feel hungry. I ate when I was told to. “It’s thinking for yourself and figuring out what you need and want, which people take for granted every day. Not knowing what you want is terrying. “You feel nothing. It’s so strange - you know you’re sad, but you do not feel sad. It was a really empty awful feeling - like I’d forgotten who I was.” Memories started to , but they were disordered. She had flashbacks to a time she was caught up in a storm in Maryland, USA, while living there when she was , or to dance routines she learned at college.  And while doctors were keen to get back to basics, Vickie was determined to rebuild her personality – learning how to play the guitar, walk her dogs and go hiking. “I felt thatI learned how to do those things again I would be me again,” she explained. “That’s why I decided to try figure skating again. It’s something I had done as a child. My friend took me to the ice rink and askedI remembered it. Before I knew it I was doing little spins. “As I started doing it, the memories came flooding back and I remembered things like getting medals when I was a little girl. “I said to my friend, ‘I used to do this didn’t I ’ I couldn’t remember but I just felt like I had. “As soon as I started training properly I remembered how to do everything.” Vickie found a coach and told him she was going to enter the British Figure Skating Championships, competing in the pre-bronze category, held in Sheffield in April – just three years after her stay in hospital. She said: “I didn’t have extra lessons or anything, I just did it myself. I told Shona, ‘I’m doing this’. Once I set my mind to something I have to do it. “I was nervous and wasn’t placed very high, but I was so happy that I managed to do it and I plan to keep skating.” Alongside her skating, Vickie has also obtained an NVQ qualication in childcare – in half the time it usually takes - and is back at work as an outdoor activities instructor. Now she is raising awareness of the condition and has also been organising a charity fun day to raise money for Newcastle Victoria Royal Infirmary, the hospital she credits with saving her le. Despite her admirable achievements, Vickie still wishes she could remember her wedding day to Shona, who she has been with for eight years, which took place in May  at the Hallmark Hotel in Carlisle. She said: “It’s so sad. My friend showed me a photo - a picture of my bridesmaids and Shona’s best men and I feel like I am starting to remember. I’m determined it will come back to me. “Shona is my rock. I trust her with my le and don’t know where I’d be without her. She protected me throughout my illness and made sure I felt safe. “She kept faith in me and knew I would come back because she kept getting little glimmers of me. I couldn’t ask for a better we.” Do you have a story to share  Email webfeatures@trinitymirror."},{"url":null,"title":"meghan harry have less money","story":"NewsMeghan and Harry have less money and far fewer staff than Kate and WilliamEven the Duke and Duchess of Sussex face \"financial restrictions\"ShareCommentsByZahra MulroySocial Audience Editor:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video say-what-prince-harry-just-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Unless youaposve been living under a rock recently , then you may have caught wind of the scrutiny the Duke and Duchess of Sussexaposs spending has come under.

Norwegian Pearl passengers who spent more than £, each have been told to arrange their own flights home  - and it could end up costing some couples or families thousands more. The stricken ship skipped ports in Palma and Monaco and sailed to Barcelona, where it remained docked while frustrated and angry holidaymakers waited for updates. The ship carrying almost , tourists was due to arrive in Rome on Friday morning, but the voyage was terminated two days early and passengers were told they would have to disembark and sort out their own travel from there. An upcoming cruise to the Greek Isles and Italy has been cancelled, meaning passengers stranded in Rome have been forced to pay for hotels or new flights. Has your cruise been cancelled  Email webnews@mirror.    Shortly after passengers were informed their cruise had been terminated early, holidaymaker Greg Hughes told : The ship is not going to continue on to Rome, this is going to be our final destination. They told us that we’re sort of on our own to make travel arrangements to get home. Most of us were flying home from Rome so now we have to scramble. Mr Hughes, from the US state of New Jersey, was on holiday with his we and their three children, aged  to , and the cruise - which began in Amsterdam on June  - was a high school graduation gt for their daughter. They were due to fly home from Rome on Friday but they will instead go to Majorca - to visit Palma, one of the destinations they missed - and then travel back to the US from there.    They were in the process of booking new flights home, and Mr Hughes said it could end up costing the family thousands of pounds. Norwegian said the Pearl suffered a mechanical issue on Monday. Mr Hughes, , said the company waited too long to tell passengers their trip was being cut short due to a problem with the -year-old ship. He said: We thought it was coming. It wasn’t a total shock, but it was a disappointment. Only on engine was working. They probably could have come to this conclusion sooner and told us a day earlier so we could have arranged travel.  After the cancellation was announced, there were long queues at customer service onboard the ship as people scrambled to make arrangements, he added. Passengers were told they would get half of their money back and the rest would be credit for a future cruise. The cruise line was offering just £ per person in flight expenses to those who booked independently. It was also offering  minutes of free wi as a gesture of goodwill. Holidaymaker Sharon Walker, who was stuck onboard after arriving in Barcelona on Tuesday, said before the rest of the trip was cancelled: I donapost think weaposre going anywhere. Thousands more were given just three daysapos notice that their cruise to Greece and Italy - departing from Rome - had been cancelled.  Ms Walker, a PhD student in the School of Law at NUI Galway in Ireland, said: We donapost really know what is happening. There has been no official announcement. Monaco was cancelled yesterday and now it looks like weaposre not going to leave Barcelona. I donapost think weaposre going anywhere. I think weaposre going to have to make our own arrangements to go home. Ms Walker said passengers were told the ship had suffered an electrical problem which affected its propulsion system. Norwegian said a mechanical issue was forcing the vessel to travel at a slower speed. Ms Walker, , said people were growing increasingly frustrated and angry, adding: A lot of people have been put out by this.  There are a lot of Americans and some Australians onboard as well, and it’s going to cost a lot of money for the families to fly back. Ms Walker said: We were supposed to go to Palma and it was cancelled. We were meant to arrive in Barcelona yesterday after stopping in Monaco but Monaco was cancelled. We were meant to leave the port in Barcelona this morning for Livorno but we havenapost left. It looks like we may have to disembark. There are a lot of people getting more and more angry as the day progresses. Before the trip was cut short, several passengers had tweeted to complain about a lack of information from Norwegian. One tweeted: “The Norwegian Pearl has now cancelled two ports of call during its voyage without giving passengers compensation.  Absolutely unacceptable, especially for a vacation this expensive. Will never sail NCL again.” Another tweeted: Stuck on Norwegian Pearl in Barcelona. Already missed two shore stops. No info from NCL. Learned on internet that next cruise has been canceled. Don’t know how to get to Rome for flights home. Come on NCL. And one posted: am call from my yr old parents stuck  days so far on the #norwegianpearl ship in Barcelona. No clear communication from @CruiseNorwegianthey can continue to Rome. Anyone have any updates  A customer who booked a spot on the next cruise starting Friday, which has been cancelled, wrote: Really @CruiseNorwegian  Now we are stuck in Rome for  days with no hotel. My bf and I planned this trip  months ago, and this is how you treat your loyal customers  Related video:  A woman from Puerto Rico found out that her cruise had been cancelled before flying to Europe. She tweeted: I just got to NY, my flight to Rome is in an hour. I am FROM PUERTO RICO and after  hrs in a call with customer service they just said to go back to PR. They can’t solve anything. They also said to pay a flight from Rome to Barcelona to take another cruise but also pay the other cruise because the refund we wonapost have it for another - days.  Passengers who were due to go on the cancelled cruise to the Greek Isles were informed on Tuesday and told that they would be given a full refund for the sailing and any pre-booked shore excursions. A Norwegian Cruise Line spokeswoman said before the voyage was cut short: We recognise the disappointment and inconvenience our guests have experienced as a result of this unforeseen situation and we offer our sincere apologies. Our team is working diligently to assist all of our guests, and we thank them for their continued support and loyalty.” "},{"url":null,"title":"riots india after girl 7","story":"NewsRiots in India after girl, , raped and left bleeding in road near family homePolice in Jaipur, India, are hunting for a motorbike rider who abducted the little girl, drove her to a secluded area and raped her before dumping her at the roadsideShareByTalia Shadwell:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL NewsStudents riot in Kashmir earlier this year after the alleged rape of a three-year-old girl \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA seven-year-old girl has been raped and left at the side of the road in India.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"monsters and magic come to lochgilphead booksigning","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead#s Argyll Book Centre is holding a book signing with Lari Don.The Secret of the Kelpie author will be in the indie book shop on Saturday June  to read her new book to eager ears and talk to readers about their favourite folk tales and inventing monsters.After a quick break, Lari willto read excerpts from her spellbinding Spellchasers trilogy to inspire you to imagine magical adventures of your own and tell one of your favourite myths.Born in Chile, Lari Don was brought up in Scotland where she has worked in politics and for the BBC.

Melrose at the local authority, told us: \"I am pleased that Newland Assets have listened carefully to the representations they have received concerning the Borders Gateway proposals.\"A Class  food retail store was very much against local and national planning policy for the site in Tweedbank as it introduced out of town shopping but the developer has listened carefully to ious concerns on this issue and removed it.ldquoThe new proposals have taken on board many observations made so far during the planning process and the revised plans are better in terms of design, road layout and visual impact.\"I am very excited about the economic impact this development could have on the wider Borders economy.ldquoSecuring a Premier Inn for the Scottish Borders will help put our region firmly on the tourism map and the economic impact of Premier Inn and the potential for other investors to follow them, is something which must be grasped.ldquoThe revised Borders Gateway proposals will complement the work taking place to develop the Tweedbank Innovation Park and will sit comfortably alongside the public and private sector projects which are underway at Tweedbank at present.\"The pound million Borders Gateway development also includes a BP filling station, a Costa drive-thru coffee shop, and a MS kiosk.And it is expected that the new outlets will create up to  jobs.Although the wider vision of the development had been welcomed, the supermarket part of the plans had come in for criticism.And Newland Assets revised their plans to omit the supermarket earlier this year.Councillor Parker added: ldquoBorders Gateway has the overwhelming support of the public and many businesses in the area and now that the food retail plans have been dropped there is no reason why these proposals should not be fully endorsed by the planners and backed by Scottish Borders Council.\"The economic advantages of this proposal signicantly outweigh the very small number of policy considerations which are left.ldquoAlthough it was right for the planners to raise concerns about the previous proposal, now that the developer has listened carefully to all the objections and amended the plans accordingly to deal with them, the Borders public simply wonrsquot understand why the council isnrsquot backing this ambitious inward investment opportunity.\"It will help bring new jobs and

planning development on the foot of the Eildon Hills.Rural Renaissance, the contracting arm of Melrose-based JS Crawford property developers, wants to build  homes on the Croft, near Dingleton Road, Melrose.Some of the new properties would tower m about the height of Dingleton Road, and the council has so far received  objections and representations.However, councillors sitting on Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning and building standards committee, which met on Monday July , opted to stick with planning officerrsquos recommendation to approve the development.Speaking at the meeting on behalf of the lsquoDonrsquot Build on the Eildonsrsquo campaign group, Melrose resident Carrie Henderson told councillors: ldquoBad design has been compounded by certain stipulations made in the planning brief.ldquoThe requirement for a road to loop around the nursery, when combined with the awkward levels on the site, have results in plans for houses on the southern slopes being some  metres higher than the level of the road.ldquoBe in no doubt, this housing estate will be dominant, intrusive and jarring. It will be an eyesore.Philip Neaves, from Edinburgh-based Felsham Planning and Development, spoke on behalf of Rural Renaissance.He said: ldquoThe Croft is an allocated development site that was allocated in .ldquoThe reporter who allocated the site would have been well aware of the sensitivity of the site but has still allocated it.ldquoWhat we have is proposals for  houses for private sale and seven affordable housing units.ldquoThe site, when viewed from Melrose, appears as part of the settlement, not the countryside, and views of the site from the Eildons are limited.ldquoThere are signicant economic benefits to the development, not just for employment during the construction phase but for nearby residents as well.Nearly all of the councillors expressed reservations about the development, but only one, Galashiels councillor Sandy Aitchison, voted against the proposals.He told the committee: ldquoThe fact is the reporter has made a big mistake here and the land should never have been allocated for housing in the first place.ldquoFurthermore, I donrsquot like the fact wersquove got affordable housing as a token gesture, itrsquos not spread out in the site and there are no family homes.\"Do people who need affordable homes not have families ldquoThere are so many objections. Many are from where and they are asking us to step in and protect this site which we as a local authority are charged with protecting.ldquoI really object to this application for a number of reasons.Melrose and Leaderdale councillor Tom Miers, who chairs the committee, also criticised the proposals but said he believes it can be acceptedthe council imposes certain planning conditions: ldquoI have real problems with the design and concept. I think the houses at the back are much too high and they stick out too much.ldquoThe middle three in particular, which will be at the back of the site, should be reduced in height.He suggested that the houses be reduced, by way of a planning condition, from three storey houses down to two storey.All councillors except councillor Aitchison were in agreement, and as he failed to find a seconder for his motion to reject the application, the proposals were granted planning permission without the need for a vote.Speaking after the meeting, Ms Henderson said: ldquoOver  people objected to this development and yet in the end it felt like their opinion counted for nothing. Todayrsquos decision is obviously a huge disappointment for them.ldquoUnfortunately, the planning committee couldnrsquot, or wouldnrsquot, see past the fact that this site is in the local plan.ldquoThe arguments we put forward that the proposal for the Croft is sub-standard and would irrevocably scar the view of the Eildons fell on completely deaf ears and the committee happily waved it through.ldquoFuture generations will look back and wonder how it was possible that a housing estate was ever allowed to be built on the beautul Eildons. But by then, of course, it will be too late.ldquoThe members of the planning committee, bar the one councillor who objected, should be ashamed of themselves for the decision they made today."},{"url":null,"title":"homophobic-selkirk-man-ordered-to-pay-compensation-to-couple","story":"A LABOURER from Selkirk has admitted hurling homophobic abuse towards two men.Then a month later Andrew Gillie approached both and told themthey didnt drop charges he would kill them.The -year-old of Buccleuch Road, pleaded guilty at the towns sherf court to behaving in a threatening or abusive manner and making abusive and homophobic comments in Yarrow Terrace, Selkirk, on August .He also admitted a charge of threatening the two men in Bridge Street, Selkirk, on September .Procurator fiscal Graham Fraser said the first incident happened at .pm when the two men, who are in a relationship with each other, became aware of Gillie and a female standing on a pavement.Gillie made a homophobic comment about one of the men.Mr Fraser said: \"He is fed up being targeted about his sexuality and was alarmed at what had taken place.\"The fiscal said Gillie had been cautioned and charged over that but came across the two men at about .pm on September  when they were walking their dog.Mr Fraser said: \"He said you better drop the charges or I will kill you.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

The nursery sector has been warning the Scottish Government that private nurseries are struggling in the run-up to the roll-out of its flagship , policy from August .ldquoMinisters must act quickly to address the sectorrsquos concerns and ensure that the capacity exists to deliver the funded hours next year.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoIt is, of course, concerning to hear of any nursery considering closure, and the obvious effects this might have on staff, parents and children.ldquoEast Lothian Council has provided assurance that they will support families to find alternative early learning and childcare places for children who had been expecting to use the Mary Poppins Nursery from this August.Ms Dewar added: ldquoI am distraught that circumstances have forced me to this decision and that such a wonderful place for children to experience their early years is to close.The decision was met with an outpouring of grief on social media.The nurseryrsquos recent th birthday was marked with a garden party.The nursery was founded by Sue Armstrong, affectionately still called lsquoMiss Suersquo, after she had written to Mary Poppins author P L Travers to askshe could use the name.Miss Sue said: ldquoI received many letters from P L Travers about the nursery.ldquoAt the beginning, she wanted to know what the nursery was going to be like. She had no objection to me using the name, she just wanted to find out more. I ended up meeting her as well.ldquoWe were hoping to get her to come and open the nursery  years ago, but her arthritis was bad. We stayed in touch, however. I would send her letters about how the nursery was getting on along with photos, and she would write back saying how she liked it, and ideas of what to do.ldquoShe said that the children should be encouraged to make up their own stories. lsquoChildren like doing that,rsquo she said.Miss Sue sold the nursery to Ms Dewar in  as she was ldquosick of all the paperwork.She said. ldquoWhen I heard it was to close down, well, itrsquos just all so sad really. Itrsquos such a terrible shame.ldquoIt is such a nice and happy place for the children, homely and warm. Itrsquos just awful that it canrsquot stay open.Miss Sue still attends events at the nursery, dressed as the iconic nanny Mary Poppins.She added: ldquoIn the film, Mary Poppins says that shersquoll stay until the winds change. Well, maybe this is the wind changing for Mary Poppins Nursery.Ward councillor Craig Hoy said: ldquoThe closure of the Mary Poppins Nursery is deeply regrettable but reflects the real pressures the independent sector is experiencing as a result of the SNPrsquos , hours policy.\"The Government faces huge problems to provide the free childcare it has promised. In many areas the level of nursery provision simply isnrsquot there and independent nurseries are already struggling financially with the planned

Five minutes in a car can cover a distance which would represent a fairly long walk.Itrsquos kind of a simple principle, I know, but one I sometimes forget, as I did a couple of weekends ago. We set off from an event at Amisfield Walled Garden for a walk. My idea was to walk along the River Tyne to Hailes Castle and thenndash by car a -minute round trip.We had some supplies in the form of fruit in my bag and a little water. It was a sunny and warm day and so we set off on our adventure.We began the walk at the old Abbey Bridge which spans the Tyne close to Amisfield. As you walk under its ancient ribbed arches of this late medieval bridge, you get a real sense of its age and the beauty of its construction.The path beyond follows the river and it is almost impossible now to imagine that a great abbey once stood here, with connections to the infant Mary Queen of Scots. A ruined old mill of later centuries still stands here. I reflected on the stories of this location: a courageous nun who defied a flood in the th century and a gruesome murder in the th century and just visible in the near distance the old graveyard, now ringed with trees and almost unrecognisable as a resting place for the dead.A labourer once thought he saw a ghost at the graveyard, but it proved to be something , and I had a wry smile at that tale of a drunken evening over  years ago. These are all tales I have already told here, but they entered my head as we wandered to the gate that led along the northern bank of the river.Hailes Castle is on the southern bank of the river and I knew that there was a bridge that would takes us over. So we set off to find the bridge.But it took us over four hours.It was a stunning walk, with wild flowers and trees decorating the riverbank almost all the way. A grey heron seemed to follow us perhaps he was warning us that the walk was longer than Irsquod anticipated.It is a walk decorated with history too, of course. A stone in the corner of the field by the first gate caught my eye. Deeply ingrained groove marks on it intrigued me. I was later told that it could be the marks of a plough, as the tips of the plough have scraped over the stone a ploughman unwittingly leaving evidence of his unrecorded toil.Halfway along the walk we arrived at the small hamlet of Sandyrsquos Mill. The cottages and mill itself have been beautully restored. The th-century mill still has its waterwheel, although itrsquos now embedded in silt. The mill ceased working  years ago and was transformed into a residential property, but with much of the old machinery inside still intact. It appears to be a very sympathetic and sensitive restoration.It was beyond Sandyrsquos Mill that the distance began to take its toll. The young kids were tired and desperately looking for the bridge. I spotted Traprain Law some distance away and realised that I had badly misjudged the distance and time it would take with wee ones. We had to sit and have a rest and story, with that grey heron listening, to gather the energy to continue.The kids didnrsquot complain much as we wandered along the still-beautul path, now desperately looking for the bridge. As we had rested wersquod phoned for friends to come and lsquorescuersquo us at Hailes Castle with chocolate and water, and we knew they were there waiting for us.Irsquove never been quite so pleased to see Hailes Castle. It loomed suddenly from across the river. I had never approached it from this direction and it certainly did its best to impress. The bridge was just a wee way further and we finally crossed it with a sense of relief.When we arrived at the castle, the kids devoured the chocolate and water, in a way that reminded me of a scene in the movie Ice Cold in Alex. Thank goodness for good friends.Wersquod made it and what a sense of adventure ndash and an achievement!I sat with the kids and told stories as my we went with the friends to retrieve our car. Hailes Castle drips with history but they wanted tales about giants.The day was a lesson for me: to think more carefully about distance when setting on a walk! I thoroughly recommend the path, especially on a lovely summerrsquos day. But itrsquos going to take half a dayyou have kids. So prepare for that!Unbelievably, the kids later wanted to go to a playpark. ldquoWhere do they get the energy  my we asked.ldquoFrom us! I replied!"},{"url":null,"title":"hopes-of-seeing-railway-station-return-to-haddington","story":"RAGESmet with Peter Brett Associates ndash a leading consultancy of engineers and planners ndash to outline the case for improved transports links to and from East Lothian.One of the more ambitious plans was to see theof a railway station to Haddington.Residents of the town have not been served by a railway station since , with the station closing to freight nearly  years later.However, RAGES feels there could still be a possibility of a station ing to the town ndash though the group acknowledged that work needed to be done.A spokesman for the group said: ldquoRAGES expressed its preference for re-opening of the Haddington branch, ideally to the previous terminus on Station Road.ldquoMinimal compulsory purchase relocation of existing industrial units would be required the biggest physical obstacle would be the reconstruction of the A overbridge which was unwisely built without preserving the railway alignment and loading gauge.ldquoA level crossing would be required at Gateside, failing which an alternative road access could be provided for the new houses on the north side of the line onto the A.There was also a suggestion of creating car parking and even a park and ride facility in the town to serve the new service, which would link the town with Edinburgh.The spokesman added: ldquoAs insufficient parking exists at Station Road , a park and ride station at Oak Tree would be essential, which could also serve the substantial Letham Mains and Gateside developments.ldquoJust east of where the A crosses the railway formation, there is a large rectangular piece of ground, occupied only by scrub, which would be suitable as a car park.ldquoAs only single track would suffice between Longniddry and Haddington, it would be possible to retain a footpath cycleway as the line was originally provided with double track throughout.ldquoAn electric train service from Haddington to Edinburgh would provide the speed and capacity which road transport ndash car or bus ndash cannot match.

It is better than some human beings are treated ndash that is the sad truth.Mr Farnsworth was presenting an annual report on the racecoursersquos performance over the last financial year.The Beast from the East snow storm, an outbreak of equine influenza, and a long spell of dry weather all contributed to what he described as one of the worst years the course had been through in his memory.A number of key fixtures were cancelled and profits fell.In December, four horses died during one day of racing at the course but a subsequent review by the British Horseracing Authority ruled that the course and race organisers were not at fault.Councillor Gordon Mackett asked Mr Farnsworththe racecourse had been affected by animal welfare concerns.The course manager said: ldquoWe did have a horrible day when there were four fatalities however, these were all completely separate incidents.ldquoIn a sport like this you will get injuries and fatalities from time to time. It is horric for the people involved.Mr Farnsworth said that the public were becoming more aware of incidents like these through social media which, he said, ldquofuelled the debate around animal welfare.However, he said there had been no indication that it had had an impact on events at Musselburgh, which saw record crowds at its Easter Day racing this year and another sell-out Ladies Day.His report to the committee revealed that the racecourse had reported a loss over the last financial year after it paid over pound, of legal costs relating to the ongoing process by East Lothian Council to find new third-party operators to run the course.Councillor Kenny McLeod questioned why the costs were being met by the course and not the council itself.However, depute chief executive of the council Alex McCrorie told the councillor that the costs were charged to the racecourse because when the new operator was procured it would be the racecourse that benefitted.He conceded to Mr McLeod that, without the legal costs being taken from the coursersquos funds, it would have been in profit last year.East Lothian Council replaced the previous governance committee which oversaw the running of the course with a new committee last year after relations between members of the old committee badly deteriorated and the British Horseracing Authoritythreatening to suspend its racing licence.The new Musselburgh Racing Associated Committeendash which is made up of four elected councillors and two representatives of the racing industry, currently members of Lothians Racing Syndicate ndash has been overseeing the hunt for a new operator.However, the BHA has only granted temporary licences and extensions under the new committee as it continues to monitor its performance.Mr Farnsworth said that the introduction of the new interim committee had caused some problems too.

I have heard many dferent versions of this tale, and most recently come across one version in a book by Taffy Thomas, who is a renowned storyteller. Here is my version of the story, which I have titled lsquoThe Riddle Rulersquo:IT WAS to be the final race of the tournament. The two knights had been equally matched, and now they would race each other for the prize of a gold cup filled with gold coins.There was an air of excitement as the crowds gathered for this race. Sir John and Sir Harry arrived together, each mounted on their stallions. Sir Johnrsquos horse was called Lightning, while Sir Harryrsquos horse was named Spear.They were equally matched, both knights had won an equal amount of races, and both had won against each other. There was no favourite, everyone knew this race would be very close.The atmosphere was electric with anticipation.Then the kingrsquos storyteller leaned over to whisper in the kingrsquos ear: ldquoYour majesty, this race is the last of the tournament. I feel it should be a race with an extra challenge, so that the crowd are better pleased.The king agreed, but asked the storyteller what he thought the extra challenge should be.ldquoThe race should be a test of the knightsrsquo wits as well as their riding ability, replied the storyteller. ldquoSet them a riddle rule and see how they solve it.ldquoAnd what is the riddle rule to be  asked the king.The storyteller smiled: ldquoDeclare the rules of this race to be thus: the horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and coins for its owner.And so the king declared the riddle rule just before the beginning of the race: ldquoThe horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and gold for its owner.There was a murmuring amongst the spectators. The knights looked at each other, thinking.When the starter flag was lowered and the king cried ldquogo, both knights stayed at the starting line. ldquoYou go first, said Sir John to Sir Harry. ldquoNo, after you, said Sir Harry to Sir John. But neither knight was willing to leave the start line lest they be deemed to be first.Soon there were boos and clapping from the crowd, but the prize was too great for either knight to risk going first.ldquoThis race is no fun, said the king to the storyteller, annoyed now that hersquod agreed to the change in rules.ldquoGive them until this afternoon to find a way to race, replied the storyteller, ldquothere is a way but they must discover it. It will challenge their wits and also their riding skills.And so the king stood: ldquoThe race is postponed until pm this afternoon. The knights must find a way to race to the riddle rule, otherwise the prize will be forfeited.For the rest of the day there was an excited buzz as people began to discuss possible solutions to the riddle rule with the knights.ldquoWhy donrsquot you agree to cross the finish line together  was one suggestionldquoBut then they would be equal first and the prize would be lost, commented another.ldquoBesides, said Sir John, ldquoI do not trust Sir Harry not to pull his horse back at the last moment. ldquoI do not trust you either, said Sir Harry.The deadline was fast approaching and no solution to the riddle rule had been found.ldquoPerhaps being first is more important than winning the gold, said an old woman.The knights looked at each other, thinking about this. Then they both said ldquonaw and shook their heads.It was  minutes before the race and a child came up to the knights and said: ldquoI have an idea. Everyone looked down at the child and laughed. How could a poor child know the answer when the knights themselves and all the spectators were scunnered But the storyteller was walking by and overheard the laughter. ldquoChildrenrsquos wisdom is not to be laughed at, he scolded them.And so the knights asked the child for the solution.The child said two words to the knights.In a flash, the knights got mounted and prepared to race. When the starter flag was lowered and the king shouted ldquogo, both Sir John and Sir Harry raced as fast as they could, each being desperate to be first across the finish line. Their riding skills were well challenged by this race.Who won does not matter in this story. What matters are the two words that were said by the child. They were the answer to the riddle rule, and so made the race possible.What were those two words If you havenrsquot already worked it out then re-read the story carefully. If you still donrsquot know, and want to know the answer, then I will give it next week.Or perhaps you could ask a child. I know some children from P in St Gabrielrsquos Primary School who know the answer to this."},{"url":null,"title":"plan-to-turn-prestonpans-town-hall-into-a-digital-paradise","story":"Prestonpans Community Council is bidding to take control of the High Street venue and turn it into an audio-visual and digital haven.A sub-committee of the community council that was formed when the option for a Community Asset Transferof the Town Hall to the group was first offered has come up with a lsquodigital destinationrsquo concept ndash and garnered positive feedback from the community council.The community council is the only group to have put in a note of interest for the Town Hall, and the sub-committee ndash featuring DJ Johnston Smith, Calum Miller and Professor Roger Bromley ndash has now made public its vision for the building.Their initial idea is to create an audio-visual centre within the Town Hall for gamers and competitions, as well as running educational classes on technology and creating a ldquodigital destination for all with k audio-visual displays, fibreoptic network, high-speed computers, floor space and a cafe.In the subcommittee strategy, the members state: ldquoThe activities which once occupied our Town Hall are not filling it today we need to think creatively to identy new audiences.ldquoAll of the traditional activities can now be accommodated where in our town.ldquoOur Town Hall needs to offer something unique to the community: our challenge is to use our assets to create richer social interactions for all.ldquoWe live in a world where the social networks that helped us advance are increasingly replaced by the digital iety. We are all engaging more online, but the conversations are getting shorter and colder.ldquoThese conversations would be more positive and productivewe could host them in a social context.ldquoWhatrsquos needed is a lsquoFaceFaceBookrsquo where the digital world is used to increase the physical interaction.They have suggested that a large screen cover the back of the building behind the stage that could act as a cinema screen, a digital backdrop to a theatre show and a space for presentations and gaming competitions.Although it is only in the very early stages of planning, the concept was well received by the community council, with member Ferhan Ashiq saying that he was ldquovery impressed with the bold and innovative idea.The community council has the option to either lease or buy the Town Hall from East Lothian Council, and this decision has not been officially made yet but will be the next step that is taken, discussing a business plan and the terms of the transfer with the local authority.The approach is laid out in the strategy, which states that the community council will ldquoreview the best practice from where and arrange research visits to similar facilities.

The one marked ldquoUnited Kingdom had been placed at the bottom of the pile. The new premier frowned, pulled it out and placed it right at the top.In the last few days, Mrs May has had to endure the sight of the two contenders rubbishing her approach to Brexit and dancing on the grave of her failed attempt to get Brexit through even though both of them backed her Withdrawal Agreement in the final Commons vote.Her speech on Thursday will be scanned for any nuance that can be interpreted as a put-down to one candidate or an endorsement of the other in other words, Boris for the former and Jeremy for the latter.No doubt, alarmed by the ldquodo or die rhetoric of Mr Johnson, Mrs Mayrsquos central message about strengthening the Union will be directed at her former Foreign Secretary. Watch out to seethere are any references to charging at the guns and the Valley of Death.In the last few days and, no doubt, in the next  hours before the Scottish hustings, the two would-be premiers will be busy burnishing their Unionist credentials.Just as there has been a bidding war on fiscal promises and on who can sound the hardest on a no-deal Brexit, so we can expect the two contenders to be trying to out-speak one another on who is the greater Unionist.Mr Hunt has already pronounced that he would support the Union with \"every drop of blood in my veins\". At Tuesdayrsquos Belfast hustings, when talk was of the backstop and borders, Mr Johnson declared the ldquoUnion comes first\" and was ldquoabsolutely inviolable.Both men have committed to introducing a Union Unit in No  to better co-ordinate the Unionist message across Government.With time so short before she goes, the PMrsquos attempt at legacy-building is dficultnot impossible. And yet this newspaper has been told that she will soon announce a review, possibly in her speech on Thursday in Scotland, to look at how the Government structures can be configured to strengthen the Union the very subject of her final address.The Conservative administration is due shortly to publish its response to the Commons Scottish Affairs Committee report on constitutional matters, which called for a review of the role of the Scottish Secretary and Scotland Office now that we are  years on from the start of devolution.While the Nationalists want the post and office abolished, some Unionists want them to be subsumed into a Department for the Union headed by the Deputy Prime Minister or First Secretary of State.But David Mundell has been, behind the scenes, battling to have the role enhanced. Indeed, there are suggestions the Scotland Office is going to be beefed up with a couple of new ministers as part of the underpinning of the Union.The Scottish Secretary is due to appear before the committee next week when he will doubtless expand on his vision for his office which, of course, might not include him depending on who wins the Conservative crown.Other signs of strengthening the Union are the UK Governmentrsquos new hub in Edinburgh, including a dedicated room to enable the UK Cabinet to hold some of its meetings there, and a push for more direct Whitehall funding of Scottish projects in devolved areas denounced as a ldquopower-grab by Edinburgh.One Unionist project, however, is unlikely to see the light of day: Mr Johnsonrsquos idea of building a bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland.When asked about it, he insisted he was still supportive but noted diplomatically it was something for the Northern Irish Executive to take forward. Which means another ldquoBoris bridge will never see the light of day."},{"url":null,"title":"cheque-lewis-chessman-bought-for-5-is-sold-for-more-than-700000-at-sothebys-auction","story":"A Lewis chess piece discovered by an Edinburgh family has made the move from a drawer to a windfall, selling for pound, at auction.The warder, a ldquobashed up piece with a missing left eye, has now set a record for its category in the sale.The medieval chess piece, part of the same set that was discovered in  on the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides, was bought by an antiques dealer for pound in .Now, after being sold to a private collector, it holds the record for a medieval chess piece at auction, Sotherbyrsquos in London said.The previous record for a medieval chess piece was set, also at Sothebyrsquos in London in , when a piece of a King made in Germany believed to be from  to , sold for pound,.The Lewis Chessmen are a hoard of  objects regarded as the most famous chess pieces to have survived from the medieval world.But the whereabouts of five pieces from the collection have remained a mystery.The family of that antiques dealer only learned recently that the .cm warder, made from walrus ivory in the late th or early th century, was one of the missing treasures.Having looked after it for  years without fully realising its importance, they took it to Sothebyrsquos auction house in London.They found of its importance and remain ldquoquite amazed.Alexander Kader, Sothebyrsquos co-worldwide head of European sculpture and works of art, said: ldquoThis is one of the most exciting and personal rediscoveries to have been made during my career.ldquoIt has been such a privilege to bring this piece of history to auction, and it has been amazing having him on view at Sothebyrsquos over the last week ndash he has been a huge hit.ldquoWhen you hold this characterful warder in your hand or see him in the room, he has real presence.Mr Kader, who examined the piece for the family, previously said that his ldquojaw dropped when he realised what they had in their possession.ldquoThey brought it in for assessment.

Lunchtime pieces or chits as they were known, were often taken to work in a small tin. It was unwise to leave these lying around unattended.

You might remember what happened: the house went up for sale in  and it looked like the estate would be broken up. The Chippendale furniture would be sold and the house emptied, and weather, vandals and entropy would be left to do the rest.:Neil Mackay: We need to start talking about the abolition of the monarchyHowever, thatrsquos not what happened, thank God: the consortium led by the prince was successful in buying the house and, in the years since, it has spent many millions in renovating the buildings and the estate. But itrsquos the effects in the wider community that are particularly striking ndash effects Irsquove seen for myself as someone who lives nearby.Our local swimming pool was on the point of being closed for example. The Princersquos foundation renovated it and saved it. The same with our once decrepit town hall. I was there on the day it reopened and I listened to Prince Charles talk about why he got involved. Dumfries House had a special place in his affections, he told us, but he also wanted to do what he could for the people of Ayrshire.And he has. Partly, itrsquos been through some of the softer benefits Dumfries House has brought, such as a new book festival and classes for local children on food and farming. But there have been hard benefits too, such as new jobs. In fact, you may have read the testimony of some of the people whorsquove benefited in this way when The Herald featured their stories the other day.People like Graeme Bone, who took a course in one of the training centres at Dumfries House and now works on upcycling factory offcuts to make bags. ldquoItrsquos hard not to be inspired here, he said. Or Kris Muir, who used to be unemployed but is now a gardener on the estate. ldquoThis place has lted New Cumnock, he said.There are lots of other people like Mr Bone and Mr Muir in the villages around Dumfries House ndash in fact, the estate is now the second biggest employer in the county ndash and I think their stories matter because they undermine one of the traditional arguments of republicans, which is that the Royal Family costs too much. It sometimes seems like British citizens who take this viewwould apply a kind of reverse austerity to the country, stripping it of everything that glitters and leaving only the useful and the utilitarian they would reduce it all to figures that can be balanced on a spread sheet. Perhaps they could print it out and take it down the Mall in a horse and carriage and see what kind of reaction it gets.However, the truth is the Royal Family is more complicated, and wonderful, than that. I know that some royalists talk about the benefits to tourism but Irsquove never been entirely convinced by that argument ndash who can say how many visitors come because we have princesses and dukes  I would point out, instead, that the monarchy costs less than a pound per person per year, but more importantly I would point to the bag-maker Graeme Bone and the gardener Kris Muir and the thousands of others like them who live near me. Their lives have been improved by the influence of the Prince of Wales and the investment and attention he attracts.And anyway, money is never what really matters in the end is it, even with the royals  The other day, Prince William did the most extraordinary thing: he told young members of an LGBTQ group that he would be fine with any of his children being gay. It reminded me of the moment his mother put aside the prejudice of the s and shook the hand of an Aids patient without her gloves. It demonstrates, then and now, that an institution that is accused of being behind the times is often ahead of them.:Mark Smith: A new secret weapon in the fight against Scottish nationalism: the pamphlet of loveThink about this too: the Royal Family does cost a lot of money ndash in  , pound million ndash but so would the paraphernalia and pomp of its replacement: a president or head of state. And we need to think carefully about what we want to spend that kind of money on: a monarch who, in the age of populism, has an approval rating of some  per cent, or some of the alternatives Sadly, you know what they are: the Scottish nationalist in Bute House or the British nationalist whorsquos about to be in Number . Some people think those two would be value for money. I would rather spend my pound per year on something better."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-english-nationalism-demeans-our-politics","story":"English nationalism is not mentioned in Mr Smithrsquos column, but it is arguably the element which has driven Brexit and left the country in its present state of lemming-like idiocy. Is it not noticed by media commentators, because it has become so normalised and taken for granted  It does appear to be a signicant mote in Mr Smithrsquos eye and it greatly diminishes his arguments for a better style of politics.Dr Angus Macmillan, Dumfries.IT is a lovely idea that a kinder politics could flourish in Scotland rather than that which we have become accustomed to. Mark Smith points out that the remarkable victory of Ekrem Imamoglu as mayor of Istanbul was based on just such a strategy, having concluded that ldquoyou cannot fight polarising populists by being polarising.Those who have become hardened by the angry confrontation that so often accompanies exchanges over Scotlandrsquos constitutional future might think it naiumlve to imagine that we could get away from all that rancour, yet the Istanbul example shows otherwise. Turkish politics has after all suffered more than its fair share of isive and angry political struggles over the years.Personally, I believe one of the biggest turn-offs when it comes to considering future options for Scotland is the grievance-led narrative favoured by the SNP leadership. The challenge for those who value Scotlandrsquos positive place in the UK is to try to dfuse discord, and to emphasise the positives we share with family, friends, colleagues and fellow citizens across the UK. Many of the dferences that nationalists seek to exploit are short-term or exaggerated, whereas the advantages of being in the closest of possible unions have lasted over the course of many generations.Keith Howell, West Linton.RORY Stewart was right to be ldquoafraid of the word ldquolove in political discourse. All you need is love, said the Beatles, and that ended in an acid trip at Haight-Ashbury. Mark Smith seems to regard love as a political tool that might be utilised so that ldquowe might be able to take on popular movements that rely on national identity, such as Scottish nationalism. His particular brand of love does not seem to be universal. Who are ldquowe Tricky word, love. Professor William Barclay used to lecture us on prime-time telly, to the signature tune of Mendelssohnrsquos Scottish Symphony, on the dference between ldquoeros and ldquoagape . The trouble is that a lot of people who think they are in love are actually in a relationship of coercive abuse. The greatest act of love you can possibly bestow on a person about whom you are crazy, but who just isnrsquot right for you, is to let her go.Dr Hamish Maclaren, Stirling.MARK Smith comments on the positive nature of ldquolove in the political sphere. What he doesnrsquot say is the first proponent of inclusive political positivity was Alex Salmond in the  referendum, and who always referred to our big southern neighbour with complementary affection. Of course his objective was Scottish self-government and his opponent was Anglo-British nationalism, the nationalism seldom referenced in the media. The term ldquoUnionist, in the time of Brexit surely being an oxymoron, and certainly contrary to majority opinion within the Tory Party.Mr Salmond gained nothing for his positivity, being told a Scottish English border would be ldquocustom posts, barbed wire, and armed guards: contrast that with the proposed ldquoinvisible border in Ireland. Or Scotland being rebuffed on a currency union, oddly this is now cast as the ldquoSNP ditching the pound by todays British nationalists.And there is not much love coming from the Tory leadership contest. What we are told by the contestants is that Scotland will not be ldquoallowed to be independent: that while border polls in Northern Ireland are guaranteed by international treaty , that winning elections with a Scottish electorate, or gaining a majority in Scotlandrsquos parliament is not ldquoa mandate for a plebiscite.GR Weir, Ochiltree.I NOTE with wry amusement the ambitions of Jo Swinson, prospective Liberal Democrat UK Leader .Ms Swinson will have no truck with the SNP or an independence referendum she hopes for a Liberal Democrat government after Brexit. Again we read about the LibDems breaking the mould of British politics, something they have forecast every time they make a small advance. The mould of British politics was well and truly broken by the Brexit Party in this yearrsquos European election  seats, with the LibDems on . I might also point out that the Tories got four and Labour .Two things she hinted at: she is not completely against co-operation with the Tories, despite their previous alliance with that party destroying any credibility the LibDems had.

Edinburgh was full of colour and noise, and there was a real sense of hope and expectation. Donald Dewar’s speech in the parliament’s first chamber was one of those moments where the hair stood up on the back of your neck. In my view – as someone in a dferent party to Donald, with very dferent views on the ultimate destination for Scotland – that speech was one of the finest speeches in modern Scottish history.How much of a privilege is it to run the country and how dficult is the top job There’s no doubt that being First Minister of Scotland has been the privilege of my le.

And like many people in senior positions, particularly women, I have had moments of self-doubt but I believe it’s important to be open about that and to be a role model to young people. But more than anything, I am grateful to have the opportunity to help make Scotland a better place to live.What is the Parliament’s biggest achievement in the last  years  Twenty years on there are so many achievements that we can be proud of, and that have made Scotland a better place to live, work, study and grow up in. From free personal care to the abolition of tuition fees, the ban on smoking in public places, a minimum pricing for alcohol and the introduction of equal marriage. There’s a long, long list of these inidual policies that wouldn’t have happenedwe hadn’t had a Scottish Parliament.Across the world there are other countries now looking to Scotland to learn from the globally ground-breaking things we’ve done on public health, on tackling climate change, and on the work we’re doing around renewable energy.But above any inidual policy, there is a much more fundamental achievement, and that is that,  years on, the parliament has reinvigorated Scottish democracy and become an accepted, established part of Scottish le. We should all take great pride in that.What has been the most dficult challenge the Parliament has faced and you personally The sad and unexpected death in  of Donald Dewar – the man who had driven through the Scotland Act and then become the first First Minister – was no doubt a moment of great uncertainty for all MSPs in the early days of the Parliament.On a personal level, I’d have to say assuming the office of First Minister was my biggest challenge. Despite having spent  years in frontline politics, and seven as Deputy First Minister, nothing can prepare you for the moment where suddenly you are the last word, where there is no longer anyone above you to seek a second opinion on somethingyou want it – everyone is looking to you.What is your most memorable moment There have been many memorable moments. The passage of the Equal Marriage Act and the Minimum Pricing legislation are two key ones for me. I also think the referendum campaign has to be one of them. It not only saw Parliament at its best – with robust debates and intense scrutiny – but also sparked an enormous outpouring of democratic engagement across the country. Although the result didn’t go the way I wanted, the legacy of a more politically involved country is one we should all cherish.I have a lot of memorable moments. It’s not the famous names or the big events, but the stories I hear from iniduals around the country that inspire me. I’ve spent a lot of time lately listening to the le experiences of Scotland’s care experienced young people. Their stories will stay with me forever and drive me to improve their lives and opportunities.In  years’ time, how do you hope the Parliament will have evolved It should evolve in line with the way people in Scotland want it to. The Parliament was established in large part because of the democratic deficit that opened up during  years of a Tory government which became more and more unpopular in Scotland. Despite devolution, Brexit in particular has demonstrated that Westminster is willing to ignore the views of people in Scotland and disregard votes of the Parliament. I have absolutely no doubt that by  we will have completed the powers of the Parliament and become an independent country. That means we will have established a genuine partnership of equals with the rest of the UK and will have ensured that people in Scotland always get the governments they vote for.Are there any people you would like to thank We should never ever forget those who campaigned for decades to see a Scottish Parliament – many of whom never lived to see it become a reality.Then there are those who have worked tirelessly behind the scenes. We couldn’t do our job without the work of the parliament staff, led by the Parliament’s chief executive, Sir Paul Grice, who recently announced he was moving on to a new job after  years. He might not be well-known by the wider public but, as someone who was there from the very beginning, all MSPs and staff owe him an enormous debt of gratitude.For me personally, I certainly would not be where I am today without the support of my mum and dad and my husband Peter.Everyone is invited to join the partySaturday, June ,  is gearing up to be a great day.From am to noon, the Queen will address Parliament and each of the party leaders will speak in response. The audience will include those young people who were born in  as well as finalists from a competition for student film-makers who produced a short film on the impact the Scottish Parliament has had in their area. There will also be a number of performances celebrating the best of Scotland’s culture and music and the Makar will perform a new piece of work.In the afternoon, the Parliament will open its doors for a day of celebration – a party everyone is invited to join from pm to pm.There will be a chance to sit in the Presiding Officer’s seat and see how it feels to take charge, as well as retro games like giant Jenga, Kerplunk and space hoppers. There will also be live music, dancers, face painting and caricaturists.And of course, there will be birthday cake and food too. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: “It will be a great day, full of colour and energy. Parliament always does these events well and brings in so many people from across Scotland. “I hope we spend the day not just looking back on what has been achieved, but focused on the work the parliament still has to do.“The public are often sceptical of politicians, but I hope people across the country will reflect on how far we’ve come with the parliament and the dference it has already made to so many people’s lives.”"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon the scottish parliament s greatest achievements","story":"The Scottish Parliament will celebrate its th anniversary today .Her Majesty the Queen will take part in the th anniversary celebrations today, with the iconic Parliament building in Edinburgh being open from pm to pm for visitors to join in the birthday celebrations.And in an exclusive QA, Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told us what she believes the Parliament’s top  greatest achievements are.The country’s top politician also shared her thoughts on Brexit and the future, sounding a note of caution for the UK’s next Prime Minister.Here, in her own words, Nicola walks us through the Parliament’s success story...Right from its earliest years, the Scottish Parliament showed that it was ready to take policy decisions substantially dferent to those at Westminster to help build a better country.A clear early example of this was the introduction of free personal care for the elderly. This was a substantial commitment but was vital for Scotland’s long term interests, preparing ourselves for the challenges of an ageing population. We’ve recently extended free personal care to cover all those who are assessed as needing it, no matter their age.MSPs also charted a dferent course when, following a change of administration in , parliament voted to scrap tuition fees in Scotland, restoring Scotland’s long and proud tradition of free education.Similarly, the decision to abolish prescription charges brought to an end what was little more than a tax on ill health. The NHS of course is the greatest, and most valued, example of a universal service where care is provided on the basis of need and not ability to pay. Our health service, like others across the world, faces challenges. But it is a real achievement of the Scottish Parliament that we have resisted the marketization moves south of the border while ensuring that under the current government Scotland’s AE departments are the best performing in theUK.On other occasions, the Parliament has led the UK in making bold policy choices, such as the ban on smoking in public places. Our Climate Change Act includedthe most ambitious emissions reduction targets of any legislature in the world and, as Health Secretary, I was heavily involved in the campaign to introduce a minimum unit price for alcohol, which we knew would play a key role in tackling Scotland’s unhealthy relationship with drink – another world leading measure.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.glasgowsouthandeastwoodextra webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"As the Scottish Parliament prepares to celebrate its th anniversary, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on both its journey and her own.\"  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on  years of the Scottish Parliament viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"GLAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"GLAS | Article Teaser\"It took a decade of hard work to make this policy a reality and I am personally very proud of the campaign, working with stakeholders, to persuade MSPs to back minimum pricing, as well as overcoming a legal challenge that went all the way to the Supreme Court.I am personally committed to making sure every child and young person in Scotland gets the best possible start in le. We have already delivered an increase in free, high quality childcare for all three and four year olds and extending entitlement to eligible two year olds and will increase it further before the end of this parliament.Scotland has also become a much safer society under devolution. Recorded crime has fallen to some of the lowest levels seen since the s. In particular, non-sexual violent crime has fallen substantially, thanks in no small part to the excellent work of the Violence Reduction Unit, which was established over a decade ago with cross-party support and is now being copied across the UK.In recent years, new powers have come to the Scottish Parliament and with those powers come increased responsibilities for MSPs to deliver for the people ofScotland.Income tax policy is now a key feature of the annual Scottish budget. We’ve used these new powers to introduce a fairer income tax policy, with most people paying less tax than they would south of the border – while continuing to raise revenue to support investment in the economy and public services.Last year Parliament passed the wide-ranging Social Security Act, paving the way for devolution of a number of benefits, as well as creating a number of newbenefits such as increased carers’ support allowance and best start grants for families with young children – and a new social security agency to deliver them. This new agency has a culture of dignity and respect at its heart and early feedback from service users has been overwhelmingly positive.I also appointed the first gender balanced Scottish cabinet and we are encouraging more women to stand for parliament, and bring a better balance to ourpublic le.Over the course of the Scottish Parliament consistent action has been taken to ensure communities have the opportunity to own the land they live and work on.Many communities have benefited from the right to buy that now covers rural and urban communities.Of course, the foundation of our country is a strong and resilient economy. That’s why we have slashed or abolished business rates for , premises –saving almost £. billion for our small businesses.We have invested in our infrastructure with all governments building new schools and hospitals and, of course, the iconic Queensferry Crossing.And, to help make sure we have the workforce we need for years to come, we have delivered just over a quarter of a million Modern Apprenticeships in the lastdecade.In April this year, new legislation to tackle controlling and coercive behaviour came into effect, giving Scotland some of the most robust domesticabuse legislation in the world.I’m also proud of the many steps we’ve taken to make Scotland a fairer society, including the introduction of equal marriage rights – attending one of the first same-sex weddings in Scotland is a memory that will stay with me for a long time.And we all worked together over many years to help Glasgow successfully host the  Commonwealth Games. This helped to inspire Scots to get more active,delivered new facilities and put Scotland on the world stage. It was a sight to behold.My final achievement is perhaps harder to quanty. There is no doubt that the re-establishment of Scotland’s parliament has profoundly changed our political culture for the better, with our nation’s lawmakers much more accessible to those they represent. It has also enabled us to have conversations we wouldn’t have had and to debate our own future, with the  independence referendum generating an increase in democratic engagement.Looking ahead, we now face the signicant challenges posed by Brexit which, of course, Scotland’s people and parliament overwhelmingly oppose. Given the long-term damage that Brexit will cause to Scotland, and the material change in circumstances this represents, I believe it is only fair that people are given the choice of whether to become an independent country. Indeed, the current SNP Government was elected on a clear manesto commitment that people should be offered that choice should Scotland be taken out of the EU against its will. Polls consistently show that people living here believe the decision on whether to hold a referendum should be a matter for Holyrood and not Westminster. Twenty years after it came into being, that is an important measure of the way people in Scotland view the Parliament and one that the new UK Prime Minister would do well to heed."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July ,  at : pmAn innovative partnership between NHS Orkney and Girlguiding Orkney, aimed at raising awareness of antibiotic resistance, has picked up a national award.

While the package of measures announced by SNH today is welcome, it is also clear that it is going to take time to achieve the objective of bringing greylag goose numbers down to a sustainable level.“That is why it is so important that the Scottish Government now stays the course.

One of the new measures is a study looking at how the birds# numbers could be brought down to .SNH have committed to supporting egg oiling and corralling activities, with an expert in corralling geese to visit the county to advise farmers on how this could be used and training for egg oiling being made available.Contractors will also be funded to carry out egg oiling at specic areas next season.As mentioned, a study will also be carried out to create an Orkney-wide plan to reduce geese numbers. According to SNH, this study will consider the practicalities, cost and location for a number of possible measures bring the birds# population down.SNH also elaborated on a previous announcement of an expansion to the licence to shoot the birds, with a new Orkney-specic licence to cover the period from February  to June  — outside the open shooting season and the time covered by the General Licence, which allows Greylag geese to be shot from July  to August  and during the open season from September  to January .This means farmers will no longer be required to apply to the SNH Licensing team for an out-of-season licence but can make a quick call to the Kirkwall office for permission.The new measures include volunteer shooters being available again this year in August and September to undertake goose control on farms which are experiencing issues with geese.SNH is considering further changes to licences, in particular, a mechanism to increase bag limits, and a possible extension to the General Licence, currently available in July and August, to include May and June.Finally, volunteer shooters will be available again this year in August and September to undertake goose control on farms which are experiencing issues with geese.Graham Neville, SNH’s Northern Isles and North Highland area manager, said: “We understand increases in greylag goose numbers have seriously impacted on farmers and crofters on Orkney. Working closely with the local goose management group, we have committed to measures that will help protect crops, while still maintaining the balance between conservation, farming and hunting.”News of support for these measures also followed an announcement earlier in the week that the sale of goose meat and funding have been extended in Orkney and the Western Isles, until the end of .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Service providers are notied of the visit request and receive an overview of the users condition and top tips to aid their interaction with the customer.Gavin Neate, founder and chief executive of Neatebox, said: “Our app helps disabled people to receive a better service, communicate with ease and travel with confidence. Even staff at companies with excellent customer service, like NorthLink, can struggle sometimes to know how best to support customers.We’re delighted that they have seen how the product can help both passengers and staff, and hope that other operators will follow suit.”Seumas Campbell, Serco’s customer service director at NorthLink Ferries, said: “We use the Welcome app to make staff aware of the specic needs of their visitors in advance of their arrival. We can greet customers by name and offer them the assistance they may require. This greatly improves the confidence and interactions between customer service teams and passengers helping to build lasting relationships.”The move is the latest in a series of measures aimed at improving journeys for all travellers.Earlier this year NorthLink implemented its new ‘Recite Me’ accessibility tool to the website to enable more people to experience the NorthLink Ferries website in a way suitable to their needs.NorthLink staff have also attended disability awareness training with Access Panel Orkney and in , NorthLink teamed up with a sign language interpreting agency to improve access and user experience for its customers with hearing dficulties.For more information Neatebox visit www.neateboxcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The concern is that, although resurfacing and general maintenance continues to be done, this may not fix the issue in the long-term.OIC has now engaged a specialist team to look at the issue, who#ll be deploying state of the art equipment to take radar readings through the causeway down to sea level, providing valuable information on its deep make-up.This data will then be used to come up with options for short and long-term maintenance of the road, with general inspections and periodic minor repairs continuing until the results of the survey are fully considered.Due to the nature of the work, there will unfortunately be road closures and a convoy system in place on the evening of Monday  July. The work has been scheduled for between .pm and .pm to minimise disruption, by ensuring that traffic from the last Pentland Ferries arrival has passed through. Delays of up to  minutes are possible.The work will begin with coring taking place, which sees four small cylindrical sections of the road removed, analysed and then replaced. This allows the contractors to identy the make-up of the top layers of the road and calibrate their equipment accordingly.The second stage of the work sees a specialist vehicle driven at usual traffic speed across the barrier a number of times, taking video and radar footage as it moves.The third and final stage sees a piece of hand-pushed equipment moved across the barrier at walking speed taking Ground Penetrating Radardata of the full depth of the structure as it goes. The GPR system emits short duration pulses of electromagnetic energy. These pulses or scans are transmitted into the road and reflections from material boundaries or embedded featuresare detected by a receiver. Through analysis of the reflected signals a continuous D model of the Barrier can then be provided, determining material thickness and construction changes.  This should therefore determine what,any, underlying defects there are within the matrix of the causeway. The survey allows data to be taken down to depths of five metres.The video survey will provide a high resolution and spatially referenced video to enable the visual condition of the surface to be assessed to sub-metre accuracy. This will be matched with the GPR survey to produce a visual model to pinpoint anomalies in the surfacing.John Wrigley, OIC roads and environmental services manager said: #As a key element of Orkney#s travel network, we keep a keen eye on the state of this road.#Our ongoing monitoring has shown that the surface continues to deteriorate despite previous interventions — which would suggest that resurfacing is not going to fix the problem in the long-term.#We now need to carry out this important piece of work to seethere could be a more deep-rooted reason for the issues — which should lead us to an appropriate and cost-effective solution.##Previous survey work has given us detailed information on the top layers of the road, but this new survey will look deep into the construction for voids or other potential failures.  We apologise for the delays that this survey will cause on the night of  July # but we#re sure that local road users will understand that this is necessary as part of finding a long term solution to improving the structure of the road.  We#d ask that road users take their time in the vicinity on the night and would also take the opportunity to remind people of the mph advisory speed limit that already exists on the first Barrier.#East Mainland, South Ronaldsay and Burray councillor, Andrew Drever added: “I accept the concerns that have been raised over a period of time, particularly by motorcyclists, and I am pleased to see this piece of work getting underway.#Once we have the survey results, we’ll be able to look at options and hopefully find a way forward in a short a timescale as possible.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We’ve declared a climate emergency! However, it doesn’t really feel like an emergency yet. It feels more like waiting in an emergency room which is slowly filling up with impatient in-patients.All that’s happened so far is the Scottish Government has scrapped their proposed cuts on the air departure tax. An important move, as, given limited technological options, we need to curtail increasing aviation demand. Some people are afraid of flying. I think we need to make more people afraid of flying. Perhaps glass floors or actual snakes on a plane  A first step amongst many on the path to consistent decision-making across the economy. But we now need to even the playing field by taxing aviation properly compared to other forms of travel.The Committee on Climate Change’s advice is to make the UK emissions reduction target net-zero by  and that Scotland should do it even faster, by . In typical Scottish fashion, what will spur us on is proving we can do something better than the English. The race is on. You may take our condensing boilers but you’ll never take our freedom !It may very well be rivalry that spurs us on to greatness. Like Andy Murray in the tennis, it is the achievements of those around him that made him work harder to reach the top. Glasgow and Edinburgh are now in direct competition to become the UK’s first net-zero city. Having lived in both cities, I am looking forward to a wind turbine on the top of the Duke of Wellington’s cone and tourists’ footsteps on the Royal Mile powering local homes. If we could harness the unleashed rivalry of Scottish sports fans and turn that into something positive, like ‘nine in a row’ for largest emissions reductions, then we’d sort the problem in absolutely no time. We always want to feel we’re better than our neighbours so get out there, start telling Susan next door about how little you drive and watch her sell that Volvo and become an eco-warrior.: The proof that the private sector cannot secure just transition to green economy – Richard Leonard: Scotland fails to hit climate change targets for past two years in a rowWe have done well so far, especially on decarbonising the power sector, as Scotland’s actual emissions are now half what they were in , back when coal reigned supreme and wind power was virtually non-existent. That is the easy stuff. Heating is next and I don’t knowyou’ve noticed but we are a Baltic nation, so we use an awful lot of it. I think  per cent is my gran. However, there has been very little progress in emissions reductions in transport, agriculture, forestry and land-use sectors, although some plans are now in place.We need to drive electric cars but also have more car-sharing options and to drive less. Changes in road transport will also have extra benefits, mostly health related. Firstly, it will reduce air pollution which hopefully means the only filter kids will need on their face is on Snapchat. Parents often choose quieter routes to walk with their children, away from traffic, as this can cut pollution exposure by almost two-thirds. We’re so afraid of inconveniencing drivers that the people being poisoned are the ones having to change their behaviour. If we continue with that logic we’ll soon just be telling children to stop breathing.Secondly, there’s the benefits of walking and cycling more. Run to the gym to cancel your membership. Then there is changing our diets. To cut emissions I have changed my milk. I now only drink oat milk, which is especially weird when I have it in my porridge. Oat on oat action. I feel like the most Scottish man in the world. I want my oats ground into liquid and poured over more oats. I’ve also gone from eating meat in most meals to only a couple times a week, which has been hard as I like a burger as much as the next Five Guys.In Scotland, it is quite clear that the view on the role of the oil and gas industry has changed since the independence referendum in . This industry which has given us all so much will, whether as part of the UK or not, need to be mostly dismantled over the coming decades. Here, with the current expertise, we have the opportunity to become a world leader in carbon capture and storage that will be required for hard to decarbonise sectors in industry. But it requires signicant policy support to come to fruition.It has been quite the year for climate change in Scotland. School strikes, dire climate reports, wildfires, protesters gluing themselves to buildings, and the warmest February on record. And now a climate emergency. It feels like a turning point. I started my PhD on this very topic about  years ago. Back then we were the first nation to introduce legislation on limiting our contribution to climate change. We paved the way and other countries followed suit. We now have  years to reduce global emissions by  per cent in order to stay below .C increase. It’s time for us to show the way once again and finish the job. Show them how it’s done.However, we cannot underestimate the scale of the challenge required. Achieving this is going to require everybody throwing everything at the wall. This will not be easy. Almost every aspect of society will see signicant adjustments. How you get to work, where you work, how and where you take holidays, what you eat for breakfast, lunch and dinner, what you buy, and how your home is heated. People often say we could do with a war, well here it is, it’s against our carbon-intensive society. Treat it like an emergency and do your part in your personal, professional and political lives.Matt Winning is a comedian and podcaster of Operation Earth, who works by day as an environmental economist at the UCL Institute for Sustainable Resources.

This industry produces more green house gases than the all of transportation. In fact, it is several times greater than transportation. The catch  scenario is this industry has had no regulation or legislation is regard to reducing greenhouse gases, infact, due to population growth, the pollution created by agriculture is vastly on the increase. Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well. It is a dilemma which will become more relevant as the population increases.I can assure you these bairns weren#t pushed into anything. They were toldthey wanted to go they had to complete a form.

The courage comes from not following the crowd herd and forming an independent and educated view. Jumping headlong onto the bandwagon is easy, understanding the science and striving to do something about it the hard bit. Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid.Especially a meaningless strike from school, what child would not love a day off among mates  No doubt the pig ignorant and stupid will be so impressed.

Learners on this path can also become alert to common logical fallacies. Even those who like Ian, with a preference for physical sciences, can benefit. Happily don’t need to be much of a scholar to spot an ad hominem attack. With all due respect for Ian’s past achievements in the physical sciences, it would be nicehe could make his points without belittling others #kids included. That’s a normal standard “of decency and tolerance” btw.I so agree with these word #gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included!#. You do so hold yourself in such regard high Peter, now go glue yourself to a train or bus to prove your point!But just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of- #Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better!# It went on for five minutes without stopping. And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse ”.And what are you doing Ian to save the planet And what would you suggest the AHS and the SIC do Ad Hominem attacks # playing the man not the ball # are often used by those who don’t have much of an argument to begin with. Instead of dealing with whether the young people have a point or not, generous-spirited Ian opted to have a go instead.Logical fallacies show lazy thinking, masking an absence of creativity and independent thought. Ian’s trollswipe above looks Ad Hominem in approach st first, but he is also using the Tu Quoque Fallacy. This is where you accuse the opponent of hypocrisy to avoid answering their charge. Self-effacing Ian thus avoids addressing the possibility of his own hubris or lack of self-knowledge.Should I have made things easier for him and asked what his actual beef with the climate protestors was  He says “Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid”and demands that everyone should be able to answer “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ” before taking a view. Perhaps he will educate us by answering his own question # sticking to terms that demonstrate tolerance and decency of course. Nuclear Free Council, Declair Climate emergency,climate justice what a load of utter bunkum. Especially stop allowing political activists to exploit our children.I put forward the question : Is nuclear power the only solution to stop greenhouse gas emissions and the only way to stop climate change progressing further  It may be the worse case scenario in terms of our power demand solution, but what are the alternatives to our demand for energy without causing further environmental and ecological damage to the planet by in using fossil fuels or cleaner alternatives like wind or solar   It has been suggested the Sahara Desert could be used for solar energy to power Europe, but how much land would be required and could this be expanded  The alternatives to fossil fuels may be cleaner, but how would this affect global weather patterns or the depletion of species due to the destruction of natural habitats being replaced for energy production Very sadly the SG SNP has committed to wind energy with its catastrophic environmental damage and only intermittent supply, but that is the policy of the scientically ignorant and utterly stupid..."},{"url":null,"title":"relief cleaner at shetland cleaner services ","story":"Relief CleanerTo cover holidays and sickness periods for regular staff in the mornings from .am to .am.To apply and for further details Tel Bigton   office hours Mon to Fri, or email your name, address and phone number to: babs.shetlandcleaning@hotmail or robbie@shetlandcleaning.plus"},{"url":null,"title":"various properties at hjaltland housing ","story":"We have a one bedroom, two person, first floor flat available to rent.

Like many people in our society, it has been irrevocably marked by our recent conflict, during which he suffered several personal tragedies, including the death of his eldest sibling, Patsy Quinn – a -year-old IRA volunteer who was killed in action in .Around two years after his brother’s death, Frankie managed to join the IRA, aged , by lying about his age. Many of his subsequent years were spent between being on the run and terms of imprisonment in Portlaoise Gaol, Mountjoy Gaol, Crumlin Road Gaol and the barbarity of Long Kesh. It is these stark experiences, as well as the beautully normal experiences of love, nature, and joy that shape his incredible new book of poetry, ‘Open Gates’.“I found that poetry was a way of expressing some grief,” Frankie said.“It’s a way for me to write down some of my feelings. It was a bit of escapism as well because you can be anonymous in a poem too.“A lot of my poetry would consist of things I was going through personally and things I have watched other people go through. There is a lot of political writing in it – I like to write about Bobby Sands, the hunger strikers, about imprisonment and Irish freedom. There is also a lot of romantic stuff, and some nature poetry.”Despite his current poetic talents, Frankie had little academic success at school, and was barely able to read or write in early adulthood. It was during his time in Portlaoise Prison in the s that he began reading again and studying for his O-Levels. Later while in Long Kesh, he began studying at the Open University and began studying poetry with visiting poetry lecturer, Medbh McGuckian.“Medhb was an influence who came into the jail’s education system and taught some of us and helped some of us create better poems and structure them properly,” Frankie explained.“I had very little education in school. I actually went to school in Belfast, St. Anne’s in Finaghy and then I was a first year in De La Salle, and then we were burnt out of our home in Finaghy. When we were put out by loyalists mobs we went back to Tyrone where my family were from. You’ll find some of that in my writing too.”During his time in prison he read a lot of poems and writings of fellow Irish writers. Some would have a profound impact on him, while others, where deemed modern greats, elicited his criticism.“I’ve read Pearse, and even Yeats, who lived through part of our conflict but never wrote anything about it,” he said.“I see something similar in Seamus Heaney’s poems, which I’ve read a lot of. I haven’t seen a poem about Francie Hughes, who was his next-door neighbour. I think Danny Morrison confronted him about that on a train and I think Heaney said ‘ I was ever going to write about him, I won’t do it now’. People like Danny, and Tim Brannigan and all of those people with a disposition for writing encouraged me a bit. Turlough Connolly would be another person, who was educated in Oxford – he was a very intelligent man who was inside with us as well. Pat Sheehan is another one who would have encouraged our writing.”From his first personal poetry collections – pages glued to the glossy covers of old Open University covers bearing the Long Kesh stamp – to his new book of poems, Frankie’s personal and literary journey is a fascinating one. His works have seen him give talks in and Paris, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dublin, and Cork, with further success undoubtedly on the horizon. However, for Frankie his poetry is all about further understanding, creativity and emotional expression.“Poetry, from a revolutionary perspective, is very important as well. It has an awful lot to add to people’s understanding and struggle. Each poem that is written has a certain message, hidden or otherwise, about certain events. It’s good for people to be able to draw them out. One of my poems is called ‘Hunger’ where I talk about the crystallising of sands, but it’s actually about Bobby Sands and the Palestinian hunger strikers – it’s a play on words. It links the whole lot together and gives a political perspective.”He continued: “It doesn’t matter to meI don’t make a penny out my poetry – it’s all about understanding. There’s a lot of deep emotional stuff there about mental struggle from when I was in solitary confinement. I was in solitary confinement for around four years.“There is certain post traumatic stress that I would deal with, and there is a lot of people in West Belfast and others places here that would have that and they don’t even know it. I like people like that to sit down and be able to read something that they can grasp.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"ardoyne dancers top of the world","story":"AN Ardoyne-based Irish dancing school are celebrating after their success at the An Chomhdhail World Championships in Killarney.Lawrenson-Toal Academy of Irish Dance brought home a world champion to North Belfast with Caragh Hendron scooping first place in the under- category.

What we are trying to avoid here is a no-deal Brexit which I think would be a very considerable burden for businesses in Northern Ireland and across the two islands.“That’s what we are trying to avoid and that is what the report does in trying to set up a dferent way of solving the problem and issue of the Irish border.”Panel chairman Shanker Singham highlighted that one of the proposals was the establishment of a Government fund to help financially support businesses who had to increase their administrative capabilities.He said the arrangements could also be implemented with the use of existing technology.“Media often says it’s all about technology – it’s not all about technology,” said Mr Singham.“Technology is not the driver for the solution, but it’s equally absurd to say technology plays no role at all.“Technology has a component – it supports the technical and administrative processes we are talking about.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dup and sinn fein clash over lack of progress in stormont talks","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

No formal or transparent selection process was used in her selection for appointment nor was she given a written contract of employment, statement of main terms and conditions or job description.During , following several years of signicant growth, the firm decided to consider promotions from associate solicitor grade to salaried partner. Mrs Mercer and two other colleagues were promoted to salaried partner later that year.However, the following year, when she applied for promotion to the role of an equity partner, she was told she did not meet the eligibility criteria. Mrs Mercer did not find out about the promotions of her comparators at the time they took effect on June , , because they had not been announced internally. Instead she learned about them around  through what she described as the \"office rumour mill\". When she enquired about applying for promotion to the next stage, she was informed that there would be no more movement in the firm for the foreseeable future.Mrs Mercer flagged ious issues about her pay during  and  and the fact that promotions were taking place without any formal or transparent selection process.In June  she informed one of firms partners that she wanted to be paid the same salary as her male comparators and to have her bonus calculated on the same terms as theirs. Mrs Mercer was later told that the firm had decided to defer the issue of her salary and bonus until the end of the financial year as part of a wider review of business and salaries. Following this she lodged an internal grievance, seeking equal pay with her comparators on the ground that she was performing like work with them. Her grievance was rejected as the firm was of the view that her work as a salaried partner was \"not as demanding as that of a salaried partner benefiting from a profit share arrangement\". The legal practice accepted that Mrs Mercer was receiving less remuneration than her male colleagues but did not accept that she was undertaking like work with them. It contended that, although she and her male counterparts were all qualied solicitors, there were signicant dferences in the work they and Mrs Mercer were undertaking both in respect of legal work and other responsibilities.In addition, the respondent contended that,Mrs Mercer proved that she was undertaking like work with her comparators, there were genuine material factors which were not the dference of sex and which explained and justied any dferences in pay.The tribunal found that Mrs Mercer was employed on like work with all her comparators going back six years to June .The firm was ordered to pay her £, in respect of the dference between her gross annual salary of £, and the modied amount of £, going forward. She will also receive £, arrears of annual salary falling six years before the date of her claim in June  along with interest of £, on arrears."},{"url":null,"title":"getting to the open all you need to know","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The leaders of EU institutions are supposed to impartially represent the interests of all member nations globally and in Brussels.Some leaders discussed the roster of upcoming vacancies, which also include the EU’s top diplomat, the president of the European Parliament and the chief of the European Central Bank , on the sidelines of the Group of  summit in Japan that concluded on Saturday.Mr Tusk wants nominations to be wrapped up soon, seeking to prevent further erosion of public confidence in the EU amid Brexit uncertainty and intra-bloc isions over managing migration.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  European Council president Donald Tusk, left, with Renew Europe party member Guy Verhofstadt There was hope at the previous summit on June - that more time would clary who should replace Mr Juncker.

The parliament must endorse that choice. But the assembly has insisted that only the lead candidates from parties that ran in last month’s elections should be eligible for the post.“The lead candidates is not the only criteria,” said Mr Conte.The commission proposes and enforces EU laws on policies ranging from the massive single market to agriculture spending, and from competition issues to immigration.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker The job responsibilities are huge: Mr Tusk and Mr Juncker negotiate with the likes of US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, while the head of the ECB can set monetary policy for the  nations that use the shared euro currency.The outgoing group of EU officials was lopsidedly Italian, with Antonio Tajani holding the parliament top post, Mario Draghi head of the ECB and Federica Mogherini the EU foreign policy chief.Top candidates include current prime ministers Stefan Lofven of Sweden and Andrej Plenkovic of Croatia.

Ireland to support the rights of workers to holiday back-pay.Northern Ireland could face a massive public sector back-pay bill after a tribunal finding that police officers and civilian staff are owed holiday pay dating back twenty years.Trade unions have argued that all workers should be included, from both the public and private sectors.There are about , public sector employees in Northern Ireland, official figures show.The public sector bill would be a huge challenge to Stormonts budgets, especially given the payments that will need to be made to RHI claimants.The British government rushed through a two-year limit on miscalculated claims but no such cap was put in place in Northern Ireland which means the costs could be astronomical.Niall McCarroll, Chairperson of Derry Trades Union Council said DTUC will be at the forefront of the biggest working-class action in a generation, demanding that any worker who has had their rightfully earned money withheld, ed immediately.This is in line with the recent Appeal Court hearing, which ruled that workers were owed money as their holiday pay had been based on basic working hours, not the actual hours worked including overtime, which in effect breached European law.The court ruled that miscalculations arose because holiday pay had been based on basic working hours, not the actual hours worked, including overtime.Mr McCarroll said: “Since the Appeal Court ruling all we have heard is how much this will cost the tax payer, impacting on our ability toand indeed provide much needed already stretched public services, whilst protecting budgetary integrity.“There has been no reference to the integrity of workers who have been forced to use foodbanks, went into mortgage arrears, struggling to survive during austerity driven pay cuts, austerity, which seems to have benefitted the already wealthy whilst attacking working class communities.”Poverty payThe trade unionist questioned whether workers might have been spared such hardshipthey were given the correct holiday pay.“This shortfall in take home pay could be as much as £ a month, which is a signicant amount for any worker, especially workers within the Derry and Strabane area, who are already in receipt of poverty pay and terms and conditions which deny them a just and favourable standard of living.“For many workers this shortfall could have been the dference between being able to heat their homes and feed their families.”He added: “Of course, so called business leaders and employers have known about this additional holiday pay entitlement for some time which most chose to ignore, and indeed when challenged by the trade union movement they refused to value their employees and pay out.“The establishment in all its parts has once again been exposed in their continuous cycle of treating working class people and their families as being non-entities within society.“All elected representatives and political parties should come out now, publicly and unequivocally showing solidarity and making it clear that they support workers and their families, in their demand for equality and justice, calling for this Appeal Court ruling to be implemente“The full power and influence of the trade union movement will meet head-on any attempts to challenge this ruling and deny workers their rightful entitlement.”Political responseIn statements to the Derry News, NI’s five main political parties have gone on record as saying they believe workers should receive payments they are legally entitled to.The DUP is however mindful of implications for the public purse and Sinn Féin believes payments should be paid over a timescale which “protects the viability of public services and businesses.\"Ulster Unionist Finance Spokesperson, Steve Aiken MLA, said “urgent clarity is needed” but like other parties was concerned about “budgetary implications” for the Northern Ireland Civil Service and its associated public bodies. He also expressed disquiet about the impact on countless business owners.Stephen Farry of Alliance, who was employment and learning minister in , stands over his decision not to introduce a cap to protect taxpayers from backdated pay claims.He insisted he acted honourably and with integrity and believed that imposing the cap would have been \"counter-productive\" as it could have caused an \"articial clf-edge\", leading to a spike of claims before the cap could take effect.And SDLP policing spokesperson Dolores Kelly said when the issue was first identied, action should have been taken to provide certainty, compensate workers for the errors and to insulate budgets from a signicant hitit would impact the delivery of public services.She also pointed the finger at Mr Farry: “It is a matter of profound regret that the Minister of the time failed to raise the issue at the Executive or introduce measures to limit public sector exposure in conjunction with other parties, Trade Unions and workers.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPhoto: Chairman of Derry Trades Union Council, Niall McCarroll."},{"url":null,"title":"one derrys esteemed citizens honoured plaque","story":"A plaque will be unveiled this weekend in honour of a Derry trade unionist who was described as “one of the most respected labour leaders” in Ireland.On Saturday th June , the Derry Trades Union Councilintends to honour former Alderman and Trade Unionist Campaigner James McCarron by erecting a plaque at his former family home in Derry followed by a talk and celebration of his le with fellow trade unionists and family members.James McCarron, a trade union leader and an Alderman on Derry Corporation, was one of  people who perished when the RMS Leinster was torpedoed and sunk by a German U-boat in .RMS Leinster was an Irish ship operated by the City of Dublin Steam Packet Company.

OrsquoHare and Diarmuid OrsquoConnor exchanged points before Keegan and Ciaran Treacy finished the job in added time.Mayorsquos five-point winning margin was a bit flattering and the final result would have been so much more dferent had Down taken all their chances.Downrsquos season is now over, but Tally has laid the foundations for better things to come.Saturdayrsquos defeat may well have been the last game in a Down shirt for a few of the sidersquos older players as there is a plethora of young players just waiting to get their chance and Tally seems to be the man to give them that opportunity.Down: R Burns, D OrsquoHagan, B McArdle, G Collins, R McAleenan, K Kernan, D Guinness, J Flynn, C Poland, C Francis, C Mooney , P Laverty, P Havern , D OrsquoHare , C Harrison .

Only a couple of people said the opposite, that they had been impressed by neither man.For Boris Johnson: Tory member Angela DickinsonA small number of people on both sides of the campaign, who had either said that they were supporters of Boris Johnson or Jeremy Hunt, then said that despite that preference the other candidate had performed better yesterday.“I thought Hunt was best but I am voting Boris,” said one man.“I am a Hunt supporter but Boris spoke very well,” said another.‘A monster has been taken off the streets,’ say family of Laurence Shaw as his killer is jailed Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"One couple, Adrian and Felicity Huston disagreed. “Boris was tired,” said Mrs Huston. “But Boris is the future,” said Mr Huston. For neithere: Tory member Angus CreeThis poll was a large proportion of people present yesterday, but a smallish sample of overall NI Tories, who are themselves only a tiny fraction of UK Tories, but even so the NI branch seems mostly pro Brexit and anti backstop, so it suggests respectable support for the moderate underdog Mr Hunt.• The Press Association also got quotes from departing delegates after the huntings, as follows:Gary Hynds, deputy chairman of the Conservative Party in Northern Ireland, said: “It’s going to be a very tough decision, they were both very impressive, and their commitment to the party in Northern Ireland was very welcome as well. “I thought the members will be very happy with that and people will be going home thinking a lot tonight and the days ahead in terms of who they will support. I think it is going to be closer than people maybe think.“Boris has been the front runner from the start, but Jeremy is performing very well and certainly closing the gap and it is going to be very interesting to see who wins.”Some were already clear in their mind about who they would vote for, including Frank Shivers of the North Down branch, who said it is “time for a “maverick”.For Jeremy Hunt: Tory member Rowan Wise“I was going in there voting for Boris and I have been voting for Boris for a while, but I thought that Jeremy came across very credible, a safe pair of hands,” he said.“But unfortunately in the times we are at, we have had a safe pair of hands with Theresa May who I thought was an excellent Prime Minister treated very badly by the EU, Westminster and parts of her own party.“So we need a maverick, we need someone with a bit of charisma, a bit of character and someone who is going to deliver for the people of the United Kingdom.”Angela Dickinson, from Larne, was also backing Mr Johnson.“I thought they were both good, Jeremy is very polished and I do like a lot about what he said. But from the point of view of actually taking us over the line and getting us out of the EU simply because we have got other things to do, I thought Boris did better,” she said.“I have known Boris for some time, I watched him as London mayor when I was in London and he was impressive there. He did things that other people basically couldn’t have done.“The best thing about Boris is his optimism, he always thinks we can achieve things and I feel that together we can do that.”However, Mark Hamilton, from North Down, was left less impressed by Mr Johnson.“I went in veering towards Boris, I thought I’d be convinced because he is well known for being a good speaker, but I went in and he was just another pretty normal speaker,” he said.“I though a lot of what he said had a lot of fluff in it, Jeremy Hunt set out a lot more clear plans in terms of the economy after Brexit - and I think he represents more the country I want to be in after Brexit.”Margaret McVeigh, from Belfast, said she was planning to vote for Mr Hunt.“I came with ideas about who I was going to vote for but I was prepared to change my mindmy mind could be changed by the two people speaking,” she said.“I think today I haven’t changed my mind, I am still going to vote for Jeremy. He was the better of the two speakers today, I think he answered the questions head on, he detailed about what he was planning to do in his four points and generally responded to questions, I thought, very very well.“I thought Boris, it was not his best effort, I lived in London for  years and he was a very entertaining speaker, in fact I campaigned for him when he was going for mayor of London.“But today he was just a bit too much bluster and blag for my liking.”Irwin Armstrong, former chair of the Conservatives in Northern Ireland, said there were striking dferences in the presentations.“We had the organised Jeremy Hunt and a much more off-the-cuff and unprepared Boris — which is probably what we would expect,” he said.Tony Cullon, from North Down, said Mr Johnson’s “dferent negotiating style” could deliver a Brexit breakthrough.“I like both candidates’ Brexit plan, both laid it out really clearly but, for me, I’ve always been a Boris fan,” he said.“I was a Boris fan going into this and I believe personally he’s going to be the one who can deliver Brexit on the st of October for the United Kingdom — compared to Jeremy Hunt, I think it will be Boris who will push it over the line.”Angus Cree, from Bangor, said he came into the event undecided.“And I have left undecided,” he said.“I don’t think either of them have a clear strategy on how they are going to get Brexit through because the EU won’t renegotiate and parliament say they won’t allow a no-deal. And I am worried that the Conservative Party has a pretty bleak future in a general election because they won’t be able to keep voters away from the Brexit Party.”Rowan Wise, chairman of the Queen’s University Conservative and Unionist Society, asked Mr Johnson about his relationship with the DUP during the event.Afterwards, he said: “I have always been a staunch supporter of the moderate wing of the Conservative Party, the One Nation Conservative brand, I think it is very important for Conservatives here in Northern Ireland to set their stall out as very dferent from the Democratic Unionist Party, especially on social issues such as abortion and gay marriage which I believe should be legislated for immediately at the national level.“I believe Jeremy Hunt, while he didn’t say as much, is a much more moderate candidate and does understand the concerns of people here in Northern Ireland.”For Boris Johnson: Tory member Tony Cullontry catch  TrendingWillie Frazer funeral -

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Abandoned - BlissThe first dog to arrive at the centre was -year-old Spaniel Grace, found by a member of the public at the side of the road. She was taken to the vet immediately, but after an owner didn’t come forward, she was brought to Dogs Trust.Two weeks ago, another Spaniel - aged eight and nicknamed Bliss by the team - was found tied to a fence not far from the rehoming centre. Like Grace, the Spaniel has not been microchipped, which has been a legal requirement for all dogs since  and the easiest way to identy a dog who has become separated from their owner. Shockingly just one week later, a Cairn Terrier - less than a year old, was found by a rehoming centre staff member at the very same spot where Bliss was left. Terrier Rizzo was lucky to be found as she is quite small and it would have been easy to miss her in the long grass.The most recent addition to the ranks of abandoned pooches is Sally, an eight-year-old Collie cross, who was found as a stray by a member of the public and brought to the rehoming centre.Abandoned - RizzoOonagh Philips, Rehoming Centre Manager said: “We want to remind anyone who no longer feels that they can care for their dog to contact their local rescue organisation for support. When a dog is abandoned on the road side, it not only puts them in danger, but also drivers. We are so thankful that all four of these dogs were found when they were.“Grace and Bliss were very shaken up by their ordeal when they came into our care and it took them a couple of days to build trust around people again. We could tell Rizzo hadn’t eaten in a while, which could have resulted in a deterioration of her physical health. Sally is incredibly sweet natured, and just like the others, will make a wonderful addition to the right home.“We are not sure why there has been a recent influx in dogs being abandoned. We always remind people that ‘A Dog is for Le®’ but we understand that le happens, and places like Dogs Trust are there to support any dog owner who experiences a bump in the road and needs our help. Sometimes the most responsible thing we can do as a dog owner is admit that we aren’t coping with our pets, but it is important to ensure they are kept safe and not left to fend for themselves.”If you

That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/bbobb.jpg","title":"coffee chain bob and berts creating  new jobs","story":"Posted on Monday  June  by John Mulgrew A Northern Ireland coffee shop chain is creating  new jobs as its expands it reach across the UK with eight new stores, it has emerged.
