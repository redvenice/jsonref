Video: Enda O\u0027DowdAngeline Ruddy, deputy principal of Moville Community College: ‘It’s on our children’s lips, it’s on our staff’s lips... There’s no getting away from mica’. Photograph: Enda O’DowdAt Moville Community College, everybody is talking about mica.“There’s not an English essay that’s passed to a teacher that doesn’t have a mention of mica in it somewhere... and every time you mention humanitarian issues it’s the first thing to the forefront,” says deputy principal Angeline Ruddy.“It’s on our children’s lips, it’s on our staff’s lips,” she says. “There’s no escaping it. There’s no getting away from mica.”The presence of the mineral in construction blocks – which makes them crack and eventually crumble – has caused structural damage to an estimated 7,500 homes in counties Donegal and Mayo, as well as smaller numbers in other counties.Mica has impacted the entire community, says principal Anthony Doogan, and the school community is no different.At Moville Community College approximately 20 per cent of staff and 25 per cent of pupils – about 20 staff and 100 families – are living in “mica homes” even more have siblings and parents who are affected.“I have five siblings, and four of them are affected by mica,” says Ruddy. The one who isn’t lives in the US.“Where I live, in a half mile radius, 20 houses are affected. It’s everywhere we go.”Her children “know nothing else but a mica household” as they go about their daily routine, mica is “like an app running in the background for every one of us.“‘Is the house safe tonight?’ is a regular question my children will ask,” she says. “I have cracks that are now the width of a two-euro coin, which means my gable is starting to move away from the wall of my house. I don’t know, really, if we are safe any longer.”Others tell a similar story. Special needs assistant Barry Moore’s home is crumbling his daughter was riding her bike around the house when “a lump of plaster fell off... it was near enough to scare her, and me.”“You’re lying at home at night and you hear the walls moving. It’s scary, to think you’re living in a place that is meant to be your safe place and you’re hearing the walls cracking.”Five of the special needs assistants – nearly half of the special needs staff – have mica homes, and so do some of the students they support. A hoist used by one child is attached to a crumbling mica wall, while foster parents have bought two mobile homes to house their children with complex needs.“They need routine, they need to know what happening... they’re going to be moved into two mobile homes behind their house and watch their house getting knocked down,” says Moore.In school, he says, you can “see the children who have mica, or whose houses have mica. They are, like their parents probably are, nearly obsessed with the fact they have mica.“As staff you’re trying to accommodate and support children... but they’re going home to houses that aren’t safe and that are causing them grief and stress.”Guidance counsellor Sineád McCarron’s home also has mica she warns of “what’s coming down the line... this is just going to explode, really, in terms of the amount of support the students need.”As principal, Doogan has significant concerns about the physical and mental health of students and staff – not least through heightened levels of anxiety – and about the impact on students’ attendance and life chances the effects, he estimates, will persist for the next five to 10 years.The anxiety of students and parents “is having an impact on their work rate and their effectiveness at their studies at school,” he says.“Every secondary school in the country”, he emphasises, has seen the effects of Covid “We’re at the beginning of this cycle for mica and in two years’ time, when there’s a large number of houses in this community which need to be demolished and rebuilt, there will be severe anxiety and perhaps worse felt by a lot of our students.”There is also “clear evidence” of an increase in absenteeism due to illness – “they’re living in draughty rooms, the rooms are colder, the rooms are causing them health issues that they wouldn’t ordinarily have” as well as students from mica homes who have left school altogether.Brother and sister Shaun and Aoife Noone describe how their home is “falling down”: “If I put my hand in the wall I could just pull away some of the side of the house,” says 17-year-old Shaun.They have moved out so that their home can be demolished and rebuilt. “I don’t really have a study room so that’s affecting my study, because I’m doing my Leaving Cert now, and it’s harder to focus and settle down and get work done,” he says.“I feel disadvantaged, it’s unfair that most people would stress or be anxious about exams but I’ve got the pressure of my house on top of that, so it’s a bit hard on the mind as well.”Aaron Price (13) and his family have also moved out. “It was a lot to handle trying to go to school and do homework and trying to empty the house.”The Government this week announced a €2.2 billion scheme to rebuild mica homes in Donegal and Mayo, capped at €420,000 per home and with a sliding scale of rebuilding costs from €145 per sq ft for the first 1,000 sq ft to €110 for the next 1,000 and €100 thereafter.It has been criticised by the mica campaigners in Donegal as falling short. “Apparently a new scheme was decided but it’s stupid, apparently each square metre gets less money, that doesn’t make sense,” says Aaron.“We need 100 per cent, and I know we probably will never get that, but if it was in Dublin, this would already be fixed.“It’s not our fault, we spent a lot of money on building our house... why should we have to spend more and more money rebuilding our house?”The adults have done the figures each of those spoken to by The  is facing a shortfall of between €60,000 to €80,000. “If council houses are being built at the minute they are built on a rate of €150 a square metre,” says Moore. “What was being offered would work out essentially for our house at €127 a square metre, which would leave us paying €65,000 on top of what we would get.“My other half is a psychiatric nurse, we’re no millionaires, we’re working-class people and we live in an average size house in Donegal which is the average in the country for a one-off build, 2,500 sq ft.“If they had dropped the sliding scale part... 145 euro per square foot, that’s it, and then your rent and then your storage, I would say 90 per cent of people would have been happy and celebrating, but they put in a scale that doesn’t exist in any builder’s pricing.”“The cost to me right now is €79,000, and that’s just for the build,” says Ruddy. “My house is 2,600 sq ft... that gives a total of €315,000 of a grant. The builders have come back to me with €395,000.“I can’t borrow because I have a mica home... 100 per cent redress is so far from it, I don’t think I’m even getting 80 per cent redress.“My children are at the stage where I should be starting to save for their college. Am I going to build their house and deprive them of education? We’re facing these choices.”“People bought the material in good faith... yet they are being victimised to the extent of having to spend 40, 50, 60, €80,000, whereas other areas were given 100 per cent redress,” says Doogan.For him, it is about the value placed on people from this area, not least given that the school itself is still “nowhere near completion” 20 years after it opened. “We bailed out the banks for €64 billion, and they’re saying three or four billion is a huge amount of money, but it’s less than five per cent of what we gave to the banks.“The people up here paid their taxes to pay for the bank bailout, and people here, like me, paid their taxes to pay for the pyrite redress in Dublin and Leinster. People round here are saying, ‘is there a different law for us?’”McCarron, too, is clear: “How can we help people look after their wellbeing and instil value systems of fair justice when our own Government continues to let this happen?”“They’ve let us down,” says 15-year-old Aoife. “If this was happening in Dublin, I feel it would be a different story, because we’re that far away and we’re rural they say ‘ah, them Donegal ones, they live in big mansions, they can afford it’. We can’t. We need our houses fixed.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"from the minute the trial started until it was over it was all about him mother of nadine lott","story":"A collage of family photographs of Nadine Lott and family members. Photograph: Nick BradshawClaire Lott often finds herself arranging memories of her daughter, Nadine. Simple ones. The girl whose laugh prompted the laughter of others. The woman who would never leave home without make-up, even if only for a run, and who was devoted to her own daughter, Kya – “the love of her life”.Or the memories of the woman who, with a heart-shaped birthmark, literally wore her heart on her sleeve.In October 2019, two months before she died, Claire brought Nadine to Rome to celebrate her 30th birthday. There, as the summer waned, they sat and talked about “anything and everything”.“Nadine would tell you everything,” Claire remembers. There, she confided that she was at a point in her life where a relationship was not a primary concern for her. “She said: ‘I’m actually so happy in my life now, I don’t need anybody.’“She loved her job, her car, her apartment, she was so proud of everything she had achieved. She had been approached to do some modelling. Everything was right.” Life was filled with promise.But these memories are often overshadowed by darker thoughts from the three days when her daughter fought for her life, savagely beaten by her former partner, Daniel Murtagh, to the point where she was unrecognisable.“You try to put those away,” her mother explains.Less than two years after the attack, she sat and she listened in Court 19 of the Criminal Courts of Justice as the Chief State Pathologist, Linda Mulligan, detailed each of the 64 injuries to her daughter’s “tiny” frame.The evidence, including details of the blood spattered kitchen, was heard within “touching distance” of the man who had carried out this brutal, primal attack. “This is my daughter you are talking about. It was so cold and factual,” she says.‘The Monster’Next Friday marks the second anniversary of Nadine Lott’s death. She died three days after the grotesquely violent attack in her Arklow home at the hands of Murtagh, her former partner. Kya, then just six, witnessed it all.During the “total carnage”, Kya had screamed at and begged her father to stop and “not to kill her mummy”, but Murtagh had carried on. Kya had seen the devil at work, Claire Lott later told the court.His name is never uttered today in the Lott household. “We don’t mention him ever,” she says. “If he has to be mentioned, he is referred to as ‘The Monster’. He is never referenced by name. We don’t consider what he is doing, where he is, what he was. He is gone,” she says.In June 2012, Nadine travelled to Australia with friends on a year’s working holiday. Her mother was “heartbroken” to see her go, but would not have tried to discourage her. Her daughter did well there as a beautician.She had few boyfriends before she had the “dreadful misfortune” of meeting Murtagh in Darwin, the capital city of Australia’s vast Northern Territory. Initially, she told only her confidante and younger sister Phoebe (26) about the Clondalkin man. She told her mother later.Claire characterises their relationship as a “holiday romance”.“We wouldn’t have known anything about his background as she met him in Australia and his family is not from around here.“We are very trusting as a family and we rely on each other a lot and Nadine had a very trusting nature. She probably inherited that because we would have trusted at face value initially what we saw and that was to our detriment,” says Claire ruefully.In June 2013, Nadine returned home. She had become pregnant shortly after meeting Murtagh. The window-fitter followed her home a few months later and, when their daughter Kya was born, they moved into an apartment together.Things did not work out, however.“They lasted a very short time together. It was a holiday romance and when they got home the holiday was over and Nadine was pregnant. When he came home it dwindled very quickly,” says Claire.“They had had a baby together and she wanted to have the perfect family unit. She was doing what she could to make that work but within months it was all over.”In 2016, Nadine made a last attempt to save the relationship: “She didn’t have feelings for him, but I think she thought: ‘We have a baby together, we will try one last time.’ And she really did try,” she says.However, it ended when Murtagh failed to turn up at the house which Nadine had, with difficulty, rented for them. “She said she wasn’t upset about him and didn’t care about him. It was more a pride thing, she had been let down and everybody could see it.”Despite going separate ways, Nadine still wanted her daughter to have a relationship with her father. “Nadine wanted him to have a relationship with Kya more than he wanted to have a relationship with Kya,” Claire believes.Nadine’s biggest achievement in life was Kya and the mother she became, her mother says. Nadine’s birthing partner in November 2013 was her sister Phoebe, not Murtagh. Phoebe, not Murtagh, took the first photographs of mother and baby.During all of the time, Claire recalls that her daughter “never, ever, ever” told her that she loved Murtagh. “Even after having Kya, she never once said: ‘I love him.’ She always just said: ‘He is funny.’“He was a very insignificant part of our lives.”ControlJust under two weeks before the brutal assault, Nadine told Murtagh in a WhatsApp message not to “threaten” her and that “nothing is ever going to happen between us again, I want to make that clear.”With hindsight, Murtagh clearly had tried to control her daughter, Claire believes: “At the time we wouldn’t have looked at it as controlling. But he was trying to have everything on his terms.”He would promise to visit Kya and not show up. Money for Nadine had to be handed over personally: “He had to be in control. We always felt he wanted to see Nadine more than he wanted to see Kya. Kya was just his way of seeing Nadine.”Murtagh disliked Nadine seeing anyone else, even though they were not together: “Nadine did have to keep things from him even though they were no longer together. She would just say: ‘It’s easier, I don’t have to put up with the grief.’“Nadine was dating a Turkish guy and the next day she got a text to say: ‘So you were out on a date. I think I’ll go and get my hair done with a Turkish barber,’” Claire recalls. “He was letting her know that he knew she had been out with this guy. That was regular.”Despite her feelings, Nadine never criticised Murtagh in front of Kya. “Nadine never gave out about him if he never came to Arklow or never turned up. Nadine would make an excuse for him, she would do anything to make it easier for Kya to accept.”Murtagh had not been violent before the fatal attack, her mother insists: “Nadine was very open. Even if she would not have admitted it to me as her mother, if she was trying to protect me she definitely would have said it to Phoebe or her friends.”It never entered Claire’s mind that she would face such carnage when she went into her daughter’s apartment after a frantic phone call from a neighbour: “We literally thought Nadine would be sitting there with one stab wound. And he would have run and she would have been upset. That’s what I went up to deal with and what I was preparing for.”The Lotts will never know exactly what happened after she returned home from a family night out in a local Arklow pub. Murtagh had been babysitting Kya, having earlier attended her school recital and nativity play. Consequently, he was staying the night.At about 4am, Nadine’s friend and neighbour Amela Kulenovic found Murtagh “vicious with rage” and making a “growling noise” as he rained blows on his ex-partner as she lay on the living room floor. He was “going ape” and “like a wild animal”, Kulenovic later told gardaí.Before the attack, Nadine had changed into her pyjamas, neatly folding the dress worn on the night out. “I have so much in my head but I’ll never know what happened. I have a million opinions, a million scenarios and a million sounds,” her mother says.Murtagh fled after the attack, driving away in his Volvo. Thirty kilometres away, in Laragh, he crashed into a ditch, suffering minor injuries. A motorist stopped to help, only to be told by Murtagh that he had “killed my wife because she was with my friend”.InjuriesToday, Claire Lott believes that the “extreme and grotesque” injuries inflicted on Nadine’s face – which had separated flesh from bone – were utterly deliberate. “Without a doubt,” she says.Pointing from her neck to the top of her head, Claire goes on: “When I saw Nadine, everything was focused from here up. Everything was destroyed beyond recognition. Not only did she not look like Nadine, she didn’t look human either.“For all of that to have happened before she had even got into hospital and before the swelling had started to take place. Her head and face were destroyed. It was just a mess,” she says.Gda Supt Declan McCarthy, who headed the murder investigation, said he had never seen such violence in his 40 years of service, a view echoed by doctors. Her injuries were so catastrophic that she never regained consciousness.Claire brought some of her daughter’s belongings to put beside her hospital bed – a photo of Nadine, her wash-bag, her perfume and pictures of Kya: “I wasn’t sure what sort of damage was going to be there when she woke up.“Pictures help with memories and I thought if she had all these pictures around her, she would get comfort when she wakes up,” says Claire, who believed her daughter would recover consciousness, despite the injuries and the need for 42 pints of blood.“As a mother you hope against hope. Visually, you are seeing one thing but you just hope that the injuries are almost superficial and deep down there can be a healing and she would come out of it. I just wanted her back, it didn’t matter what form I got her back in.“I knew it would be a long recovery. I thought we were in for months of recovery before we even got to healing. I thought we were going to need plastic surgery. Those were the thoughts that were going through my head.“Even when they were taking her down for the last brain scan, I still was sitting in the chair thinking: ‘Come on Nadine, show them there is a little bit of you there. Just give them something that they can work with.’” She died on December 17th, 2019, at 3.16pm.‘His show’Today, Claire Lott\u0026nbspbelieves her daughter’s identity got lost during the trial: “From the minute the trial started until it was over, it was all about him. We referenced it as ‘his show’. He felt like he was running the show.”Her daughter’s voice, she says, was not heard until a victim-impact statement was read at the sentence hearing in October, when Murtagh received the mandatory term of life imprisonment for murder.“That’s why it was so important for us to do it as a family,” she says.Claire Lott attended every day of the three-week trial, bar the two days when Murtagh’s final video interview with gardaí was played to the jury. “I stayed at home with Kya. I didn’t want to be there to listen to him boasting about what he had done,” she says.In it, the 34-year-old boxer told of the “pounding” he inflicted, sitting forward in his chair as he did so, punching his fist into the palm of his other hand. He told, too, of how he used a tyre pump charger, with its wire wrapped around his knuckles for a solid punch.He lied throughout, she says, about his claims to gardaí that Nadine had been seeing someone else and when he claimed they were “kind of back together for the past three months, on and off”.“He never thought he would get convicted of murder, he thought he would be found guilty of manslaughter. At no point did he actually believe or did his family believe that he would be found guilty of murder.“He honestly believed that the jury would be on his side. I think he is so self-centred and egotistical that he thought people would believe what came out of his mouth,” she says, noting that he had called Nadine his “future wife” in his last interview.“She was neither his girlfriend nor his wife. They were amicable for a child and that was it. In her texts to him, she was being as nice as she could be but it didn’t mean she even liked him,” Claire insists.Nadine’s mother was repulsed by Murtagh’s demeanour in the courtroom, especially when he would blow kisses down to his mother from the dock before he went into the cells each evening.There has never been an apology from him.“One day we were leaving court and we had just seen the most graphic pictures of Nadine’s blood and drag stains all over the apartment. And his mother shouted up to him: ‘I love you.’ How can a woman sit and look at what is being done to another woman and then portray her love?”“That made it even harder for us because I, Phoebe, Tanith, Kyle, David, none of us could look up at Nadine and shout: ‘We love you. We will see you later. We will call you at seven.’ They thought this was okay to do.”Pain and griefToday, Nadine is talked about every day by the Lotts, to keep her memory alive for Kya.Hundreds of people attended a vigil for her in Arklow, her hometown: “She would never pass anyone without saying hello, she would always help someone out if needed help, she would never see anyone stuck,” Phoebe says.This month, the Lotts’ priority is to give eight-year-old Kya, who is looking forward to Santa, the best memories of Christmas possible, even though December is the month when she had to say “goodbye to her mammy”.“But the reality is that Kya will say herself that not a day goes by that she doesn’t think about that night. She says ‘Why my mummy’ and tells us how hard it is to be the only person in her class who doesn’t have a mummy,” Claire says.“We talk about Nadine like she is still here. It’s almost like she will walk in the door. Like she was here yesterday and is coming back. Then you are driving the car and you get this overwhelming pain and grief like you are actually going to go insane.“And then your brain switches off and even if you wanted to keep the crying going you can’t. You live in 2019 and in those couple of weeks before Nadine passed where everything was fine. That’s where you live.”The Nadine Lott Trust Fund has been set up in Nadine’s memory and as a secure fund for Kya’s benefit throughout her life. Contributions can be made through Bank of Ireland in Arklow, or through Pádraig J Hyland \u0026amp Co Solicitors, Arklow.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"hundreds turned away from ucd vaccination centre amid high demand for boosters","story":"Hundreds of people seeking booster shots have been turned away from the Covid-19 vaccination centre at UCD after the queue reached maximum capacity by 9.30am.

Photograph: Alan BetsonHundreds who turned up for their booster shot at UCD on Saturday morning were turned away because of long queues and delays on the university campus.The UCD Gerard Manly Building vaccination centre was due to open its doors at 9am, but such was the queue that it opened at 7.50am. The centre is administering booster vaccines to those aged between 50 and 69 and healthcare workers.UCD site manager Hugh Kane said there were already more than 50 people in the queue when he arrived at 6.45am. There are 10 booths in operation with a capacity of 120 an hour.By 9.15am, there were 472 people awaiting the booster, according to Mr Kane’s headcount. Anyone else who arrived after this time was turned away while those at the back of the queue were told they would have to wait four hours to get their booster vaccination.“We are not in a position to take anybody else at this stage as we have booked appointments in the afternoon,” he said.Long queues were also reported at City Hall in Cork and at the CityWest vaccination centre in Dublin. There were queues at the vaccination centre in Kilkenny city an hour before it was due to open at 9am.Early arrivals at UCD waited for two hours to get vaccinated. “I was here on Thursday and I was turned away so I was there at 7.30am,” said Maura Lynch. “There was about 150 people in front of me. It’s a relief to get my booster shot.”Blanaid Mehigan complained that an official said her vaccination certificate could not be read. “He let 20 people through when I was queuing. A girl who is going to Argentina was out by a day was turned away. I don’t understand it. It’s a bloody flu shot,” said Ms Mehigan.Many people who thought they had arrived early were turned away. “I’m frustrated. This is clearly not working properly,” said Karen O’Sullivan, who arrived just after 9am.“We are being criticised for not taking the flu shot, yet you can see the enthusiasm and the commitment here today. I don’t mind two hours waiting, but to wait and be told it is not going to happen is disappointing.”Contact tracingAsked about contact tracing among passengers arriving into Irish airports over the coming weeks, HSE chief executive Paul Reid said all passengers on flights with a confirmed case of the Omicron variant which has arrived from a designated country of concern will be contact traced under new public health measures updated by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre.If a case of Covid-19 that is not suspected to be Omicron is confirmed on a flight arriving from one of these designated countries, passengers within two rows in all directions of the inidual with the virus will be contacted traced, he said.If there are two non-Omicron suspected cases, the whole flight will be contract traced, he said. The same measures will be in place if one case of the Omicron variant is detected.Asked whether some visitors could end up stuck in quarantine for Christmas, Mr Reid urged the public to stay tuned to Government messaging on the issue.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"nphet is the beast government created but can it be tamed","story":"Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan with   Prof Philip Nolan,   Rachel Kenna and Dr Ronan Glynn. Photograph: Colin KeeganCollins The words coming out of Dr Tony Holohan’s mouth could not have been clearer: do not leak this information at all, and absolutely do not breathe a word before the Minister for Health, Stephen Donnelly has been told.It was last Thursday afternoon and Nphet was wrapping up a meeting in which it agreed to recommend a series of additional restrictions in the lead-up to Christmas.Going to “great pains”, Holohan declared: “This cannot leak before Stephen Donnelly sees it, and Stephen Donnelly can’t see it until late because he is in the Dáil. He almost said I beg you, he said I am pleading with you, do not.”Extra safeguards were put in place.This time the official letter which is sent from the Chief Medical Officer’s office to Donnelly would not even be sent digitally by email. Instead, in the gloom of the winter night, an official was dispatched from the Department of Health to hand-deliver it to Donnelly, who had been on his feet in the Dáil all evening.By the time that official stepped out into the rain, however, most of the details were already being reported by major news outlets. The information was out before the letter had even been put to paper.There was “absolutely huge annoyance about this,” a Government source said. The thinking was, “this is not the way to do business.”What followed the next day was a showdown between public health and Government, the likes of which had not been seen since the infamous Level 5 bombshell that dropped in October 2020.As people and businesses the length and breadth of the country fretted over the clearly imminent restrictions, the Minister for Justice, Helen McEntee, appeared on the country’s biggest radio show, RTÉ’s Morning Ireland, to discuss a scheme for undocumented migrants. She was tackled on the letter and asked what the Government’s plan would be.“It is not helpful that I am talking to you and I haven’t seen the letter,” she said twice.Even McEntee, a mild-mannered and level-headed politician, could not hide her evident frustration. Political insiders knew there was something brewing because, as one person put it, “that would not be Helen’s style”. She wasn’t alone.A meeting of the Cabinet Covid-19 subcommittee was hastily convened on Friday.‘Showdown’The point of the meeting was to discuss the advice with Holohan, but it descended into what multiple sources have described as a “showdown” in which politicians either “read them the riot act” or “exchanged angry words”, depending on who you talk to.Tánaiste Leo Varadkar was said to have been “clinically brutal” in his criticisms. The Minister for Finance, Paschal Donohoe, was angry too, along with McEntee and Minister for Arts Catherine Martin.Ministers wanted to know why they were effectively the last to hear these matters of huge significance and they wanted to know why this kept happening.There were other gripes festering: the previous evening Dr Cillian De Gascun appeared on RTÉ’s Drivetime programme. He was asked about whether schools might reopen in January. He answered haltingly at first but then said he would be hopeful it could happen.Added to the mix was a letter addressed by Holohan to parents around the country where he wrote about a “very high incidence in the as-yet-unvaccinated 5-11 year old age group” which was “a cause for some concern”.Ministers have often complained about feeling bounced into situations in a very public way by Nphet before they have had a chance to consider the implications, and this was the major bone of contention again.The upshot of the confrontation was that Nphet members were to be asked to route their planned interviews through the Government press office. All week, a narrative has been allowed to form that members of the public health team would need to get their permission slip signed before they could go on the radio or TV, raising the spectre of the team being silenced.But that is not how they see it.Free to talkSources on the team say they don’t believe they have been silenced and that they feel free to talk on radio whenever they please. They say it is the Government’s fault if it mishandled the communications of what its actual plan was – to provide Nphet members with the Government position before they go on air and to have clarity on who will be appearing where.“It is all a little bit of a manufactured storm. The Government are creating a problem that does not exist.”Sources say that if the Government wanted to make the overall message more coherent and ensure conflicting messages aren’t going out in public then they should have “built a change over time” instead of “having a hissy fit.”Some people on Nphet are undeterred others are confused most just plan on getting on with their jobs as they were.Pragmatically, many people on the team can understand why the issue came to a head.“I can see their issue. It is not okay to be on Morning Ireland not having seen the letter,” one figure said.On the other side of the fence, there is still aggravation. Government figures say that while Nphet meetings have been “leaky” for quite some time, they believe it has gone “to a whole new level” in recent weeks.There has been much chatter about uncovering the leak. On the Nphet side, members say that if anyone in Government has a suspicion about a serial leaker then they need to take that person aside and confront them because other members of the team feel their reputations are being affected by what is happening.It is clear there is paranoia in all quarters and a tug-of-war to re-establish where the power lies.Nphet has been referred to on more than one occasion as being the most powerful group of people in the country. Although it existed in different forms before 2020, it rose from relative obscurity to become one of the biggest beasts in the political jungle.Passenger seatThe question has been asked: how did Nphet become so dominant? And why is it that the Government always seems to be in the passenger seat when it comes to the big decisions?The answer is: because the Government made it so.In the very early days of the pandemic, on March 3rd, 2020, as the caretaker administration grappled with a decision on whether the St Patrick’s Day parade needed to be cancelled or not, the then minister for health, Simon Harris, said that any decisions made by the Government would be guided by public health and by science – “not by politics”.It became apparent within days exactly how serious the situation was and by March 19th the first major piece of legislation allowing for sweeping restrictions was brought before the Dáil. During that debate, Harris said that the requisite steps would not be taken “on the basis of a whim I or any of the other members may have”, but on the basis of “the best medical advice from the Chief Medical Officer so that we can do that and do it quickly. If the Department of Health and the Chief Medical Officer believe these powers are necessary in the time of a public health emergency, then I am with them all day long.”He added that “every decision that has been made by the National Public Health Emergency Team, which is chaired by the Chief Medical Officer, has been implemented in full.”At the end of April, five weeks into lockdown, Harris was asked about an imminent plan for the reopening of society.“We will follow public health advice first, second and third,” he said.From the very beginning of the pandemic, the power and centrality of Nphet was endorsed, emphasised and encouraged by Government.From a cursory reading of the minutes of the very first Nphet meetings, it is clear that its members did not see themselves as being the primary decision-makers. They talked about being a forum for advising on strategy and about how everything was deliberative until the Government made the final decisions.“No one knew what they were doing, the only people who had some semblance what they were doing was public health,” a source familiar with the situation said.“Even that was on a wing and a prayer. The Opposition were also part of the collective effort too. It is easy to blame the Government for allowing Nphet to take on a directive role but so did the Opposition. They were both in on it.“The Government didn’t have a choice because they didn’t have the knowledge, but it suited them as well politically to hide behind it and blame Nphet.”Simon Harris was regarded as having a close and effective relationship with both Tony Holohan and those in his office.The arrival of Stephen Donnelly as the new Minister for Health appears to have changed that dynamic.ProblematicHis critics inside the department paint him in a problematic light as someone who has struggled to maintain proper communication with the CMO and his team. They say there used to be clear lines of communication but now it has “triangulated”, with the Department of Taoiseach stepping in to take charge on occasion. Others say he went into the role ready to “interrogate” Nphet advice, “to question it, and to say no” when it was warranted.Regardless of any personal views, it is clear the new Government brought about a change in the relationship with Nphet at a time when we had learned a lot about the pandemic – and a lot about the cost politically, economically as well as socially.The relationship between Government and Nphet existed in two different worlds: the early and dark days of the pandemic when no one knew what was happening and the later days when the country had to find a way to live with Covid-19.This is still the world we are still living in and, despite plans to disband Nphet in October (which was apparently news to Holohan and his team), rising case numbers and the threat of the new Omicron variant mean we will be hearing from the public health team for some time to come.Ministers clearly have no Plan B for how to grapple with the coming weeks in relation to taking advice, and no alternative to Nphet. Some insiders believe that if the plan was to get the team to quieten down then this will backfire.This is because Nphet is the beast that the Government created and its expertise will be needed in the coming weeks if a more transmissible variant is about to take off. The Government knows it, and Nphet knows it too.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"yes we want to see a united ireland eventually but what s your hurry","story":"Sinn Féin voters are the most opposed to those measures – on the flag, anthem and joining the commonwealth – that might appeal to unionists.

We have been made aware that a small number of staff had impromptu drinks around their desks after the event.“The Treasury did not organise an in-person departmental party last Christmas.”At the time non-essential shops, leisure and entertainment venues were closed as well as pubs, bars and restaurants, and people were urged to stay at home except for limited reasons including work if it could not be done from home.The Times said chancellor of the exchequer Rishi Sunak was not at the event and that it is understood he was not aware of it at the time.A Treasury spokesman told the paper: “In line with the guidance at the time, a number of staff came into the office to work on the Spending Review 2020.“We have been made aware that a small number of those staff had impromptu drinks around their desks after the event.”Downing Street said it has cancelled any plans to hold a Christmas party this year.It came as Boris Johnson’s ex-aide Dominic Cummings said there are “lots” of photos of parties in No 10 that will “inevitably get out”.Mr Cummings dismissed defences from the Prime Minister’s allies that he would not have known about celebrations going on under his roof amid signs Mr Johnson’s popularity is slumping.Government chief whip Mark Spencer insisted Downing Street staff “were not drinking alcohol” and partying during Covid restrictions after it emerged the Prime Minister’s press chief addressed staff at one event last Christmas.No 10 said Mr Johnson retained full confidence in Jack Doyle to serve as communications director despite ITV reporting he addressed up to 50 people and made a speech at one party on December 18th. — PAStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"beverly knight tells rat a d theatregoers stay away disrupt","story":" Beverley Knight, the West End actress, has told “rat-a---d” theatregoers to stay home.The singer-turned-stage-performer from Wolverhampton criticised members of the audience at the Garrick Theatre, after a second performance of the musical she is starring in was disrupted.After Thursday evening’s rendition of The Drifters Girl, Knight took to Twitter to complain about the show-stopping disruption.“Ok. If your intention is to come to the theatre, get rat-a---d, make a scene, disrupt the show thus causing a show-stop?“My advice is stay at home. People pay to come to the theatre to be entertained, not to endure your foolishness. Done.”Members of the audience that night responded to Knight’s tweets, with one saying: “We were there last night and this person’s behaviour was shocking!”Another person tweeted: “People were drinking throughout, so by the second half they were joining in with the singing and drowning the cast out.“There was a lot of lurching in the interval. Perhaps limit the amount of drinks sold and not allow people to bring bottles in from outside?”Ms Knight said that suggestions for theatres to limit or stop selling alcohol were “tricky” because they “rely on the revenue that the bar receives”.She added: “Most folk who come along are not utter idiots.”A spokesperson for the production said that two audience members had to be escorted out of the building by theatre staff for “loud and abusive behaviour” during Thursday’s performance.They continued: “The cast left the stage whilst this happened, before resuming and completing the performance.“This is an isolated incident, however both The Drifters Girl and Nimax Theatres would ask all patrons to behave in a responsible, respectful manner when attending a performance.”The Drifters Girl has been playing in the Garrick Theatre, in London’s West End, since November 4 and is running until July next year.Tickets to see Knight, known as the queen of British soul, are selling for upwards of £20.The musical is about the “formidable businesswoman” Faye Treadwell, played by Knight, and her management of the long-lived R\u0026ampB and soul vocal group The Drifters.The ’s review said: “The sound of the show, I should declare, is exquisite, Beverley Knight leading the way and raising the roof at points in the title role.”Hundreds of people responded to Ms Knight’s Twitter post about the show’s disruption on Thursday, many sharing similar stories of raucous behaviour at other West End theatre performances.Melissa Phillips, an actress known for Gangs of London, tweeted in response that the “same scenario” happened at another West End show she attended recently.She said: “The person had to be removed by 6 security staff. The show stopped temporarily. It was distressing!”Another added: “I went to the show and wasn’t too far from the person that disrupted the show which she should be ashamed of.“I didn’t think the audience drowned out the cast at all some people sang along and was just enjoying the brilliant show.”Problems with audience behaviour in theatres is not uncommon as the use of mobile phones, loud chatting and eating can all become distracting and disruptive to other theatregoers.However, “rat-arsed” audience members can pose a safety threat and be disorderly to the point of causing a “show-stop”, as Ms Knight experienced on Thursday.More from NewsDeath toll may exceed 100 as tornadoes rip through US, destroying factories and nursing homesValerie Pecresse vows not to bend to \u0026#39wokeism\u0026#39 during first rally as Right-wing presidential candidateUkraine\u0026#39s large civilian reserve army is getting ready to repel a Russian invasionGovernment plans to bury power lines underground in wake of Storm ArwenShed that traps cows\u0026#39 methane and burns it on site given go-aheadNew opioids - ten times the strength of fentanyl - create battleground for US medicsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"cambridges sending harry meghan barbed christmas message","story":"Glad tidings of comfort and joy this week as William and Kate returned to Westminster Abbey to record a carol service to be broadcast on ITV on Christmas Eve.

It was sung just after the Duke of Cambridge had read, from St Luke’s Gospel, that “there was no room for them in the inn”. Oh dear.Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary, owned up to his part in Matt Hancock’s downfall this week. He told a live recording of Matt Forde’s Political Party podcast that the fateful CCTV camera was put up in the Secretary of State’s room when he oversaw an office move.“I honestly didn’t have any idea where it was pointed but for Matt it was very, very bad luck,” Hunt said, adding: “If it was someone trying to catch him out doing some mischief that camera would have been pointed at the sofa, not the door.”Hunt also lifted the lid on his embarrassment when, during his time as foreign secretary, he said, during a visit to Beijing, that his Chinese wife Lucia was Japanese. He desperately tried to phone her to warn her of the gaffe. When he eventually got through, Lucia answered in her best Japanese: “Konnichiwa – darling!”Lily Cole has been handing out the kind of eco-advice that only a supermodel worth £10 million can offer: suggesting people should reuse their couture gowns. “I wore my old McQueen dress for the Fashion Awards, because sustainability means loving things MORE and committing to them!” she reveals.What’s wrong with going to Oxfam?More on why honours for prime ministers appear to have stopped with Tony Blair. I disclosed last week that the current situation means Theresa May is styling herself Lady May after her husband Philip was knighted. Friends of the former Labour PM have since confirmed that Blair “hasn’t been offered one”.Privy Council expert David Rogers tells me former prime ministers are sniffy about peerages because they tend – with some notable exceptions like Margaret Thatcher and Harold Wilson – to be given to politicians who lose elections. This would explain why William Hague, Michael Howard and Neil Kinnock are in the Lords along with David Owen and David Steel. “Heath, Major, Blair, Brown considered themselves far too successful to go to the Lords and mix with failures,” Rogers says.Great excitement about Harry Hill’s upcoming musical Tony! – a “rock opera” about “the life of former Ugly Rumours front man and Britain’s first pop prime minister”.

Which can only mean the other third have not been paying attention. Just to bring you up to speed, in case you fall into that category: the Prime Minister knew absolutely nothing about a Christmas party that definitely didn’t happen in Downing Street on December 18 last year.“How could it have happened when Christmas parties weren’t allowed due to Covid?” I hear you cry. Well, quite, that is precisely why it didn’t. Just as Owen Patterson did not commit any breaches of lobbying rules and just as Bill Clinton did not have sexual relations with that woman. Nothing whatsoever to see here. Just a nice baby girl, born to Johnson’s wife Carrie this week. Can’t we just focus on that?But here’s the curious part: although this party didn’t take place, Allegra Stratton, Johnson’s former press secretary, was filmed laughing about it anyway in a video that was leaked to ITV News. Which was somewhat unfortunate for all those who had insisted it never took place. Obviously Stratton had to resign from her current job, for laughing about a party that didn’t happen. The country, meanwhile, has kept itself busy sharing jokes and memes about what has inevitably now been called Christmas partygate. One wag on Twitter suggested Labour refer to the Tories from here on in as simply “The Christmas Party.” Another said of Johnson’s apparent non-attendance at the party that didn’t take place:Yes, it has been a rich seam to mine, and if we didn’t laugh we’d be crying as we asked ourselves in disbelief how a man who seemed so trustworthy at the outset, so clearly guided by a strict moral code, could have let us down so badly.

They firmly believe Johnson, as should we all:Some even expressed their support by comparing him to their favourite television comedians, such as Kathy Burke...But if, despite all the copper-bottomed assurances that no party or parties took place and no rules were broken, at least we know the very best officers have been assigned to the case.

They said it was a flu shot, but afterwards, she found it hard to think and could only focus on her stomach. Her periods, which usually lasted three to five days, began to last for fourteen. Later on, she realised that like hundreds of thousands of other Uyghur women, she had been sterilised.Mass infertility of this kind is usually the stuff of dystopian fiction. But in China’s Xinjiang province, it is happening by design. Official government policy is to devastate Uyghur society and cut off its future. The children are sent to state-run “boarding schools”, their parents to “re-education” camps to be tortured, starved, raped and experimented upon. Whoever is left is sterilised and then put under intensive surveillance. In some counties, the Uyghur birth rate has fallen 90 per cent.In a speech in 2014, general secretary Xi Jinping compared this regime to a system of public healthcare given to cure “sick thinking”, which he defines as any religious or cultural affiliation to something other than the Chinese Communist Party. This week in London, a public tribunal chaired by veteran war crimes prosecutor Sir Geoffrey Nice put another name to it: genocide.In one sense, the legal debate over the Uyghur genocide is an arcane one. It’s clear that a crime against humanity is occurring. There is not yet evidence of mass killings, though as scholars at the Tribunal pointed out, genocidal regimes can take some years to reach a policy of outright massacres. But the legal definition of genocide in the Geneva Convention is broader than that. If you can prove that a government or inidual has intentionally set out to eradicate a significant part of a community, it counts.Thanks to a cache of secret CCP documents photographed and leaked by an unknown whistle-blower, we know that this intention goes right to the top. According to these documents, in 2014, Mr Xi told a closed-door gathering of CCP officials that Xinjiang officials must adopt a policy of “optimising population” to produce the correct “population proportion”. The proportion he’s referring to is the ratio of Han to Uyghurs in Xinjiang. There were, he was effectively saying, far too many Uyghurs.Since then, the same language has filtered down into the speeches of other officials, government policy documents and debates among Chinese social scientists. Resources have been mobilised, camps built to house more than a million people and the population shuttled around from here to there in a vast exchange of forced labourers, prisoners, children, police, Han settlers and men sent to lodge with Uyghur families to report on all their activities. Any Chinese officials who show leniency are purged.The Uyghur Tribunal chaired by Sir Geoffrey was set up by volunteers because the UN and associated bodies are too corrupt or cowardly to do their job. The Geneva Convention imposes arduous duties on states to take action when they recognise a genocide. So most states don’t.We cannot halt the Uyghur genocide. But we could recognise it by sanctioning the whole cohort of senior officials involved and designating Mr Xi’s government as a genocidal regime. If you cannot even name evil, you cannot fight it.In the days before the Tribunal published its judgment, Boris Johnson was asked in Parliament whether the UK would follow the US in declaring a diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Winter Olympics. The Prime Minister’s bizarre answer was that we would “effectively” boycott them because “no ministers are expected to attend” but, just to quibble, just, you know, in case China were to get unhappy, he clarified: “I don’t think sporting boycotts are sensible.”When is a boycott not a boycott?

But this is awful.”Mr Molbeck-Blyth, 52, added: “The National Trust is undermining a small business we’ve worked hard to build up over 13 years. Frankly I’m furious about it and so are lots of our customers.”Customers have vented their frustration at the NT’s decision, with more than 7,500 already signing a petition against the closure of Brownlow CafeLouise Denholm, regular visitor to the cafe, wrote on it’s Facebook page: “I can\u0027t believe you are closing on 2122 as you make the most amazing food and cakes and it is a crying shame that you are being shut down by NT after all these years.”Another visitor told her local newspaper, Hemel Today: In my view the National Trust has made a grave error in closing the café and by doing so is going to drive down the numbers of people coming to Ashridge Estate. It is also disappointing that the National Trust isn’t doing more to support a clearly successful local business.We love going to the café because it has great food and lovely staff. It is also nice to support a local business, and clearly lots of people agree as it is always busy.Mr and Mrs Molbeck-Blyth were informed by the NT in July that their lease would not be renewed, with the trust activating the break clause in their contract with effect from January 31. The National Trust defended the decision not to renew the cafe’s lease, saying it was time “to revisit arrangements and make changes to our visitor offer”.A spokesperson for the trust said: “While we are unable to comment on inidual agreements, we would like to thank the Brownlow team for the contribution they have made to visitors over the years.We also want to reassure visitors that we will still offer refreshments, initially in the form of a temporary outlet, which will be open 7 days a week.We will soon be sharing an update about our exciting new café proposition, proposed to open in the spring. Visitors should not see a disruption to the service and we hope they will welcome the extended opening to suit their needs.”More from NewsDeath toll may exceed 100 as tornadoes rip through US, destroying factories and nursing homesValerie Pecresse vows not to bend to \u0026#39wokeism\u0026#39 during first rally as Right-wing presidential candidateUkraine\u0026#39s large civilian reserve army is getting ready to repel a Russian invasionGovernment plans to bury power lines underground in wake of Storm ArwenShed that traps cows\u0026#39 methane and burns it on site given go-aheadNew opioids - ten times the strength of fentanyl - create battleground for US medicsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"traps cows methane burns site given go ahead","story":"A cattle shed that collects methane from cows and uses their waste to grow fruit and vegetables has been given government backing in the fight to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.The so-called GreenShed will look much like normal housing used to keep cattle inside over winter, but will be more airtight and include extraction technology to remove the methane and burn it onsite. Methane is a greenhouse gas 28 times more potent than carbon dioxide and has a powerful short-term impact. Methane from livestock accounts for around six per cent of the UK’s overall greenhouse gas emissions.The Government is relying on technological solutions to cut significant amounts of methane from livestock farming, rather than focusing on changing diets to encourage less meat eating.Energy needed for the GreenShed will be provided in part by burning the waste produced by the cows in an anaerobic digestor attached to the shed.The heat produced from that process will also be used in polytunnels that help crops to grow in a vertical farming system.The project is being led by researchers at Scotland\u0027s Rural College, and is one of dozens to receive Government-backing from a fund to develop direct air capture of greenhouse gas emissions.“Tackling methane really offers us a lot of opportunity,” said Carole-Anne Duthie, the head of SRUC\u0027s Beef and Sheep Research Centre. “Because it’s got such a short halflife, it can have a massive impact.”Other recent inventions to tackle livestock methane include a mask that catches their burps, and the addition of seaweed into their diet, which has been shown to reduce the gas by up to 80 per cent.The GreenShed researchers hope the technology will be ready in the next three to four years, and could provide a simple retrofit solution on farms where cattle are already kept inside over winter.It will target cows during the final “finishing” months before they are sent for slaughter, when their methane emissions are highest.The system is expected to add 10-30p for the farmer on the cost of producing a kilo of beef, at a time when they are facing increasing pressure on price.The researchers are relying on a growing desire in consumers for food produced in a greener way, and a willingness to pay for it.Although the project estimates it can cut up to 250 tonnes of CO2 equivalent gas from every cattle shed per year, it will not solve the problem of emissions from agriculture.Burning the methane will produce CO2, while the shed cannot tackle the emissions produced during the rest of the cattle’s life. There are also concerns that the feed given to cattles kept indoors is produced in areas that contribute to deforestation.Instead, increasing numbers of environmentally minded farmers are focusing on a regenerative agriculture system, in which hardy breeds of cattle are kept outside all year long, in a boost to their welfare and to soil health and its ability to store carbon.“We need to tackle the climate and bioersity crisis to have livestock outside and deliver the true benefits of a regenerative farming system,” said Martin Lines, the chair of the Nature Friendly Farming Network. “My concern is this research will encourage the keeping of animals inside. We should be doing more to treat those animals as sentient beings.”But its backers argue that the technology could provide a relatively simple way to reduce the emissions from cattle.“It’s one of many in our potential toolkit to help solve the problem,” Ms Duthie said. “The key benefit is that you’re not asking for radical changes to how those farms are going to operate.“The responses from farmers so far are really quite enthusiastic.”More from NewsDeath toll may exceed 100 as tornadoes rip through US, destroying factories and nursing homesValerie Pecresse vows not to bend to \u0026#39wokeism\u0026#39 during first rally as Right-wing presidential candidateUkraine\u0026#39s large civilian reserve army is getting ready to repel a Russian invasionGovernment plans to bury power lines underground in wake of Storm ArwenNew opioids - ten times the strength of fentanyl - create battleground for US medicsChristmas parties won\u0026#39t kill this Government its own incompetence willMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"first picture royal navy trident","story":"Man found dead at nuclear base in unexplained tragedy is named as sailor, Royal Navy engineering technician Stephen Cashman has been named as the serviceman who was killed in \"unexplained circumstances\" at the Faslane nuclear naval baseTributes have been paid to Stephen Cashman following his death at Faslane nuclear naval base Image: MODByTim HanlonNews Reporter:,  Dec Updated:,  Dec | comments A Royal Navy serviceman who died in unexplained circumstances at the Faslane nuclear naval base was a -year-old Trident submariner, it has been confirmed.Engineering technician Stephen Cashman died on Thursday at the Clyde base and it has led to an investigation by Police Scotland.

Leaked footage of staff, including the PMaposs former spokeswoman Allegra Stratton, joking about cheese and wine at the party and definitely no social distancing sparked outrage about the get-together. Ms Stratton resigned on Wednesday after the video emerged. Now, The Sun reports that the PM is facing a growing Tory mutiny with some warning him to aposget a grip.aposFive aposnewbieapos MPs, who joined in the latest intake in , are said to have written letters to demand Mr Johnson quits. Meanwhile, former Tory chief whip Andrew Mitchell urged the PM to get a grip in order to keep his job. He told Times Radio: “I hope he will still be Prime Minister in a year — butDowning Street don’t get a grip and start to deliver the governance many of my colleagues are talking about openly, then the PM will be in considerable trouble.”  When the party allegations first emerged in the Mirror, Downing Street denied that such an event had taken place, but said all rules would have been followed had it happened.Number aposs robust defence was undermined earlier this week when ITV published a video showing government spokesperson Allegra Stratton joking about an event at Downing Street, leading Boris Johnson to apologise to Prime Ministeraposs Questions.The PM has always insisted all Covid measures would have been followedthere had been a Christmas party.

Why  No one knows. Or, at least, no one is willing to say. For as far back as anyone can remember, a stream of out-of-touch, often privately educated, Education Secretaries, have signed off on the idea that teaching student’s th century literature, at Level , is just what students need to secure them a decent job in the workplace. Students who don’t pass their GCSEs are forced to repeat what they’ve already failed at. Forced to engage with books written in a language they will never use. Trying to explain to young students who already feel like they have failed, why Jane Eyre is so important to them, is borderline abuse. At a time when young people are turning away from books and literature at an alarming rate, no one in government seems bothered or interested in providing students with something a little more relatable. Last week I had to face one such group. The futility and unfairness of it struck me mid lesson. I had no argument as to why they should engage with Dracula.  Why reading Stoker would be of use, interest, or benefit to them unless they had an express desire to go into further education. Which the vast majority don’t. Starting off a lesson with the words, ‘Today we are going to be looking at Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde’ will mean within two minutes % of a GCSE class will have shut down. Do the powers that be think there is no other literature available to young people  Using contemporary texts by authors like Kit de Waal or Lisa McInerny, would at least give students and teachers a fighting chance. If educators were permitted to teach English using contemporary literature that told of the lives and challenges of iniduals who looked and sounded like the students they were teaching, on subjects like county lines, gangs and drugs, or any other aspect of st century teenage le, more students would engage. It’s what they are familiar with. What takes up much of their time. And using a language they use themselves exploring issues and situations they can identy with. A large section of the materials we currently use to teach our young students are entirely ineffective. In fact, they are worse than ineffective. Relying on these texts throws unnecessary, unhelpful barriers in the paths of students. It damages their already damaged faith in themselves and a system that is supposed to support, nurture, and encourage them.

In the following year, all three received an indefinite leave to remain, and a year after this, they received their British Citizenship. With this, I also automatically gained citizenship through my parents - and of course, I was born here - so for all intents and purposes, I was and am British. Growing up in North London, I went to school in Barnet and then went on to secondary school nearby as well. Ultimately, I graduated from University of London while working multiple jobs throughout my university years. I then started my career as a journalist and hoped to make a change because the industry lacked British south Asians, and coverage around the community has been predominantly negative. There are around six million people like me, with similar stories of being born and brought up here, working in the UK and classing themselves as British Pakistani - which, despite having Pakistani at the end of it, does not make the aposBritishapos part of it any less credible - surely  Although at times it feels as though we are unwanted, this country is where we entered the world and is what we know. Evenwe decide to visit our home countries to gain more of a connection with our cultures, at the end of the day we are British citizens, right  But as much as we try to cling on to being British Pakistani or British Bangladeshi, British anything, the second part of the title has become a tool to ensure we know that we are in fact second-class citizens. This is because even though I was born here, I can be deprived of my citizenshipI am able to become a national of another country - for me, I could be deported to Pakistan on the governmentaposs whim. Despite being born and brought up here, clause , proposed by Priti Patel in July and updated last month, would allow for the Home Office to deprive me of my citizenship without delivering physical notication.This means,I went abroad and the government was unable to contact me, before boarding a plane back I could be told my passport is no longer valid without any warning.Mohammed Tasnime Akunjee, the lawyer known for representing Shamima Begum, explained how the new clause impacts Brits like me. He said: The existing law is thatthe Home Secretary deems you not conducive to the public good, and wish to strip you of citizenship, they have to sent you a notice of their decision with a reason for why they are stripping you of citizenship. However, now with the new clause, they donapost have to tell you, youaposll only be told when you try board a plane and your passport is no longer al. The government has said those who are deprived of their citizenship without notice have the right to appeal, but Mr Akunjee says there are issues with this.  He said: You need a physical notice in order to appeal a decision -you donapost have that then the courts will demand that you prove that you have actually have been stripped. You have to acquire that proof and be able to submit that to the court before you can even appeal. Additionally, although some might think that being born here would put you less at risk of being deprived of your status, Mr Akunjee says from a legal perspective, it does not. He said: Both peoplecan be stripped of their citizenship, being born or not born here doesnapost make a dference in respect of this bill. According to , the Home Office has said: “British citizenship is a privilege, not a right. Deprivation of citizenship on conducive grounds is rightly reserved for those who pose a threat to the UK or whose conduct involves very high harm. The Nationality and Borders Bill will amend the law so citizenship can be deprived where it is not practicable to give notice, for example,there is no way of communicating with the person.” So this means that as long as I am a good immigrant, I can stay in the UK  ButI was white, as I would be less likely to be able to get another nationality I would be more likely to keep my British citizenship regardless of what threat I pose to the public. *A version of this piece originally appeared on MyLondon Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Priti PatelHome OfficePoliticsShamima Begum\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Allies of Mrs Johnson - then Ms Symonds - denied the reports at the time. And asked whether the party took place at PMQs on Wednesday, Mr Johnson said: No.Yesterday, it was confirmed that as well as investigating the party held in Number  on December , a second gathering on Novmeber  would also be subject to a probe by Cabinet Secretary Simon Case.

He announced a probe into the event by Cabinet Secretary Simon Case - but his spokesman confirmed that inquiry will only cover the events of December  last year.

The FM said the Scottish Government was acting as Omicron was set to overtake Delta as the most dominant strain within days, adding Covid could put signicant additional pressure on hospitals and other health and care services at the peak pressure of winter. “The fact is, we do face a renewed and very severe challenge in the face of of the new Omicron iant,” she said at a briefing in Edinburgh. “To be blunt, because of the much greater and faster transmissibility of this new iant, we may be facing – indeed we may be starting to experience – a potential tsunami of infections.” Meanwhile in Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford also sounded the alarm over the new Covid strain, telling reporters at a briefing that restrictions would be reviewed weekly. The Department for Health said on Thursday there had been , new Covid infections and fears for the NHS are growing.The Prime Minister announced on Wednesday that England would move to Plan B restrictions, with people told to work from home as of Monday. The ramping up of Covid curbs also means more mandated mask-wearing and next week MPs will vote on a Covid pass scheme for some venues. But the Prime Ministeraposs authority has been damaged over the lockdown-breaking Christmas bash in No last December - first revealed by the Mirror. On Thursday night it emerged his communications director Jack Doyle gave a thank-you speech at the event and handed staff spoof awards.Tory backbenchers are also threatening a major rebellion over the Covid pass plan while Labour has said the PM is not fit to lead the country as the pandemic rages.Askedpeople in England should cancel their Christmas parties too, Mr Johnsonaposs spokesman said on Friday: Under Plan B, weaposre not shutting hospitality. The use of certication enables a number of venues to remain open when otherwise we would have had to close them for public health reasons as we have had to do previously. We understand fully the impact that these measures have had on hospitality in the past and certication allows them to remain trading.

The UK recorded its highest number of Covid infections since January  today and UK scientists warned millions could catch the new strain before the New Year as it will become the dominant iant in the UK by mid-December. The Survation poll for the Mirror reveals % of people are less likely to follow Covid rulesGovernment officials have broken them. The survey of , Brits online found % believe Government officials did break the rules at the peak of the second wave, with % stating the incidents should be investigated by the police. And % of Conservative voters who backed Boris Johnson in the last General Election believe the Tories think itaposs one rule for them and another for everyone .The poll comes after Professor Chris Whitty said he fears Brits will not accept new lockdown restrictions after enduring almost two years of the pandemic. Speaking to a  at the Local Government Association he added: “My greatest worry at the moment is that people…we need to do something more muscular at some point, whether it’s for the current new iant or at some later stage, can we still take people with us ”  The Office for National Statisticsinfection survey found  in  people had Covid in England, in the week ending December . This equates to around , people. On Friday face masks were made mandatory in most indoor spaces including cinemas, theatres, churches and galleries.And from Monday those who can work from home are advised to do so, and on Wednesday the NHS Covid Passwill become mandatory for entry into nightclubs and other large gatherings.The PM’s spokesman slapped down rumours of a Covid ‘Plan C’ or a ‘Plan B plus’ being prepared for the New Year just in case the plan B measures did not curb the new iant. Plan B measures are set to be introduced next week, with MPs set to vote on the measures in the Commons on Tuesday. But at least  Tory MPs are set to rebel and vote against the introduction of tighter Covid restrictions, with many furious with Mr Johnson’s handling of Downing Street party revelations.  Former Tory chief whip Mark Harper said the PMaposs authority has been diminished by the Owen Paterson sleaze row and the alleged Downing Street party. He told the Commons on Wednesday: “Why should people listen to the Prime Minister’s instructions to follow the rules when people inside Number  Downing Street don’t do so ”And renowned rebel Steve Baker told the Mirror he hoped Labour would vote against the measures.But shadow Health Secretary Wes Streeting slammed rumours of Labour voting against plan B restrictions in order to defeat the PM.He told BBC ’s Radio  Today programme “public health has always come first for the Labour Party during the pandemic. Despite the trouble the Government finds themselves in, public health will still come before party politics”. Sir Keir Starmer said the booster programme should have been ramped up weeks ago. “The Government pooh-poohed that it’s now doing it but again, as ever, too late, he added.The Survation study put Labour on a six-point lead over the Conservatives, which suggests voters have lost faith in Mr Johnsonaposs handling of the pandemic following the party scandal. Since the Mirror first revealed parties were held at the Prime Ministeraposs Number  flat in the run up to Christmas last year, the PM is now facing accusations of seven separate parties and drinks doaposs held across Westminster in November and December last year. Cabinet Secretary Simon Case is currently investigating three dates on which bashes were said to have been held in breach of lockdown rules. They are, a No leaving do on November  at which the PM spoke a No Christmas party on December  and a Department for Education bash on December . Downing Street has cancelled its Christmas party this year blaming the increase in workload for the cancelled plans. The Prime Ministeraposs spokesman said: I think weaposve made it clear since the latest situation with Omicron, obviously thataposs taking up a great deal of time at the moment. He added: Thereaposs no plans for [a party] in Number .On November , sources told the Mirror people gathered for drinks in Boris and Carrie Johnsonaposs flat above  Downing Street. And on the same day, farewell drinks were held in number s round table room - the night Dominic Cummings quit. Two weeks later on November , sources claim  to  people crammed into a room at Number  to say goodbye to top aide Cleo Watson, an ally of Cummings. Former Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has admitted to holding a canapes reception for his top team on December . Four days later people working on the London mayoral campaign for candidate Shaun Bailey held their own ‘raucous’ party. And on December  the Mirror broke the story about the Number  Christmas Party. ITV News reported on Thursday that Jack Doyle, who was then deputy director of communications at No , addressed up to  people at a Christmas gathering said to have been held on December .He offered to resign but the PM turned it down. A Number  spokesperson said Ed Oldfield is still in his position and the PM is still confident with his position, despite accepting Allegra Stratton’s resignation.

He predicted that the figure could be reached “sometime in January”the iant is resistant to existing protection and it has a similar severity to Delta - which is not yet known.  “Even the best-case scenarios involve several-fold more admissions per day than we’re getting at the moment – we are at about  right now,” he added. It comes as scientists say that Omicron could become the dominant iant by as soon as next week. And the government is currently looking at putting in stricter restrictions, it is reported. Daily Covid- cases have now reached their highest level in almost a year and the UKHSA predicted that,current trends continue, the UK will exceed one million infections by the end of the month. The UKHSA has also found that the AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines provided “much lower” levels of protection against symptomatic infection with Omicron compared to Delta.Cabinet minister Michael Gove warned of a “deeply concerning situation” after holding a Cobra meeting on Friday afternoon to discuss the latest data and the co-ordinated response across the four nations.The government said there had been a further , lab-confirmed Covid- cases in the UK and the last time a higher daily figure was reported was on January , when , cases were recorded. An additional  confirmed cases of the Omicron iant have been reported across the UK, bringing the total number to ,. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at the UKHSA, said early data indicates that “a few months after the second jab, there is a greater risk of catching the Omicron iant compared to Delta strain”. She added: “The data suggest this risk is signicantly reduced following a booster vaccine, so I urge everyone to take up their booster when eligible.” Gove said the Omicron iant is doubling every two to three days in England “and possibly even faster in Scotland”. He added that % of reported cases in London are the new iant, and warned that evidence suggests Omicron is “more likely” than past Covid iants to “potentially” lead to hospital admissions among the fully vaccinated.  Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has warned of the possibility of a “tsunami of infections” from the new iant – and said she could not rule out more restrictions north of the border as a result.But so far Boris Johnson has “no plans” to go further with measures in England, amid claims that he is considering a Plan C with tougher restrictions.Now under Plan B, people are required to wear masks in more indoor spaces including museums, galleries and community centres. There will be ato working from home guidance from Monday, and mandatory Covid passports for large venues from Wednesday.The new regulations will be put to a debate and vote in the Commons next week – and with Labour ’s support they are certain to be approved despite the prospect of a large Conservative revolt.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSOmicron iantCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Some staff who worked on the  autumn spending review had office drinks while England was under lockdown restrictions.It comes as Boris Johnson battles mounting revelations of rule-breaking festivities in Downing Street in the run-up to last Christmas.The Times reported that around two dozen civil servants were present for the drinks on November , . A Treasury spokesman said: A number of HMT staff came into the office to work on the Spending Review . We have been made aware that a small number of staff had impromptu drinks around their desks after the event. The Treasury did not organise an in-person departmental party last Christmas.  “They’d all been working really hard,” a source told the Times. “They had to be in the office anyway that day. It wasn’t a formal party but perhaps in hindsight it wasn’t the most sensible thing to do.” At the time non-essential shops, leisure and entertainment venues were closed as well as pubs, bars and restaurants, and people were urged to stay at home except for limited reasons including workit could not be done from home.The Times said Chancellor Rishi Sunak was not at the event and that it is understood he was not aware of it at the time.Downing Street said it has cancelled any plans to hold a Christmas party this year.

Vaccines passports will also be required for nightclubs and large events from December .But some experts have questioned whether the toolkit of measures will be enough to curb the new strain, with reports of officials drawing up Plan C with even tougher rules. Downing Street said on Friday there was growing confidence that the new iant spreads more quickly than Delta and there was some evidence of vaccine escape.Scotlandaposs First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warned of a possible tsunami of infections ahead of a four-nations Cobra emergency meeting chaired by Cabinet Minister Michael Gove on Friday afternoon. Here we sort the fact from the fiction on future Covid restrictions in England. What is Plan C  Officially, there is no Plan C. The Governmentaposs Covid Winter Plan, published in September, includes a section on Plan B which has a string of measures to imposethe Covid situation worsens. Boris Johnson pulled the trigger on Plan B on Wednesday, with masks becoming mandatory for most indoor public spaces from Friday, and vaccine passports made a legal requirement for nightclubs and large events like football matches from Wednesday. Brits will be ordered to work from home againthey can from Monday. This was thought to be enough to keep the virus at bay over the winter, along with the mass booster programme. But the arrival of Omicron has changed things. Downing Street say there is no official Plan C amid reports officials are drawing up a contingency blueprint with more restrictions.  The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said on Friday there were no plans to go beyond what weaposve set out already when askedthere was going to be a published Plan C. But he added: Obviously we need to keep the characteristics of this iant under review, and we would actnecessary, but thereaposs no plans to go beyond what we set out. Askedthere was a Plan C document, he said: Not that Iaposm aware of. As a responsible Government, of course, you would expect us to... we have an array, already, of options available to us in terms of what measures we can take to mitigate a growth of any iant or virus. But there are no plans to go beyond that currently. What restrictions could be included in Plan C  There are plenty of restrictions that could come in to get infection rates down. Working from home is one of the big levers the Government can pull - and this is already coming into force next week. The other big one is a reduction on household mixing, which was mooted as a contingency plan back in October. However this would be highly unpopular and it doesnapost seem to be on the cards so far. Here are some of the ideas that could be in the pipeline. Hospitality check-ins Punters could be asked to use the NHS Covid app to check into pubs and restaurants, to help contact tracers track the spread of the disease. This rule was in place earlier this year as hospitality venues reopened after lockdown but it was later abandoned. Use of the app fell after the so-called pingdemic when hundreds of thousands of people were told to isolate, leading to staff shortages across a number of industries. In August the rules were changed so double vaccinated people no longer had to isolatepinged by the app. Instead they were advised to take a PCR testthey came into contact with an infected person.  Face masks in all indoor spaces Rules on face coverings have been tightened since Friday, to cover indoor spaces such as theatres and cinemas as well as shops and public transport. But officials are said to be considering making it mandatory in all indoor spaces, which would include hospitality too. Vaccine passports in more venues From December , people will have to prove they are double jabbed or have had a negative Covid test to go to nightclubs and large events like football matches. But this could be broadened to smaller venues too. The Government has been reluctant to require vaccine passports for pubs and other hospitality venues but this could be considered.  Tougher isolation rules Self isolation rules were loosened in the summer so double vaccinated people didnapost have to stay at home for  daysthey came into contact with an infected person. Following the emergence of Omicron, the rules were tweaked so anyone who is a contact of an Omicron case has to isolate regardless of vaccination status. Bringing back the -day rule could have an impact - but it would be controversial again. What would cause Plan C to be triggered  The Government usually refuses to say explicitly what thresholds need to be met to lead to new restrictions - as the situation can change rapidly. But we can take some educated guesses based on the Winter Plan and previous lockdown rules.Throughout the pandemic, one of the key aims of restrictions is to prevent the NHS coming under unsustainable pressure. Hospitalisation rates are a key thing to watch for as large numbers of people being admitted onto Covid wards would put the health service under strain. How well vaccines are working is another critical factor, as the protection offered by the jab has allowed everyone toto some semblance of ordinary le. One of the big unknowns about the Omicron iant is how well the existing vaccines work against it. This is what scientists are currently trying to find out. The transmissibility of the new iant is also important - and how sick people are becoming from it. The new iant may seem frightening but it is worth remembering that we didnapost have the vaccine last winter, which is the best protection against the virus. When could that happen  The short answer is we donapost know. Experts are still working to understand the new iant and the scientic advice will be critical to whatever decisions the Government makes. There are some indications that the new iant may cause less serious illness than feared - but this could still have a big impact on the NHSit spread quickly and infects lots of people. There is also the political angle, as lots of Tory MPs are unhappy with the idea of further restrictions - so there could be some big parliamentary battlesthe Prime Minister tries to bring in fresh curbs. MPs will vote on Tuesday on the Plan B measures, which would be reviewed again in the New Year. However the Government can bring in additional restrictions soonerthe public health case is strong enough.

With Christmas parties in full swing, people may want to knowthey can drink before they are given the jabCoronavirus vaccines can cause minor side effects and drinking booze may not help Image: Barcroft Media via Getty ImagesByBenjamin LynchSEO writer:,  Dec | commentsVaccines are vitally important for tackling the coronavirus pandemic. The government hopes that despite new restrictions such as Plan B, as well as further restrictions possible in the form of aposPlan C apos, hospital admissions will be lower due to vaccinations.When the UK was forced to lockdown in  and early , most of the population was unvaccinated against the virus. Receiving the vaccine should not be too much of an inconvenience unless you are someone who may have a reaction to it. Some people have experienced brief, flu-like symptoms after receiving it, but most are expected to be fighting fit and are welcome to socialise after being vaccinated. So can you drink alcohol before and after your vaccine  Can I drink alcohol before or after having the Covid- vaccine   It is probably best to avoid drinking before and after the vaccine and you are only damaging yourselfyou have been drinking excessively. Alcohol may harm your immune response triggered by the vaccine by suppressing your immune system. If your immune system is slower to react, then the effectiveness of the vaccine could be impacted.  As for drinking after receiving the vaccine, people have been known to have side effects caused by the jab. Alcohol will not help any of these symptoms and is not a cure for feeling ill, it is just likely to dehydrate you and you will feel worse. Can alcohol affect the immune system   When a person is exposed to a virus, the bodyaposs antibodies are tasked with fighting off this illness. Healthier people with better and faster immune systems can fight viruses off more quickly. This is why older people are more at risk from viruses like Covid-, as their immune response is typically slower. Yale Medicine addiction medicine specialist Dr. E. Jenner Edelman, told Healthline: Alcohol has erse adverse effects throughout the body, including on all cells of the immune system, that lead to increased risk of serious infections.With COVID-, alcohol is likely to interfere with an inidual’s ability to clear SARS-CoV- and cause people to suffer worse outcomes. What are the side effects of the coronavirus vaccine   In February, around one in three people reported some kind of side effect from the vaccine, including some soreness around the area the needle penetrated the skin. Side effects are caused by the bodyaposs response to the vaccine and not the virus itself.Dr Anna Goodman of Guyaposs and St Thomasapos Hospital, in London, told the BBC that a heavier response to the vaccine does not mean you are more immune to the virus than others. She said: Because you have more fever, that doesnapost mean you are more immune. You canapost presume it to.

William and Kate released the photo on Friday afternoon with their three children and Charlotte quickly went viral as people saw the similarity to the Queen, even in the way she posed.The six-year-old was sat beside her father Prince William while her two brothers, Prince George, eight, and Prince Louis, three, were sitting nearer to their mum, reported OK! Unlike in previous years for Christmas photos the family were not dressed formally but had summer outfits on. “Delighted to share a new image of the family, which features on this year’s Christmas card,” wrote the Cambridges.  Princess Charlotte wore a blue gingham-patterned dress for the shoot and looked serene in front of the camera with her hands crossed in front of her and her long hair swept to the side. Fans quickly picked up on Charlotte looking a lot like her great grandmother, the Queen, and even had Her Majestyaposs typical pose.“What a handsome family. You can really see Queen Elizabeth in Princess Charlotte,” one person wrote on Twitter.“Charlotte is such cute princess, she is a the mini version of the Queen,” a second follower commented, while another added: “Charlotte is the image of the Queen. Adorable.”  The Mountbatten-Windsor family photo comes days after Kate hosted the charity carol event, Together at Christmas, held at Westminster Abbey in honour of those who have given their support to communities in need during the pandemic. It was a rare occasion where Kate was seen at a public event with the rest of her family including her parents and brother and sister. The Cambridgesapos kids were not at the event and a royal expert said they do not like to put them on ceremony at public occasions. The reality is that William and Kate have a rule that they do not take the children on any official engagements, said Duncan Larcombe about their absence at the carol event earlier this week. “It was on a school night and they are pretty strict. The children are in a rather strict regime so that might have been the reason, but the fact it was a televised official engagement shows that William and Kate are still reluctant to focus too greatly officially on their family and their children.

Elizabeth Astin, , and her husband, sourced materials, furniture and bargain decorations from the likes of Amazon, BM and The Range instead of paying professionals to do the legwork. The couple, from Birmingham, sourced wooden sleepers for their builder saving them £,.Their nephew fitted the electrics and they built a relaxing zen area using leftover supplies, , BirminghamLive reports. Elizabeth sourced bargain decorations and furniture from Amazon, BM and The Range.  She told money-saving community LatestDeals: We moved into our house as a new building  years ago. When we bought it, the agent told us that there was no back garden. What they meant was that there was a lower patio area with a huge retaining wall and a sloping upper area that was north facing. Not very attractive at all. Still, it stood us in good stead over the years. Our girls had water fights, we bought numerous bouncy castles, water slides and paddling pools and my husband and his dad made a decking for the adults to chill. We always wanted to improve it but it was for the kids. While they were young, it was more important for them to have a safe place to play. Now they are grown up, we wanted to finally tackle the garden and improve it. The first step was planning. It was dficult with the garden being on a slope. We realised we needed at least two levels or terraced areas to be able to have somewhere to entertain and relax. The back garden gets sun at the top of the garden all day long, she said, so the couple worked around it to make sure they maximised the sunshine.She added: Before starting on the makeover, I had spent a lot of time browsing the Facebook group ‘DIY on a budget gardens’.I learned a great deal and got lots of inspiration from group members. We were always mindful to try and keep costs down without compromising on quality and our dreams.  We saved up for all of this including replacing the iron railings with a lovely glass fence. It was a big project. The existing decking was built by my husband and father in law when we moved in two decades ago. This had to be pulled down and the areas levelled. We had a beautul clematis that sadly had to be pulled down too and that was done by my husband - it took him two days to do it. It was a complete makeover. We also had to pull down and replace an ugly iron fence on top of the large retaining wall. The couple paid a builder to do the landscaping, build the patios and replace concrete slabs with Indian stone, which took up the main budget. Elizabeth said: We had to get someone in to build the glass and steel fence as well as do parts of the project ourselves due to the nature of the makeover and the retaining wall. We had to ensure the wall could hold the new patio areas so we needed professional help. The building work was £k but we saved money by having the electrics fitted by our nephew who is an electrician. Also, we managed to reduce the price by using wooden railway sleepers rather than building retaining walls. The builder provided all the materials. We had an original quote for £k from another builder so by having the sleepers we saved approximately £k. The glass fence was £, and once that was installed, my husband used the leftover Indian stone and sleepers from the builder to create a little zen area. He built a bench and a space to put a relaxing water feature on. We also reused the old gray slabs from the original patio and laid them in the front garden, to build a little seating area. Part of this area included tub chairs we already had from Aldi, which we had bought the year before for £. I bought furnishings such as cushions and decorations from Amazon and BM. I probably spent around £ on these, again trying to source the best value for money.  The day bed was from The Range. I searched for the best price and got it for around £. The same bed on other websites were between £ and £ so I basically got it half price. I also wanted to arrange the plants to suit the new makeover. Most of them were already there before - I just replanted them. We did, however, buy a few more from a local garden center. They were very cheap - probably no more than £ for all of them. Now the project is finally done, it’s our safe haven. We managed to save thousands by combining professional work with DIY and my husband created an amazing little zen area that was previously barren. The garden is a sanctuary for us to relax in now. The only thing which didn’t go to plan was the installation of the furniture, as it took a while for it to arrive. If we had to do this project again we would order it well in advance as we only received the dining set this week. It’s now in the garage waiting for next year!’ Tom Church, Co-Founder of LatestDeals said: Elizabeth and her husband have managed to create a stunning garden that no doubt increases the value of their property, after waiting nearly two decades to complete the makeover. With dficult areas, sometimes getting a professional in is best - but as Elizabeth has proven, sourcing budget supplies and doing parts of the overall makeover yourself can save you thousands of pounds. I hope this garden lasts them many years to come.

IKEA bargainsRachel Green, , and her partner Max Butler, , didnt rate their plain cupboards and drab black worktop, so decided to completely transform it on the cheap by sourcing materials from Poundland, Ikea and BQA couple transformed their plain kitchen into a modern, minimalist cooking spaceByRyan FaheyNews Reporter:,  Dec | comments A bargain-hunting couple used smart DIY hacks and clever purchases to completely transform their kitchen into a rustic cooking space. Rachel Green, , and Max Butler, , slashed costs of revamping their brown cupboards and black worktop by hunting for bargains on BQ, Ikea and Facebook Marketplace. Taking it on as a lockdown project, the couple also scrolled through Pinterest to get their inspiration. During lockdown when we were house searching we had a lot more time on our hands, they told bargain site LatestDeals. So I spent hours on Instagram and Pinterest saving pictures of my favourite ideas and creating a mood board for each room.The kitchen had plain brown cupboards and black worktops, so we decided to create more of a monochrome feel with marble effect countertops and matching accessories. We did the whole project on a budget by sourcing items from BQ, IKEA and Facebook Marketplace. They found some of the items they needed at Homebase, including a roller set for £. and two tins of Maison Deco Refresh paint to cover the worktops, cupboards and splash-back. But to jazz it up, they painted their fittings gold. They said: To add a special touch we decided to make all the handles on the wardrobes and drawers gold. We did this by removing them all and spray painting them with a can from Amazon. It cost just £.. They protected the worktops with two rolls of self-adhesive film that they bought at BQ for £. They added: One addition we wanted for the kitchen was some shelves. One of our friends gave us the idea so we could get some cupboard space back, as well as have the ability to rescue some of our nicer ceramic pieces from the back of the cupboards. I’d also seen the idea of a shelf pantry all over Instagram and wanted to recreate it for myself. To find the materials, we searched Facebook Marketplace for people selling scaffolding wood for cheap and we managed to get them for £ a board.  Then we just sanded them slightly, keeping some of the roughness, as that was the look we were going for. We got the brackets off Etsy, and these turned out to be one of the most expensive purchases. We went for some rustic handcrafted brackets made from reclaimed timber and they were £. And they added to the rustic, homely feel by placing items, like an Asda casserole dish for £ and Poundland jars, on top of the wood. They said: Some of the other jars came from IKEA for the pasta, and they were £. each. While we were in IKEA we picked up some faux foliage for the shelves and the tops of the cupboards for around £, and a gold rail for additional wall storage for £. They used sugar soap to wash down the surfaces before sanding them down. By taking off the draw handles, they could spray them gold without causing a mess in the kitchen. They slapped two coats of paint on the skirting boards, ceiling and cupboards. They said: Overall it was very easy to do, it was just time consuming waiting for the paint to dry and hard to get to some of the cupboards to paint them. If we had to do it again, we would take the doors off to complete the job. We had tried to avoid doing this as we thought we might struggle to get them back on. However, it made it a lot harder to paint without getting inside the cupboards too.

Jane says: “I didn’t want to crush Neve’s dream by not posting the letter, even though I never thought we’d get a reply in a million years.  “Neve was ecstatic when she received a reply from Buckingham Palace. Her Majesty respectfully declined Neve’s invitation, which is perhaps inevitable since the day we were in London was Prince William’s wedding day!” I painted a picture of your favourite horse Shane Hagan felt so much affection for the Queen she felt compelled to send her a painting of her horse Sanction. The -year-old, from York, says she “absolutely loves” the monarch and wanted to give her something back after all she has done for our nation. She adds: “I took up painting after corrective eye surgery and, because I know the Queen loves horses, I painted one of her favourites and sent it along with a Christmas card. “I don’t think anyone imagines they’ll receive a letter back from the most famous woman in the world. “So when I received one, thanking me and encouraging me to continue painting, I was chuffed to bits. Now I’m a full-time artist.” Can you cover bus shelters  My mum is fussy about her hair In , nine-year-old Emma Parsons was so annoyed by mum Jeanette’s hairdo being ruined by rain as they stood at a bus stop she decided to do something. “I thought the Queen could sort this out,” she says. “So once I’d dried out at home, I wrote to Her Majesty to ask for help. I askedshe could put seats and roofs on all the bus stops, but to cover our one first. “My dad, Vince, said I’d never get a reply. Two weeks later none of us could believe our eyes when I received a letter from Buckingham Palace.”  The Queen’s lady-in-waiting explained “it is not within the Queen’s control”, but Emma, now , says: “Soon afterwards the bus stop, outside Cardf Castle, was modernised and I have taken full credit for that.” Civil servant Emma adds: “My parents weren’t sentimental, but that letter was kept and I still have it. My grandchildren are very impressed.” My daughter charmed the Queen with her story about the young Princess Elizabeth A teacher was so impressed by Lottie Trewick’s story of the Queen and Princess Margaret playing in the grounds of Buckingham Palace that she sent it to Her Majesty. And -year-old Lottie was thrilled to receive a reply.  Lottie’s mum Karen, from Winchester, Hants, says: “Lottie wrote the story during the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee in  and there was a lot of excitement about the Royal Family. “And she was doubly excited to receive a response.  “The letter says: ‘Her Majesty was pleased to see your charming tale about a mighty oak tree which, in your story, became a great fortress for Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret’. “We framed the letter.” Will you send my cat a th birthday card  When Rachel Thomas, of Barmouth in North Wales, heard that the Queen sends cards to those celebrating their th birthday she was keen to remind her not to forget a special centenarian: her cat. Rachel, now , says: “When I was , I realised my -year-old cat Sindy was  in cat years. “So I wrote to Her Majesty asking for a card for my cat. “Her reply said that the Queen can’t send a card to a cat.  “But I was so proud to get a letter from the Queen’s lady-in-waiting that I went around all the classes in my school to show off the letter I had received.” Iaposm worried about koalas Fearing for the impact on wildle during last year’s Australian bushfires, six-year-old Esme Robinson wrote to the Queen to express her concern. Shortly after sending it, the nation was plunged into lockdown and the Queen stayed at Windsor Castle.  Esme, of Herts, lost hope of receiving a reply to her letter sent to Buckingham Palace. A few weeks later she was stunned to receive a special letter franked with the royal stamp. Mum Suzi says: “It was a great moment of excitement at a time when we all had to stay at home.” Get well soon Nine-year-old Summer Wise was off school with Covid in October when she heard the Queen had spent the night in hospital. She wrote to wish her a speedy recovery. Her mum Natasha, of North West London, says: “Summer wrote in her neatest writing and decorated the envelope with stickers and drew a picture of Windsor Castle. Summer told Her Majesty she was also ill and asked her lots of questions.  “She was astounded when she received her reply from Windsor Castle containing a leaflet all about the Queen so she could find the answers to her questions. “We’ll keep the royal reply for ever.” Here’s a chocolate medal  some bunting Three-year-old India Grainger sent Her Majesty a chocolate medal and some bunting to celebrate her diamond jubilee in . Her mum, Hester, from Reading, Berks, says: “India dictated her letter to me and was very specic about what she wanted me to write. She was incredibly excited when we posted it but doubly so to receive a letter back.  “She said she was touched that India had given her a chocolate medal and some flags. And India was over the moon. “The framed letter hangs in our bathroom.” You are the best queen in the whole wide world Keen to bring a smile to the poorly Queen’s face, seven-year-old Chloe Elmer drew her gold and purple crown, her hats and a giant love heart. And in a letter adorned with more hearts and “I love you”, Chloe, of Basingstoke, Hants, wrote: “Dear your majesty, I hope you are fellingbetter. You are the best queen in the wholwide world.” Mum Elizabeth said: “Chloe really wanted Her Majesty to know she was in her thoughts. She even researched the Queen’s favourite colour for the hats. “A few weeks ago we had a letter from the Queen’s lady-in-waiting, thanking Chloe. She was completely shocked and had the biggest smile ever. She’s so proud to know Her Majesty took the time from running the country to write. “Chloe’s letter is a frame on display as a treasure.” We have a race horse you bred Knowing the Queen is passionate about horses, Louise Rowe wrote to give Her Majesty an update one she had bought from her in August . Louise, , from Dorking, Surrey, says: “I wanted to let the Queen know Otago, a horse she had bred, was really happy, doing well and making us proud.  He has won at Epsom twice and I said he had a home for le with us once his career ended. I was thrilled to receive a reply – she wished me well with Otago. The Queen’s letter and card will be treasured for ever.” We are related Student Cameron Holmes wrote to the Queen two years ago to tell Her Majesty: “We’re related.” Cameron, , from Malton, North Yorks, says: “A relative traced our family tree all the way back to the s and discovered that my th great grandfather was King James V of Scotland. I felt I had to let her know.  “Maybe I shouldn’t have been so surprised to receive a reply from Buckingham Palace – we are family, after all.” The letter, which sends Cameron’s family good wishes and includes a genealogical chart of the Kings and Queens of England, is now framed in Cameron’s home. Happy birthday Barnaby Hocking, seven, from Paignton, Devon, made the Queen a nd birthday card while doing art with his dad Dean.  Barnaby’s mum Victoria says: “The day the reply came, with the Buckingham Palace stamp, the postman ran up our drive – he was almost more excited than we were. “We didn’t expect to hear back. For the letter to be so personal means an awful lot. Barnaby was so proud he took his letter to school.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON The QueenBuckingham PalaceRoyal FamilyCivil servantsChristmas cards\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Boris Johnson has already introduced his Plan B which is unpopular by many members of his own Conservative Party and those in the business community where Christmas is a key period of the year.Ministers took part in a Cobra meeting on Friday where they looked at what steps can be taken to slow the spread of the Omicron iant, it is reported. Communities Secretary Michael Grove, who himself has tested positive, said that London and Scotland were hotspots and the situation was “deeply concerning”. The new data suggests that Omicron will now become dominant by as early as next week.  Last Christmas, London was badly hit by the Alpha iant and now a year on there is talk over whether similar restrictions to those in place then could be reimposed with all  boroughs having rising cases of Omicron. Data from the Department of Health shows that infections in London rose by .% in the week up to December  which was the quickest of England’s nine regions. There were . infections among , people tested which was the highest since last January. So far it has not been reflected in hospitalisations and deaths but the data typically lags behind by several weeks as it takes time for people to become seriously ill.  Mr Gove, reported the Daily Mail, said: The meeting Iaposve just chaired with first ministers of all the devolved administrations was presented with some very challenging new information.We know that we have the highest number of Covid infections across the UK recorded today since January . We know the Omicron iant is doubling every two to three days in England, and possibly even faster in Scotland. We know that % of reported cases in London are the Omicron iant and of course we only identied Omicron in this country a fortnight ago. On Friday, , new Covid infections and  deaths were reported in the UK within  days of a positive test. A further  Omicron infections were reported bringing the total to ,, according to the latest figures. In England,  additional Omicron cases were reported totalling , overall. One additional case of Omicron has been reported across Scotland which has  confirmed cases of the iant. In Wales, four further cases have been reported with the total number now standing at . No new cases have been reported across Northern Ireland where the number of infections currently remains at three.

Abdul Elahi posed as a rich stockbroker on Sugar Daddy websites before blackmailing his victims into performing degrading sexual acts. The -year-old then sold the footage to paedophiles around the world in packaged boxsets - which included young women abusing themselves, siblings and their children. From the sales of his material, he would then launder the money through Amazon gt cards and buy electrical goods to sell on for cash. In one single sale, the McDonaldaposs worker traded a terabyte of twisted images and footage - amounting to , hours of video and , photos. Some of Elahiaposs victims attempted suicide after he uploaded videos of them to porn websites even bragging: Pornhub are going to love this. The warped paedophile previously admitted  online sexual offences after he targeted nearly , victims in  countries between  and . Elahi was branded depraved, abhorrent and callous by a judge as he was jailed for  years with an extended license period of eight years. Sentencing at at Birmingham Crown Court, Judge Sarah Buckingham said: Your offending is prolic and involved at least  victims.  You showed a complete and utter disregard for the welfare of every victim you manipulated irrespective of their age and there was a sadistic element to your offending. Your distribution of images was on a vast scale and allowed you to make money which you then laundered. You used multiple fake online personas to encourage women to perform sexual acts. These were not porn stars bur real women who provided the images. You were sophisticated in your operation. You wiped imagery from your phone , you packaged up these products into boxsets to be sold. There are so many examples of your sadistic and degrading exploitation and blackmail of these women it would take days to cover it all again. Your demands increased in their viciousness and brutality and however much your victims pleaded for mercy you ignored their pleas. Even when they were driven to suicide you sneered in the face of their despair. In my judgement you do pose a signicant risk of members of the public. You are an extremely dangerous inidual. You were motivated by a feeling of power and control over women, you were attracted to the financial reward you could achieve. You were utterly devoid of any empathy and regret for the pain and suffering you inflicted. Whatever your claims you did this for money I am satisfied that you harbour sadistic and paedophilic characteristics and are aroused by the abuse of children along with the abuse of women. You derived pleasure from manipulating, humiliating and distressing your victims. You were totally unmoved by their pleas to be left alone. You were prepared to, and did, offend, You showed no insight or remorse and at the same time breathtaking arrogance. You will remain a danger for some years to come. You are an example of one of the very worst type of predatory offenders ever apprehended thus far. Elahi boasted about his jet-set lestyle and how he used private jets to fly to Los Angeles – in fact, he was living with his parents and working in McDonalds. Prosecutor Andrew Langdale had branded Elahi one of the most serious sexual predators online that has been seen before this court. He added: Elahi is in a league of his own. He taught others how to abuse women and children. “This is child abuse imagery he distributed we argue he is a dangerous predator. “Abuse against others was his full time occupation. Graham Arnold, defending, said: It may be something that means nothing to the victims but he wants me to express his deepest remorse. He pushed people to do depraved things at their own great cost. He is trying to look into himself to see why and it is a very dark place. The truth is that he is struggling to find any light but all I can say on his behalf is that he is trying. Appearing alongside Elahi in the dock was Kirsty Nicholls, , who previously pleaded guilty to two charges of sexual assault of a child and one of making an indecent photo. After Elahiaposs arrest in July , officers from the NCA, the FBI, and Australian and New Zealand police found phone messages between the pair.  Elahi requested that Nicholls abused a young boy, to which she was entirely compliant and even made suggestions on how to carry out the abuse Nicholls, of Northolt, Middlesex, was jailed for six years and nine months today. Judge Buckinghamshire said: It was through Sugar Daddy websites that you encountered Elahi, the very worst type of man. One who used, manipulated and blackmailed vulnerable women to get what he wanted. The dference between you and his victims was that you were willing to do as he asked. You are intelligent and aware what you were doing was horribly wrong and in your own words sick. You became immersed in a sexualised world and became caught up in the world of online sex work without any thought of the implications.

It was reported that Meghan bought the Queen a singing hamster, which led the monarch to burst out laughing, remarking: It can keep my dogs company. Meanwhile, not only did Meghan impress the Queen during her first Christmas at Sandringham, she also impressed her future brother-in-law, Prince William, with her gt choices.  According to the biography Finding Freedom, she nailed his gt - a spoon with the words aposCereal Killerapos on it. The authors wrote: Meghanaposs biggest challenge was finding the perfect novelty gts to amuse her new extended family. At least one of her gts was a huge hit—a spoon for William that had aposcereal killerapos embossed on the shallow bowl end of the utensil.

Like Meghan, the Duchess of Cambridge was no doubt similarly nervous to Meghan when she spent her first Christmas at Sandringham in . However, rather than hitting the High Street or furiously searching online for a gt for the Queen, Kate came up with an idea for a more personal homemade present - and it appears it went down very well with Her Majesty. Speaking in a documentary to mark the Queenaposs th birthday, Kate revealed what the thoughtful gt was. She explained: I can remember being at Sandringham, for the first time, at Christmas. And I was worried what to give the Queen as her Christmas present. I thought back to what I would give my own grandparents. And I thought, aposIaposll make her something,apos which could have gone horribly wrong. But I decided to make my grannyaposs recipe for chutney. I was slightly worried about it, but I noticed the next day that it was on the table. “I think such a simple gesture went such a long way for me and Iaposve noticed since sheaposs done that on lots of occasions and I think it just shows her thoughtfulness, really, and her care in looking after everybody.

Whether it’s the Christmas work do, a dinner party with friends or a pre-th present swap there’s bound to be lots of merry events. And, unless you’re tee-total you’re probably going to have a tipple or two . But, as we know, alcohol can affect our health in a number of ways – not least including the damage to your liver. If you do want to have a drink over the Christmas period, we’ve spoken to doctors and experts to find out the best options.  Canapost see the sign-up box  Click here. And, it seems mulled wine is a winner.Hussein Abdeh, Clinical Director and Superintendent Pharmacist at Medicine Direct, said: “When it comes to Christmas time, there aren’t many more festive drinks than mulled wine, but did you know that it also has a number of evidence-based health benefits.“Mulled wine is made from red wine, which is known to contain compounds called polyphenols. These compounds are loaded with antioxidants that aid in keeping your blood vessels flexible, which helps the heart to pump blood around the body more easily. “This reduces the risk of clotting and helps to take some strain off the heart. Furthermore, polyphenols help to keep HDLin your blood. “The cinnamon contained in mulled wine is also packed with antioxidants which can help with the physical signs of ageing by reducing oxidative stress in the body.“Cinnamon is also an effective anti-inflammatory and can help to reduce the risk of inflammatory conditions such as Arthritis and IBS Irritable bowel syndrome . This spice can help to reduce levels of ‘bad’ cholesterol while keeping the good cholesterol at a stable level.“The cloves in red wine are able to control your blood sugar levels, which is a serious health benefit as prolonged s of time with high blood sugar can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.”Experts over at Optibac Probiotics added: “Drink vegan red wine. The presence of plant polyphenols in vegan red wine is believed to be particularly signicant: polyphenols have been shown to have numerous health benefits, thought to be due to their ‘prebiotic’ properties.“And, vegan guts will be grateful for the higher intake of healthy plant nutrients! The good news is that vegan red wine is a great source of polyphenols!” Soyou’re looking for a tipple with health benefits then vegan mulled wine could be for you.It should be noted that mulled wine can be high in calories and soyouaposre looking for a lower-calorie alternative opt for light spirits like vodka with low-calorie mixers or even an alcoholic spritzer like Two Brooks which has  calories a can. However, it’s important to note that alcohol is still never healthy. The NHS advises drinking no more than  units of alcohol per week. If you are worried about your drinking or find it dficult to stop then head to drinkaware for further resources or contact your GP for advice and support.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON AlcoholChristmas party\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The prime minister gave the go ahead for the parties although there has been advice that people should be tested. Johnson said: We donapost want nativity plays to be cancelled. We think thataposs okay. Currently on what we can see, keep going with Christmas parties but obviously everybody should exercise caution.

Ian Wileman, , said that his huge collection helped pick him up after losing his beautul primary school teacher we, Michelle. He was forced to make the heart-breaking decision to end le support for his best friend Michelle, .Michelle died after a combination of the influenza virus and scarlet fever led to her contracting sepsis in March, .Ian has collected spiders since he was , but found himself struggling to look after them following the tragedy.Ian told the Liverpool Echo : When I was really not good, shortly after Michelle died, I actually went in the room and found a couple of them had died because Iaposd forgot to water them.I was really gutted, because obviously I wasnapost in a great place, and then losing a couple of animals because I hadnapost gone in and watered them properly, I just felt really guilty.I was in a situation where I thought, aposIaposve got to move them onapos. Five months later, he drove his son Billy to the pet shop so they could match their male with someone aposs female for breeding. But Billy realised this meant the end of their spider collection Ian said: On the way home, Bill was - at the time, he was eight or nine - and he was really upset that there were going to be no more spiders.  So I said, aposOh, weaposll get a couple moreapos. The eight-legged friends have been a huge part of Ianaposs le for decades and without them, he may never have met his we. In his early s, Ian was an iconic animal man who visited schools with spiders and the other animals he had at the time, taking his collection as far as Halax, West Yorkshire. A visit to a primary school in Speke, near Liverpool also planted the thought of going into teaching.  The teachers there just kept saying, aposYouaposve got an aptitude with these kids. The kids love you. Wouldnapost you think about doing it full time  Ian met Michelle in  while they were both training to be teachers at university. On their first date, he jokingly told Michelle he would marry her. He said: She was a beautul, lovely, caring woman. She was everything to me, we were best friends. When she died in March , Ian promised Michelle that he would raise their then-eight-year-old son Billy to be a man with good morals and ethics.  We spent quite a long time on our knees. Le was pretty dire for quite a long time. But these animals kind of give you something , you know, youaposve got , lives in that room that need you to keep them alive. He added: Itaposs a big part of my le. I donapost know what Iaposd doIaposd never had them. Ian also shares his hobby with his son Billy. Around  spiders in his collection of , across belong to Billy, who bought them with his own pocket money. Ian said: Heaposs really, really keen on it.  Itaposs a big part of his le now as well, which shows in the fact that heaposs buying his own and growing his own. I donapost go near it. The spiders heaposs bought out of his pocket money are his. I have nothing to do with them. He looks after them. He feeds them. He waters them. He pots them on when they need potting on. Itaposs down to him to do that. They keep their collection in a room heated between  and  degrees celsius. Both spend hours watching them and looking out for signs that they need feeding, or are shedding their skin, or are ready for breeding. He said: They all have absolutely incredible markings on them. Itaposs like keeping little works of art. They are absolutely amazing things.  He finds it infuriating spiders are portrayed as scary creatures when they are amazing and beautul and worthy of protection. The worst species of spider out there that youaposre allowed to keep, Iaposve got  of them in this house, he said. And theyaposve got medically signicant venom, sothey bit you, itaposs going to hurt, youaposre going to be in pain. Nobody has ever, in the whole history of mankind, been killed by a tarantula bite. Ian added: Thereaposs no reason for anyone to say negative things about them. There are enough people scared of them.

Her daughteraposs request for help was the last time she spoke to her. The mum explained: “They worked on her for a long time. They told me in the hospital that normally they only work on a case like this for twenty minutes, but that they had worked on her for two and a half hours, so I knew they had done everything they possibly could to save her.” And Michelle said that the family are now determined to honour Aimeeaposs memory - starting a fundraiser for two important charities, with over €, raised so far.

Sue Radford, who has  children with her husband Noel, organised a breakfast to welcome Santa’s elves to their huge -bedroom home in Morecambe, Lancashire.Sue and Noel, , are parents to Chris, , Sophie, , Chloe, , Jack, , Daniel, , Luke, , Millie, , Katie, , James, , Ellie, , Aimee, , Josh, , Max, , Tillie, , Oscar, , Casper, nine, Hallie, six, Phoebe, five, Archie, four, Bonnie, three, and Heidie, one.Sue frequently chronicles the lives of her hefty brood on Instagram and Youtube.In a video shared to the family’s popular YouTube channel, Sue says good morning to her viewers as well as wishing them a “happy first of December”. She turns the camera around to show that one of her younger children is up early with her, dressed in sweet Christmas pyjamas and putting the finishing touches on a huge tree.Sue proceeds to move through the children’s bedrooms, waking them up for them to move out, bleary eyed, to a dining table laden with Christmas cheer.There are stacks of advent calendars - a dferent one for each child - as well as Christmas crackers, plates piled with pancakes, fruit and chocolate croissants, and chocolate santas. In the middle of the table, three toy elves were sitting on a sleigh, which had a balloon attached to it reading: “Special elf delivery to: The Radfords, From: Santa”. As the kids filter into the Radford’s dining room, chaos ensues. While a couple of the kids seem to have tunnel vision for the candy canes laid on the table, most of them are fixated on the fact Santa has brought three elves with him, one more than in previous years. One of the older children asked: “Who wants to name it ”, which led to the younger children all shouting out suggestions. Eventually, the clan decided on the name “Sprinkles”.  The kids get stuck into their choccy milk, Christmas crackers and their breakfast, while Sue moves around the table handing out their respective advent calendars, which appear to be tailored to each child’s taste. They range from a Body Shop advent calendar for one of the older girls, to a gourmet truffle advent calendar for Sue and Noel to share. Eventually Sue moves away from videoing the joy around the breakfast table to do a one-on-one chat with the camera about what  had been going on that morning. In a segment occasionally interrupted by a crying child and a pooch beside her on the couch, she talks about one of the kids’ PE days as well as a panic over not being able to find Hallie and Phoebe’s school trousers.  With the older kids having left for school, Sue then moves around the home showing some more festive scenes, including a Santa sack for each of her children, hanging across a fire place. Sue and Noel Radford have previously said they are proud of the fact that they keep their family going without relying on benefits. Instead, the stars of the Channel  series  Kids and Counting look after their whopping clan with the proceeds from their pie shop and YouTube channel. The sheer logistical enormity of running the Radford family has made them popular and captivating watching. Recently Sue showed off her home after she and her partner Noel put trees up in their living room, kitchen and on their front porch to feel the festive spirit. She wrote on Instagram : “Christmas has landed in the Radford house.”For previous Christmas celebrations, each Radford child has around £-£ spent on them, costing their parents over £, in gts. To make sure there are no mix-ups on the day, Sue has bought each of them a personalised sack to keep them all in. Sue hand wraps each gt she buys and it has previously been reported she can wrap around  presents every  minutes. She and Noel get through around  rolls of wrapping paper each year to cater for their massive brood. The Radfords have Christmas food to budget for too, with just the festive food costing another £. Britainaposs largest family recently welcomed a brand-new addition to their already huge family, as Sue announced that her eldest son Chris has become a father for the third time. Sue and Noel recently claimed that they have spent more than £ million raising their  children.

The store in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, surprised the schoolboy with his own navy Aldi unorm and Rupert, Store Assistant name badge, when he visited them. He was then shown around the store and warehouse before helping to recycle Aldi packaging. An excited Rupert was then even shown how to work the tills. In an adorable video, the youngster can be seen rearranging cans in one of the aisles and removing empty packaging. At the end of his sht, he was awarded a star customer service badge by one of the managers.Kirsty posted adorable pictures of Rupert during his visit on Facebook later on that day , writing: When your five-year old gets a job at Aldi.The post received over , likes and over  comments.

Loralie Henry, , has spent more than half of her le in foster care in Los Angeles, Calornia, in the US. She was first put into foster care when she was four before briefly going back to her biological mum and ing to the system aged six. Loralie said: It was actually really scary, too. I didnapost know what to expect in other homes or what they would feed me. I didnapost really know what to do. So I thought, aposWell, what should I do  Is there anyone waiting for me apos I was really scared. Until I met my mom. My second-grade teacher.  Zoe Henry is a teacher and didnapost have any plans to adopt. The single mum says the moment she saw Loralie two years ago she knew she wanted to adopt her.She added to KABC : She came into my class, and I just took one look at her - her little freckles, her little birthmark.I am going to adopt this little girl. Sheaposs my daughter. The minute I set eyes on her.  Zoe thought the little girl would get adopted by another family, but when that didnapost happen she begged social workers to let her adopt. Loralie went to Zoeaposs house two days later. The schoolgirl said: I remember the moment when we were sitting by the car, sheaposs like, aposYouaposre going to come with me.apos I was so surprised and happy. It was like an early present.  Zoe said Loralie has a lot of obstacles but now she is a brave and strong little girl. She added: She is probably the most compassionate person I know. She wants to be a foster mom someday and adopt kids. On November , which is National Adoption Day in the US, Loralie and  other kids were officially adopted by their forever families.  Zoe added: Biological parents have the right to contest. That did not happen. I know her mom really loves her. I know she really wanted to be a better part of her le. But like I tell Loralie, her mom loved her so much that she would let her be adopted so that I can give her what she needed.Matilda is a  American film based on the  Ronald Dahlaposs novel with the same.The young girl has psychokinetic abilities and comes from a disruptive family.During the film, Matilda forms a close bond with her teacher Honey - who goes on to adopt her at the end.

The teens vanished after leaving Fosteraposs home and their whereabouts have been unknown since. But police in Sparta, White County, confirmed the YouTuberaposs discovery matched the car driven by the teens. Mr Sides shared a video on his YouTube channel aposExploring with Nugapos and said he was lost for words when he found the car.  He said: When I saw two teens went missing and vanished in a car, that really stood out to me. When I looked at the town where they were last seen, I saw that a big river ran through it. That just told me to go. The YouTuberaposs first search was unsuccessful, according to reports. But it all changed after one of the manaposs videos was brought to the attention of White County Sherf Steve Page, who then contacted him to suggest looking at a dferent location along the Calfkiller River.  In a video published at the end of November, Mr Sides described the moment he found a car underwater. He said: Whoa, oh OK, thataposs % a car in front of my face. Iaposve been looking all day, and I finally found a car. The police said officers rushed to the scene as soon as Mr Sides called them, and following an investigation, they confirmed the vehicle matched the one driven by the missing teenagers. Mr Sides said the discovery was overwhelming and, even though he was glad that it could bring closure to the teensapos families, he was sad as it meant they had lost their lives. He added: They have been underwater for  years and no one can come and find them is a very sad situation. We observed that all the windows of the vehicle were open.  Probably the young person driving the vehicle, he lost control of the steering wheel and caused the car to fall into the river. Authorities said the remains located in the car have yet to be officially identied and information will be released in due course. Details of how the car ended up in the river are unclear, but officers think the pair lost control of the car and went into the water as there was no guard rail along the road in . Major John Meadows, the lead investigator in the case, said the teens were his classmates, adding it was humbling to be able to help their families find an answer to their mysterious disappearance. Sherf Page told The Washington Post : We have gone in wells, dug up areas, we have used ground-penetrating equipment looking for bodies.[But] it was right under our noses the whole time. … It’s heart-wrenching to know it was that simple, and it was made that hard because of all the rumours and horror stories through the years. The pairaposs disappearance sparked several theories around Tennessee, with some people suggesting they were murdered, while others claimed they had run away to another state. Following the discovery, Sherf page added: I made a promise to the [Foster] family that as long as I was Sherf I’d be looking for these two kids. I did. I have. Mr Betchelaposs father Ronnie said the discovery of the car made him feel like he had lost his son all over again, adding: It just shattered my heart again. We always kind of thought through the years that something happened, but I just didn’t know what. Mr Sides said: I was very humbled that I could just help out. I would like to think the police did what they could. But this one just slipped through the cracks.

Fteen-month-old dachshund Nala followed her heart and managed to squeeze her way through a narrow gap in the gate. She also maneuvered her way over a large cardboard barrier that was there to make it extra dficult. The loyal puppy wanted to find owner Kiera Vernon, , who was upstairs at the time. Meanwhile, Kiera’s mum, Denise Vernon, caught the puppy in the act and captured it on video. It wasnapost the first time the Vernon family, from Wallasey in Wirral, Merseyside, spotted Nala making bold acrobatic moves. As an attempt to protect her back and stop her climbing, Denise put the strip of cardboard as an barrier and hoped that it would stop her.  But the skilled puppy can climb fairly high for her small size, and is willing to give any challenge a go. Denise, , said: “Nala just wants to be upstairs with my daughter Kiera, and tries everything to get up to see her. She loves Kiera to bits and won’t leave her side whenever she’s at home.” In the video, Nala can be seen pushing her back legs in an attempt to get over the cardboard. With a few kicks she gets over to the other side and takes no hesitation in rushing upstairs to Kiera.  Denise was worried that the amount of climbing would damage her back. Luckily there is an even bigger strip of cardboard put in place to keep Nala downstairs now, which seems to have stopped the sneaky pup’s antics – at least for the time being. For Simba, who also watched Nala’s escape act, and the other family dog, Reggie, there was no hope of them getting upstairs. The TeamDogs Christmas Gt Guide, sponsored by Keep Wales Tidy, is packed with more than  treats, toys, gadgets and garments to make every dog’s tail wag with holly jolly joy on December . Weaposve tried and tested many of the gts on our own TeamDogs friends so you can ensure they’re worth placing under the tree for your most special member of the family. To download our Christmas Gt Guide for free simply subscribe to the TeamDogs newsletter. Denise said: “We got this gate made to measure as Simba could jump normal baby gates. But I was amazed at Nala. We just want to protect her back. “I see little cute sausage stoppers for the bottom of stairs that everyone seems to rave about, but Nala would easily find a way of getting up the stairs.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON TeamDogsBabiesDogs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The graveyard was established back in  making his discovery feel even creepier.He shared the video to TikTok and got over  thousand likes from users who were seriously intrigued by the discovery.The man, named Tarpit, said: “Yikes, look what I found, they felled this tree in the graveyard and I’m here picking up sticks and chips to burn in my kiln. “This is the oldest graveyard in L.A, what is this  We’re opening it right now.” Tarpit focused the camera onto the small box which appeared to be tied up, containing something wrapped up inside. He continued: “It’s all wrapped up, is that a mummy ” after prodding the mysterious object with a small stick. The small figurine-type object appears to be bound with thread or string, and looks like it has been burnt. Tarpit said: “Okay I have seen what I needed to see. Itaposs something tiny all wrapped up in string. And weaposre going to put it back to rest, donapost you think  Many TikTok users have dferent theories as to what this object might be, with one user even claiming it could be a fetus. One user commented: “People used to do that with babies that were miscarried. They would bind them and stick them in trees. Pretty sure that is what you found.” But others had dferent theories as to what it is, with one user claiming that Tarpit had just opened ‘black magic’. It’s safe to say that the internet was pretty creeped out, with many people warning the man about even touching the object. Some were pretty peeved at Tarpit for touching and moving the object, so much so that he felt the need to make a part  video. In the second part, he reburies the object properly out of respect, just in case the ‘mummy’ is an actual person. He said: “On the off chance that there is a person in there, which is not my bet, we’re going to rebury it better.” He concluded: “If it gets exposed again, I’ve bought string and superglue and we’re going to find a nice spot for it. “I’m not going to go and exhume it again, on the off chance that it is human remains I will keep an eye on it.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Dignity Funerals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The task is already dficult enough when those taking part don’t know each other well, often choosing bubble bath and wine as a last resort. Mathematician Dr. Hannah Fry discusses the many mathematical issues that may occur during Secret Santa in a video by Numberphile. From anonymity violations to derangements, it turns out there’s a fair bit of maths behind the festive fun. She said: “There are fundamental things that you need for the perfect Secret Santa, one is total anonymity and two is that everyone should have an equal probability of being selected. According to Dr. Hannah Fry, the normal way of organising Secret Santa by selecting names out of a hat, fails on both fronts. She explains: “Everybody writes their own name on a piece of paper and drops it into a bowl in the middle.  “That bowl is passed around the table and people pick up names, butthey pull out their own name, they read it and put it back. “By doing that,the last person picks out their own name, how do you solve it without violating the rule of anonymity ” In a nutshell, the last Secret Santa member wouldn’t be able to swap with anyone  without finding out who was buying them a present. Hannah continued: “If you have  people sat round a table, there’s a four per cent chance of them choosing their own name. “It all depends on where you’re sitting around that table, which is where you’re looking for a derangement.” A derangement is defined as ‘a permutation of the elements of a set’, and in this case, will ensure no one picks their own name. Hannah explains: “Say you’ve got three people, A, B and C, say there are six ways that this can be reordered, there are only two extra permutations that could work for Secret Santa.  “The problem is,they’re sitting around a table in order ABC, someone is bound to pick their own name.” So, how exactly does Secret Santa worksomeone is bound to pick their own name  It’s all down to the order in which you’re sat at the table, according to maths-whizz, Fry. She continues: “Say A picks first, B picks second and C goes third. If A picks up their own name they’re going to replace it. “They can only pick two things, B or C. If A picks B, now it’s B’s go, so it’s not going to be an issue for B. “However,A has picked B, and B has picked A, there’s only one person for C to pick, and it’s themselves!” As a solution, everyone involved could wait until the end until they look at who they’ve got and start againthey pick themselves. But according to Hannah, this technique has a  per cent chance of failing and a five per cent of failing more than three times in a row.She added: “At this point, everybody is probably going to be less keen to buy each other presents and want to call it a day. Don’t worry too much though, as there is a solution that’s bound to give you the ‘perfect’ Secret Santa.  Hannah explains: “You create a series of cards that are split in two, at the top of the card you write “you are number ” and on the bottom you write “you are buying for number . “You do this for each person, lay them on a table, shuffle them around and go along with a pair of scissors and cut the cards in two. “At that point, you can create your derangement just by shting the top half of the cards along by one. By doing this, you will guarantee that the top number will not match the bottom number. She concludes: “Everybody will pick up a brand new top and bottom half, then you write a list of all of the numbers in the office and everybody can fill in what number they are. “They now have no idea who anyone  is buying for.” This calculation means that everybody will have an equal chance of buying for everybody . Alternatively, you could make le a lot easier and get it sorted online with a random generator - but we’ll let you decide.

Landlord, Rob Allcock, said he couldnapost stop watching it.Since posting the video on Twitter, many people have hypothesised that something must have fallen on top of the glass,Dorset Live reports.But Rob said this wasn’t possible . “Itaposs a single glass - theyaposre not touching and this is a toughened Guinness glass with the bottom blown out of it,” he said.  The glass was placed upside down, Rob explained, on a hygienic drip mat with a gap underneath to allow the glass to dry. Thereaposs no way anything could have hit it. According to Rob, the toughened glass at the bottom, which is not supposed to shatter, burst as though”someone had crushed it from the top”. Itaposs just really odd and you can see from my weaposs reaction, sheaposs pretty freaked out, he added. The Longs Arms pub is no stranger to paranormal activity although nothing of this nature had ever occurred before. Husband and we Rob and Liz have run The Longs Arms in South Wraxall for  years, becoming custodians near-on four years ago.  In that time a number of phantoms have presented themselves to regulars, visitors, customers and the owners, according to Rob. He recounts scenarios where children have been seen sitting with customers, eating dinner.When a customer goes to leave, theyaposd say to Rob: Wasnapost that little boy really well behaved  And heaposd explain there were just two adults sitting there, with no children. People have been pushed into the toilets from the back of their heads, while others have seen men in the garden, picking apples up. Things around the pub have been known to move around, but no glass has ever spontaneously burst before. Normally, you see things and then you look back and thereaposs no one there. Iaposll be walking through to the kitchen, which has a door that opens both ways, and it will open assomeone is on the other side, pulling it - you get used to things like that,” Rob said.  Most famously is the little black and white dog, that has been seen so vividly by all people and children alike that they actually attempt to pick him up, and kids chase him round the tables, even though thereaposs nothing there. Rob explained that when he reveals to people that the dog isnapost there, they get quite freaked out. Theyaposve seen it, and you canapost argue with someone once theyaposve seen it, he added. He added: Growing up in pubs in Liverpool, my mum always used to tell me, donapost be afraid of the ghostly things you see, be scared of the living. Iaposve always kept that with me - what are they going to do  Itaposs not a horror film, itaposs just what it is. I canapost explain it, I just donapost feel like theyaposre going to harm us. Although over the years, loads of people have told Rob and Liz, they ought to get a ghost hunter in, Rob says no way. We might see things, hear things, feel things, but itaposs all good - I donapost want to start upsetting anything - Iaposd rather just let things be. It is hypothesised that The Longs Arms dates back to the th century, however, it is not exactly known - although it is clear that the building has been an inn since . The Allcocks are the only other family after the Longs that have owned the pub in  years.

Most notably sheaposs gone viral for revealing some of the most jaw-dropping deathbed confessions she claims to have ever heard while working, which include murder, kidnapping and leading a double le.Unsurprisingly some of the confessions are downright terrying and Nurse JJ has said she wishes some people had taken their secrets to the grave instead of telling her as she now has to live with it.

Similarly, another user reportedly told her how they had been stealing money from their blind friend. A sixth admitted to having two families and shared that they were worried about who would turn up to the funeral. After sharing the first  confessions, Nurse JJ answered some questions on TikTok about them and where they came from as several of her followers had begun to question whether or not they were real. She said: This is a really common question, so thank you for asking it. I appreciate that. All  of the confessions that I posted are things that patients have told me, I canapost speak to their origin, whether they came from a place of hospital delirium, or truth, or anger.

People in the comments were ided over the confessions, with some fascinated by them but others upset for the nurse as it was unfair to put that on her.

It uses antibodies extracted from ostrich eggs from birds that have been injected with an inactive, non-threatening form of Covid.  Ostriches are capable of producing dferent antibodies neutralising foreign entities in the body. By spraying the antibodies on a filter from a mask, the reaction can detect whether the virus is present. President Tsukamoto and the group explained that they experimented over ten days with  Covid patients. They found that the masks they wore glowed under UV light.  The researchers said: The ostrich antibody for corona placed on the mouth filter of the mask captures the coronavirus in coughing, sneezing, and water. aposaposNext, a fluorescent dye-labelled ostrich antibody is reacted and the virus is visualised by irradiating with light. We also succeeded in visualising the virus antigen on the ostrich antibody-carrying filter when using the LED ultraviolet black light and the LED light of the smartphone as the light source.  This makes it easy to use on the mask even at home. Visualisation of the illness is possible. The presence of the virus can also be confirmed from the ostrich antibody-carrying mask used by a person infected with the new coronavirus for eight hours. There are plans to sell inspection kits to the general public in Japan and further afield, potentially even this year, once a patent has been secured for the technology.

It would almost be better to have a regulation and a furlough scheme.#Sharing doubts over what number of people and what premises they attended actually constituted a #party#, he added: #Given that it#s best according to the authorities to avoid party situations then from a business point of view, we need support.#We need some clarity followed by some support.#The BID chairman#s comments came as leaders of all four UK nations are set to meet to discuss the rising levels of the new Omicron iant of COVID-. Earlier this afternoon, Ms Sturgeon warned that “dficult decisions” might have to be made in “days to come” amid this “surge”. Aware of the potential economic and social impact that further pandemic restrictions might have, she said that a lot would depend onfinancial aid could be agreed with the UK treasury.In the wake of this announcement and in the anticipation of further developments in the coming days, both Orkney Islands Counciland NHS Orkney have said they are prepared to respond to any new or righter restrictions which may be announced.Asked to respond to the First Minister#s announcement, an OIC spokeswoman said:  #The council is continually assessing its response to the pandemic and holds fortnightly incident management team meetings.#It was highlighted in this morning#s meeting that more announcements were likely to be coming from the First Minister.#Now that these announcements have been made this afternoon, they will be considered by officers, including our Safety  Resilience team and where necessary urgent matters will be escalated to the Incident Management Team or Senior Management Team as required, to ensure that that the council continues to support the response to the pandemic quickly and effectively.#The situation is of course fast moving and members of the public should expect further updates in due course —  but meantime we urge all to take very regular lateral flow device tests and to follow the guidance in respect to hand hygiene, face coverings and social distancing.#In a joint statement, NHS Orkney#s chief executive Michael Dickson and director of public health Louise Wilson explained that the guidance around parties has already been in force within their staff since November.They said: #The rapidly changing national picture is to be expected as we begin to understand the Omicron iant.#The guidance issued last night by Public Health Scotland regarding deferring Christmas parties was already in place here at NHS Orkney, we asked all our staff to show caution around Christmas events and to consider alternatives to reduce risk in early November.#Additionally, we have reminded all staff to work from home wherever possible and of course we are all continuing with our regular lateral flow tests and have all mitigations in place.#As the First Minister stated “our best form of defence is vaccinations”, we’d encourage anyone who is yet to be vaccinated to get in touch with ourselves, you can do this by calling   . We are well underway with our vaccination boosters and aim to have all booster vaccines administered by the middle of January with all appointment letters out before Christmas.#From tomorrowall household contacts of confirmed cases, Omicron or not, need to isolate for  days regardless of vaccination status or a negative PCR result. Non-household contacts can end isolation after receiving a negative PCR resultdouble vaccinated and have no symptoms.#These changes to isolation for household contacts of COVID- will have an impact across the community, and NHS Orkney has robust business continuity plans to help us deliver our key services.

As such, it is urging people to defer such parties at this time.In a statement issued this evening, Dr Nick Phin, Public Health Scotland#s director of public health science and medical director, said: “There is much that we still need to learn about Omicron, but early evidence suggests that this new COVID iant is much more transmissible.#The impact of this transmissibility has been seen in recent weeks, with a number of Omicron outbreaks linked to parties.“We still need to learn more about the severity of disease caused by Omicron and the effectiveness of vaccines, but there are important things that we can do to help protect ourselves and our families now. To help minimise the further spread of COVID-, and Omicron in particular, I would strongly urge people to defer their Christmas parties to another time.“I appreciate that everyone is keen to celebrate this festive season, particularly after the pressures of the last twenty months, but by postponing some plans we can all do our bit to protect ourselves and our loved ones.”Public Health Scotland has also issued a reminder of the other measures we can all take to continue to keep safe over the festive period:copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

There were no help groups, no mental health care, back then.“We went to my grannys to live for a while and then we came back to the house, the three of us, and that was it. It was a case of paddle your own canoe, really.“My dads going out to work every day as a painter and decorator and we were two young boys going out to school.“Its really just about capturing that time and the values he taught us as kids without ever really knowing he was doing it - or us realising what he was doing. The behaviours, we just kinda copied him.“Thats what I realised as I started to right this thing, that this is what it was...”Ironically, it was his grand daughters prompting that convinced him to put pen to paper in the first place.“About a year ago, my eldest grand daughter said to me - grandad, remember all the old stories you used to tell us when we were kids, about our grandad, racing the pigeons. She told me one of them, almost word for word. I thought, I really must capture those for posterity, for the family. RETIREMENT “Obviously, when retirement and lockdown came into play I had a lot more time on my hands so I sat down at the laptop to fiddle about and to write these wee stories.“As I started, this thing just took on a le of its own and became something completely dferent which was kind of a surprise to me, but a very pleasant surprise, as I really enjoyed writing it.”And I really enjoyed reading it, this simple tale of a hard-working father and his two sons making their way in the world.But the real stars of the book are the pigeons to whom Frankie cleverly lends human traits, such as the ability to talk - characters like Proud Boy, Warhorse and Bootsy.And, of course, Princess Sofia, who we come to learn resembles Frankie’s own mother.The trials and tribulations of the loft in attempting to win the biggest prizes in the sport resemble the struggles faced by Frankie’s family in an era when times were tough.But this isn’t a depressing tale rather, it is an uplting story of how families and, by extension, close-knit communities bandied together to overcome adversity. With a healthy dose of pigeon racing nostalgia thrown in for good measure.“Whilst some of the pigeon names and details have been changed the book is based on true le events,” continues Frankie.“It was never my intention to get the book published, I only started writing it as something to give the grandkids. “I really dont care about the business side of things – its just nice that people can read about my father.“I suppose people are quite surprised about the book but there’s more interest there than anything which is great.“Depending on the feedback who knows, there might even be a second one.”‘The Penzance Smash,’ published by Austin McAuley is out now."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1639060616576.jpg--covid_19___thu_9th_december_figures.jpg?1639060617000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20211209newscovid 19 thu 9th december figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows four further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.

She said: “Before I was married I attended West Church where I helped in Sunday School, was a GB Officer and Youth Club leader, playing in the Praise Band.”Now a member of Tamlaght O’Crilly Upper Parish Church, Melissa plays piano there every Sunday.She was very active in Glarryford Young Farmers, participating in all competitions - even stock judging - and the highlight was helping to produce the ‘Arts Festival.” She has performed in the Ulster Hall, Millennium Forum and The Waterfront HallA great believer in contributing to the community, Melissa currently leads Tamlaght O’Crilly Community Choir and involved in fundraising for local charities.She said: “Music has opened many doors for me. I started learning the trumpet in P and at secondary school mastered the piano. Ive been involved in the EA Orchestra, Ulster Youth Choir, Ulster Youth Orchestra, Carnlea Accordion Band and Tamlaghtmore Silver Band.”Since taking over as Principal on November  this year, she has been “overwhelmed by the kind welcome she has received from pupils, parents and staff.She said: “I have invested my own children’s education into Kilrea Primary School and now I am delighted to do my part for the school.“I have always been so impressed by the family ethos in Kilrea. Children are welcomed into school like a member of the family.“Staff go above and beyond in their care, teaching and learning. Parents are extremely gracious with their support, time and energy.

Credit: Liam McBurneyGarrett HarganTwitterEmailDecember   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailHEALTHChange in health and social care can often prove dficult and controversial and politicians have been criticised for being parochial by shirking tough decisions.Yesterday a health budget was announced of £bn over the next three years. Dr Tom Black, chair of BMA’s Northern Ireland Council, said he would urge that any agreed budget allocation for the Department of Health is used to prioritise the transformation of health and social care services.That includes: a fully-financed workforce planning strategy to support the restart of elective care and drive down our appalling waiting lists the extension of multi-disciplinary teams throughout the rest of the country which are vital to the survival of general practice, and reforming the current pension taxation system that imposes unfair financial penalties on doctors working extra shts to cover staffing gaps and drive down waiting lists.Recommendations in the Bengoa report have to be implemented. The three-year political vacuum here exacerbated chronic problems in taking dficult decisions.Professor Rafael Bengoa has said that in the face of increased specialisation and ever rising demand, it is not practical or desirable to try to deliver specialist services everywhere.Areas such as the Western Trust have faced long-term issues with filling vacancies for specialist staff. Bengoa says that for some specialist hospital treatments, it’s necessary to consolidate provision in regional centres of excellence.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up At the same time, there are many services that will be decentralised — provided closer to people’s homes, in the likes of GP centres rather than in hospitals.Northern Ireland has the highest prevalence of mental health problems in the UK, with a % higher overall prevalence of mental health problems than England. Mental health alone requires £.bn worth of funding and a -year strategy has recommended taking a regional approach to mental health services.HIGHER EDUCATIONPeople in Londonderry have been campaigning for a full-sized university since the birth of the NI Civil Rights movement in .A renewed commitment was made to deliver , students in New Decade, New Approach. However, numbers at the Magee campus have dropped from , in  to the latest available figures in  of , — of which , are full-time places.Civil Rights veteran, Eamonn McCann said“levelling up” is to make a real dference in the North West it must mean “new money to fix age-old problems”.He continued: “We don’t need vague promises about ‘development’, but concrete decisions, on rail and university expansion, for example.“It’s far, far too long since the university and rail expansion were put on the agenda by grass-roots pressure. The target of , students is very far from being fulfilled. If that can be done through Magee, so be it. If not, a new North West university must be made a practical proposition.”Garbhan Downey of the Derry University Groupsaid a new cross-border university would redress the “systemic neglect” of the region and would mitigate against the impact of Brexit. “It would also end the articial separation between Derry and Donegal, which has damaged both economies. In real terms today, there should be no more ision between our two neighbouring counties than there is between Antrim and Down.”The DUG said that while Belfast’s economy has grown by % since the Good Friday Agreement, Derry’s has contracted by %.He added: “In a comparison study, the research also showed the economy of Lincoln in the East Midlands of England has grown % since the creation of a university there in .”ROADSThe most important projects — as stated by the Executive — are the A and A dualling schemes. The A is made up of two schemes, one of which, Randalstown to Castledawson, is done and one of which, Derry to Dungiven, will be finished in .Roads expert Wesley Johnston said: “Within the Department for Infrastructurethere is a strong ambition to upgrade York Street Interchange in Belfast, but it has no funding and in any case the Minister is lukewarm on the scheme and shting public option may require the project to be reconsidered, or at least re-designed to be more sympathetic to the inner urban setting.“There is also a plan to extend Glider to north and south Belfast.”He added: “In terms of other road schemes, the focus needs to be on safety improvements and bypasses to bottlenecks. In terms of safety, the priority is the A from Hillsborough to Loughbrickland which will hopefully go ahead in the next few years.”He also referenced the bridge at Narrow Water which is to be part-funded by Dublin and of which the Minister is a firm supporter.RAILSteve Bradley from rail lobby group Into The West believes the most impactful rail project that could be rolled out is expansion from Derry-Portadown. He says it is in areas such as Derry and Strabane where better infrastructure would improve outcomes.In areas of high deprivation, limited connectivity can worsen deprivation by reducing affordable access to employment, education and healthcare. Those lacking the resources and transport options required for mobility become deprived from interacting with the whole extent of opportunities offered by society, according to a UK Government connectivity review published this year.Mr Bradley said: Derry-Strabane, Derry-Letterkenny and Portadown-Armagh are three specic projects that should be the Minister’s rail opening priorities.Followed by continuing the line from Strabane through to Omagh,  Dungannon and Portadown.  That would give the West and Donegal a direct rail route to Dublin and end half a century of rail isolation for Tyrone.”ENVIRONMENT“What a Christmas gt it would be for the people of Northern Ireland to roll out an ambitious programme of railways, greenways and new urban cycle paths,” said James Orr from Friends of the Earth. “On my list would be a greenway all along the coast of Northern Ireland.”He added: “New fossil fuel infrastructure is awful for the planet and in financial terms they will be stranded assets. Rolling out the gas network and the gas caverns at Larne is sheer lunacy in climate emergency. Lets insulate people’s homes, provide smart grids and heat pumps and turn every roof on a public building into a solar roof.“A Green New Deal for Northern should start with a major programme of tackling fuel poverty with a mass home energy efficiency programme starting with those who are most in need.”This week the Belfastrevealed that seven million tonnes of waste is dumped into NI’s rivers and seas every year. NI Water requires investment of around £bn in water and wastewater services over a six year period which would go some way towards addressing those spillages.Mr Orr suggested: “We can green these projects by using natural wetlands. Plants like reeds and trees such as willow look beautul, create homes for wildle and also treat sewage. By taking an ecological approach rather than a hard engineering approach we can save money in the long term as they are much cheaper to run.”SPORTCasement Park is a long-running saga and a stadium whichcompleted would be a major boost for the GAA community. However, local residents have lodged a challenge to the ,-seat project which First Minister Paul Givan said could cost more than £m.Football stadia throughout the country is also in need of upgrading. In line with the Irish Football Association’s  Facility Strategy, the Stormont Executive had committed £.m to the development of football stadia after the completion of Windsor Park.The Oval was set to receive a £m investment. A second strand of £m was made available to other Irish Premiership clubs who were capable of hosting fixtures with a , capacity.The DfC Minster is actively considering the outcomes of a re-engagement exercise undertaken in relation to the programme. No funding has been awarded to date.Aaron Vennard, NI and Portadown supporter, set up a Twitter page focusing on NI football grounds years ago. In his view, the funding is insufficient but he believes Glentoran, Carrick and Coleraine’s grounds should be prioritised.“If it’s going to be a ‘regional fund’ then we need to look immediately to the West and to South Down,” he said.“Ideally the funding would be so large that we could develop an Iceland-esque plan for football that would tackle not just immediate stadium concerns but grassroots and youth training: regional stadia development,  indoor dome pitches,  outdoor pitches, , UEFA A coaches,  referees and a national football centre.“Casement Park absolutely should be rebuilt. If the Assembly has to cover the cost, then so be it, but I’d hope that there would be a provision for the stadium to be used for non-GAA sports.”BROADBANDThe Covid pandemic has emphasised the need for improved broadband infrastructure as growing numbers of people work from home and businesses offer digital services.Project Stratum, the £m Department for the Economyrun project was celebrated as NI’s largest publicly funded investment in broadband infrastructure.However, the roll-out has run in to problems including those in Enniskillen where residents whose internet connection is slow said they have been excluded.Disconnected rural areas are supposed to benefit most. Over , premises now have access to gigabit capable full fibre broadband which means they can enjoy speeds of up to Gbps.DfE plans to accelerate the roll out of the project to enable connectivity to , premises by March .Anyone who lives in an area where a broadband service with a speed of Mbps is already available or expected to become available soon is excluded from the scheme.Most ReadPaedophile father given  years for horric attack on his -day-old son ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Troubles survivors call on Sinn Fein to condemn Gerry Adams ‘Tiocfaidh ar la’ Christmas videoPSNI say body found in Tollymore in search for missing German-born computer expert Bernard SankeProperty: superb city living in east BelfastGruesome details of how former UDA leader Johnny Adair carried out his first murder revealed in new bookTop VideosPlayTake a look inside the former Tesco store in Belfast’s city centre which will be an event space over ChristmasPlayBelfastjournalist Eimear McGovern test drives electric Volkswagen ID.

Photo: Getty ImagesDecember   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThroughout the pandemic, we have been told our actions and decisions on public health measures will be led by the science.But what happens when even the scientists don’t have the answers At a media briefing with the chief medical officer and chief scientic adviser earlier this week, neither were able to say with certainty what Omicron means for Northern Ireland.They were able to tell us it will likely be the dominant iant here at some stage shortly after Christmas and that modelling is currently being updated to try and forecast its impact.Even with this work ongoing, a Department of Health document this week made some worrying predictions.Prior to the arrival of Omicron here, hospital occupancy was below the least severe scenario, it said.Not exactly a comforting assessment of the current state of the health service.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up More concerning, however, it warned: “It is anticipated that this picture will change rapidly with the emergence of Omicron.”At the moment, we are very much reliant on watching the pandemic pan out in South Africa, where Omicron was first identied.It appears to be infecting younger age groups, but that has tended to be the pattern with earlier iants, and the infection inevitably makes its way into older, more vulnerable age groups.Not enough time has passed yet to accurately assess the impact on hospitalisations and there is some suggestion that Omicron leads to less severe illness than Delta.If indeed this is the case, there are some who have celebrated this as a positive development, but it must be tempered by the real possibility that Omicron is more infectious than Delta.If this is the case, as the maths suggests, the effects would be disastrous.For example,Delta infects , people and % of them require hospitalisation, that would mean  Covid- patients taking up beds.Turning to Omicron,it infects , people and % need hospital treatment, that would mean an additional  Covid- inpatients for a system already stretched to breaking point.The argument for taking quick and decisive action was made on Thursday night, with Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the World Health Organization, appealing to countries to act now.“Even though we still need answers to some crucial questions, we are not defenceless against Omicron or Delta,” he said.“The steps countries take today and in the coming days and weeks will determine how Omicron unfolds.“If countries wait until their hospitals start to fill up, it’s too late. Don’t wait. Act now.”Returning to the science, this seems like a logical argument to make.We know there is a lag time between infection and hospitalisation, and a further period before patients become so unwell that they require critical care or even die.By the time we get clear answers about the danger posed by Omicron, with a doubling rate believed to be in the region of three days, it will already have a firm hold on the Northern Ireland population.What we do now decides the trajectory of the pandemic in the weeks and months ahead.So, why isn’t the Executive taking more decisive action now to slow the spread of a iant that could potentially cause disaster There are cynics who believe the emergence of Omicron has come at a convenient time to encourage more people to be vaccinated and adhere to the likes of face coverings.But in reality, it couldn’t have come at a worse time for politicians eager to keep voters on side.Here we are, two weeks before Christmas with thousands of people preparing to travel around the UK to reunite with family and friends.At the same time, financial supports such as furlough have ceased and we are trying to rebuild our fragile economy, while also attempting to find a balance between social mixing over the festive period and suppressing an airborne virus.After almost two years of draconian restrictions, people are fed up and an increasing number are rebelling against, ignoring, or simply forgetting even the most basic public health measures.All this at a time of waning immunity and while the health service copes with normal winter pressures, an exhausted workforce and the consequences of spiralling hospital waiting lists.Even a small rise of Covid- inpatients could prove to be too much for the NHS.Yet, move now on restrictions and it turns out Omicron isn’t such a disaster after all and the politicians will never be forgiven by the voting public.However, put in place additional measures now that actually stop the health service from collapsing in January and there will be plenty who will complain the absence of a crippling Covid- wave is proof they were never required in the first place.Isn’t it the case that health minister Robin Swann is still being pilloried for his warnings of a Covid- death toll of biblical proportions as he made the case for lockdown Another factor likely to be playing a role in how the Executive responds is whether Westminster will fund support packages for businesses affected by any measures put in place now.The chances of Boris Johnson loosening the purse strings to cover the cost of our Omicron strategy while similar measures aren’t in place in England are remote.Ultimately, and probably most importantly, who wants to be the politician seen to be cancelling Christmas The Executive didn’t want to do it last year and that was without an Assembly election just months away.Most ReadPaedophile father given  years for horric attack on his -day-old son ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Troubles survivors call on Sinn Fein to condemn Gerry Adams ‘Tiocfaidh ar la’ Christmas videoPSNI say body found in Tollymore in search for missing German-born computer expert Bernard SankeProperty: superb city living in east BelfastGruesome details of how former UDA leader Johnny Adair carried out his first murder revealed in new bookTop VideosPlayTake a look inside the former Tesco store in Belfast’s city centre which will be an event space over ChristmasPlayBelfastjournalist Eimear McGovern test drives electric Volkswagen ID.

However, as I said, the report will be published once the Executive make their decision. I will not comment on any leaks before then.During the same session, the SDLP#s Matthew O#Toole asked Mr Lyons whether or not he “authorised someone to leak a letter to the BBC two days after the Omicron iant was first established on Friday  November”, in which the Economy Minister outlined his opposition to vaccine passports.Mr Lyons responded, “There have been many, many leaks across many, many months within the executive and I am not sure who is responsible for those leaks,” adding, I was very open and upfront with executive colleagues and also publicly about my position and I don’t need to hide behind anybody  in leaking something.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Two DUP MLAs also clashed in the Chamber during a debate on a hunting bill, with Jonathan Buckley voicing his opposition to the proposed legislation.Mr Buckley said: I know that some members might not like to hear this, but the veterinary evidence is in support of hunting. The Veterinary Association for Wildle Management states:Hunting is the natural and most humane method of controlling the fox population. It is humane for a number of reasons perhaps the most important is that it is intrinsically certain and leaves no wounded survivors.His party colleague Christopher Stalford later hit back: I am grateful to the member for giving way. Earlier in the debate, reference was made to the Veterinary Association for Wildle Management. It sounds benign, does it not  However, we were not told that the previous name of said group was Vets for Hunting.Sinn Fein also faced a backlash for voting against the Bill, despite the party in the Republic being vocal about its opposition to hunting with dogs. The party said they voted against it the legislation was unworkable, flawed and rushed and in the time we have left in this mandate amending it sufficiently was not possible.TUESDAYThere was a sobering debate in the Assembly on Tuesday on the Social SecurityBill. Among other measures, it would enable more terminally ill people to qualy for fast-track support.The SDLP#s Mark H Durkan highlighted how the current legislation is not fit for purpose.Rather than creating a system that encourages people into work, where possible, we have one that penalises those most at risk, he said.The delay in accessing payments has a unique impact on iniduals with a terminal illness, given that time is a luxury that they are not afforded. In the words of one case study from research provided by Marie Curie: #My brother died waiting and received a letter saying he was fit for work the day of his funeral.#How can anyone reasonably conclude that we have a system with people#s best interests at heart when what we have lacks any heart at all  These requirements, alongside the six-month le expectancy rule, have caused incalculable harm to people across the North. It is cruel, and it should have been scrapped a long time ago.Meanwhile, there was another hearing at the High Court over the DUP#s #boycott-that-isn#t-a-boycott# of North-South meetings. The court heard that the party#s ministers have displayed open defiance since their boycott was ruled to be unlawful by the court in October.The judge also urged the ministers to end their unsophisticated wriggling against a legal duty and proceed towards attending the cross-border meetings again.Back in the terminal illness bill debate, People Before Profit MLA Gerry Carroll offered a token of generosity to Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey, when her speech was stled by a coughing fit. The Minister had to pause and apologise to members on several occasions.Again, I want to thank everybody, but I cannot talk any more, Ms Hargey eventually conceded.Mr Carroll rose to his feet askingthe minister would give way, which she did, and Mr Carroll revealed he didn#t actually have anything to say. I just want to let the Minister get the chance to get a drink of water so she can finish her contribution. Does she agree with that  he said to laughter in the Chamber.During an exchange about the UK Government#s Advanced Research and Invention AgencyBill, Matthew O#Toole commented: The Bill, of course, came from the beloved Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson#s former adviser, who has now left government and is tweeting and blogging angrily from his afterle.Former UUP leader Mike Nesbitt later said that it was a pleasure to follow Mr O#Toole in the debate, who also worked for the Government in London before leaving to blog and tweet, albeit with considerably less venom than Mr Cummings.WEDNESDAYOn Wednesday it was announced two PSNI officers would not be prosecuted for arresting a man who was injured in  Ormeau Road bookies massacre in  during a commemoration event earlier this year. Police had challenged those in attendance at the event over Covid regulations and Mark Sykes, who was shot in the attack, was arrested.The announcement was met with criticism from many corners, with Mr Sykes saying he would be appealing the decision, and others calling into question the PSNI Chief Constable#s judgement in suspending the two officers involved in the wake of the incident.Deirdre Hargey also unveiled plans to deliver , new homes over the next  years in a bid to help tackle NI#s housing crisis, however Mark H Durkan questioned how the , goal will actually be realised.“Minister Hargey plans to deliver over , homes over the next  years, but without detail as to how this will be achieved and afforded, her plan might as well be a letter to Santa, he said.Sinn Fein have a track record of making positive announcements for people in the North, but we have seen time and time again how these promises never materialise and their best laid plans fall by the wayside leaving people disappointed and frustrated.Elsewhere, there was more Brexit-related waffle from Whitehall, when PM Boris Johnson insisted the Northern Ireland Protocol can be worked in a dferent way. Responding to a question from DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, Mr Johnson said in the Commons: [Sir Jeffrey] knows that we share a view that the protocol is not working in the way that it needs to in order to guarantee the Belfast Good Friday Agreement.I don#t believe things need to be that way. I think it could be worked dferently. And we want our EU friends and partners to understand that and we will continue to work with them to get them to see things in the way that people on both sides of the Irish Sea see them. What exactly worked dferently means was not explained.Tory MP Mark Francois also hit out at NI Secretary Brandon Lewis#s apparent reluctance to trigger Article  over the protocol issues.Brexiteer Francois said Mr Lewis keeps threatening to invoke Article , but he never quite gets round to doing it.He added: There#s a pattern of behaviour, here. The Secretary of State talks a great game, but he never plays one.THURSDAYDuring a Health Committee briefing on safe access zones for those attending abortion clinics, MLAs heard some stark comments from health workers who have faced abuse in their place of work from pro-le campaigners.Dr Siobhan Kirk of the Belfast Trust said two health trusts have had to move their clinic locations as a result of signicant harassment and intimidation, and a security guard has been hired and windows have been blacked out at the Belfast Trust where these services are located.“It’s not nice coming into work and being called a murderer,” she said.Dr Kirk#s colleague Colin McMullan said that  incidents have been reported since March at what is a weekly clinic.Meanwhile, DUP MLA Stephen Dunne hit out at the Communities Minister after it came to light that her department provided no funding to mark the centenary of Northern Ireland.Even a complete philistine would have felt shamed into allocating a few pounds towards the centenary but not this Culture Minister, he said.Over in Westminster, MPs debated the Government#s Nationality and Borders Bill, which essentially makes it harder for refugees to claim asylum in the UK. All of the DUP#s MPs voted in favour of the Bill. As People Before Profit Cllr Fiona Ferguson put it: The DUP: There must be no harder border down the Irish Sea!Also the DUP: Supports a harder boarder for refugees and asylum seekers.Furore over the No  Christmas party continued on Thursday afternoon. Deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill said she was concerned by the developments and the effect they could have on the public health message. Where was the concern over the Bobby Storey funeral  Perhaps, like the party#s stance on hunting with dogs, its public health stance also does not translate across borders - in this case, the Irish Sea.After a full scale inquiry, millions of taxpayers# money squandered and the collapse of the institutions, it emerged on Thursday that the RHI scandal resulted in scores of civil servants being brought to book, top-down reform of Stormont, and potential criminal charges for those involved. Just kidding, only one civil servant received a written warning.FRIDAYFriday saw TUV leader Jim Allister voice his opposition to Clare Bailey’s climate change Bill, however he appeared more concerned over the fact that Sinn Fein support it more than anything.He was speaking following a meeting with farmers in Loughguile.“I am saying that the answer is not to take % and more of our animals and slaughter them or to take % of our production and export it to the depleting rainforests of Brazil and then sit back smugly and say, Didn#t we do well . That is the ethos of the Bill,” Mr Allister said in a statement.“It comes down to this: do our constituents buy the high quality meat produced in North Antrim or the meat produced on land that has been stripped in the Amazon basin  That is an issue that politicians, including those likePhilip McGuigan who champion this absurd Bill, have to consider.“I thank the farmers from the Loughguile area who took the time to underscore to invited MLAs the very clear and real dangers of this Bill and trust that those who chose not to attend, like Mr McGuigan, will nonetheless get the message.”Related topicsClare BaileyGordon LyonsMark H.

New travel restrictions introduced for arrivals into Ireland, amid fears over the Omicron iant, have made predicting passenger numbers more dficult, Dublin Airport said in a statement.

Primark shops in the Netherlands have been hit by restrictions in trading hours, in Germany customers need vaccine passes, while its five shops in Austria have all closed. But in the months ahead things are unlikely to get worse than they were at the same time last year, when most of the chain’s shops were closed. Between December and April sales are expected to be “signicantly better” than in the same period a year earlier, AB Foods told shareholders. The business also has several other wings, including grocery, sugar, ingredients and agriculture businesses. These have all traded in line with expectations since the start of the financial year in September. “We are experiencing the impact of widely reported port congestion and road freight limitations and our businesses have been working hard to overcome these dficulties,” AB Foods said. “We have seen an escalation in the cost of energy, logistics and commodities and we have been implementing plans to offset these through operational cost savings and, where necessary, the implementation of price increases.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Niamh Hawes hasbeen taking part in Miss Bikini Ireland for the last year and achieved a top  spotDerry NewsDerry girl lands top  spot inMiss Bikini Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The man is being treated for abdomen would in Altnagelvin Hospital.Derry NewsMan in critical condition in hospital following Derry stabbing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Primark shops in the Netherlands have been hit by restrictions in trading hours, in Germany customers need vaccine passes, while its five shops in Austria have all closed. But in the months ahead things are unlikely to get worse than they were at the same time last year, when most of the chain’s shops were closed. Between December and April sales are expected to be “signicantly better” than in the same period a year earlier, AB Foods told shareholders. The business also has several other wings, including grocery, sugar, ingredients and agriculture businesses.

Specsavers is encouraging avid readers to have regular eye tests so they can continue to indulge their hobby. Presbyopia is the gradual loss of our eyes’ ability to focus close up as the lens becomes less flexible. A natural part of ageing, it usually becomes noticeable around the age of . The condition is common and typically isn’t a cause for concern. But some struggle to adapt, and find they need to hold their book at arm’sto read the page or direct a light on it to see the words more clearly. For most people, the answer is a simple eye test which will identythey need reading glasses, multi-focal glasses or contact lenses to make words clearer – and le easier. Maeve Walsh, director at Specsavers Crescent Link in the Waterside and Ferryquay Street in the city centre, says: “It can sometimes be dficult for people to assess themselves whether they have presbyopia, which is why we always encourage regular eye tests, usually every two years. “As we age, it’s completely natural for our eyesight to worsen and it shouldn’t be something we worry about, providing our eyes are in good health. “My advice to those with presbyopia would be to carry your specs with you at all times and get into the habit of having them close by. This will help with activities like reading, and will also ensure you’re not straining your eyes, which can sometimes cause other problems.” To find out more about presbyopia, or to book an eye test visit:https:www.specsavers eye-health presbyopiaandwww.specsavers stores derryorwww.specsavers stores crescentlink Top five signs you have Presbyopia .

Reporter: Staff Reporter Dec   addthis, Lynch’s, the local family retailer which operates a number of Spar and Eurospar stores and supermarkets, have opened their third local supermarket bringing their total store number to eight across the North West and Mid Ulster. googletag.cmd.push Lynch’s Eurospar, Greysteel is the third outlet from the retailer to open under the popular Eurospar brand and has allowed management to more than double the number of jobs available, now employing  locally. Acquiring what was previously a Centra store on the site, company director Paul Lynch says the community needed a larger format supermarket brand that would not only bring a host of fresh and local produce and ranges, but would be convenient and complemented with services vital to the local area. Paul said: “We have invested around pound, to bring our supermarket experience to the Greysteel area and are so proud to open the doors. “We have more than doubled the size of the space which allows optimum navigation throughout the aisles, where shoppers will find an increased iety and range of fresh and local foods including our own meat offering and pre-packed ranges. “Importantly, we have continued the on-site partnership with Nicholl Fuels to offer locals a -hour fuel service with pre-pay pumps and we have  parking spaces to allow shoppers to conveniently load their cars safely.” The team has also retained important services including the Post Office, ATM, Lotto and PayPoint and added even more amenities and initiatives to bring value and choice to the area. The deli now serves an extended range of hot and cold food to go alongside Barista Bar coffee and Spar bakery, and shoppers can take advantage of the many deals available including the current  Deals of Christmas campaign which drops the price of big name items and festive essentials every week in the lead up to Christmas. Paul continued: “Eurospar also price matches over a thousand branded products to Tesco each week, so paired with our consistent schedule of value deals, we’re bringing a huge amount of savings for shoppers.” As is the Lynch and Eurospar ethos, the team in-store will implement outreach initiatives with the local community, sponsoring and supporting local clubs and organisations, while also fundraising for charity partner Cancer Fund for Children. Paddy Doody, sales and marketing director at Henderson Group, which owns the Eurospar brand in Northern Ireland added: “We now have  Eurospar supermarkets in Northern Ireland, each one bringing a wealth of convenience in a large format supermarket to their areas. “The Lynch’s are experienced independent retailers and know how to engage with their local communities, with an incredibly high bar set for customer service. “Its fantastic to see the Eurospar brand thriving under our independent retailers and we wish Lynch’s the best of luck with their new business.” The new supermarket in Greysteel joins Lynch’s portfolio of stores including Eurospars in the Skeoge area of Derry and Draperstown in Magherafelt, plus Spars in Dungiven, Claudy, Newbuildings and Trench Road in Co Derry, and Clonoe in Coalisland.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Niamh Hawes hasbeen taking part in Miss Bikini Ireland for the last year and achieved a top  spotDerry NewsDerry girl lands top  spot inMiss Bikini Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The man is being treated for abdomen would in Altnagelvin Hospital.Derry NewsMan in critical condition in hospital following Derry stabbing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Niamh said: “I want to model full time which is one of the reasons I entered the competition. I model around Derry and Belfast and one of the photographers I work with in Derry sent me a link online to enter the competition. “The next day the organiser of the competition, Greg, rang me and told me I was accepted and walked me through the next steps. “It was my first ever show and I had no experience in runway modelling. I wanted to enter because I thought it would be a great way to get experience of runway modelling and performing in front of crowds. It’s also a great way to get more exposure all around Ireland and beyond.” In a normal year, without Covid restrictions, the competition normally has three stages A photoshoot workshop, a fitness workshop and then the finals. This year, due to Covid, there was one photoshoot workshopin October last year in Dublin and the fitness workshop was cancelled as it wasn’t possible to do with social distancing. The finals which were originally supposed to be held in December  but they were delayed to January this year as a result of lockdown. This was then delayed again to allow for a more normal setting for the finals. Niamh continued: “The finals took place this weekend, December , so it’s been a long road. “The competition is full of challenges and tests to see that the winner is fit to head off and represent Ireland at swimsuit USA in America. “So, throughout the competition the photoshoots and workshops and working with other brands is all a test for howprofessionalyou are and how well you can work with photographers, brands and other models. “It’s also about a healthy body and lestyle so they’re looking for someone who is passionate about physical and mental health. “For example, one of our challenges throughout was promoting our sponsor, Beauty Belle, on social media s and doing weekly posts. Then, the big challenge at the final to test how confident you are in front of a crowd. “I absolutely loved the experience and I’m so grateful for it, the final reallywasa night I’ll always remember. “I was terried when I was travelling to Limerick but when I got there and out on stage I was really in my element and it confirmed this is exactly the kind of thing that I want to continue doing in the future. “I love the rush I get being out of my comfort zone andthatswhat modelling does for me, nerves are good. “I was disappointed that so many of the opportunities throughout were held off or not able to happen because of Covid, I would’ve really liked to spend more time with the other girls and get to know them more as they were lovely and made the whole experience. I was one of two girls from the North, I didn’t get to see much of them. I was also really pleased with placing top six at my first ever show, I would’ve just been happy to complete it. The whole experience really boosted my confidence. “I really want to say a big thank you to The Beauty Edit makeup shop inFoyleside, my personal trainer, Peter Ward, and my friends and family who supported me especially my Mammy, Shauna and my best friend, Erin who travelled to Limerick with me. “Over the next year, in preparation for Miss Bikini  , I will be taking up any opportunities I can to grow my confidence and to grow as a person and grow my . I will be training so I can be the best candidate possible next year. “This year, I did the show for the experience and fun but it’s made me realise how much I want the title now and I don’t plan on letting anything distract me from it in the next year.” To support Niamh’sjourney for the next year, follow her on Instagram at:niamh.hawes  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Niamh Hawes hasbeen taking part in Miss Bikini Ireland for the last year and achieved a top  spotDerry NewsDerry girl lands top  spot inMiss Bikini Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The man is being treated for abdomen would in Altnagelvin Hospital.Derry NewsMan in critical condition in hospital following Derry stabbing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

I am calling on the Education Minister to introduce regulations to cap unorm costs and provide statutory guidance to schools to ensure school unorms are made affordable for families. “A recent poll of parents showed that % were concerned about the rising costs of unorms and PE gear, while % said they getinto debt to cover the costs. Unorms and PE gear are costing parents hundreds of pounds, per-child, every year. This is unacceptable and must be addressed. With the cost of living rising, urgent action is needed to support families and I am calling on theEducation Minister to legislate to ease the burden of school unorm costs.

Since April of this year, there have been  donors and families who have enabled  patients to receive a le-saving transplant in Northern Ireland. Statistics have shown that % of people in Northern Ireland support organ donation, but only % have signed the Organ Donor Register. Mayor Warke said: Making the decision on whether or not to become an organ donor is a big decision and a personal one for each inidual. Its important that we all take the time to think about our own choice, and to share that choice with our family and friends. Christmas is a time for giving, and one of the greatest gts that any of us could give is the gt of le. The statistics around organ donation are really quite incredible. One organ donor can save the lives of up to nine people, and with around  iniduals currently on the waiting list in Northern Ireland, every single donor makes a huge dference to potentially saving someones le. Its vitally important to remember that loved ones will always be involved before any organ donation can go ahead. Given the fact that only half of families agree to donatethey dont know their loved ones decision, but  out of  will support itthey know their loved one wanted to donate, Id ask everyone to please share their choice. By doing so you could save lives. You can record your decision around donation on the NHS Organ Donation Register atwww.organdonationni.info  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Niamh Hawes hasbeen taking part in Miss Bikini Ireland for the last year and achieved a top  spotDerry NewsDerry girl lands top  spot inMiss Bikini Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The man is being treated for abdomen would in Altnagelvin Hospital.Derry NewsMan in critical condition in hospital following Derry stabbing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Joseph McCarthy, the writer, director and producer of Grief, thanked everyone involved in the production of the film and Derry and Strabane District Council and Derry Credit Union for supporting it.  He added: “Paddy Simpson, from Brunswick Moviebowl who screened the film and was very supportive of Grief, deserves a special word of thanks, as do Charles Bradley and Joe Parke from Bradley and McLaughlin Undertakers, Bishop Forster, Bishop McKeown and Mayor Warke.” The film can be viewed on YouTube by means of several links on Black North Productions’ Facebook page and has had over  views in less than a week. Next up for the local film company will be their anti-bullying film, Summary Justice, which deals with the ongoing issue of bullying in schools and will involve local pupils, parents, several teachers and the principal of Saint Saviours College, where most of the action takes place.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Niamh Hawes hasbeen taking part in Miss Bikini Ireland for the last year and achieved a top  spotDerry NewsDerry girl lands top  spot inMiss Bikini Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The man is being treated for abdomen would in Altnagelvin Hospital.Derry NewsMan in critical condition in hospital following Derry stabbing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Niamh Hawes hasbeen taking part in Miss Bikini Ireland for the last year and achieved a top  spotDerry NewsDerry girl lands top  spot inMiss Bikini Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The man is being treated for abdomen would in Altnagelvin Hospital.Derry NewsMan in critical condition in hospital following Derry stabbing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

At a media briefing, he stated there were inherent internal contradictions in the bans and said, Weve seen these before where you ban flights except for your own citizens. Is it that some passport holders will have the virus and some wont  Does the virus read your passport  Does the virus know your nationality or where youre legally resident  Our concern here is that we apply public health principles, not political principles to selecting measures that are used to control the spread of disease. He made the comments in the wake of tightening border restrictions across dozens of countries in response to the Omicron iant. WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also called on countries to take rational and proportional risk-reduction measures. He said, Blanket travel bans will not prevent the international spread of Omicron and they place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods. Dr Ryan suggested other ways to manage risk: There are ways that you can de-risk travel in terms of having increased testing, more testing before departure, more testing on arrival, quarantine until negative testing. There is a whole series of things that can be done that will manage the risk of importation of disease or even exporting disease to another country which fall short of blanket bans. The idea that you can put a hermetic seal on most countries is just frankly not possible. We all know that, weve seen that happen before. And certainly there has to be consistency. If [the bans] are being applied, they have to be consistent.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Niamh Hawes hasbeen taking part in Miss Bikini Ireland for the last year and achieved a top  spotDerry NewsDerry girl lands top  spot inMiss Bikini Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The man is being treated for abdomen would in Altnagelvin Hospital.Derry NewsMan in critical condition in hospital following Derry stabbing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

After continuing with his le, as best he could, he collapsed last year in his garden with back and leg pain. Kevin travelled to Istanbul last month to meet a specialist and will require surgery within a matter of months, which will cost in the region of pound,.

On Friday, June , their  and  U Feacuteile teams will play in a novel charity game, with all the funds going help Kevin and his family. “We are trying to raise as much money for Kevin and his family as possible,” said Philip Muldoon, one of the organisers. “We want the good people off Ballinderry and surrounding areas to come along and donate on the night of the match to keep the date free. “To any business people who would like to sponsor a prize for the raffle in the Bridge Bar afterwards they can do so by contacting myself or Karl Conlan. “Kevin is going to need a lot of help post and pre surgery and this will go a long way to doing that.” To mark the occasion Noel ONeill of Arboe based company ND Sports has made the outstanding gesture of sponsoring a one-off retro top for both teams.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Niamh Hawes hasbeen taking part in Miss Bikini Ireland for the last year and achieved a top  spotDerry NewsDerry girl lands top  spot inMiss Bikini Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The man is being treated for abdomen would in Altnagelvin Hospital.Derry NewsMan in critical condition in hospital following Derry stabbing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

I am contacted about cleansing issues on a daily basis and while working with council staff a solution is found, butrobust processes and procedures were in place, this should be routinely completed and no major issues should arise.Cllr Sharvin says he is also keen to see greater attention on cleaning play parks, explaining that currently there is no formal process to do so and operates on adhoc basis.ldquoGiven the increase of use play parks during Covid and the councilrsquos objective to increase healthy living in our communities, itrsquos vitality important that we clean and maintain our play parks on a regular basis.

pop royalty and real-le royalty, George Lowdenrsquos guitars are known to be the best in the world.The Prince of Wales recently made known his knowledge of and fascination with Georgersquos guitars and Ed Sheeran reportedly likes to keep one handy in nearly every room of his house.With Niall Horan of One Direction and Dubliner singer songwriter Dermot Kennedy becoming the latest owners of the bespoke guitars, Georgersquos company, Lowden Guitars, has just announced its latest collaboration with Sheeran.To celebrate the release of his most recent album, Sheeran has teamed up with George, who founded the firm in , to design and create a signature guitar worthy of music royalty.The Sheeran by Lowden Equals Edition guitar will also be available to the public to purchase, with a limited edition run of , available through Lowdenrsquos global dealer network.Itrsquos the second joint project with Sheeran, following on from their range of more affordable guitars.The latest achievement comes in the wake of George recently meeting the Prince of Wales at a Windsor Castle reception to mark Lowden Guitars winning the  Queenrsquos Awards for Enterprise.He also launched a new range of limited edition guitars to mark his th birthday over the summer which features specications chosen by George.Itrsquos all a far cry from when the renowned luthier first began to hand-make guitars for his own use.He could never have known that his determination to make the best guitar would see his name travel around the world and be spoken of by royalty.ldquoTherersquos quite a lot of things that have happened that I never could have imagined. When I started out, I had no formal training in the manufacture of guitars, explained George.ldquoIn a way, that gave me the confidence to take some risks, innovate and produce an instrument that has a completely unique voicing.He found the Prince of Wales to be very interested in the guitarsrsquo manufacture and may have even suggested a new development.ldquoWe had a great chat and he asked quite a lot of questions about the wood, all kinds and how we found it, said George.ldquoHe was also very interested in dieback ash, asking aboutit would be a very good way to use the trees as a lot have perished due to this disease.ldquoIt wouldnrsquot be the best toned wood you could find but Irsquove been thinking more about that since and wondering whether we could use it for guitar necks or not so we might do a little experiment to seeit works.From creating coveted instruments for top Irish and UK guitarists in the know, Lowden Guitars have become an international sales success mdash hence the Queenrsquos Award.George explained: ldquoThe company is far bigger than I ever envisaged. In some ways itrsquos good but I never tried to expand the company and get the kind of growth we have enjoyed. It just kind of happened over the years as organic growth which has been great.His guitars tend to sell by word of mouth from musician to musician and the actual experience of playing a Lowden and relishing its distinct tones at first hand.ldquoWherever in the world where we sell, we are still quite a niche, upper end company so the guitars are at the highest price level in all of the countries, said George.ldquoItrsquos a natural process where people see the guitars for the first time. They go into a shop and then over a period of a few years the reputation builds within that country. Our presence also grows and then we move into more specialist guitar shops, so it all takes time.ldquoI remember as a teenager I was mad keen to get a Gibson  which I saw in Matchettrsquos shop window in Belfast all those years ago and I couldnrsquot afford it.ldquoIf something is really good, and the young player comes in and plays it but canrsquot afford it, it goes into his or her mind and later on they find a way to afford it.George says the Covid pandemic has not impact on sales, although it has had other consequences.George said: ldquoIt didnrsquot impact on us for sales as our order book remained very firm but it was more to do with making the guitars as we had to completely re-organise the factory for better social distancing which was very expensive.ldquoWe had to close down the factory for a while in order to do that and more with people having to isolate it proved challenging..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Magpies fly high in Breffni Park  ","story":"DOWN kingpins Kilcoo qualied for an Ulster semi-final after a good performance at Kingspan Breffni Park on Saturday evening, defeating Cavan-based Ramor United by  points.The Magpies, reigning Ulster champions, will meet Glen of Derry in the last four in what will be a massive clash in two weeks time.It was tit-for-tat early on but the home side got a massive confidence boost in the fth minute via a well taken Sean McEvoy goal, their most impressive performer on the night.Kilcoorsquos response was emphatic though, firstly Ceilum Doherty stuck over a nice point and then that man Jerome Johnston done what he does best and fired to the net to put his side into a lead they would never relinquish.Further scores from Ryan McEvoy, Shealan Johnston and Doherty again sent them in four up at the water-break.The second period of the first half turned out to be poor affair with both sides missing good scoring chances.

Four dedicated spaces for electrical vehicles are also included.Itrsquos understood that in addition to the  jobs in the new Lidl store, a further  will be created across the other proposed retail units, with  jobs created during construction and development.Council planners are recommending to members that the application be approved with  conditions including its full construction within a five-year period.In papers submitted ahead of Mondayrsquos planning meeting, planners said they were recommending approval as the proposed retail use is considered to comply with the local development plan.They say that when the buildings are constructed, they will not adversely impact on the character of the area or have a detrimental impact on the amenity of existing residents in properties adjoining the site.ldquoAppropriate provision is made to meet the needs of cyclists and adequate facilities are made for shower and changing facilities as required for such a major employment-generating development, the papers point out.A spokesperson for Lidl said the poundm store would reflect the retailerrsquos concept design, boasting a sales floor, a shopping environment withspacious, wide aisles, long tills, restrooms and baby-changing facilities, as well as a bakery offering and staff facilities.ldquoOur ambitious plans to complement the site with additional retail and leisure units represent an investment of more than pound million into the area and the support of more than  jobs, he said.ldquoWersquore proud to be part of the centrersquos signicant regeneration and bring a new future of growth to the locality whilst honouring the sitersquos historical connections to the community.The spokesman added: ldquoWe hope to receive planning permission for the site and look forward to opening the brand new, state-of-the-art Lidl store early next year, bringing shoppers even more choice of quality products at unbeatable value.Carryduff shopping centre was a prime retail destination for many years, but since the closure of its flagship Supervalu store in , it struggled to attract an anchor tenant that would drive its growth.The formal planning application by Lidl follows an extensive local consultation of the plans undertaken in February which was positively received by local representatives and the wider community.Lidl acquired the . acre Carryduff shopping centre site in August last year as part of the retailerrsquos plans to expand its store presence across the region to more than  stores by the end of the decade..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Newcastle harbour development plans  ","story":"THE redevelopment of the former generator house at Newcastle harbour has the potential to act as a catalyst to secure additional investment.Thatrsquos the assertion of Mournes councillor Willie Clarke whose comment came after Monday eveningrsquos annual meeting of the Newcastle Harbour Heritage Association.He congratulated the grouprsquos chairman Campbell Miller and the committee members on the ldquofantastic positive contribution they have made in improving the harbour over the past year.Cllr Clarke said the two main items discussed at the annual meeting included the refurbishment of the former generator house as a community hub and the provision of a new boarding pontoon that would allow disabled people to board vessels, something which he said is long overdue.The business case for the new floating pontoon recently passed through Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee.Cllr Clarke explained the vision for the generator house includes the provision of showers, toilets, and changing facilities for water-based recreation, alongside a meeting room for the community and harbour users.He said the business case was submitted to the local authority and approved through the so-called community transfer process.ldquoIt is essential that this building is refurbished for the local community which will be a catalyst in the development of the harbour, suggested Cllr Clarke.ldquoIn addition, it offers an excellent opportunity for the local council and the harbour community to develop a partnership to create a community hub for the area. I will be facilitating meetings with council officials to progress this vital community asset as quickly as possible.Cllr Clarke said there was no doubt that with an ldquoambitious and focused vision for the future, the harbour area could become a unique attraction, meeting the needs of not just the local community, but also become an exciting destination for those who visit Newcastle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Red High hurlers through to final  ","story":"THE first half of this Danske Bank Mageean Cup semi-final was brilliant to watchthere were any neutrals around.If you were a supporter of either St Patrickrsquos or St Louisrsquo, it was nail-biting, edge-of-the-seat drama played at a blistering pace with top class scoring at each end.That half finished - to - in favour of the Ballymena side.For the Red High management of Darren Swail, Sean Paul Gibson and Danny Toner, the entertainment factor had to be sacriced to get the result they needed.Bringing Oisin Coulter back as extra cover in defence curtailed the damage that Ballymenarsquos two Loughgiel inside forwards had done in the opening half, but it also meant that the Red Highrsquos attack would struggle to retain ball to keep the scoreboard running.Jack McCloskey had scored - in the first half and Roacutenaacuten McCollam -. McCollam fired over another point in the th minute and pointed a free at the very end while trying to it in on the Downpatrick area to poach a late goal.McCloskey didnrsquot score in the second half and being out of general play resulted in his normally reliable free-taking also taking a hit.At the other end the outnumbered Downpatrick forwards had to survive on scraps as well but they could always rely on their free-takers.Goalkeeper Pearse Smyth landed two points from inside his own half, while Tom McGrattan converted three frees and landed a point from play as well.McGrattan was the star of the game and he capped a brilliant inidual performance with two late plays that effectively took his team into the final.With the game in the balance at - each in the rd minute, McGrattan jinked his way along the sideline under the stand to win himself a free.It was an acute angle, but the Portaferry clubman arrowed the sliotar between the uprights.Then less than a minute later he played a beautul cross-field pass into the path of mid-fielder Finn Turpin, who stepped inside the defender and hit the roof of the net from  metres out.St Patrickrsquos were through to their first ever Danske Bank Mageean Cup final where they will play St Patrickrsquos Maghera at the Dub Arena on Friday week, December .But back again to that breath-taking first half.After five minutes, the teams had each scored three points. By the tenth minute, Jack McCloskey had cut through the Red High cover and shot to the net off the base of the right hand post.Within three minutes Downpatrick were a point up. McGrattan went around the left side of the Ballymena defence at full pace to rle to the roof of the net for one of the best goals that you will see at any level.Aodhan McGarry responded by pointing from a side-line and the water-break broke the action at - each.McGarry started the second quarter scoring with a fine point but a run of three successive scores from Finn Turpin, McGrattan and Oisin Coulter edged the Red High ahead again.However, three frees from Jack McCloskey and a point from Ronan McCollam put Ballymena in the lead by - to - at half-time.By the second water break Downpatrick were - to - ahead, mainly through frees and St Louisrsquo were now looking for scores from distance.The next  minutes went scoreless. In hindsight Ballymena snatched at a couple of scoring chances that might have put pressure on the eventual winners who pumped a lot of ball in high on the north Antrim defence with no .Eventually sub Tom McFerran brought the teams level and McCollam from the left wing gave St Louisrsquo the lead. The gauntlet had been thrown down for the Red High.Oisin Coulter landed a much-needed Downpatrick point in reply and they held firm until Tom McGrattan delivered the match-winning scores.It is scant consolation for Ballymena that they played their part in a fine display of schoolsrsquo hurling, but a number of players stood out including Daire McMullan, Connor Dickson and Dara Martin in defence and McCollam and McCloskey in attack until tempered by Downpatrickrsquos packed back line.Defence was ultimately the winning of the game, but they would not have got across the line without Turpin, Oisin Coulter and especially the mercurial Tom McGrattan.As a hurling disciple of the great Bro Charles in the s, I was a proud man leaving the Dub on Friday evening.For the generations of hurlers who climbed to the top of the hill on Saul Street each morning over the past  or  years, winning a Mageean was just not on the radar.This team is only  minutes from achieving what for us was the impossible.St Patrickrsquos: P Smyth - frees, J Ruddy, R OrsquoNeill, D Coulter, S Mageean, D Mallon, C Lenaghan, T Connolly -, F Turpin -, M Dorrian -, A Connolly, T McGrattan - , O Coulter -, R McGrath, S McCarthy.Subs: F MacManus for A Connolly , LMcCabe for S McCarthy , F Casey for R McGrath ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Road officials set to carry out survey at Ballynahinch school  ","story":"PLANS by roads officials to carry out a survey on the main road outside Ballynahinch Primary School have been welcomed by Strangford MLA Peter Weir.The work will be carried out to assess the potential for a new pedestrian crossing and while pleased that the survey is to take place, Mr Weir is disappointed that there are no current plans to also introduce a temporary mph speed limit at the Dromore Road as part of a province-wide Department for Infrastructure initiative.Mr Weir mdash who has met with school principal Mr Michael Moore mdash said the safety of children who have to cross the busy road was of paramount importance and a real issue of concern for parents and residents.The former Education Minister said he was ldquodisappointed that the school had not been included in the Roads Departmentrsquos part-time mph speed limit scheme.ldquoI believe that the Department needs to give a clear commitment that Ballynahinch Primary School will be included in the next roll-out of the scheme, said Mr Weir.ldquoThe Dromore Road is busy and is also a bus route.

Jimmyrsquos  is scheduled to take place on Sunday, March , and it is anticipated that interest will be high especially given that the Seeley Cup sold out well in advance.The Joe Seeley offers a flat and fast course starting on the Ormeau Embankment in Belfast with two and a bit laps through the Ormeau Park.For those watching or racing it was a sharp cold day, but miraculously the heavy rain and high winds that preceded the .pm start died down just in time to let the runners have a fair crack at a good performance.At the pointy end there were small clusters of runners who made a break early on in the first lap and then a lead group of five formed as they headed out for the second lap. The huddle of five then broke apart in the last K as they hurtled towards the finish line in break neck speed.Overall winner Owen Everardonly edged for glory in the last two strides as right to the mat it was not clear who would breach the tape first.His time of . was two seconds ahead of Matthew Neill , who was one second ahead of third-placed Eskander Turki . The top  competitors were all sub  minutes for K, which is fast by any means.East Down ACrsquos Neil McCartan, who prefers shorter distances and would choose track over road running, finished in a commendable .. This is not a personal best time, but given that this is his first serious attempt at a K in three years he will be more than satisfied. This got him well inside the top  in th place.Neil Curran reaped the rewards of his consistent cross-country racing, converting the stamina gained in that discipline to a strong road performance. He was chuffed to take  seconds off his previous best time and at . is well poised to run a sub  minute K in the near future.He said that he ran conservatively off the start as he was fearful of overcooking it and as a result ended up running solo for a large part of the distance.

Many runners set sub  minutes for K as a good base goal, but he smashed that and some.He was even more delighted to discover that he was the quickest junior athlete on the day by well over a minute. As mentioned this race stood as the NI  Ulster Championship, so he gains that title as well as a Seeley Cup age group win.A great achievement.It was actually a hat trick as he also snatched bragging rights in the Murray family as his dad Dee and mum Janine were also racing on the day.Dee was next home for EDAC in a very respectable .. Dee has been troubled by niggles and was not even surehe was going to start let alone finish, so being able to take part was more important than the result.Seamus Savage who was the next EDAC finisher is training hard to regain fitness and based on his current form he went in not expecting too much.While he enjoyed the race, he found it tough in the latter half.

Sam Anderson was glad of the cheers of club mates as she battled to the finish in one hour and seven minutes. Another race ticked off by this consistent attender. Good work by all three.Cross-countryThe Robinson brothers, Oliver and Alex, ended off their  cross-country season with a trip to the Uneven Age Group All Irelands Cross Country in Gowran, Kilkenny, on Sunday.The sun shone all day but the temperature stayed low with the ground remaining icy in parts. Alex had gained his Ulster U- team place by coming sixth at the Ulster  NI race in Donegal a few weeks previously, so he had set his expectations high.His race was ,m around a very twisty course through long grass, all of which made it more technical than previous races.The start of any cross-country race is hectic with lots of jostling and this was no exception.Alex was pulled back when the gun went off and then had to contend with some fallers so he never really got into his stride.He was disappointed to place th out of a field of  runners, but deserves huge credit for his commitment over the last few months.Alexrsquos older brother, Oliver, was running for the Down team in the U- race.

In my opinion, such an appointment is crucial and could benefit the town and the business community a great deal.ldquoThe night time economy is one area that needs to be improved not only in Downpatrick but where, but rapid progress this in the current Covid climate may not be possible.ldquoHowever, there is no reason why ideas to regenerate our night time economy cannot be discussed now to lay plans for the future, he continued.Cllr Curran said every high street is dferent, with many people keen to see them become vibrant shopping hubs at the heart of local communities, explaining that the work of the Stormont task force could not be more timely.He added: ldquoAnything that can be done to increase footfall in our town centres in the future will be more than welcome.The call for evidence document is available at https:www.executiveoffice-ni.gov.uk consultations call-evidence-high-street-task-force, while responses to the call for evidence can be made to highstreet@communities-ni.gov.uk..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/12386616.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

If someone had asked meI was Catholic, I would have said yes.If they had asked meI was Protestant I would also have said yes. I thought they were both synonyms for Christian.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

By the time of the  World Cup, when the Northern Ireland heroes qualied for the Mexico finals, I did know that there was a dference between Catholic and Protestant, but only because I had by then become interested in politics, and had begun to read about such things.This ignorance of the tribal ide was a common experience among children whose background was middle class Protestant, and I suspect more common than it was among Catholics of a similar background, because church going levels were far, far higher among Catholics than Protestants until quite recently.In , before the Troubles had begun, already under half of Anglicans and Presbyterians in NI were weekly churchgoers. Among Catholics in NI, it was well over %. This experience is one way of illustrating how wrong Mary McAleese and the late Fr Alec Reid were to say that Protestants were brought up to hate Catholics .But even in , while I had become aware of the ide between Catholics and Protestants, I had not come to think of any such ision among the players the Northern Ireland football team, nor did I — or any of my school friends — spend so much as a moment thinking about the religious background of the other sporting names who gave us such joy in those increasingly distant days, from Alex Higgins to Barry McGuigan to Dennis Taylor..As I became older I thought more and more about how dficult it must have been for NI players of a Catholic backgroundin the s. Tensions were high in the province in the aftermath of the hunger strikes and in the run-up to the Anglo Irish Agreement and republicans were waging a campaign to destroy Northern Ireland.So many of the key figures in the NI team over the decades were from a nationalist background. I have no idea what their political affiliations were,any, and no desire to find out. But there is something particularly admirable about someone who showed loyalty to the Northern Ireland team when they might privately have wanted an all-island team.My thoughts ed to the subject this week when I was asked on the BBC Radio Ulster Nolan show to discuss comments by the former NI manager Michael O’Neill and others that the British national anthem, God Save the Queen, might not be the best song to be played before Northern Ireland games. It is a concern that unionists should take very seriously. It would be awfulfootballers and fans from a Catholic background started to drt away from the NI team — as some have always done but so far in relatively small numbers.I mentioned on Nolan that the News Letter facilitated a debate bout changing the anthem away from GSTQ more than a decade ago. The idea attracted strong opinions among NI fans, both for and against.My own view is that the national anthem is less than ideal for any one of the four home nations because it is the anthem of the UK, rather than any one of its countries.However, finding a specic anthem for Northern Ireland would prove tricky, both in getting something that had musical merit and in finding wording that was acceptable to a broad base of fans.The debate about whether or not to use the national anthem or an NI-specic one is quite separate to the suggestion by the football agent Gerry Carlile that both God Save The Queen and the Republic of Ireland’s national anthem, Amhrán na bhFiann , be played at Northern Ireland games.That would be completely unacceptable, because it would strike at the heart of what the NI team is about — which is a team that represents the northern jurisdiction of this island, the existence of which republicans themselves finally came to accept in .The mere fact of the Northern Ireland football teamspresent a considerable challenge for republicans, because those teams have very widespread and instinctive support, even among people in NI who are apolitical. They are, indeed, one of the last representations of Northern Ireland that are openly embraced.Think of what has happened with the centenary. Republicans have in effect thwarted any celebration, Beyond the front page of the News Letter, barely any local institutions have dared to so much as say Happy th! — not even ones that have Northern Ireland in their name, While London has slightly stepped up its support for the centenary at the end of the year, the anniversary is still largely invisible. If the football team is undermined, another plank of Northern Ireland le will be removed.• Ben Lowryis News Letter editor.

High levels of vaccination among the population will greatly reduce the pressures on the NHS.They make another lockdown much less likely, and further lockdowns are to be avoided at all costs, given the huge social and financial damage that they cause.But the change in the Covid certication requirements in Northern Ireland from Monday are not widely understood and have not been sufficiently publicised. There has been a misapprehension that the old cards, given to people when they got their jabs, are not sufficient as proof.Last night the government said that such cards were sufficient. It would be utterly unfairotherwise. Older people who have been conscientious in getting jabbed often have no access to apps and might not have applied for a letter, which is a cumbersome process. It is fair to ask for proof of jabs in certain circumstances but not fair to make that proof too onerous.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

The third Irish signatory, Robert Barton, a Unionist landowner turned Republican and an intimate friend of Collins, was the Sinn Fein delegation’s economic adviser. Never before had British and Irish representatives put their names to a formal agreement of this kind as complete equals. After the signing, which took place at . am, the two sides shook hands for the first time. Trust had replaced the deep suspicion with which they had first regarded each other. Irish leaders, who a few months earlier had been denounced as rebels and murderers, had come to enjoy the respect of the British delegation. Michael Collins had undergone an astonishing transformation from terrorist leader to statesman, gaining the admiration of two prominent members of the British team, Churchill and Birkenhead.Final agreement on the terms of the treaty had been reached in two intense negotiating sessions in the Cabinet Room at No , which ended two months of wrangling. The first session, which lasted over five hours, began at pm on December . Lloyd George employed all his formidable political skills to secure a breakthrough in all but one of the key areas that had hitherto defied resolution.The Irish gained the full fiscal and financial autonomy they craved. The British got what they wanted on defence: the use “in time of war or of strained relations with a foreign power [of] such harbour and other facilities as the British government may require”, combined with the permanent retention of what came to be known as the Treaty Ports , major strategic assets which Neville Chamberlainwas to abandon in a further Anglo-Irish Treaty in  to Churchill’s fury. Since the start of negotiations in October, the words of an oath of allegiance which Irish elected representatives would in future be required to swear had been through endless drafts. It was at last settled with a suitably convoluted rigmarole to spare the Irish republican conscience as much strain as possible: “I will be faithful to His Majesty King George V, his Heirs and Successors by law, in virtue of the common citizenship of Ireland and Great Britain, and her adherence to and membership of the group of nations forming the British Commonwealth of Nations.” This was the first time on which the customary reference to Empire was dropped from an official document.There remained just one make-or-break issue: Northern Ireland, with its devolved powers over local matters entrusted to it by Westminster earlier in . Sinn Fein were determined to get it into their independent state. Lloyd George was happy to give them all the help he could. In November, he had piled pressure on Sir James Craig, the Northern Ireland prime minister. In letters and conversations he tried, with all his accustomed craftiness, to get Craig to accept that he had a patriotic duty to remove the last barrier to peace in Ireland by joining a sovereign all-Ireland Parliament in place of Westminster, while retaining all the devolved powers that Westminster had provided.The Unionist members of the British delegation did not demur. Not for the last time, Ulster Unionists found that they could not rely on their English Unionist allies in high places . Austen Chamberlain said that separate arrangements for six of the nine Ulster counties were “illogical and indefensible”. He thought “the greatest moral pressure” should be put on Northern Ireland to bring it into a settlement that was “vital to the Empire”. His party chairman, Sir George Younger , believed “Ulster should take some risks and forget some of the past arguments against unity in Ireland”.These Unionist calls for compromisewere made against the background of a sustained press campaign, led by The Times, criticising Ulster Unionists for their intransigence. “Ulster blocks the way to peace” was the newspapers’ regular refrain. Craig described it as “ a press campaign against Ulster without parallel in the history of Great Britain.”But the Northern Ireland premier was unmoved. He told Lloyd George that a single parliament for Ireland was “precisely what Ulster has for many years resisted by all the means at her disposal”.Lloyd George tried another tack in November, concentrating his cunning this time on the leader of the Irish delegation, Arthur Grfith. Here he had much greater success than in his attempts to manoeuvre Craig into an all-Ireland parliament. At a private meeting with Grfith on November , he got the leader of the Irish delegation to give a personal written pledge that,Northern Ireland refused to accept an all-Ireland settlement, it would remain under the British Parliament, “but in this case, it would be necessary to revise the boundary of Northern Ireland. This might be done by a Boundary Commission ... to make the boundary conform as closely as possible to the wishes of the people.” What went unrecorded in the paper was the clear impression given by Lloyd George that Northern Ireland would lose so much territory that it could not survive as a separate entity and a united independent Ireland would as a result come into existence.During the course of the long afternoon session in Downing Street on December , Lloyd George reminded Grfith of what they had agreed.Proof was needed. A frantic search was made of the prime minister’s wardrobe, and “eventually an insignicant pocket cast up an envelope and a piece of paper.” On the strength of this written undertaking to establish a Boundary Commission whichwould undermine Northern Ireland, the leader of the Irish delegation agreed to sign the Treaty himself, but said that he could not commit his colleagues.At this, Lloyd George assumed a magnicently melodramatic air. He had told Craig in Belfast to expect news of the outcome of the discussions in Downing Street the following day. That could of course have been done by telephone, but Lloyd George now conjured up an elaborate plan to send the news in writing to Belfast in an attempt to force a decision out of the other two Irish delegates.“Here are the alternative letters which I have prepared, one enclosing Articles of Agreement reached by His Majesty’s Government and yourselves, and the other saying that the Sinn Fein representatives refuse to come within the Empire. If I send this letter it is war, and war within three days. Which letter am I to send  Whichever letter you choose travels by special train to Holyhead, and by destroyer to Belfast. The train is waiting with steam up at Euston ... to reach Sir James in time we must know your answer by ten p.m tonight. You can have until then, but no longer, to decide whether you will give peace or war to your country.”With these impassioned words ringing in their ears, the Irish delegates ed to their Knightsbridge hotel for anguished discussions amongst themselves, but promised to be back in Downing Street by the pm deadline. In fact, it was nearly .pm when they ed.Nothing more was heard about the special train waiting at Euston. Grfith announced calmly, “Prime Minister, the Delegation is willing to sign the agreements, but there are a few points of drafting which perhaps it would be convenientI mentioned at once.” The most important concerned the Boundary Commission redrafting increasedthe likelihood that Northern Ireland would collapse. At Iam on December , an agreed text was handed to the Downing Street typists.In England, reaction to the treaty was ecstatic. The Times led the way: “These are fitting peace terms to mark the close of an age of discontent and distrust, and the beginning of a new era of happiness and mutual understanding.” In Ireland, discontent intensied and took a new form: the long quarrel with Britain was replaced by distrust and ision within Sinn Fein, which led to a bitter civil war the following year. In Northern Ireland, IRA terrorism increased, generating sectarian stre in  parts of Belfast came to resemble the battlefields of the First World War. The Boundary Commission recommended only minor changes, and its report was shelved. Englishmen looked away. “The country”, said Austen Chamberlain, “wants peace and is tired of Ireland and Ulster.” English politicians hoped they would never have to think seriously about Irish affairs again. For nearly  years they had their wish — which meant that that they were fatally handicapped by ignorance when the Ulster crisis of  erupted.l BIBLIOGRAPHY—D.G.Boyce, Englishmen and Irish Troubles: British Public Opinion and the Making of Irish Policy -and “ How to Settle the Irish Question: Lloyd George and Ireland -” in A.J.P.

At this stage of the process, we are accessing a number of dferent scenarios on the possible levels of growth in Cardf up to , and the need for houses to be built to accommodate this growth..removeldquoIt is important that people understand the consequences of the options, as most growth scenarios will have pros and cons with regard to important issues such as land for employment opportunities, the impact on the environment, addressing housing need, supporting the delivery of community and transport infrastructure, and how many truly affordable homes that could be provided.People can respond to the consultation by visiting the website https:cardfldp.consultation.ai, while there will also be focus groups to gather views of people who donrsquot normally respond to council consultations.The next phase of the consultation explores eight options on how the city should accommodate a growing population, and how many homes should be built in the countryside or in urban areas.Option one would extend the existing strategic sites, built on countryside on the outskirts of the city. This would mean more affordable homes and a wider range of housing, due to the cheaper construction costs of building on greenfield sites.Options two and three would see new homes built mostly on urban brownfield sites, meaning land which has already been developed. This would mean denser housing, and could be more expensive to build with less range in size. Option four is similar, but focusing on building around existing district centres to create a lsquocity of villagesrsquo concept.Option five would see new homes built around existing transport links in urban areas while option six would focus growth around proposed transport improvements like the metro and planned new train stations, including on some greenfield sites.Option seven would focus on greenfield sites not already earmarked for development, on countryside on the outskirts of Cardf. Option eight would be a mix of using greenfield and brownfield sites, in urban areas and the countryside, to get the best of both.Cllr Wild added: ldquoAt this stage of the process, all of the options that are presented in the consultation are potential options, rather than preferred options. The preferred strategy could combine a number of these options together. All of the feedback from the public will be considered, alongside further technical work, which will help the council prepare the preferred strategy that will be consulted on with the public in autumn .This consultation follows a previous one held earlier this year, which focused on what the broader goals of the replacement development plan should look like. This included exploring how the city should face problems like coronavirus and the climate crisis. The final plan is expected to be approved in October . article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

While the sample cannot give a  per cent accurate record of public opinion, it does provide a helpful indicator of which way the wind is blowing when it comes to any future Covid policies on vaccinations and restrictions.A few days ago, Germany announced it would be reimposing some restrictions across the nation, as well as bringing in tough new measures aimed specically at unvaccinated people..removeMany leisure and entertainment venues will only be accessible for people who have either been vaccinated or who have recently recovered from Covid, and the German parliament will also consider a general vaccine mandate which,passed, could come into force as soon as February next year.The nation follows neighbouring Austria, which last month brought in lockdown-style rules for people who have not been vaccinated. Around  per cent of people in Austria have been fully vaccinated ndash one of the lowest rates in western Europe.By comparison, some  per cent of people in the UK have been given both jabs, and booster vaccines have already been administered to . per cent of those people who are currently eligible.Asked on Fridayvaccines could ever be made mandatory for the general public in the UK, a spokesman for Downing Street told reporters: \"Wersquove set out our policy on this and wersquove said itrsquos not something that we would look to introduce.\"And earlier this week, Wales health minister Eluned Morgan said such rules were\"not something the Welsh Government has considered\".While health is devolved in Wales, policies regarding vaccines have remained largely the same across the four UK nations, led by common advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation .However, England has taken the additional step of making vaccines mandatory for health and social care workersndash a measure which hasnt been introduced here in Wales. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Soon after they arrived in Belfast it is believed that Mr Lovell died from Black Flu and before he died, and about to be left alone, Mrs Lovell accepted compensation for the damage that the wagon had suffered in the sea crossing and gave up ownership.The vintage horse-drawn caravan has been lovingly restored.It was the custom at that time in some Romany communities that the do was burned when the owner died, hence making this type of caravan particularly rare. This wagon luckily escaped as it had passed out of Mr Lovell’s hands.In  it came into the ownership of Mr McNeill. He completely stripped down, repaired, and repainted the original wood and metal employing the skills of craftsmen such as signwriter   restorer Mark Stead and wheelwright Cecil Watson. Where replacement was necessary, he sourced only authentic materials. Whilst in the restoration process, a museum stated that they estimated therewere only five remaining in the United Kingdom. It is estimated that this number has decreased still further since then.The wagon was transported to Bray, Co Wicklow in  where it had a starring role in the feature film of Charles Dickens’ ‘The Old Curiosity Shop’.Wilsons’ Plant, Machinery and Commercial Manager Richard McFetridge said: “I am delighted Wilsons Auctions have been entrusted to auction off such a special, historical asset. This horse drawn caravan has been meticulously cared for over the years and is a testament to its owners. I have no doubt this extremely rare wagon will be highly sought after and look forward to the outcome of the auction.”Bidding on the wagon will open on Wednesday, December  at pm. Bidders will have a full  hours to take part in the auction and place their bids, as the bidding will time out at pm on Friday, December .

The consultation with key stakeholders will run for a period of  weeks.”The issue first arose inFebruary  when the council received a request from Abbeyville Residents’ Association for five Irish language street signs which was turned down after councillors voted in favour of a policy retaining street signs in English only proposed by Glengormley DUP councillor Alderman Phillip Brett and seconded by Glengormley Ulster Unionist councillor Ald Mark Cisgrove.Ald Brett stressed the importance of the council having a policy on the issue so thatthere were future requests, these could be dealt with “smoothly”.Ald Cosgrove said that given the facts and figures presented to members over the number of Irish language speakers in the borough, the request would be “preposterous” and street signs would look like a “dog’s dinner”.According to the  census,.% of residents in Antrim and Newtownabbey had some knowledge of Irish. In , it was reported that  people in Antrim and Newtownabbey spoke Irish as a main language.However, in September , the council was forced to do a u-turn after being challenged in the High Court by a resident who sought a judicial review over a “deeply held concern that the policy adopted by the local authority was unlawful”. Read hereThe borough councilinsisted that its policy was “not a ban in any way on the Irish language” and a new, “more detailed policy would be drafted for the council to consider”.Commenting on last week’s decision, SDLP group leader Councillor Roisin Lynch said: “I was disappointed that councillors decided to support this deeply restrictive policy. It is a shameless and deliberate attempt to slow down and stymy efforts for dual language signage.“There can be little doubt that this onerous policy is designed to obstruct efforts to progress the visibility of Gaeilge in our local communities. I am particularly disappointed that Alliance Party councillors backed a policy designed to restrict the growth of the language.“It is of vital importance that the Irish language is given the visibility it deserves and that anyone who wishes to see bilingual signage in their area has access to a fair and transparent process. This is a slap in the face to those in our communities, including myself, who know that we need to break down barriers to the visibility of the the Irish language, not create new ones.”Antrim and Newtownabbey Mayor Councillor Billy Webb commented: “This is not an Irish language policy. This is a multi-lingual policy. We are a erse community.“The policy is going out to consultation. We were looking for one third of residents of a street to instigate an application and then  per cent plus one in the actual vote. That is a normal and true democratic process. The DUP was looking for two-thirds.”Michelle Weir, Local Democracy Reporter--A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this article.
