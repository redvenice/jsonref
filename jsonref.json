[{"url":null,"title":"Governments scientists Covid spread China meeting","story":"Share this article But the panel stood firm and said: \u0027Providing information to travellers and providing effective means for screening febrile travellers attending healthcare settings was likely to be a better option.\u0027 Professor Ferguson, who was one of the experts behind the terrifying Imperial College London projections that spooked No10 into Britain\u0027s first lockdown in March, claimed that modelling suggested the benefit would be \u0027low\u0027.He said it would only detect travellers who were not sick before boarding a flight but became ill during the journey. This is because it can take patients several days before they show any signs of being ill. Minutes from the second meeting on January 21 also show that \u0027NERVTAG felt there was a lack of clarity on the exit screening process in Wuhan\u0027.But the group assumed China was stopping travellers with a fever from departing the nation because of statements released by local authorities. And they said it would have little effect – even if Beijing\u0027s bureaucrats weren\u0027t doing it.Dr James Rubin, a psychologist at King\u0027s College London, also warned that screening could lead to \u0027stigma\u0027 for travellers. Documents say: \u0027It was noted that port of entry screening in the UK would be a significant undertaking, especially as fever may not be a very sensitive method of identifying cases.\u0027Fever wasn\u0027t mooted as a symptom until January 30 – the day after the first two coronavirus patients were diagnosed on British soil. Members \u0027largely agreed\u0027 it was a sign of the disease.NERVTAG also said that direct flights out of Wuhan would not be the only way to travel out of the affected area and that the outbreak zone \u0027appears to be expanding\u0027.At the third meeting on January 28, the experts discussed widening the \u0027case definition\u0027 of a Covid patient – a set of criteria to classify whether someone really has Covid.Department of Health bosses warned keeping it just to patients who had been to Wuhan – which had already banned all flights and trains from leaving the city – was inconsistent with the reality of the \u0027changing geographical spread of the virus\u0027.Data at the time revealed there were at least 30 provinces in China with confirmed cases of WN-CoV – the place-holder name for the coronavirus before it was eventually given a title in early February.NERVTAG said \u0027expanding the case definition to the whole of mainland China at this moment in time was not feasible and did not seem appropriate with the information at hand\u0027.But they agreed it should include the whole of Hubei – which is home to around 60million people – and a wider number of provinces. The list of affected areas should be kept under review, NERVTAG also said.Just two days later at the fourth meeting, the group U-turned on their advice and accepted it was \u0027necessary\u0027 to include all of mainland China on the case definition list.Minutes from the meeting say: \u0027Following a short discussion, NERVTAG agreed with DHSC on expansion of the geographical element of the case definition to include the whole of mainland China.\u0027Professor Chris Whitty also said that \u0027feedback\u0027 and the \u0027evolving nature\u0027 of the crisis meant that it would be better to slap the whole country on the list, instead of just a handful of provinces. Professor Van-Tam also argued that any Britons with tell-tale symptoms of Covid who were seeking to be repatriated from China should not be allowed to board an organised flight back to the UK.During the same meeting, NERVTAG said there was \u0027no evidence\u0027 to support that wearing face masks cuts the risk of spreading the virus.  China denies entry to team of WHO experts due to investigate the origins of Covid-19 pandemic amid growing suspicions of a cover-upChina has denied entry to a team of World Health Organisation (WHO) experts who were due to arrive in the country to investigate the origins of the coronavirus.The news comes amid growing suspicions of a cover-up in the country where Covid-19 is believed to have originated at the end of 2019, although its origins remain bitterly contested as China remains determined to control the narrative.The head of the World Health Organisation says he was \u0027disappointed\u0027 that Chinese officials have not finalised permissions for the arrival of the team of experts.A year after the outbreak started, WHO experts were due in China for a highly politicised visit to explore the origins of the coronavirus, in a trip trailed by accusations of cover-ups, conspiracy and fears of a whitewash.The WHO said China granted permission for a visit by its experts, with a 10-person team expected to arrive this week - but before most could even begin their journeys they faced roadblocks, with Beijing yet to grant them entry.The WHO\u0027s emergencies director Michael Ryan said Tuesday that the problem was a lack of visa clearances, adding that he hoped it was a \u0027logistic and bureaucratic issue that can be resolved very quickly.\u0027World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, in a rare critique of Beijing, says members of the international scientific team have begun over the last 24 hours to leave from their home countries to China as part of an arrangement between WHO and the Chinese government.\u0027Today, we learned that Chinese officials have not yet finalised the necessary permissions for the team\u0027s arrival in China,\u0027 he said at a news conference Tuesday in Geneva.\u0027I am very disappointed with this news, given that two members had already begun their journeys and others were not able to travel at the last minute,\u0027 Tedros told reporters in Geneva, in a rare rebuke of Beijing from the UN body.He added that he has \u0027been in contact with senior Chinese officials\u0027 and that he had \u0027once again made it clear that the mission is a priority for the WHO.\u0027I have been assured that China is speeding up the internal procedure of the earliest possible deployment. We\u0027re eager to get the mission under way as soon as possible,\u0027 he said.Earlier this week Chinese authorities had refused to confirm the exact dates and details of the visit, a sign of the enduring sensitivity of their mission.Covid-19 was first detected in the central city of Wuhan in late 2019, before seeping beyond China\u0027s borders to wreak global havoc, costing over 1.8 million lives and eviscerating economies.But its origins remain bitterly contested, lost in a fog of recriminations and conjecture from the international community - as well as obfuscation from Chinese authorities determined to keep control of its virus narrative."},{"url":null,"title":"Actress refuses appear Womans Hour accusing host Emma Barnett degrading ","story":"Share this article Today\u0027s programme about the \u0027Me Too\u0027 movement\u0027 took place one year on from the start of Harvey Weinstein\u0027s court case in America. Barnett was discussing, \u0027what the #MeToo movement has achieved and the unintended consequences.\u0027But the show also sparked anger among some listeners after one of the actresses claimed some women \u0027lied\u0027 about sexual abuse accusations. She told the show: \u0027There are the bad apples out there that jump on the band wagon and maybe aren\u0027t telling the truth..you hope there aren\u0027t too many liars out there.\u0027        "},{"url":null,"title":"Ex Goldman Sachs banker Richard Sharp used Rishi Sunaks boss BBC chairman","story":"Share this article The appointed chairman of the BBC Board -

But they don’t get here all by themselvesWhere I live the most dangerous place to stand right now is in the hallway, when there’s a knock at the door and someone (not me, clearly) is expecting a delivery. Lockdown life is lived at constant risk of being trampled by eager online shoppers about to receive a parcel. One of the somewhat unexpected consequences of the pandemic has been the surge in the volume of packages, goods and meals arriving at our doors throughout the day. The postman always rings twice, but he’s a mere beginner compared with DPD, Yodel, Deliveroo, DHL, UPS …If we cannot go to the shops the shops will have to come to us. And so they have, thanks to the thousands of new drivers and couriers who have emerged to provide this service through parcel companies and platforms. These are hardly secure or well-paid jobs, of course. Rather, it is often a form of bogus “self-employment”, with the drivers – rather than companies they serve – providing their own vehicle, fuel, insurance and so on. Don’t be surprised if they don’t always smile like on the ads.This could be how things are for some time to come. Shouldn’t those of us, then, who are lucky enough to be able to afford it consider tipping, or tipping more generously, some of these hardworking people who come to our doors at all hours, seven days a week? The mixture of surprise and relief that I see whenever I fish out a few quid or top up a Deliveroo rider’s fee tells me that tipping is not all that common. Jonathan Clarke, a musician, told the BBC in November that only one in four of his Deliveroo customers gave a tip.Tipping can be a social and cultural nightmare. On this issue I wear my bourgeois guilt heavily. One Christmas I nearly broke my foot rushing downstairs to try to catch the bin men with my festive envelope.I also had an upsetting experience as a young man on my first work trip to the US, which may have shaped my views. I was staying in a company apartment in downtown Manhattan and ordered in a Chinese meal. A young rider duly appeared at the door and asked for the fee. “Just a minute, I think I’ve got that exactly,” I said in a cheery and doubtless highly irritating English voice. I handed over the precise amount. There was a pause as the uncomprehending young scooter rider stared furiously back at me. And then suddenly he marched off, shouting: “I’m never coming back here!” This was not my only cultural misstep of the night – the light meal I thought I had ordered turned out to be enough to feed a family of four.Not every country or culture believes in tipping. In China or Japan, it is far less common and potentially insulting to offer a tip at the wrong time or in the wrong way. Dutch taxi drivers do not expect a tip, apparently, but French ones do. And so on.Tipping is getting a bit harder in practical terms, as cash becomes a rarer commodity. Notes and coins are not exactly Covid-compliant. But does the cashless technology allow for an easy top-up that will definitely go straight to your server? It is not always clear.I like tipping. Yes, it reduces some sense of guilt. But it’s not just that. Good service should be noticed and rewarded. And low-paid people need more generosity from those who can afford to show it.I was taught this early on. As my father lay in bed, dying as it turned out, just before Christmas, he asked whether I had made sure that the postman and the milkman and the refuse people and the paperboy had received some cash in the traditional end-of-year envelope. This mattered to him. I can’t say he had any profound final words to deliver to the world. But he was certainly thinking about other people right up to the end."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3195f385f9fc8f882a8199299e59d117794853f2/0_135_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=30ca427b32af51ef01edbb792483fc9a","title":"call for pupils without laptops in england to be allowed into schools covid","story":"Guidance says children who lack devices are ‘vulnerable’ and can continue to attend in-person teachingPupils in England who have no access to laptops are designated as “vulnerable children”, the Department for Education has said, meaning they can continue to turn up at school for face-to-face learning during lockdown.The DfE guidance raises questions about whether schools will have the capacity to teach the more than a million children who fall into this category, when they have been told to restrict teaching for at least six weeks as part of efforts to control surging coronavirus cases.It also came as a surprise to the children’s commissioner, Anne Longfield, who learned of the guidance after she had called for pupils to be designated vulnerable if remote learning equipment could not be provided to them. Sources at Longfield’s office questioned why the DfE had made no effort to publicise it.In comments earlier on Tuesday, Longfield had said: “Those children who haven’t got the tech should be offered a priority place in school from Monday.” She also called on companies to provide free data capacity for children and families at a time of “emergency”.A few hours later, a DfE spokesperson said students who do not have a device could continue to attend school, pointing to a page on the gov.uk website that said such children were classified as vulnerable.When asked when that guidance was published, the DfE spokesperson said they would not able to able to establish that until the following day. On Wednesday, the spokesperson said the guidance had been in place since September. The digital ide in England hits poorer pupils hardest, with research by the educational charity Teach First suggesting four of five schools with the poorest pupils do not have enough devices and internet access to ensure all those self-isolating can keep learning.Russell Hobby, CEO of Teach First, said: “Access to high-quality education has always been unequal. But whilst trying to learn from home, the gap between children from wealthier homes and their poorer peers is greatly exacerbated.”More than 560,000 devices were delivered to schools and councils last year, according to the DfE. It announced before Christmas that it had bought 440,000 more.In Oldham, a headteacher said pupils with no broadband at home during the first lockdown last year rode trams all day to make use of free wifi. Glyn Potts, head of Newman Roman Catholic college in Oldham, added that his school had this week received 138 laptops from the central government scheme to add to the 34 they received last year – nine months after making the original request for 237.There were reports elsewhere of 13-year-old pupils submitting schoolwork at midnight because that was the only time they could use the sole computer or smartphone in their home, according to Claire Garside, of the Leeds-based volunteer group Digital Access West Yorkshire.“Every headteacher has told us they’re short of devices. Due to the DfE criteria, headteachers applied for these devices knowing that it wasn’t going to be enough for the children that they know need access,” said Garside.Aside from the shortage of hardware, ministers and telecoms companies faced calls to remove punitive mobile data costs. BCS, the chartered institute for IT professionals, said the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) should negotiate with mobile data providers to apply a “zero-rating” for educational websites in the same way they apply to online NHS resources.“Many low-income families rely on mobile data for internet access, and the average data allowance is much lower. Schools would need to confirm details of the sites they need, but these can be agreed and refined over time,” said Adam Leon Smith, chair of BCS.The DfE drew criticism by posting a photo on Instagram of a warehouse containing some of the 50,000 laptops and tablets due to have been delivered to schools this week.Siobhain McDonagh, the Labour MP who coordinated a letter in which MPs, unions and charities called on Boris Johnson to take action to help “children on the wrong side of the digital ide”, said of the photo: “It beggars belief that the government would celebrate distributing devices almost a year after schools first closed and to just a fraction of the pupils who need them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd0b211489cbe7df1e5e18fba24facac3a4bb9fd/134_0_3358_2016/master/3358.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9f26967ad96206350f78bce33e2b668","title":"a level and gsce students how are you feeling about exams","story":"We would like to hear from students in England about their reaction to summer exams likely being cancelledThe education secretary is due to make a statement in the Commons on Wednesday saying summer exams in core subjects may still go ahead in England.

It happened in 2002, when his unit was ambushed by poachers with AK-47 rifles and a shotgun. He was wounded in the arm and stomach one bullet rupturing his spleen. As a wildlife police officer in Zambia’s Department of National Parks and Wildlife, his job is inherently risky.Like other wildlife protectors, he puts his life on the line every day. But not every animal needing protection is a big beast. Following the incident in 2002 in a park bordering Angola, Mubiana was transferred to Kasanka national park in central Zambia, where he now protects one of nature’s mysteries – and the biggest mammal migration in the world – from poachers and land encroachment. These poachers may be after antelope and elephants, but their actions also pose a threat to the straw-coloured fruit bat, Eidolon helvum.Every year, between October and December, 8–10 million straw-coloured fruit bats descend on the park to feast on an abundance of fruit. From west Africa, over the forests of the Congo basin and on to Zambia, the bats migrate thousands of kilometres over savanna and open land, dispersing seeds into deforested areas, and reforesting and regenerating landscapes on their journey. Scientists are still trying to fathom why these fruit bats, or “flying foxes”, gather at Kasanka in numbers not seen anywhere else. Each night they leave their evergreen swamp fig roosts to fly up to 55 miles (90km) in search of wild berries and fruit.Listed as near threatened on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s red list, the straw-coloured fruit bat is one of the largest fruit bats in Africa. There are fears that if their numbers drop below a certain amount, the colony may not be able to keep going. “If that turns out to be true, we might be in trouble,” says Dr Dina Dechmann of the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior, whose team has studied the bats for 12 years.With the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the bats have faced a new threat from humans seeking to attack them. “These bats are being persecuted because of ongoing publicity about their role as virus hosts. Their importance completely outweighs the potential threat,” says Dechmann, adding that their role in transmitting viruses such as Covid-19 directly to humans has not been scientifically proved.But habitat loss is fast becoming the park’s chief threat. As forests where bats roost and feed are lost, they are increasingly being forced out. “Bats will either need to forage farther, or they will remain in the same location and overuse resources. So it’s a habitat and wildlife management issue just as much as an urban-human bat conflict issue,” says Taylor-Boyd.Areas surrounding the park are also critical for people who rely on the forest for food and income. The trust has helped communities gain legal ownership of 60,000 hectares of surrounding forest, supporting income-generating activities such as beekeeping. Churchill Musungwa, a voluntary forest guard, says his community decided to work with the trust after seeing land nearby destroyed.Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow bioersity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f35b2c7a8d80c8d54fe367ac6b5505c019e25b0/0_352_2746_1648/master/2746.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=3bbfbf43593d0d2741b9f307b7b2812a","title":"vitesse dutch club sporting director johannes spors chelsea brexit","story":"Dutch club’s sporting director Johannes Spors on Chelsea links, Brexit’s impact and strategy that could deliver a European spotJohannes Spors has spent considerable time immersed in football club alliances. As head of recruitment within Red Bull’s operation, he watched players move from Salzburg to Leipzig as outsiders screamed in horror. There was grumbling, too, as Chelsea sent 28 loan players on loan to Vitesse Arnhem following Alexander Chigirinsky’s takeover of the Dutch club. The numbers have diminished vastly but Armando Broja, a 19-year-old striker, has been temporarily – and successfully – dispatched to Arnhem from Stamford Bridge.As Vitesse’s sporting director, Spors is accustomed to questions about Chelsea. “The background is simple,” he says. “The owner is one of Roman Abramovich’s best friends so that comes from a direct friendship. There are no contracts or satellite club agreements or whatever this is two independent clubs who have had a good connection in the past through loan players.But what of a reverse scenario, whereby Chelsea cast admiring glances towards one of the talents in a Vitesse’s squad? “I would definitely open the door for them to talk about it because we have that good relationship but the market determines a price,” Spors says. “They don’t give presents to us and we don’t give presents to someone else.”Recruitment, such a fundamental part of Spors’s role, is about to be affected by Brexit. The situation is particularly notable in the Netherlands, where non-EU players can be signed only when at a premium salary level, albeit reduced for under-20s. “A lot of people aren’t realising this all happens in January,” Spors says. “I’m still getting a lot of contact about taking young English players. I have to tell people that just isn’t possible. I think a lot of people will have a hard confrontation with the new rules, especially until things settle down. We can’t just take any English player we want.“It can really be a game-changer. At the moment, a lot of young talent from Holland and Belgium leave for English academies at an early age. That won’t be possible any more, they’ll have to stay until at least 18 and even then they have to meet the points criteria. For us, other countries – Germany, France – should become stronger in this market as England can’t pick up this talent.”Spors’s own journey is fascinating. At 38, he is the youngest sporting director in the Ereisie and the only one without a professional playing background. Vitesse hired him on that precise basis. “They wanted someone who had worked themselves up to this position,” he says.This year came Spors’s first key decision to find a head coach. His fellow German Thomas Letsch – also formerly of the Red Bull network – was hired by early December, Vitesse sat second in the table and now they are behind third-placed Feyenoord on goal difference.“I made it clear, I am standing for a certain playing style,” says Spors. “It is intense. If you compare to the Premier League, more the Klopp direction than the Guardiola direction.”Spors was a student in Heidelberg when asked to produce video analysis for Hoffenheim. As the club grew under Ralf Rangnick – from Germany’s third tier to the Bundesliga – so, too, did Spors’s involvement. He spent five years as head of first-team match analysis before leading the scouting department. That role, he insists, shouldn’t be as difficult as many portray.“Most important is that the club has a clear strategy,” Spors says. “You have to make clear the way the club wants to play and the definition of the position needed. The scout can only deliver quality when this is clear by profiling. Very often that clear profile or the analytical work is the problem.”Spors is defensive, understandably, of the Red Bull method. Salzburg and Leipzig can no longer work in tandem because of Champions League involvement, which perhaps illustrates its success.“In terms of a development plan for a player, the environment is perfect,” he says. “They had important role models like Naby Keïta: Salzburg to Leipzig to the Premier League. It’s very important for the development of a young player to be at the right level at the right time. Red Bull could always offer this – perfect levels for young players.“From a business point of view, the model makes sense. When you want to be competitive at the highest level, you need a big platform. What made Red Bull strong all the time was smart recruitment of young players to develop. They created value.”Logic suggests Vitesse will finish this season behind the powerhouses from Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Eindhoven. Yet the club’s trajectory is striking. “Qualifying for Europe would be a massive success because that isn’t easy in Holland,” Spors says. “We have to work harder, think smarter.

It shows Lavery apparently casting doubt over the speed at which the regulatory process was carried out for the vaccines.However, Lavery – who is understood to have been spoken to by Starmer’s office – later tweeted that “my words have been taken out of context”, adding that he rejected “any claims that I am in any way opposed to the rollout”. He also praised the scientific community’s achievements on the vaccine.The comments were made in a video broadcast by Socialist Telly – which describes itself as “Grassroots Socialist Television, for the many” – on 3 January. Noting the government’s handling of test and trace, PPE provision and the awarding of public contracts, Lavery said: “Why would anybody have any confidence in the vaccine?”Lavery, who also made reference to the UK’s decision to delay administering the second vaccine dose so more people could get their first jab sooner, made clear he wanted people to get the vaccine. “I want everybody, let me be honest, I want people to take the vaccines, I really, really do and it’s important,” he said.Responding to a clip of the footage, the former Labour MP Mike Gapes – who defected to Change UK in 2019 before losing his seat at the general election – tweeted: “What a disgrace.”Lavery, an ally of the former leader Jeremy Corbyn, served as the party chair for nearly three years until April 2020.On Tuesday, Starmer told ITV’s Good Morning Britain that “we have to deal with the anti-vax campaigns because they will cost lives”, as he explained that he would be prepared to work with the government to pass emergency legislation to deal with them.Lavery tweeted on Tuesday afternoon: “Like everyone else, I am blown away by the achievements of our scientific community in bringing a vaccine forward for a disease we have only known about for a year. My words have been taken out of context and I reject any claims that I am in any way opposed to the rollout.“We now need a national effort to ensure the vaccine is rolled out. I urge everyone to make sure they get the vaccine as soon as possible so we can once again see family and friends and get back to fighting for a better Britain.”Rollout began on Monday for the recently-approved OxfordAstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine, the second to be given the green light in the UK. It follows the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) also authorising the PfizerBioNTech jab last month, which made the UK the first western country to license a vaccine against Covid. Speaking as the Oxford vaccine was approved at the end of last month, the MHRA chief executive, Dr June Raine, stressed “no corners, whatsoever, have been cut”.As England begins a third national lockdown that will last for at least seven weeks to stem the spread of the virus, the government is hoping to deliver a first vaccine dose to those in the four highest-priority groups – 13.9 million people – by mid-February."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1a492d40bbfa7cbd79f24dc3ccd20d124a8f076/0_78_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16fc2f8e0e3130406cd8cc8929d5db88","title":"have you become unemployed due to coronavirus","story":"We would like to hear from those who have lost their jobs due to coronavirusWe would like to hear from people who have lost their jobs as a result of coronavirus.

When police happened upon the scene, the man at the wheel was asleep. To hear him slur his words as officers asked where he was going and where he had been, he might well have been somewhere on the fifth planet from the sun and not in the bedroom community that is Jupiter, Florida. And when he added that, no, he had not been drinking, an officer couldn’t help but wonder, “Are you sure?”Things only got worse once the man – zonked out on prescription drugs, as it happened – staggered his 6ft frame out of the car and on to the cool blacktop, a rippling vision of Florida Man chic in long sleeves, shorts and bare feet. He couldn’t keep his hand down tracking a light beam, couldn’t heel-toe a straight line, couldn’t recite the alphabet because he thought he was being asked “to sing the national anthem backwards.” When the officer asked if he had anything prickly on his person, the man, after an initial denial, confessed to “a few screws in the body” – mementoes from surgeries on his left knee and back. The entire incident goes down in about 20 minutes, maybe less. And as police cam B-roll goes, bless, it’s fairly G-rated. It’s only after the mind races to connect it to the more grisly police videos that have filled our timelines over the past six or so years, and this summer in particular, does this clip from Jupiter leave you breathless. That’s when you realize that, really, could have been the last we ever saw of Tiger Woods.The dashcam footage of Woods’s 2017 DUI stop is just one of the many pivotal moments recalled in Tiger, a two-part documentary on the superstar golfer that debuts on HBO this Sunday in the US, with part two airing the following week. It is a quintessential HBO Sports documentary, which is to say it takes a thorough and fair look at the rise, fall and recovery of one of history’s most sphinxlike figures. You won’t be surprised to learn that Woods politely declined an invitation to participate in this project but, rest assured, his face and voice are well represented in a breadth of archival interviews that date all the way back to his appearance on the Mike Douglas Show at the age of two opposite Jimmy Stewart and Bob Hope.Given how insanely long the 45-year-old Woods has been a certifiably famous person, you may wonder what more there is to learn about a man whose life would become a marker of time in our own. (Where were you when he crushed at Augusta in ’97? Or when he hit that fire hydrant on Thanksgiving in 2009?) But there’s plenty of protein here for viewers who don’t mind reckoning with our shared obsession with “godding up” sports heroes and celebs just to watch them tumble. “The interesting thing to me is how quickly and how much glee the media – and, in some quarters, the public – took in his downfall,” says Matthew Hamachek, who is the co-director of Tiger alongside Matt Heineman. “That was very telling.”In Woods’s case, though, the lofty expectations started with his late father, Earl – who famously told Sports Illustrated’s Gary Smith that his son was “The Chosen One”. Earl’s presence looms large in the first-half of the documentary, and there’s no missing the bond between father and son in the pride and power with which the boy repeatedly refers to himself as black. It isn’t until the Nike money starts rushing in and Earl’s philandering become a threat to his son’s saintly brand image (oh, the irony) that you hear Tiger referring to his race as “Cablinasian”. Never mind if that wasn’t the word Jupiter police used in their report.Woods’s DUI charge, which was lawyered down to a reckless driving plea, lingers in the doc like a baddie in a slasher flick. But safe shelter is easy enough to find among a slew of supporting characters in Tiger, who range from close family friend Pete McDaniel to longtime bagman Steve Williams – none of whom, alas, are close to Woods now. And yet: “The thing that was most surprising to me in the process is that people who even had acrimonious splits from Tiger are all fiercely protective of him,” Hamachek says. “These are people who really had a front-row seat to the pressures and expectations thrust upon him and felt like part of their job was to protect him from the world. Earning these people’s trust was extremely difficult.”Dina Parr, the golfer’s high school sweetheart, experienced one of the harsher Woods breakups, via letter. And yet her home videos of a teenage Woods cutting loose offer a glimpse into the sweet soul underneath the driver-clobbering automaton in that blood-red Sunday polo.But she is unlikely to be the woman in Woods’s life in which viewers of this documentary are most interested. Nor for that matter is Elin, his ex-wife and mother to his two children. No, that honor goes to Rachel Uchitel, the first of several women to be outed as a Woods mistress and easily the biggest get for the makers of the documentary. And to watch the show reflect on the fevered tabloid media effort to out her and Woods’s other paramours in 2009, with the daily revelations of lose-my-number voicemails and the golfer’s marathon sex drive, is to be reminded of a simpler time when the National Enquirer – not TMZ – was the sleaziest gossip rag and Taiwanese news animation was totally a thing.Woods’s sex-addicted downward spiral fuel the doc’s second half, and it leaves you wondering whether Elin might have forgiven her husband’s transgressions if they had been flings and not fully blown emotional relationships, and whether Woods has even one black women in his life. They don’t surface in his romantic life, and they don’t surface in this documentary either. “I don’t think it’s happenstance,” says executive producer Sam Pollard. “Growing up in America as a person of color, when you’re engaged in the white world, sometimes you don’t connect with your own people like people assume that you would.” Not even Royce, the older half-sister from Earl’s first marriage who fed Woods and did his laundry while he was breaking NCAA records at Stanford, makes an appearance. Think of this as the white space in an otherwise textured portrait of a complicated man.At the very least, Tiger should leave you feeling sympathetic for the man – who, despite his incredible athletic gifts and huge fame, never looked like he chose to be The Chosen One. It could well have you going back to read the statement he released after the police killing of George Floyd and how far out of the way it went to empathize with law enforcement who “train so diligently to understand how, when and where to use force.” Those words, typical Woods, seemed so cautious and even cowardly then – especially when compared to the more assertive tone struck by Michael Jordan, the greatest political fence sitter of all time until last summer. But after watching the doc you appreciate the statement for what it is – the words of a man who is just trying to survive another day in America. Sounds mighty black to me."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5cc27fe2d5b6e889d333c4931a8d0dc8a0c5247/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=e1f3f0b19bcadb6c6e86060208df8426","title":"georgia senate runoff elections live results","story":"Democrat Raphael Warnock secures historic victory as outstanding Senate race draws to a closeVoters in the state of Georgia returned to the polls on Tuesday to cast their ballots in two runoff elections that will determine control of the US Senate. The results will significantly affect the extent to which President-elect Joe Biden will be able implement his agenda.In the November general election the Democrats maintained their hold on the House of Representatives, but fell short of the 51 seats needed to retake the Senate, where the Republicans have had a majority for the past six years.Tom McCarthy said: “Control of the US Senate is on the line. If the Democrats win both races, the president-elect will gain a big opportunity to build a progressive legacy. If Democrats lose one or both races, the country will enter at least a two-year period of ided government, with the Republican Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, retaining power and likely frustrating Biden’s agenda.“If Democrats win both races, the Senate would be split 5050, but Democrats would effectively control the body with Kamala Harris, the vice-president-elect, in her role as president of the Senate, breaking any ties in a strict party-line vote.Tom McCarthy said: “The Republican candidates include one sitting senator – the wealthy appointee Kelly Loeffler, 50 – and one senator whose term has just ended, David Perdue, 71.“Challenging the Republicans are fresh faces on the Democratic side. Documentary film-maker Jon Ossoff, 33, a former congressional staffer and failed House candidate, is running to replace Perdue, while Atlanta pastor and first-time candidate Rev Raphael Warnock, 51, is running to unseat Loeffler.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57695ecad375c7e19a627f668bc1967b76d09503/0_33_4598_2757/master/4598.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=17cf653e668b2d477ea431a288fbfc83","title":"i have never felt safe uk shielders on new lockdown","story":"The vulnerable share their concerns and reveal how the new restrictions will affect their lives Kate Osborn breathed an immense sigh of relief when Boris Johnson advised the clinically extremely vulnerable to begin shielding again. Not for herself, she continued to shield and work from home throughout last year, but for all of those who could not live off £94 statutory sick pay.“I’ve been concerned about other shielders risking their lives,” she said. “I know people who had to go into frontline work when shielding ended on 1 August. All it did was take away the statutory protection. I’ve had a terrible guilt for people who have not been able to shield.”The 50-year-old teacher from Cambridgeshire, who has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a lung disease, as well as severe asthma, and has been teaching remotely while her children have stayed away from home, says all shielders should have had a choice of whether to continue isolating.“I’m glad to be shielding again,” says teaching assistant Sharon, who takes immunosuppressant medication for Crohn’s – which led her to be hospitalised last year – and did not wish for her surname to be published.“It’s right for kids to be in school but I’ve never felt that safe. The first lockdown I didn’t even leave the garden – you weren’t allowed to leave your premises so I didn’t do anything at all, it was awful. But then all of a sudden I’m in a classroom with some 30 kids and two teachers, packed in like sardines.”Aaron Foulds, 49, an insurance broker with asthma so severe that he has been hospitalised following chest infections on a number of occasions, never stopped shielding – only venturing outside, to the hospital, three time since 13 March.“It doesn’t take me much to get out of breath, it’s not something I can risk getting, the outcomes are not expected to be any good” he says of contracting Covid.But Foulds, who lives in Keyleigh, West Yorkshire, is most concerned about the delay to the second dose of the vaccine: “Changing it without any concrete evidence seems to be quite a risky strategy. The government have no form in getting these decisions right: ‘Wear a mask’, ‘don’t wear a mask’ ‘Eat out to help out’, ‘don’t go out’. It just worries me this is another one they might get wrong.” He said he will only “take a chance” and go outside after he had received a second shot of the vaccine. “I take vitamin D supplements too, and again that was off my own back early doors,” he added.But retired electrical engineer Jim Petrie, 78, who has COPD, feels mass restrictions are tantamount to effectively placing people “under house arrest”, and just wants the freedom to continue to stay active – playing golf regularly and attending his local health club in Glasgow.“Covid would certainly be very bad for me, but I want to be able to decide for myself so long as I’m not affecting other people,” he says. Scotland’s chief medical officer wrote to shielders on Monday saying they should stay at home as much as possible: “We are not advising you stop going outside, which we know is good for mental and physical health.”Petrie also believes there have been failures throughout the pandemic. “The problem is both the faulty PCR testing and exaggerated forecasts. I’m losing my liberty because the authorities have not being doing their jobs properly preparing the NHS for a national emergency.”But others are more sympathetic to the dilemma facing the government. “I don’t want to see everyone locked behind closed doors but the only way to do anything about it is to stay away from other people,” says 64-year-old Ian Deacy, a building services engineer who is immunosuppressant due to medication taken for rheumatoid arthritis, of the rising transmission rate.“We should’ve locked down before Christmas, I don’t think the festive mixing was a good idea. I’d sooner miss one Christmas and make it to the next one.”Deacy, from Leicester, who has been furloughed since March, says he is also hunkering down and waiting for the jab. “The sooner the injection comes the better. However I’ll be in a position where I’m injected and my wife won’t be and might have to go to the office.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1c8ae09f2f77683648cd80c0f72272d1bc34ece/24_0_3767_2262/master/3767.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=be696ce7d09fa22be1c7778f2de0b880","title":"england prepares for a wintry third lockdown in pictures","story":"Empty streets and shuttered shops as England grits its teeth for a new lockdown, with people allowed to leave their homes for limited reasons only, and measures expected to stay until mid-February or even March"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/447d31a890917a65b9e3a0222679c43be9f2afe7/0_0_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b30693ab033e6df04dd2a425a9f685c","title":"coronavirus live news who chief very disappointed after china blocks wuhan visit 1 in 50 infected in uk","story":"Moderna is second vaccine to get EU approval Japan under pressure to impose state of emergency for TokyoThe European Union should send coronavirus vaccines to its Balkan neighbours and do more to combat the virus in Ukraine, 13 of the EU’s foreign ministers said in a joint letter to the bloc’s executive.Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Sweden said the EU would not be safe from Covid-19 until countries on its borders could also recover from the pandemic.“We strongly support the efforts and initiatives by member states and the European Commission to share the vaccines from the allocated contracts with the closest EU neighbours, such as the Western Balkan countries,” the ministers said in the 6 January letter, which was made public.Lithuanian foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said separately it was “our duty to extend a helping hand to EU partners in the east, Western Balkans and other regions”.EU countries launched a mass Covid-19 vaccination drive on 27 December, but Balkan nations - poorer than EU member states - have not been able to negotiate the same access to Covid-19 vaccines with drugmakers. Other neighbouring governments have no clear schedule for their national inoculation programmes.The European Commission said it received the letter and would reply to those governments, telling reporters it was looking at ways to help Balkan countries and other neighbours, including Georgia and Ukraine.The six Balkan countries of Albania, Bosnia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia, all of which apart from Albania emerged from the 1990s break-up of Yugoslavia, are considered future EU members.Like much of the continent, Covid-19 infections have rocketed across the Western Balkans since October, with hospitals close to being overwhelmed by incoming patients.The daily number of Covid-19 cases in Portugal, a nation of just over 10 million people, reached a record high of 10,027 on Wednesday, as the country prepares to approve an extension of a state of emergency to fight a worrying increase in infections. The critical care wards of major hospitals in Peru and Bolivia stand at or near collapse after end-of-year holidays, reflecting wider regional public health capacity concerns as much of Latin America struggles to secure adequate Covid-19 vaccine supplies.While infection counts remain below last year’s peak, depleted resources, weary medical workers and a recent rush of severe cases are taxing already ailing healthcare systems from Chile to Mexico, officials say.In Bolivia, long lines of patients seeking tests snaked along the street outside a hospital complex in the city of La Paz, prompting fears of worsening contagion amid the chaos.Oscar Romero, the director of the Clinicas hospital in La Paz, said the difference now was that more patients were requiring intensive care, calling the second wave “far more serious”.In neighbouring Peru, hospitals in the capital, Lima, and nearby Callao, which together service a population of 10 million, had only 16 ICU beds with ventilators available early this week, according to a report from the Peruvian ombudsman’s office. Farther north along the coast, hospitals were full, the report said.“We’re now paying for the behaviour of the past few weeks,” Fernando Padilla, a regional health chief in northern Peru, told reporters. He said Peruvians had become too relaxed, failing to take proper precautions to avoid contagion.The scramble for hospital beds comes in a region where many countries have been slow to lock down vaccine supplies. Bolivia and Peru have lagged well behind some wealthier neighbours, only recently signing deals to procure vaccines. Neither country has begun to vaccinate its residents.The procurement issues are not unique to the region’s poorest countries. Regional power Brazil, suffering from the world’s second-deadliest outbreak, has yet to approve a single vaccine. Travel has been restricted in a northern Chinese city of 11 million as authorities move to snuff out a Covid-19 cluster, while health officials in another province detected a new virus strain found in South Africa.Ten major highways leading into the city of Shijiazhuang, around 300km (200 miles) south of Beijing, have been closed and a bus terminus was also shut in an attempt to prevent the virus spreading beyond the city in Hebei province.There have been 117 cases in the city – including at least 63 more reported on Wednesday – 78 of which were asymptomatic, prompting mass testing across the affected area.The same day, health authorities in southern Guangdong province reported a case involving a mutant virus strain found in South Africa.The strain detected in China was isolated from a swab of a South African pilot who had entered the province in December and tested positive for Covid-19, said the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention.Its announcement comes days after China confirmed its first case of a new coronavirus variant detected in Britain, prompting widespread concern as both strains are said to be more infectious.Unlike much of the world, China has largely brought the virus under control through strict lockdowns and travel restrictions. But there have been a series of local outbreaks in recent weeks, prompting mass testing and targeted lockdowns.The village of Xiaoguozhuang within the city boundary has been classified as a “high risk” district and sealed off. Health authorities said all 40,000 residents in that district have been tested for the virus.State TV showed villagers being tested by staff in full hazmat suits and protective wear, with roadblocks staffed by police and medical workers. All schools in Shijiazhuang have been closed.State broadcaster CCTV showed teams of health workers spraying disinfectant across streets and said an emergency team of medical workers had been sent to the city.More than 400,000 residents of another nearby city, Nangong, have also been tested, authorities said.Beijing is also racing to vaccinate millions ahead of the Lunar New Year travel rush next month.British prime minister Boris Johnson said the coronavirus marathon had turned into a hopeful sprint to vaccinate millions in the weeks ahead but justified another lockdown to relieve crisis-hit hospitals.Hastily recalled lawmakers are to vote on the lockdown retrospectively after it took effect across England overnight, forcing schools to close this week as part of a stay-at-home order, while the UK’s other nations have imposed similar curbs.Johnson said a variant strain of the virus that emerged in south-east England last month was spreading with “frightening ease and speed”, worsening one of the world’s worst death tolls.Official data show that one in 50 people in England were infected last week, rising to one in 30 in London, and many hospitals say they are swamped with Covid-19 patients.“It is inescapable that the facts are changing, and we must change our response,” Johnson told the House of Commons, noting the lockdown would stay in legal force until 31 March but would be reviewed in mid-February.By then, the government plans to have given a first vaccine dose to about 14 million people including everyone over 80, care home residents and all frontline medics in the National Health Service (NHS).Britain was the first country to start rolling out vaccines last month with the PfizerBioNTech shot, and this week began injections of a home-grown jab developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca.So far, more than 1.3 million people have received a first dose of one or the other vaccine across the UK, and the government is delaying follow-up doses in order to spread as much protection around the population as possible.Madrid’s regional authorities have launched an investigation into a report that a care home allowed priests and relatives of workers to be vaccinated against Covid-19 in contravention of rules.Only care home residents and staff are supposed to be vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine under Madrid regional health authority regulations.However, relatives of some of the staff at Casablanca Valdesur nursing home, in Valdemoro, south of Madrid, also received injections of the vaccine, eldiario.es, an online newspaper, reported on Wednesday.“We have launched an investigation into the claim,” a Madrid regional government spokesman said.Grupo Casablanca, a care home company contracted by regional authorities to administer the vaccine to 1,600 people in a series of homes, said the drug has a life of two hours if not used.To avoid wasting doses, it was used on people who were not staff or residents at the Valdesur home, the company said, adding rules were followed at all other homes.It said in a statement:Some anomalies have been detected in the selection of people vaccinated against Covid-19 who are not residents of the Casablanca Valdesur nursing home, but who belong to their environment.The Casablanca group assumes responsibility for what happened and regrets the consequences that these anomalies in the selection process may have caused.Dozens of Bulgarian men danced and sang in the cold waters of the Tundzha river in the central Bulgarian town of Kalofer to mark the Christian holiday of Epiphany on Wednesday, ignoring curbs imposed to stem the spread of the coronavirus.In a popular ritual, Orthodox priests cast a crucifix into a lake or river, and it is believed that the person who retrieves it will be freed from evil spirits and will be healthy through the year. Despite calls from authorities to cancel the celebration, about 70 men from Kalofer took part in the ritual, while dozens gathered along the river banks to watch it.“We tried … not to have it, but there was no way. Even if we did not help them, they would have done it anyway,” said Kalofer mayor Rumen Stoyanov. “This is an important event for the community… We tried to limit the access, but we could not.”After the crucifix was recovered, the men put their arms around each other’s shoulders, sang and danced in a circle to music played on drums and bagpipes.The event in Kalofer sparked heated debates on social networks, where some supported it while others called for the men and the town to be fined for breaking rules they fear may fuel coronavirus infections.Christians in Greece also defied bans on public gatherings to mark one of the most important religious days in the Eastern Orthodox Church commemorating the baptism of Christ and the revelation of the Holy Trinity.Bulgaria, which ranks second in number of deaths per capita from Covid-19 in the EU, managed to limit the surge in new infections after closing schools, restaurants and banning large public gatherings since late November.On Wednesday, the Balkan country reported 1,310 new cases, bringing the total to 205,390, including 7,902 deaths. Portugal’s president, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, is self-isolating after being in contact with someone who tested positive for Covid-19.The 72-year-old is campaigning to win a second term as the country’s president in an election on 24 January. He has several presidential debates scheduled before then.In a statement shared on his official website, Rebelo de Sousa’s office said the contact was with a member of Casa Civil, a body of specialists who provide consultation services to the president.Rebelo de Sousa is waiting for the health authority to decide if the exposure was high risk and for how long he will have to stay at home, the statement said.The European drugs regulator could shortly approve an amendment to its approval of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine that would permit the extraction of six doses from a vial instead of five, an EU official has told Reuters.The source, who asked to remain anonymous because discussions are not public, said the change to the authorisation could come “very soon”.The European Medicines Agency recommended on 21 December the conditional approval of the Pfizer vaccine. Under that authorisation, five doses should be extracted from each vial. The change could add a requirement for the use of special syringes that allow the precise extraction of more doses from the same vial, the official said.“The responsible people in the member states should order these special syringes (Low Dead Space Syringes) now,” EU lawmaker Peter Liese said, adding they were widely available and could cost as little as €0.09 ($0.1) each.The EU has secured 200m doses, and has taken up an option for another 100m. It is also in talks for a new order of 50 - 100m doses, EU officials told Reuters on Tuesday.EU states could use EU vaccines in different ways from those recommended by EMA, but if they do so they face liability risks.Top Serbian politicians have urged greater international acceptance of Russia’s coronavirus vaccine, as they joined the front of their country’s queue for shots, days after Moscow delivered the first consignment.The first batch of 2,400 doses of Sputnik V vaccine arrived on 30 December, and Russian sovereign fund RDIF said it had agreed to supply more up to a total of two million.Serbia started inoculations with the two-stage drug on Wednesday, including a shot for parliament speaker Ivica Dačić, who urged the World Health Organization to register it.“You heard certain statements that (international) travel will be allowed for those who get the Pfizer shot only,” he said. “I would not be surprised if they (the statements) turn to be true as a kind of political pressure.”So far only the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech - with which Serbia kicked off a mass inoculation drive last month - has been granted emergency WHO approval.Interior minister Aleksandar Vulin, known for his pro-Moscow stance, was also among the first to get the Sputnik shot. “I wanted to get the Russian vaccine, because I believe in Russian medicine,” he told reporters.Russia has so far signed agreements to supply Sputnik V to Argentina, Mexico, Bolivia, Venezuela, Uzbekistan, Algeria, Egypt, Nepal and India and has production partners for the drug in several countries.Serbia, which officials say also plans to obtain the vaccines from AstraZeneca, Moderna and China’s Sinopharm, has registered almost 350,000 cases of Covid-19 with 3,405 deaths.Ireland plans to vaccinate about 10,000 people a week with the Moderna vaccine, deputy prime minister Leo Varadkar has said, after Europe’s drug regulator gave the vaccine the green light.The government’s current schedule is to vaccinate 135,000 people by the end of February with the PfizerBioNTech vaccine, the only Covid-19 vaccine approved for use in the country.Germany intends to stick to recommendations by BioNTech and Pfizer regarding the administration of a second dose of their Covid-19 vaccines rather than delaying it, health minister Jens Spahn said.Germany has asked an independent expert panel for advice on whether to allow a delay in administering the second dose to make scarce supplies go further, after a similar move by Britain last week.“My impression is that it makes a lot of sense, especially with these sensitive issues, where trust and reliability are important, that we stick to the approval,” Spahn told a news conference, adding that this was in line with the initial feedback he had received from the vaccination experts.He also spoke out against mixing or switching between Covid-19 vaccines, which some nations are also considering to stretch scarce supplies.Germany’s 83 million residents will receive more than 130m Covid-19 vaccine doses, enough for everybody who needs to receive the shots, Spahn said.He said he expects first deliveries of the vaccine developed by Moderna next week. The European Medicines Agency earlier on Wednesday approved the US drugmaker’s vaccine for emergency use.Germany will receive 50m doses of the Moderna vaccine this year, of which 2m doses are expected in the first quarter, he said. Vaccines are our best hope for controlling Covid-19, but they should be delivered in ways that we know are effective, writes Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the Georgetown Center for Global Health Science and Security, and Ilan Schwartz, an infectious diseases doctor at the University of Alberta, Canada.Academics and lawmakers have been seduced by the idea of reducing the two-dose schedule for mRNA vaccines to just one dose, delaying the second dose until more people receive the initial immunisation, or even decreasing the dose of vaccine by half, all with the goal of getting more shots into more arms as quickly as possible. The notion of maximising the number of vaccinated people by these methods has rapidly gained support. In a time of crisis, regulators might be justified in making a decision such as this with little data in order to make the most of limited vaccine supplies and protect as many people as possible.However, in this case, they are not, both because it’s not supported by the data that we do have, and because it doesn’t address the actual problem currently facing the UK, the US, and Canada, which is the distribution of existing supplies.Ukrainian police and health officials are investigating reports that some citizens have been illegally getting inoculated against Covid-19 with vaccines that have not been officially approved, prime minister Denys Shmyhal said.Ukraine, which has registered more than one million Covid-19 infections and 19,357 deaths so far, has yet to approve any of the newly developed vaccines, though it signed a contract in December to buy 1.9m doses of China’s Sinovac vaccine and the shots are expected to be delivered soon.Some Ukrainian media outlets reported on Wednesday that a clinic in Kyiv had begun inoculating people, probably with the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, at a charge of up to €3,000 per dose.The reports said the vaccine could have been brought in from Israel and that several top officials and businessmen had been vaccinated.“None of the vaccines are currently certified in Ukraine. And I’m sure no rational person would get vaccinated with drugs of unknown origin,” Shmyhal said.Shmyhal said last month the first shots of the Chinese vaccine could arrive in February. Ukraine also hopes in March to receive the first batch of 8m doses of vaccines under the global Covax facility, set up to provide vaccines to poorer countries.A Ukrainian pharmaceutical company backed by a prominent Russian-leaning opposition figure said this week it had applied for state approval to make Russia’s Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine.Coronavirus infections in Ukraine began rising again in September and have remained consistently high ever since, triggering several national lockdowns.The Covid-19 vaccine developed by Moderna is expected to also be effective against the new variant of coronavirus detected in Britain, the Dutch national drugs authority CBG said.The CBG said the European Commission was expected to give the final stamp of approval to the Moderna jab on Wednesday, after the European Medicines Authority gave its approval earlier."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"About 335,600 people will receive the benefit this weekThe first test is for governments to stop subsidising fossil fuel industry which knowingly contributed to global over-heatingEvery 0.1 degree matters as the world attempts to keep within 1.5-degree rise"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4450007.1609793884!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"why is ireland s covid vaccination campaign off to such a slow start","story":"December 29th, 2020: Dublin grandmother Annie Lynch (79) became the first person in the Republic to receive the coronavirus vaccine on Tuesday afternoon.

Photograph: Liam McBurneyPA WireWith coronavirus numbers out of control in Ireland and many other countries, there will inevitably be intense focus on progress made by governments in vaccinating their populations against Covid-19.In 12 months’ time, the difference between a slow and a fast rollout of vaccines here will probably be measurable in terms of the loss of hundreds of lives, along with tens of thousands of jobs.So far Ireland has got off to a slow start, leaving the Government and health officials open to accusations of sluggishness and delay. By the end of December one in every 2,500 people had been vaccinated, compared with one in eight in Israel and one in 80 or so in the US and the UK. By that date 1,800 Irish people had been immunised, according to Our World in Data, compared with more than 40,000 in Denmark, a country with a slightly bigger population than our own.The criticisms will only intensify as soaring case numbers heap further pressure on the health service and force much of society to remain shut. The best answer to them is to make serious inroads into vaccinating the population, but this is contingent of there being enough supply.This, in turn, depends on authorisations from EU and Irish regulators, which have tended to lag behind other jurisdictions so far. Another factor is the size of the order made by the EU on behalf of member states for inidual vaccines.It was only after serious pressure from Germany that the European Medicines Agency brought forward its decision last month on the PfizerBionNTech vaccine, and now it is due to make a decision on the Moderna vaccine in the coming days.The agency is not alone among regulators in having issues with the application by OxfordAstra Zeneca for its vaccine, and its requirement for extra data to be provided has pushed back a decision on this until February.Workhorse vaccineThe problem is that this vaccine was conceived as the workhorse of European vaccination programmes, because it is cheap, easy to transport and works in a way similar to existing vaccines, unlike the PfizerBioNTech and Moderna treatments, which use novel technology.The EU went for a strategy of not putting all its eggs in the one basket by placing orders for six different vaccines. It may also, with the benefit of hindsight, have spent too long haggling over price. A number of last year’s likely contenders got delayed, and regulatory decisions moved slowly, leaving the bloc with insufficient orders for the vaccine that was out of the traps first, PfizerBioNTech.As a result, there is little point in the Irish vaccination programme “getting ahead of itself” until a secure and ample pipeline of vaccines comes on stream. Until that happens, we will have to make the best use of what we have. The UK has delayed the second dose of the vaccine so that a greater number can be administered a first dose and so enjoy the partial protection this offers. This approach has split scientific opinion. Even the drug manufacturers are ided, with Pfizer resolutely opposed to any delay in administering a second dose of its vaccine and AstraZeneca more favourably disposed to the idea.For now, this approach has been ruled out in Ireland but another idea we may adopt from the UK is to extract six doses from a vial of PfizerBionNTech vaccine rather than the recommended five. When the right needle is used, the content of the dose can be split six ways, rather than being used five times and leaving some fluid over. This could potentially increase productivity by up to 20 per cent.Who’s the boss?Some countries have decided to start their vaccination programme with working-age adults rather than vulnerable care home residents, but this approach is unlikely to find favour in Ireland.At this point, it is difficult to tell who is running the vaccine rollout programme here. Is it the Department of Health, which has decided the public health response during the pandemic? Or the HSE, which is administering the vaccinations? Or the taskforce that drew up an implementation plan and is still active?While the UK started administering the OxfordAstra Zeneca vaccine at 7.30am on Monday, Irish journalists seeking updates on supplies of the Moderna vaccine here were being referred by the Department of Health to the HSE, and by the HSE to the department. A plan for vaccinations in nursing homes was delayed on Monday, seemingly over consent issues. GPs are still wondering when they and their staff will be immunised.At least Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly was able to announce an increase in this week’s vaccination target from 20,000 to 35,000.None of these early teething issues will matter in the long run, hopefully, but greater clarity would do no harm.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4451459.1609933609!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"aengus mac grianna apologises over blasphemous new year s eve sketch","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIn a tweet Aengus Mac Grianna said he wished to apologise for the sketch. “Truly I am deeply sorry for the offence, distress and hurt caused.

Photograph: Collins.Gardaí must be among the groups given high-priority for receiving the Covid-19 vaccine due to members of the force facing an “increased danger of exposure” to the disease in their work, a representative organisation has said.The HSE is understood to have met several unions on Wednesday to provide a briefing on the planned rollout of vaccinations over the coming months.Frank Thornton, president of the Garda Representative Association (GRA), called for gardaí to be prioritised.“The GRA is receiving numerous reports of gardaí who have contracted the virus or are self-isolating in the past week which shows the danger of infection for gardaí as frontline workers in the battle against Covid-19 must be recognised by policymakers,” he said. “Gardaí have been to the fore in the national effort to suppress the virus from the onset of the outbreak and the level of infections and self-isolation is sky-rocketing.”Fifteen gardaí in the Dublin politan Region (DMR) have tested positive for Covid-19 since Christmas, according to sources. In contrast, by mid-May only a dozen gardaí had tested positive in the entire country, almost three months after the virus had arrived in Ireland. A number of gardaí in north Co Cork are self-isolating after outbreaks of Covid-19 at two stations. Garda sources said the HSE had confirmed more than six cases at two stations in the North Cork Division.Close contactsA number of close contacts from both stations are also having to isolate following the outbreaks, which come as increasing numbers in the force contract the disease in line with a general upsurge in the virus. In Meath, two Garda units have been stood down after one garda tested positive and two others started displaying symptoms. A total of 20 gardaí in the region are off-duty and self-isolating as a result.Mr Thornton said this shows the “increased danger of exposure” faced by members and their families.“It also points to the risk of resources being stretched at a time when the need for gardaí to police the pandemic has increased,” he said.“With plans to vaccinate up to 135,000 people by the end of February, and a month-long lag in full efficacy, it is imperative that frontline gardaí are given the protection of the vaccine as soon as possible.”Mr Thornton added that early vaccination will reduce the number of gardaí forced to isolate and ensure they remain available to protect communities around the country.The Garda Press office declined to comment on inidual cases or outbreaks at identified stations but said the disease was not affecting its capacity to carry out its work.The statement added that HSE guidelines, supported by internal medical guidance, are routinely circulated to all members, who are expected to fully comply. Tied-upMeanwhile, Naval Service sources on Wednesday confirmed that two ships, the LE Ciara and the LE William Butler Yeats, have been forced to tie up at Haulbowline Naval Base following suspected outbreaks of Covid-19 among crew.It is understood that some crew members aboard the LE Ciara began to feel unwell more than a week ago and the ship was berthed as crew isolated themselves. Some crew aboard the LE William Butler Yeats began to feel unwell in recent days and they took similar action.The Defence Forces Press Office confirmed the presence of COVID-19 in the Naval Service but said that for operational security reasons, it was unable to comment on what vessels or units are affected by the current outbreak. “We are prioritising the health and well-being of our personnel while continuing framework operations and maintaining vessels at high readiness for Maritime Defence and Security Operations as required,” it said.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4451371.1609930744!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"construction industry says evidence does not support shutdown","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe ‘exemplary record’ of the construction sector in protecting workers from Covid-19 has been defended amid an expectation that work on most building sites will be halted due to the surge in new cases of the disease. Image: iStock.The construction industry is “redoubling” efforts to prevent the spread of Covid-19 on sites since the Christmas period, but expects the Government to restrict activity following a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday.Tom Parlon, director general of the Construction Industry Federation, said he was shocked to learn that the Government was considering closing down the sector in an attempt to control the recent spike.The Cabinet is expected to order that nearly all construction work should stop until the end of the month, with exceptions for social housing, urgent repairs and critical projects.“Due to the escalating situation of Covid-19, the construction industry understand that the Government will decide to restrict activity,” Mr Parlon told The . “The nature of those restrictions is still not clear and clarity is urgently required.”Mr Parlon said the industry has had “an excellent track record” at keeping Covid-19 off sites and managing it when on site. “At no point were combined cases over 56 during the previous nine months,” he said.“The rate of infection per employee industry-wide ranged from 0.003 per cent to 0.035 per cent during this period amongst our 147,000 employees. This is considerably below the population average at all times.“Companies are redoubling their efforts to preventscreen Covid from being imported from the community after the Christmas period.“Testing, screening and constant communication with sub-contractors and employees is underway. The message is if you are a close contact or exhibit any symptoms do not show up to work.”Mr Parlon pointed out that the spike in Covid-19 incidence occurred during the recent “relaxation phase” and during a period “when industry wasn’t open”.“The HSE are constantly monitoring incidence on site through their steering committee,” he said. “Construction sites are recognised as positive in terms of managing and mitigating Covid-19 thus helping prevent the spread due to its world class standard operating procedure.“Finally, no other country – barring some US states and Italy in the initial wave – have shut down construction during lockdowns. Most recently, the UK and Scotland have entered lockdown and left construction operational.Output droppedMr Parlon said that during the first lockdown, when most work in the sector was halted, about 5,000 homes had not been built and output had dropped by 10 per cent at a cost of €3 billion to the industry and the economy.During discussions in recent days, Mr Parlon said he had been assured that the construction of housing and work on educational projects would continue.“We will continue to work with the HSE, the HSA and the wider Government on monitoring the situation and will follow the advice as provided by these bodies,” Mr Parlon added.Construction worker Brendan Hennessy told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland there had been no issues on the sites he had worked on from when activity resumed after the first lockdown up to Christmas.He said workers were clocking in at different times, following one way systems, using canteens at different time and that everything worked well.He said, in his experience, workers were not car pooling and people were not allowed on to sites without having their temperature checked.Developer Michael O’Flynn told the same programme he appreciated how serious the Covid-19 situation has become in recent week.However, he questioned why it would be seen as safe to build social housing but not private housing, with an exception expected to be given for one over the other.Mr O’Flynn said the impact of a shutdown for people awaiting a home should be considered and said there should be a consistency in the approach.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"Northern Ireland secretary could detract from Blair statement of regret, officials feared-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4451349.1609914478!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"china blocks entry to who team studying origins of covid 19","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus expressed  dismay at news a team investigating the origins of Covid-19 had not been allowed into China. Photograph: World Health OrganisationAFP via Getty Images.China has blocked the arrival of a team from the World Health Organisation (WHO) that is investigating the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, claiming that their visas had not yet been approved even as some members of the group were on their way.WHO\u0026nbspdirector general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus expressed his dismay at the move and said he had called on China to allow the team in.“I’m very disappointed with this news, given that two members have already begun their journeys, and others were not able to travel at the last minute,” he said.“But I have been in contact with senior Chinese officials. And I have once again made made it clear that the mission is a priority for WHO and the international team.”The WHO has been attempting to send in the team of global experts from a number of countries for some months. It has been talking with Chinese officials since July. Scientists have long said it is essential to find out how the virus jumped species into humans.The expedition to China was heading to Wuhan to investigate the earliest cases. It was not intending to probe claims that the virus originated in a Chinese lab, which have been dismissed by most scientists.The mission has been criticised by the US, where the outgoing president, Donald Trump, has categorically blamed the Chinese for the pandemic.Garrett Grigsby, of the US Department of Health and Human Services, said in November the investigation appeared to be “inconsistent” with the WHO’s mandate.‘Transparent’“Understanding the origins of Covid-19 through a transparent and inclusive investigation is what must be done to meet the mandate.”Dr Mike Ryan, an Irish-born offcial at the WHO, said the team had been working very closely with Chinese colleagues when planning the trip.Two members of the team, who had a long distance to travel, had begun their journeys, he said, but it had become clear that their visas had not been approved by the Chinese authorities.“We did not want to put people in the air unnecessarily if there wasn’t a guarantee of their arrival in China being successful,” said Dr Ryan. “Dr Tedros has taken immediate action and has spoken with senior Chinese officials and has fully impressed upon them the absolute critical nature of this.”The team hoped it was “just a logistical and bureaucratic issue that can be resolved very quickly”. One of the two colleagues who were on their way had gone back, while the other was remaining in a third country in transit.“This is frustrating and, as the director general said, disappointing. That disappointment has been expressed very clearly by Dr Tedros directly to our counterparts in China. We trust that in good faith, we can solve these issues in the coming hours and recommence the deployment of the team as urgently as possible,” said Dr Ryan.Ilona Kickbusch, the founding director and chair of the Global Health Centre in Geneva, said geopolitics had got in the way of countries joining together to defeat the coronavirus pandemic and the hostilities that had been generated could now get in the way of finding out how it began.“I think it will be incredibly difficult to be able to find the origin of the virus, because so much time has passed,” Ms Kickbusch said.Come togetherThe world managed to come together to eradicate smallpox at the height of the cold war, she pointed out. Even when Sars, another coronavirus, surfaced in China and caused havoc between 2002 and 2003, the global reaction had been one of cooperation and a push for more transparency.Back then, Beijing had acknowledged it had made mistakes, reorganised its health ministry and created the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. Other countries had given it the benefit of the doubt and called for more cooperation.But now, she said: “There is a closing of the mind, quite clearly, on all sides.”Before the crisis, geopolitical tensions had bled into the global health response, she said, pointing to how the US-China trade war had morphed into a “geopolitical blame game”.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4385961!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us on course for a less than revolutionary administration","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t‘Radical laws and sharp ruptures from the status quo require either decisive majorities or support from the other side. A ided electorate allows for neither.’As ever, Tom Wolfe got there first. Readers had expected the author of The Bonfire of the Vanities to “do” Los Angeles or Chicago after his treatment of 1980s New York. Instead, the place that drew his fine eye for trends was Atlanta. A Man in Full considered the city, and the state that it anchors, as America’s potential future. Some 23 years on, Georgia continues to grow in population as several other states shrink. Once uncompetitively Republican, it is now the nation’s political schism in miniature.Nowhere was closer-fought in the US presidential election two months ago. If the Democrats take both of its Senate seats, to go with Joe Biden’s win there, imagine the symbolism. Here is a party going with the grain of the nation’s evolution.But not, it is worth saying, a party with a suddenly free hand. A split Senate, with the vice-president casting decisive votes, does not assure Biden a radical presidency. His chances of that waned when the “blue wave” of congressional gains failed to materialise in November. His subsequent nominations to the executive – their mildness, their familiarity – admit as much. His flirtations with the left are just a few months old but feel a century ago. His first problem is that a Senate majority is only as good as its internal cohesion. Conservative Democrats are not the force they were but, in a tight vote, it takes just a few to scuttle progressive dreams. West Virginia’s Joe Manchin is one who has to mind his red-state electors. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, Georgia-like in its competitiveness, has no more incentive to rile swing- or right-leaning voters.Any defections on his own side would leave Biden exposed to Republican intransigence. What hope there was of a more co-operative party post-November is embarrassing to recall now. In its bogusness and tenacity, Donald Trump’s quest to overturn his election defeat somehow intensifies by the week. Nothing in his presidency became him less than the leaving of it.But leave it he will. It is the conduct of the Republicans who remain in Washington that promises an ordeal for Biden. A dozen or so senators plan to contest the certification of the election result. That is more than a fifth of the Republicans there. Estimates of like-minded colleagues in the lower chamber exceed 100.And this is three years ahead of a presidential nomination race that will only incentivise such pandering to right-wing grassroots. Some of those activists will march against certification on Wednesday. A party that will not grant the president-elect’s legitimacy is not going to consider his legislation on its merits. Clinton and Obama And so the US is on course for a less than revolutionary administration. But then it has known no other for some time. Bill Clinton and Barack Obama were supernaturally gifted politicians. Both lost Congress at their first mid-term elections, and their domestic programmes with it. Clinton did not even have a landmark statute to show for two years of unified government. As for Trump, he secured a tax cut before losing the House of Representatives at the first time of asking – never to recover.Come to think of it, no US administration since the 1980s could be described as transformative, at least on the home front. Presidents still have their executive orders and discretion in foreign affairs. But social change on the Lyndon Johnson-Ronald Reagan scale tends to entail legislation, and lots of it. With the exception of Obamacare, the boldest versions have not survived Washington’s sieve in recent decades.The evidence nudges us to a conclusion that is no less true for its perverseness. The real winners of the age of partisanship are those who hate it most. The winners are the moderates. Radical laws and sharp ruptures from the status quo require either decisive majorities or support from the other side. A ided electorate allows for neither. America’s bifurcation, once it feeds into legislative numbers and conduct, puts paid to grand schemes. Voters in the middle find themselves in the oddest of predicaments: scandalised by the viciousness of politics and yet served by its results.“Moderate”, to be clear, is not a synonym for “good”. This time last year, immoderate measures against the coronavirus pandemic would have saved lives. Splitting the difference on Trump’s attempt to stay in office would be a nonsense. Equidistance from opposing arguments is no guarantor of sound policy. It is with surprise, then, not elation, that we should record this oddity of modern politics.

issue","story":"China played down concerns that a World Health Organisation mission had been blocked from investigating the origins of Covid-19, saying discussions on access are still taking place amid a spike in local infections.Foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a regular news briefing in Beijing that the problem was not just about visas for the team.The head of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said on Tuesday he was very disappointed that China had not authorised the entry of the team for the investigation, which he said was a WHO priority.Much remains unknown about the origins of Covid-19 and China has been sensitive about any suggestion it could have done more in the early stages of the pandemic to stop it.Ms Hua said there had been a misunderstanding and the two sides were still in discussions over the timing and other arrangements and remain in close communication.There\u0027s no need to overinterpret this, she said.China\u0027s experts were also busy dealing with a renewed spike of coronavirus infections, with many locations entering a wartime footing to stop the virus, she said.More than 400 infections have been recorded in recent weeks after a cluster erupted in Beijing, seen as an embarrassment for a country that has sought to get to zero casesThe 10-strong team of international experts had been due to set off in early January as part of a long-awaited mission to investigate early cases of the disease.China has been seeking to shape the narrative about when and where the pandemic began, with senior diplomat Wang Yi saying more and more studies showed that it emerged in multiple regions. WHO emergencies chief Mike Ryan has previously called this highly speculative.Foreign journalists trying to report on the impact and origins of coronavirus, including from the , have been harassed since the outbreak began at cemeteries in Wuhan and at caves deep in China where scientists had studied similar coronaviruses. Beijing is so determined to stamp out dissent against its official story of what happened that authorities have disappeared citizen journalists who sought to report on the outbreak.A few weeks ago, one of them, Zhang Zhan, resurfaced in court where she was sentenced to four years in prison in a trial that the UK criticised as “secret.” Authorities have even instructed some Wuhan residents not to speak to foreign journalists, reminding them that only praise for the government response is acceptable.Conspiracy theorists have speculated wildly about the origins of the virus but the global scientific consensus remains that the novel coronavirus was a natural \u0027spillover\u0027 event.The Chinese government has been strictly controlling all research at home into the origins of the virus, and state-owned media have played up reports that suggest the virus could have originated elsewhere.China has dismissed criticism of its handling of early cases although some including US President Donald Trump have questioned its actions during the outbreak.The United States, which has announced plans to leave the WHO, has called for a transparent investigation and criticised the terms under which Chinese experts conducted a first phase of research.The mission is due to be led by Peter Ben Embarek, the WHO\u0027s top expert on animal diseases that cross the species barrier, who went to China on a preliminary mission last July.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"does public health england realise middle national emergency","story":"So which is going to win the race to administer two million doses per week first – the vaccines or the virus?At the moment the clever money is on the latter after the Office for National Statistics estimated that more than one in 50 of the entire population of the country was infected with Covid last week.That’s easily more than a million people and with an R value well above one and the new super-infectious strain at its disposal, our viral foe continues to accelerate its roll-out across the UK.By comparison, vaccine shots have been delivered to about 1.3 million people so far at a rate of about 300,000 per week. It is clearly good news that nearly a quarter of the highly vulnerable over-80 age group has had an injection, but that still means that more than three quarters have not.We should also remember that the virus has a three-week built-in advantage – that’s the time lag between someone getting a shot in the arm and developing the maximum immunity that their first jab can offer (though resistance to serious disease may come a little sooner).The strict new national lockdown, imposed after viral transmission went up through the gears and and smashed through the tiers, is our one hope of slowing it down. But the virus has already had several further days to multiply since the ONS collated the data it published yesterday.Depending on the age profile of those getting infected, we can expect each million new cases to result in about 30,000 fresh hospitalisations and 5,000 extra deaths. Over the next month or two the NHS will be doing very well indeed to get recovered patients out of hospital anywhere near as fast as sick ones are coming in.All of which means that an enormous burden of responsibility rests on the shoulders of vaccine roll-out minister Nadhim Zahawi and everyone else working on the great inoculation effort. In this context, it is not only the right of the media to scour the entire operation – from manufacture to distribution to injection – for any weaknesses, but its duty, too.As Mr Zahawi told BBC Radio 4’s Mishal Husain this morning: “You are absolutely right to press me on this.”The ’s James Rothwell yesterday wrote an eye-opening dispatch from Jerusalem about Israel’s phenomenal vaccination programme. Despite having a population just a seventh of Britain’s, it has carried out as many jabs – already inoculating the majority of citizens in the high-risk groups in a network of centres that stay open for 14 hours a day. Four competing Health Maintenance Organisations (HMOs) race against each other to carry out the most vaccinations. “There is a sense that people are making history and that they are on a mission, a national effort, to come out of this,” one nurse told him.That is the spirit that Mr Zahawi must seek to engender here. Is he yet succeeding? Well, put it this way, you wouldn’t want Public Health England (PHE) to be in charge of organising the proverbial raid on Entebbe.The  today reveals that PHE, which has a key role in the logistical side of the vaccination effort, sent guidance to NHS trusts warning them not to expect deliveries on Sundays or after agreed lunchtime “cut-off points”, even if supplies are running low (though a PHE source has said exceptions would be made if there were a genuine risk of running out). Orders sent on Saturday afternoons will not be delivered until the following Tuesday, according to documents seen by the . PHE may yet move to a seven-day schedule in due course.Britain’s network of 11,000 pharmacies – most of which are well used to taking part in the regular autumn ’flu jab programme – is also feeling under-utilised and pointing out that it has the potential to deliver more than a million vaccine doses a week on its own.Meanwhile, there are also whispers that staffing levels at the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) are not sufficient to conduct essential quality control tests on batches of vaccine at maximum speed.Boris Johnson said at his press conference yesterday that “the rate-limiting factor at the moment is making sure that we can get enough vaccine where we want it fast enough” rather than at the sharp end of clinic capacity.His commitment to move from weekly updates on the numbers inoculated to daily ones from Monday was hugely welcome, bringing with it a further remorseless glare of public and media scrutiny about the need for speed.One shouldn’t for a second doubt the dedication and commitment of the vast majority of those involved in the vaccination effort. But lions must not be led by donkeys. In decades to come those taking part will look back on these testing weeks as the most dramatic in their entire careers. They will not wish to tell their grandchildren: “We were only allowed to work six days a week.”They will far rather say: “It meant working around the clock. You could forget about having a day off. We were in a race against time and we won it. They reckon we saved a hundred thousand lives.”Mr Zahawi today told BBC Radio 4 that when figures are published for the week from January 4 to January 11, they will show a “dramatic uplift” in the rate of vaccination. They need to. And then another one after that. That really will be an achievement worth banging a saucepan for.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"georgia senate vote winner republican democrat joe biden","story":"President will address \u0027Save America\u0027 rally on WednesdayTrump should not come to Scotland to escape inauguration, says Sturgeon​Meet the Democratic odd couple aiming to win Biden the SenatePolice officer who shot Jacob Blake will not face charges ​Subscribe to The  for a month-long free trial​Democrat challenger Raphael Warnock has beaten incumbent Republican Kelly Loeffler in one of the two Georgia run-off elections, NBC News and the Associated Press have projected.In the second race, Democrat Jon Ossoff has also taken a narrow lead over Republican David Perdue, with 98 per cent of the vote counted.Rev. Warnock\u0027s victory is the first time a Democrat has won a Senate race in Georgia in 20 years and gives the Democrats the chance to regain control of the Senate for at least the first two years of the Biden presidency. If Mr Ossoff holds on to his lead, that would mean the Senate is split 50-50, with Vice-President elect Kamala Harris holding the deciding vote.An exit poll of more than 5,200 voters, taken on election day and during early voting, found that half had voted for Donald Trump in the presidential election, and half for Joe Biden.Meanwhile, Mike Pence will not interfere in the result of the US election, his advisers said, despite growing pressure from President Trump to help overturn his defeat. Mr Trump has asked the Vice President to block Congress\u0027s certification of the November election results in an ongoing attempt to stay in power, after dozens of lawsuits by his campaign challenging election results had failed in US courts.Follow the latest updates below.The President is awake and tweeting, and has reacted to Jon Ossoff\u0027s declaration of victory over David Perdue with typical good grace and decorum.As we enter the final two weeks of Donald Trump\u0027s presidency, Dominic Penna our video team take a look back at his tumultuos four years in office.Since his victory in 2016 and inauguration in 2017, Donald Trump has been at the helm of one of the most unconventional and eventful presidencies in recent memory.From the inauguration crowd size controversy, to meeting Kim Jong-un and swearing in three Supreme Court justices, Mr Trump ploughed ahead with his unique style of leadership which sometimes stumped even the most seasoned of Washington correspondents.To round off his term in office, Mr Trump faced both an impeachment, a devastating pandemic in the months leading up to the 2020 election, and most recently, a controversial phone call with Georgia\u0027s Secretary of State in an attempt to overturn Joe Biden\u0027s victory in the state.READ MORE:  Donald Trump\u0027s presidency: The best and worst moments from his four years as US President Stacey Abrams has tweeted her congratulations to Jon Ossoff, who just a few moments ago, declared victory in his Senate race against David Perdue.Jon Ossoff will stand for all of Georgia in the fight for healthcare, jobs + justice.

Raphael Warnock says people in his state are feeling a sense of hope this morning.Speaking in a round of morning television interviews, he said his victory pushes against the grain of so many expectations, but this is America and I want some young person who\u0027s watching this to know anything\u0027s possible.Georgia is now in an incredible place when you think of the arc of our history, he said.This is the reversal of the old southern strategy that sought to ide people, Rev. Warnock said on ABC\u0027s \u0027Good Morning America\u0027. In this moment we\u0027ve got to bring people together to do the hard work and I look forward to doing that.He told NBC\u0027s \u0027Today\u0027 that we can ill-afford to be ided.

He has also managed to get three Supreme Court Justices confirmed during his tenure, after blocking Barack Obama\u0027s attempt to get Merrick Garland confirmed in 2016.Some prominent Democrats have taken to Twitter to gloat about his possible impending departure from the Majority Leader\u0027s Office, including California Governor Gavin Newsom.The sun has not yet risen in Washington DC but a small army of Trump supporters has already descended on the US capital, Rozina Sabur writes.As reporters line up outside the White House grounds to receive their credentials for Donald Trump’s address later today, protesters have been streaming passed. Many have been hurling abuse, in a sign of how toxic US politics has become. “Why don’t you tell the truth?” shouts one. “You’re going to burn in hell,” says another. Washington is braced for unrest today with thousands of protests and counter- protests expected to mark Congress’ certification of the electoral college results.For the president’s supporters today marks an opportunity to express their frustration with the outcome of the election, and protests against what many believe was a fraudulent race. For Democrats, the event marks the final chapter in the Trump presidency. With the final nail being hammered in to the Donald Trump presidency today, our reporter Nick Allen takes a look at what is next for some of his closest advisers - his children.The Trump presidency has been a family affair and, as Donald Trump\u0027s star falls, his children find their futures looking uncertain too.Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner have been White House employees, senior advisers to the president and, after he leaves office will be looking for new work.When Mr Trump assumed office, he left his adult sons, Donald Jr and Eric, running the Trump Organization. If he were to decide to resume control of his business they may be less busy too.It is not beyond the realms of possibility that Mr Trump\u0027s exit from the White House will lead to the start of a Trump political dynasty.READ MORE: What next for Donald Trump\u0027s children, after Joe Biden\u0027s inauguration?Reverend Raphael Warnock has become the first African-American to win a Senate seat in the history of Georgia after he defeated Republican incumbent Kelly Loeffler in a special run-off election on Tuesday night.The 51-year-old has never held political office before, but he has been an active member of Georgia’s political scene, spending much of the last decade campaigning for the expansion of Medicaid, criminal justice reform and increasing voter registration.Born the son of two Pentecostal pastors and raised in public housing in Savannah, Georgia, Rev Warnock has committed much of his life to his faith.READ MORE: Raphael Warnock: the African-American pastor who made history with Georgia Senate run-off winToday marks the day when Congress is expected to certify the Electoral College vote, officially recognising Joe Biden as the 46th President of the United States.The clock is ticking. With or without the co-operation of the outgoing Trump administration during the transition, Joe Biden wants to hit the ground running when he takes office on January 20.Irrespective of the blizzard of litigation, Mr Biden has already identified key members of the team he hopes will help ensure that his administration assumes the reins of government smoothly.Elsewhere in America, Trump supporters have been gathering in Washington DC for a day of protests and rallies today.Protesters are gathering in anticipation of the certification of the electoral college results in Congress this afternoon. Once ratified, Joe Biden\u0027s victory as President will be officially confirmed.Overnight, MAGA supporters clashed with police in the nation\u0027s capital, as seen in footage on social media.President Trump has spent much of the last few days attempting to pressure his VP Mike Pence to stop Congress from ratifying the results.It is hard to over-exaggerate just how much is riding on the remaining Senate seat race in Georgia which will decide the balance of power and thus the fate of many of Joe Biden\u0027s policies, writes our US editor Ben Riley-SmithOn the current maths the Democrats have 49 seats and the Republicans have 50. Win the last so-called ‘run-off’ races in Georgia and the Democrats are just about over the line. In tied votes in the US Senate, the deciding vote is cast by the vice president, soon to be Kamala Harris. Mr Biden can pass some laws in that case without Republican votes.But if they fall short the Republicans keep their majority. And that means Mitch McConnell remains as Senate leader.READ MORE: How defeat in Senate battle could leave a hamstrung Joe Biden struggling to accomplish real changeAs the Democrats inch closer to control of the Senate, and a clean sweep politically, our reporter Nick Allen looks at what this could mean for the first 100 days of Joe Biden\u0027s presidency.President-elect Joe Biden is due to be sworn into office on January 20. Mr Biden made a long list of promises for his first 100 days, but his overriding priority will be the coronavirus pandemic.In addition, he is expected to try to roll the clock back as much as possible to January 2017, when he and Barack Obama left office.That would involve using executive orders, as much as possible, to overturn orders introduced by Mr Trump, including those that loosened environmental regulations.READ MORE: What will Joe Biden\u0027s first 100 days as US president look like, and when is his first day in office?In scenes reminiscent of the second week of November, all eyes are on the vote tabulaters in Georgia, who have just released their latest batch of counted ballots.It\u0027s good news for the Democrats, as Jon Ossoff now holds a lead of 16,370 votes, according to CNN, which means he is not only inching closer to victory, but inching closer to a win without a recount.With 98 per cent of ballots counted, Mr Ossoff has a lead of 0.4 per cent over Mr Perdue, taking him within striking distance of exceeding the 0.5 per cent recount threshold.However, as Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said earlier today, it is unlikely we will have a final tally until this afternoon.President Trump has spent the morning calling fraud in the run-off elections in Georgia, where Democrats have already won one race and are closing in on winning a second.Looks like they are setting up a big “voter dump” against the Republican candidates, the President tweeted. Waiting to see how many votes they need?Just happened to have found another 4000 ballots from Fulton County. Here we go! he tweeted a little later.Democrat Jon Ossoff has extended his lead over Republican David Perdue to 16,370 votes with 98 per cent of ballots counted, according to Edison Research.That gives Mr Ossoff a 0.4 per cent lead over Mr Perdue, taking him close to clearing the 0.5 per cent threshold under which Mr Perdue could automatically request a recount.Stacey Abrams, a former Representative in the Georgia House, has congratulated Rev Warnock on his Senate victory.Ms Abrams, who is seen as a key figure in the Democratic party, was credited with significantly increasing Democratic turnout in Georgia in the 2020 Presidential election.Further to our post at 8.23am, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger has told CNN that some counties will now take a break from counting, and that we should have a better idea of the final results at noon on the East Coast, which is 5pm in London.“They’re probably going to take a break here, I think, in the next hour. Try and get as much work as they can done tonight ... At least, record exactly how many ballots are out there and then get as much scanning done tomorrow. Hopefully by noon we’ll have a better idea where we are,” he said.In the latest batch of counted votes, Democrat Jon Ossoff has extended his lead over Republican David Perdue to 12,806 votes. This gives him a lead of 0.2 per cent, which is still within the band where the loser in the race can request a recount. The winner must win by 0.5 per cent in order to avoid such a scenario.Donald Trump has taken to Twitter this morning to continue his attempts to pressure his VP Mike Pence to decertify results from some states, which would deny victory to Joe Biden.If Vice President  @Mike_Pence  comes through for us, we will win the Presidency, Trump tweeted. Many States want to decertify the mistake they made in certifying incorrect.Mike can send it back! READ MORE: Donald Trump urges Mike Pence to block Joe Biden\u0027s election victory in CongressIt may be a while before we know the final result if the Ossoff-Perdue race, as several key counties in Georgia have stopped counting votes for the night.Chatham County, Fulton County and Cobb County, which all contain significant urban and suburban populations, will resume their counts around 8am local time (1pm GMT).Attendees react as results come in during a Republican election night party in AtlantaRepublican U.S. Senator Kelly Loeffler speaks at the GA GOP election night event for the run-off election for Georgia\u0026#39s two Senate seats in AtlantaElection observers watch as a Fulton County election worker scans absentee ballots at the Georgia World Congress Center in AtlantaRev. Warnock, the senior pastor of the church where Martin Luther King preached through the height of the Civil Rights movement until his assassination, made history with a surge in African-American turnout.To be sure, a narrow win out of 4.4 million votes involves plenty of variables. But African-American voters were a force in the early vote and on Election Day. Notably, it wasn\u0027t just in metro Atlanta, but also in rural and small-town counties across South Georgia, where African-American turnout has historically lagged.That means it was an alliance ning from the most affluent African-American residents of Atlanta, including recent transplants to Georgia, to those African-American Georgia natives who hail from the most economically depressed pockets of the state.This election cycle a confluence of factors for African-American voters: 2020 offered the first general election after the disappointment of Stacey Abrams\u0027 narrowly missing out in 2018 on becoming the first African-American woman governor in U.S. history, and it was the first election after the death of Rep. John Lewis, Atlanta\u0027s civil rights icon who once marched alongside King and would publicly joust with Trump.Ms Loeffler and her Republican allies used the two-month runoff campaign to hammer Rev Warnock with ads calling him dangerous and radical. They used snippets of his sermons from Ebenezer Baptist Church to accuse him of hate speech and racial isiveness.But African-American voters can point to Tuesday\u0027s vote count and take credit for that strategy ending in defeat.The race for U.S. Senate in Georgia between incumbent GOP Sen. David Perdue and Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff is too early to call.As of 7:40 a.m. GMT Wednesday, Ossoff had a lead of 9,527 votes out of nearly 4.4 million counted, or a margin of less than 0.2 percentage points.There were still some mail ballots and in-person early votes left to be counted statewide, the majority of which are in Democratic-leaning counties.Under Georgia law, a trailing candidate may request a recount when the margin of an election is less than or equal to 0.5 percentage points.The Perdue-Ossoff race was one of two runoff elections that Georgia held Tuesday. In the other election, Democrat Raphael Warnock unseated Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler.The races will determine which party controls the U.S. Senate. Democrats must win both seats to take power, while Republicans only need one to keep Mitch McConnell as majority leader.The campaign for Republican David Perdue, who currently narrowly trails Democrat Jon Ossoff, has released a statement saying they believe Senator Perdue will be victorious.Using language that echoes that used by Donald Trump in the wake of his defeat to Joe Biden, the campaign said: We will mobilise every available resource and exhaust every legal recourse to ensure all legally cast ballots are properly counted.We believe in the end, Senator Perdue will be victorious.With 98 per cent of the vote counted, Sen. Perdue currently trails Mr Ossoff by 9,527 votes.Global stock prices slipped and bond yields rose on Wednesday as investors braced for the prospect that Democrats could win both seats at stake in a U.S. Senate run-off election in Georgia, handing them control of the chamber.Along with their narrow majority in the House of Representatives, a \u0027blue sweep\u0027 of Congress could usher in larger fiscal stimulus and pave the way for President-elect Joe Biden to push through greater corporate regulation and higher taxes.With Biden proposing to reverse President Donald Trump\u0027s tax cut, increase the minimum wage, and strengthen oversight on various industries, some might argue that his agenda is not particularly market-friendly, said Vasu Menon, investment strategy executive director at OCBC Bank in Singapore.Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff has taken a lead of about 3,500 votes in his close race against Republican US Senator David Perdue in Georgia, according to Edison Research.Both candidates have 50.0 per cent of the vote, but Ossoff has edged ahead of Perdue 2,195,441 to 2,191,881 with 98 per cent of the expected vote counted, according to Edison.The NBC television network on Wednesday projected Democrat Raphael Warnock the winner of his U.S. Senate runoff election against Republican Senator Kelly Loeffler.Warnock, a pastor at the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta where slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King once preached, would become Georgia\u0027s first Black senator if final election results confirmed his victory.The close margins in the race means the winners might not be clear until at least Wednesday morning in the US.Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said election officials would take a break overnight but resume counting on Wednesday morning. Hopefully by noon we\u0027ll have a better idea where we are, he said on CNN.Most of the votes remaining to be counted were in counties Joe Biden won in November, with roughly 30,000 to go in DeKalb and Newton counties near Atlanta, according to Edison Research estimates.The critical races drew an estimated 4.5 million voters - a record for a run-off.Georgia Democrat Raphael Warnock claimed victory on Tuesday night in a key US Senate race against Republican Kelly Loeffler - who has not conceded defeat.US officials and major media had yet to declare a winner for either of the two Georgia seats at stake, both of which Joe Biden\u0027s Democrats need to flip to take control of the Senate.Georgia, I am honored by the faith that you have shown in me, Warnock, a 51-year-old Black pastor, said in a televised address shortly after midnight. And I promise you this tonight, I am going to the Senate to work for all of Georgia.Democratic Senate candidate Raphael Warnock speaks on his campaign\u0026#39s Youtube accountAs the hour slipped past midnight on the East Coast, the odds of Democrats Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff beating Republicans Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue were slowing inching up. It was a seesaw night. Warnock and Ossoff jumped to early leads, but as more votes came in, the Republicans swung in front.It made for some great television suspense, although people following online saw a different view. The New York Times website estimated the victory probabilities in each race and, as the evening progressed, moved steadily in the Democrats\u0027 direction. After midnight, the Times judged both Warnock and Ossoff had a better than 95 per cent chance of winning.Even before 10 pm, Dave Wasserman of the influential Cook Political Report tweeted that he had seen enough to predict Warnock would beat Loeffler. That led Twitter, however, to slap his prediction with a warning that other sources were saying it was too close to call.The Republican election night party in Atlanta is beginning to empty, with those remaining increasingly concerned that one or both GOP Georgia Senate candidates could lose.That would give Georgia a Democratic senator for the first time since 2005, when Zell Miller retired from his seat.John Burke, a spokesperson for Republican David Perdue, says, This is going to be close. He says, We\u0027ll see how the last few votes go.Republican supporters attend a run-off election night party at Grand Hyatt Hotel in Buckhead in AtlantaAs votes were tallied on Tuesday night, Democratic candidates Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff had the backing of Black voters, younger voters, people earning less than $50,000 and newcomers to the state, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of voters in Tuesday\u0027s high-stakes Senate contests.The Republican coalition backing Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue was the mirror opposite: white, older, wealthier and longtime Georgia residents.The findings from AP VoteCast reveal the extent of Georgia\u0027s recent political transformation - from GOP bastion to electoral battleground where turnout is decisive. The survey found roughly 30 per cent of Georgia voters were Black and almost all of them - 94 per cent - backed Democrats. Voters under 45, those earning less than $50,000 and those who recently moved to Georgia all broke for Democrats.But Republicans held firmly onto their supporters, bringing out white voters and those older than 45 - groups that still account for majorities of Georgia voters. Republicans Perdue and Loeffler also fared better than their rivals among voters earning more than $75,000 and those who have called Georgia home for more than 20 years.A person dressed in a Spider-Man costume holds campaign signs for Senate candidates near a polling location in Marietta, GeorgiaDonald Trump has suggested that Georgian officials are waiting to see how many votes Democrats need to beat the Republicans before announcing results.In his latest unfounded claim of election fraud, Mr Trump appears to be saying that the vote is rigged against his party. But votes are being published in batches as they are counted, with delays due to counting a large number of postal votes.We\u0027ve all done it, haven\u0027t we? When the new year begins, it takes a few days to get used to writing the correct date.But most of us aren\u0027t writing statements for the the president of the United States.A post issued by the Trump campaign has provoked ridicule on Twitter after it contained a number of falsehoods – and the wrong date.In the statement, the president\u0027s team denied a New York Times report that Mike Pence will certify Joe Biden\u0027s victory. The statement claims, wrongly, that the vice-president can decertify the results or send them back to the states for change and certification. He can also decertify the illegal and corrupt results and send them to the House of Representatives for the one vote for one state tabulation. This is not true and there is no precedent for a US vice-president doing this.The statement was also incorrectly dated 2020.Washington police banned the leader of a far-right group from the city and made two arrests on Tuesday as protesters supporting President Trump\u0027s attempts to overturn the election gathered in the city.Enrique Tarrio, the leader of the Proud Boys, who was arrested on Monday for destruction of property and possession of a firearm magazine, was released on Tuesday and ordered to stay away from the city, according to a court document.Protests against President-elect Joe Biden\u0027s November election win, which Congress will certify on Wednesday, started across the US capital on Tuesday and were expected to grow on Wednesday to thousands of people.Mr Trump, who lost the election by 7 million votes, was expected to speak to protesters on Wednesday morning at the Ellipse, a public park south of the White House, he said in a post on Twitter on Tuesday evening.Protesters are gathering in Washington DC before Wednesday\u0026#39s pro-Trump rallyA top Republican official in the Georgia secretary of state’s office has blamed Donald Trump for the Republican party\u0027s results so far, as early counts suggest they may be heading for defeat.Gabriel Sterling told CNN that if the Republican senators lose, the blame ought to fall squarely on the shoulders of President Trump and his actions since November 3.Mr Sterling has criticised Mr Trump’s untrue claims of fraud in the November election. He told CNN that the president\u0027s claims undermined Republican voters\u0027 trust in voting.Mr Sterling also claimed that the president has started a civil war among Georgia Republicans by denying the results of the November election.Gabriel Sterling said Donald Trump had led Republicans to believe that their vote did not matterThe elections director for Georgia\u0027s most populous county said a bomb threat targeting an Election Day polling place was investigated last week by the FBI.Rick Barron of Fulton County said during a media briefing that the person said that the Nashville bombing was a practice run for what we would see today at one of our polling places.A bomb detonated in downtown Nashville on Christmas morning, killing the bomber and injuring three other people and damaging dozens of buildings.The Fulton County threat, received on December 30, was reported to the FBI. Mr Barron said agents visited the Tennessee home of the man who made the threat and searched it but did not make any arrests.Mr Barron also revealed that several members of his staff have received death threats and innumerable racial slurs have been directed at his staff, by phone and on social media.Republican former US president George W Bush will attend the inauguration of Joe Biden on January 20, his chief of staff has said.President and Mrs Bush look forward to returning to the Capitol for the swearing in of President Biden and Vice President Harris, Freddy Ford tweeted.Witnessing the peaceful transfer of power is a hallmark of our democracy that never gets old, he added, in a seeming jab at President Trump who refuses to concede defeat and has not confirmed if he will attend Mr Biden\u0027s inauguration.It will be the eighth swearing-in ceremony the Bushs have attended, Mr Ford said.George Bush left office in 2009More people voted in Georgia\u0027s most populous county during Tuesday\u0027s run-off election than on Election Day in November.Fulton County elections director Rick Barron said there were more than 70,000 votes cast in person on Tuesday, with about 60,000 in-person votes on November 3. Fulton County includes most of Atlanta and is heavily Democratic.Mr Barron noted that there were fewer absentee ballots cast than during the general election and that the early in-person voting period was four days shorter, both of which he said may have contributed to the higher Election Day turnout.Spokesperson Summer Dunham says neighbouring DeKalb County, also a Democratic stronghold, also had more in-person votes on Tuesday than on November 3.Georgia voters in Tuesday\u0027s run-off races were evenly ided about which party should win, an exit poll showed.With about 10 per cent of the vote counted, Democrat Rev Raphael Warnock led Republican Senator Kelly Loeffler by 54.9pc to 45.1pc, while Jon Ossoff led Republican Senator David Perdue by 54.3pc to 45.7pc. However, those votes are from counties in Atlanta that are expected to vote Democrat.Edison Research\u0027s exit poll found roughly half of voters would prefer the Republican Party to retain control and half would like to see the Democrats take over, reflecting how close the two races were likely to be.The poll also found about half of voters in the two Senate run-off races voted for President Donald Trump in November\u0027s presidential election and half for Democrat Joe Biden.Meanwhile, about three quarters of voters who backed Republican candidates in Tuesday\u0027s votes said Joe Biden was not legitimately elected in November, according to AP VoteCast.Most polls have now closed in Georgia, though voters who were in line before 7pm (12am UK) will be allowed to vote.Results will begin to be posted in the next hour, though it may be some time before we have a definitive result.Officials have already started processing postal votes which should help to avoid a repeat of the scenes in November when Georgia\u0027s votes took days to count.Staff in Lawrenceville, Georgia, get cracking with the huge task of processing and counting all the votesGeorgia officials have started counting ballots as polls close across the state in two critical races.Here\u0027s what you need to know.What are these votes for?There are two Senate run-off elections being held. The votes are leftovers from the November general election, when none of the candidates hit the 50 per cent threshold.Why are they important?Democrats need to win both of the votes to seize the Senate majority – and, with it, control of the new Congress when Biden takes office in two weeks.Who are the candidates?In one contest, Republican Kelly Loeffler, a 50-year-old former businesswoman who was appointed to the Senate less than a year ago by the state\u0027s governor, faces Democrat Raphael Warnock, 51, who serves as the senior pastor of the Atlanta church where Martin Luther King Jr grew up and preached.The other election pits 71-year-old former business executive David Perdue, a Republican who held his Senate seat until his term expired on Sunday, against Democrat Jon Ossoff, a former congressional aide and journalist. At just 33 years old, Mr Ossoff would be the Senate\u0027s youngest member.When will we get the results?We could know the winners late on Tuesday evening in the US (early Wednesday in the UK).President Trump has confirmed he will address a rally of his supporters on Wednesday in Washington.Mr Trump tweeted on Tuesday evening that he will be speaking and is expecting a big crowd at the event, a protest against the certification by Congress of the 2020 election results.Republicans and Democrats have gone head to head in Georgia for a vital run-off election that will determine the balance of the SenatePolls have closed in the vote that is exceptionally closeDonald Trump has urged Mike Pence to block the certification of the election result in a last-minute attempt to overhaul Joe Biden\u0027s victoryThe president has confirmed he will speak at a rally in Washington DC on Wednesday in which protesters including the Proud Boys will demonstrate against the result of the November electionProsecutors have announced they will not charge a white police officer over the shooting of Jacob Blake, which set off violent protests in Wisconsin last summer.

Italy occupied the country from 1935-41, when it became part of the Italian East Africa colony.La Molisana, based in the Molise region of southern Italy, said that it would change the name of the pasta to “conchiglie” – Italian for shells, in reference to the shape of the product.The firm’s apology was welcomed by the National Association of Partisans, which represents the guerrilla fighters who battled Italian Fascist and German forces during the Second World War.Michele Petraroia, the head of the association in Molise, said the pasta company had a proud tradition of standing up to fascism, recalling that its factory had been destroyed by retreating Axis forces during the war.“Nevertheless, it was appropriate that La Molisana should clarify that it has nothing to do with fascism.”Italy underwent less of a reckoning with its dark past than Germany and there is still a vocal minority of Italians who openly praise the fascist era.There was controversy last May, during the first wave of the pandemic, when a company in Verona in northern Italy produced face masks adorned with the image of Mussolini.The face masks were condemned as “deplorable” by MPs from the centre-Left Democratic Party, part of the ruling coalition.Modern day fascists are regularly drawn to Predappio, the town in the northern region of Emilia-Romagna where Il Duce is buried.A handful of shops in the town do a brisk trade in fascist memorabilia, including busts and keyrings, statues of Mussolini on a rearing stallion, pasta in the shape of his helmeted head and even Mussolini-themed babies’ bibs.Neo-fascists gather in the town three times a year – on the anniversaries of Mussolini’s birth, death, and his March on Rome, the 1922 putsch which brought him to power.Reminders of the fascist era are never far away in Italy - in Rome there is a towering stone obelisk that still bears the words “Mussolini Dux”, Latin for Duce or Leader.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pharmacies wont excluded vaccine rollout minister insists","story":"Pharmacies are to be included as part of the Covid vaccine rollout, a Governnent minister has insisted, after The  revealed their offer to give jabs had been snubbed by ministers.Covid Vaccine Deployment Minister Nadhim Zahawi told Sky News he was confident that the UK will hit the stretching target of vaccinating almost 14million people by mid-February, and that community pharmacies will play a role. Royal Pharmaceutical Society president Sandra Gidley said there were thousands of high street pharmacies who were ready, willing and able to assist in the rollout of the programme, but were being excluded because they had to be able to guarantee they could deliver at least 950 doses per day.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"evictions ban under review boris","story":"NewsEvictions ban under review, Boris Johnson confirms with it set expire in just  daysEvictions are due to start again next Monday after being temporarily suspended in the wake of the pandemic in March and again in DecembermirrorShareCommentsByOliver MilnePolitical Correspondent:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsHalf a million Brits are reportedly behind on rent\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

They began again in September but a aposaposChristmas Truceapos between December  and January  offered breathing space to some struggling renters. The announcement came as campaigners warned that without action hundreds of thousands of people could face evictions from later this month. Around one in  private renters are behind with their payments, according to Citizens Advice. The charity estimates the % could equate to around half a million renters being in arrears,its findings were projected across the UK. On average, people who have fallen behind on rent now owe £, which could potentially mean around £ million is owed in total, Citizens Advice said. More than halfof those who were behind on rent had no rent arrears in February , the survey of more than , private renters in November across the UK found.Among people who were already struggling with rent before the coronavirus pandemic hit, % said their arrears had got worse.Citizens Advice said that in December, it helped someone every two minutes typically with an issue to do with their privately rented housing. Alistair Cromwell, acting chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: “Half a million private renters remain behind on their rent, with the majority falling behind during the pandemic restrictions. “Unlike people who own their homes, private tenants have had no structured way to defer payments but instead have had to try to keep up with their rent and bills as best they can in a time of great uncertainty and hardship.

The number of cases of Covid- are soaring across the country, with , positive tests ed in a  hour period for the first time on Tuesday. People are being told to stay at home to save lives and protect the NHS, with schools, pubs, cafes and non-essential shops all forced to close. Only essential shops, such as supermarkets, have been allowed to remain open, with Brits told to only leave homethey have to for food, medical supplies or exercise. The country is reluctantly resigned to yet another long lockdown, but what more should be done to ensure it works and reduce the misery it causes  Here are some of the things the government need to tackle... Close our borders Jeremy Hunt called on the Government to shut our borders “at once”, but travellers are still arriving at Britain’s airports with hardly any checks at all. Michael Gove yesterday hinted that negative tests may be made compulsory for some travellers to the UK, but not for British nationals or foreigners residents in the UK arriving home. Sort out the exams chaos GCSEs and A-Levels will not happen again as normal this year, but it doesnapost mean there needs to be a repeat of last year’s fiasco, when ministers were forced to scrap grades generated by a controversial Ofqual algorithm. The regulator has promised to “consult rapidly” on replacing the exams. Cancel the Universal Credit cut The £-a-week rise in Universal Credit has been a leline for many struggling families during the pandemic. But the Government recently announced it would end in the spring, which the Fabian Society says will plunge more than million people into poverty.  Ramp up business support Another national lockdown could be the death knell for thousands more small businesses who have been hit the hardest by the pandemic. While some businesses can get a £, grant, there will be no extension to the reduced VAT or business rates relief - two of the key demands from industry groups. Help the Excluded Three million self-employed workers - % of the UK workforce - have received no help at all from the Government during the pandemic, with many facing financial ruin. Manchester mayor Andy Burnham yesterday tweeted: “Does the Government really have no intention of brining  million taxpayers in from the cold ”  House the homeless again During the first wave of coronavirus, almost , homeless people were moved to hotels or emergency accommodation. Jon Sparks, chief executive of homelessness charity Crisis, yesterday urged the Government to “again ensure lives are saved” with aof the scheme. Bring back the ban on evictions During the first lockdown, the ban on evictions meant thousands of families could stay safe in their homes, but it ended in September. While Scotland is considering an extension to the ban, there has so far been no word from Whitehall about the rest of the UK. Fix the Test and Trace shambles The test and trace system has been beset with problems despite costs escalating to £billion, failing to reach enough contacts and ortests on time. Meg Hillier, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, last month urged ministers to “stop throwing money” at Test and Trace and instead “urgently work out what’s going wrong”.

This morning a public health warned the crisis is at its most serious point. On December  and , , new cases were identied following the governmentaposs decision to allow Christmas bubbles in some parts of the country. Dr Susan Hopkins, deputy director of the national infections service at Public Health England , voiced the bleak outlook as frontline medics battle a surge in cases. She told BBC Breakfast: This position is the most serious weaposve been in so far this pandemic. We are now seeing a number of patients in hospitals % higher than the cases at the peak in March April. And we know that the cases in the community are still rising. And that means that we expect to see further admissions to hospital, and we expect to see further deaths. Yesterday the Department of Health confirmed that , people had tested positive in  hours, bringing the number of cases in the past seven days to ,. Dr Hopkins said the maximum impact of mixing over Christmas was seen on December  and  - with more than , cases reported on the th and , on the th in England alone.  We hope that everyone is now staying at home, reducing their contacts, and that we can start to see rapid declines in new infections. She said it could take  to  days for infections to come down after the introduction of lockdown restrictions. Iaposm hopeful that because London went into the restrictions on the th of December, that we are starting to see a flattening in London. Itaposs still rising in other parts of the country, and I would expect thatpeople really take heed and reduce their contacts that we will start seeing a reduction in cases in about  daysapos time.  But on a more hopeful note, she said Public Health England was able to deliver vaccines seven days a week. Dr Hopkins said closing schools could have a positive effect on driving down infections saying: Because children not only are interacting in school but also on the way to school, on school buses, they are having conversations outside, and itaposs all of those little things that we are advising Government that need to be avoided.

Jenny, , and her husband Sam, , from London, purchased the three-bedroom  Edwardian terrace house for £, in September . After renting in the capital for several years, the pair were excited to have their own place and eagerly set about giving it a makeover during lockdown.Jenny, who is a children’s surgeon at a large children’s hospital in central London, has been documenting their journey on their Instagram account @se_edwardian_terraceto the coupleaposs , followers – who are blown away by the results.We had zero DIY experience, and only owned a screwdriver when we moved in but we were keen to learn and do as much as we could along the way, she said. We made a long list of things that we wanted to change in each room and started work straight away. “The bathroom was already beautul when we moved in, so we were lucky that we didn’t have to do that.”  We started on the sitting room first and the first job was to pull up the black carpet, which was a very messy job. We discovered -year-old floorboards underneath and set to sanding them back. They were dark brown and covered in dirt and dust. “Next up, we stripped back the textured wallpaper, definitely one of our most hated jobs.”  The couple did most of the work by themselves, bar hiring a builder to skim the walls and build shelving on either side of the chimney breast, which they then primed and painted. Jenny said: I love painting so decided to paint the walls and do all the paintwork white. We love dark colours and the room is so light – it works really well we think.  We styled it with a Laura Ashley sofa, a mustard ottoman and a West Elm coffee table. We also found two French button back armchairs in our local antique shop in Blackheath and had them reupholstered to finish off the bay window. One of the coupleaposs biggest challenges was the hallway, which the pair re-did with Victorian mosaic tiles – but they couldnapost find matching border tiles.  Jenny said: Sam spent hours cutting and templating the tiles and we laid them ourselves, which was quite tricky but totally worth it. “Every time we walk downstairs we smile as it was our first big DIY job.” Sam then set about ling the hallway and stairs.  Jenny said: “We painted the woodwork white and the walls ammonite. We finished it off with a wool herringbone carpet with matt black binding along the sides. It is our favourite part of our transformation so far. For our bedroom, we wanted a change from the blue walls and grey carpet. We chose Farrow and Ball Oxford Stone for the walls and wardrobes.  “I made roman blinds and headboard in a fabric we bought from Laura Ashley. We bought tiles and recreated the hearth around the fireplace to complement the black and stone colour theme.” The couple have spent a total of £, on the makeover so far and most of the transformation took place during the past year. Jenny said: It was the perfect lockdown project but the templating, cutting the tiles and making sure they were central was definitely the hardest part.  We find painting the walls makes such a dference and for rooms like our office and bedroom, just changing the colour had such an impact. “The fact we have done it all ourselves makes it that bit more special, too.” The couple are beyond delighted with their home, with their favourite room the hallway, as it was very dark when they purchased the house.  They plan on renovating the kitchen and dining room in coming months, which they expect to be a very big project, and look forward to having friends and family over to showcase their new home. Jenny said: Ironically, no one has seen it in person due to Covid- restrictions.“They have loved seeing the transformations on Instagram but we really cannot wait for people to come when it is safe to do so.”"},{"url":null,"title":"covid lockdowns needed two more","story":"NewsCoronavirus lockdowns may be needed for two more winters disease expert warnsGraham Medley, professor of infectious disease modelling at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, has warned that the country is \"in for a long haul\" when it comes to the pandemicmirrorShareCommentsByMilo Boyd:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror incoming video chris-whitty-says-lockdown-restrictions-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Graham Medley, professor of infectious disease modelling at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, made the bleak warning this morning. Asked about Professor Chris Whittyaposs comments that restrictions may be needed next winter, the Sage member said: Weaposre in for a long haul, we stilla long way to go in this epidemic. Vaccination is a way out, but I think heaposs right to raise that possibility that there could be - next winter or even the winter after - the possibility that we will see a resurgence of Covid to such an extent that Government again has to take measures to prevent another large outbreak. Follow our live blog for all the latest coronavirus updates. But letaposs get there. Weaposre very hopeful now that this virus is seasonal so that it will reduce once the spring and summer comes, and then that gives us an additional chance to be able to prepare and in particular to get vaccination done for everybody. When asked whether the country could emerge from the lockdown in mid-February as Johnson suggested on Monday, Professor Medley sounded a note of cautious optimism. Speaking in a personal capacity, he told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: I think itaposs possible, I mean thataposs obviously a Government decision what they decided to do at what point. But it really depends upon what happens over the next five weeks in terms of the infection rates, itaposs much like in March and April. We know more now but nonetheless weaposre still looking at the the epidemic increasing and looking for that peak and hoping it happens soon. The UK is suffering from previously unseen numbers of coronavirus cases at the moment.

Thataposs because itaposs a rather chilling place, by all accounts. Opposite Queenborough in Sheppey is an area dubbed Deadmanaposs Island, where no visitors are permitted.The island is covered in human remains and coffins, with bones and skulls all over the place. Why, you ask  Well, more than  years ago, the spot was used as a burial ground for convicts who died aboard prisoner ships, reports Kent Live. As water levels have changed over time, the bodies in the unmarked graves have been uncovered. In , due to coastal erosion and a sht in tides, skulls and bone fragments now stick out of the ground from the six feet of mud that once blanketed the area. The island, which was once lost under the high seas, was most recently explored in  by the BBCaposs Inside Out South East programme. The crew are among some of the only visitors to have set foot on the island in recent times as people are banned due to its bird breeding and nesting site. Owned by Natural England, the land is out of bounds to the public as a Site of Special Scientic Interest and is recognised to be of international importance under the Ramsar convention. Natalie Graham, who presented the Inside Out programme claims sheaposll never be able to forget the terrying sights she saw on Deadmanaposs Island. Speaking to The Sun, she said: What I saw there will stay with me forever. This is a really strange sight. I would imagine there can’t be anywhere on earth like this. Th showaposs director, Sam Supple added: It is like being on the set of a horror film. It looks so surreal, it’s like an art department has designed it. There are open coffins and bones everywhere.

Luke Smythe said his children woke up shivering after their boiler broke over the Christmas period. Mr Smythe, his partner Jessica and their children Willow, aged  months, Winter, four, and River, six, who is asthmatic, then waited days for the boiler to be repaired. Baby Willow even started screaming because of the cold, Yorkshire Live reports.The boiler was not fixed until January  even though Mr Smythe, from Scarborough, contacted Insight Lettings on Boxing Day to tell them it had broken. Gail Carmichael, the manager of the company, apologised for the poor service, saying it is totally and utterly unacceptable. On Monday, Mr Smythe said: I am trying my best to spread the word so that no other children have to wake up shivering cold and miserable because of this company. The boiler was finally fixed by Insight Lettings on Tuesday after ious reasons were given to the family for the delay. Mr Smythe contacted Insight Lettings on December  to inform them that the boiler was broken and an engineer from a maintenance company came out the next day. Mr Smythe said: After he left he said he would report the problem and we will get you up and running. That didnapost happen. Mr Smythe said that they waited at home for a number of days and after multiple calls they were eventually told by Insight Lettings that the spare part had been lost. He claims this was not true as he found out that an engineer for the contractor had purchased the part but had not been told what it would be used for so had carried it around in his van. Mr Smythe said: We didnapost get any of that information from Insight though. Itaposs had to come from engineers. Instead of saying aposSomeone picked up the part and we had an errorapos they just said they lost the part, which is ridiculous as it makes no dference to us.  Theyaposve lied to us every step of the way. Theyaposve screwed up royally. Mr Smythe said that he was conscious that some of the staff were away for the Christmas period and offered to help in any way he could, such as by picking up the part that was needed. He said: I found the part online in  minutes. If I could do it why canapost they  Speaking on Monday, Mr Smythe added: They just want to waste my time and give  hope. My kids are still shivering. Imagine being a -month-old. Itaposs not like you can pipe up and say aposIaposm coldapos. The only way to react is to scream your head off. Thataposs what weaposve been dealing with. He also said that by law he and his family should have been provided alternative accommodation within  hours of the problem being reported but nothing has been offered for nine days. He said: I canapost explain how painful it is to watch your children be cold over something as stupid as people not doing their job properly.  Mr Smythe contacted the Environmental Health agency and his local MP in a bid to put pressure on Insight Lettings.After YorkshireLive   contacted the company for a response on Monday night, Mr Smythe was then contacted by the CEO of Insight Lettings on Tuesday morning and the boiler was fixed in the next few hours.Gail Carmichael, manager, gave a response to what had happened, saying that their partner company had sent round an engineer the day after the problem was first reported on Boxing Day. She said: Unfortunately a part was needed to fix the problem and that’s when an unacceptable delay happened and we and the tenant were let down. Although we tried to support Jessica and Luke between Christmas and New Year, we relied too much on our emergency partner to recty the situation for us, which left Jessica and Luke without heating and hot water for too long, which is unacceptable. She said that management were informed of the issue on Monday and tried to find the family alternative accommodation. Ms Carmichael said: We have also offered them a gesture of goodwill to reflect the poor service that they’ve received.

Speaking to Today on BBC Radio , he argued while the new national lockdown in England will clearly save tens of thousands of lives, he fears things have evolved since last March. I think the virus is dferent and it may be that the lockdown measures we had are not enough,” he said. The decision to close all schools and universities until at least mid-February, but not nurseries, has baffled many scientists. The Early Years Alliance, which represents nurseries and childminders, said some providers are closing despite what the Government has said.  Calum Semple, a paediatrician and a fellow member of SAGE, told BBC Breakfast: If we’ve gotten to the point of closing the universities, secondary schools and primary schools on the grounds of public health, then I would be looking to close all other non-essential activities. And it may be that a political decision has been made here that nurseries are essential. But it’s not a scientic one. While the subgroup SPI-B of the Governmentaposs advisory board SAGE recently suggested: “As a consequence of the uncertainty around the mechanisms for increased transmission, enhanced mitigation measures are likely to be necessary.”  It said they could include “reconsidering the m rule and requiring that where regular interactions less than m are necessary this should include correctly worn face coverings. The committee also agreed primary actions to cut transmission would include travel restrictions between regions and internationally, on top of any national lockdown. The likes of Professor Jackie Cassell, from Brighton and Sussex Medical school, have urged the Government to impose smart lockdowns to address the unavoidable contact between essential workers. Prof Cassell said: In Tier  or lockdown, these essential workers are taking the bulk of societyaposs Covid- risk working.

Riley Quinn, from Sheffield, has always been a fit and healthy boy and has never been seriously ill, his mum said.But a couple of months ago he began suffering with headaches and sickness - and his mum couldnapost believe it when he was diagnosed with a brain tumour.Emily Brook, , claimed doctors originally said it was migraines and she had to make sure that Riley was remembering to wear his glasses. But when her little boy started to be sick before eating food, complaining of a aposfunny smellapos when he woke up and starting to lose weight fast she called the doctors again. They said he would be sent for a CT scan to rule anything out but was rushed into hospital on December , , when Emily rang doctors again concerned.It was then that doctors confirmed the devastating news that Riley had a brain tumour, Yorkshire Live reports. Emily said: I just couldnapost believe it. You read of these things happening to other parents and you just never think that it is going to happen to you. Riley has always been a really fit and healthy boy and has never been seriously ill. To look at him you would have never thought he had a brain tumour. His step dad Marc took him into hospital as I had to look after our nine-month-old baby but when  to  professionals started to look at Riley through the window we knew it wasnapost good news. Riley was admitted into hospital that day but doctors couldnapost perform an MRI scan as his heart rate dipped suddenly. An emergency drain was fitted the next day on Christmas Eve to drain away the spinal fluid that had become trapped and was building up pressure.  Emily added: He seemed OK after that but he started to look really poorly in his face and I think his body had finally given up after trying to keep strong for so long. But he wasnapost allowed home for Christmas Day which was obviously really heartbreaking. He was taken in for an operation on December  to remove the tumour, most of it was removed apart from a tiny slither which was attached to his brain stem. Riley still canapost talk or move much and his tongue has really swollen up since the surgery but doctors expect him to make a full recovery. At the moment we canapost see past taking each day as it comes, its been so hard to see him like that, not like the Riley we know. Right now itaposs just heartbreaking but his progress from day to day has been remarkable.  Doctors believe that Riley should make a full recovery within a few weeks. But now the family have to begin the anxious wait to find outthe tumour is cancerous. Emily said: A biopsy has been taken of the tumour and we should hopefully have those results back next week. But for now its just an anxious wait. When we first told Riley about his diagnosis the first thing he asked was aposit is cancer apos so now weaposre just praying that it is benign. For now weaposre just taking it everyday as it comes. I feel awful because I didnapost believe him at first and I thought he was faking it and I should have called the doctors sooner than I did. Riley was begging me not to phone anyone, but I will never forgive myself. I just really want to raise awareness now to make sure that you listen to your children, eventheyaposre adamant nothing is wrong just ring the doctors anyway.

Whilst almost all pubs across Britain are shut, the residents of Chandler Court care home are still allowed to enjoy cocktails, a pint and a chat with pals. Some  residents have been frequenting The Chandler Arms, their in-home pub. Allowed in six at a time, Martin Dowell, , said: “It’s great to meet for a pint.” The care home’s pub in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire has been respite for many during the pandemic, missing the social interaction it brings. Boss of Chandler Court, Dawn Covill, said: “We all miss going to the pub. “In these challenging times, there’s nothing like catching up with an old friend over a drink or two. “So when residents told us they missed their local, we thought we’d bring it to them.” The care home was able to set up a pub within their building. This meant that it was allowed to stay open and residents could visit it in a safe, socially distanced manner.  “For many residents, the pub is associated with a lot of positive memories from their younger years, from their first-ever drink to countless hearty meals with family or friends, and everything in between.” He added. “The Chandler Arms’ opening was a huge success and residents left with a smile on their face. “Ironically, it turns out we’re the only pub in the UK to be unaffected by the tier restrictions, so we’re looking forward to our next pub night.” "},{"url":null,"title":"pandemic gave bosses more power","story":"NewsopinionPandemic gave bosses more power and reduced staff to status of th century outworkerThe pandemic has produced profit for many businesses, who no longer have to provide a warm office space for staff - increasing their power but reducing the status of employeesmirrorShareCommentsByPaul Routledge:,  JAN Newsopinionthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror incoming video boris-johnson-explains-new-lockdown-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

That was the start of the Industrial Revolution, which put the Great into Britain. But now it’s more profitable to send them home to work, employers are happy to do that. “Bosses predict the end of full-time office working” read the headline over a story that three-quarters of businesses will keep home working that was introduced last year. I suspect it won’t be a matter of choice, but a condition of the work relationship that passes for employment these days. Do you feel your bosses are benefiting from the pandemic  Have your say in the comments section Pandemics can produce profit. If it suits the bottom line, people will have to do the job from their child’s bedroom – or find other work. “Working from home, or workshy at home ” I asked early on. But productivity has held up well, because six out of  say they find it impossible to switch off.  Instead of working from home, we’re living at work. I’ve been doing it most of this century. Fragmentation of employment has been going on for years. Covid- has accelerated the trend, putting greater power in the hands of the employer, who no longer has to provide office space, heating, lighting or car parks. And there will be no office romance on Zoom.

But a ban on non-essential travel in the latest lockdown means the couple will stay at their new home in America. Royal sources confirmed the prince has “not yet attempted to contact” his grandmother to arrange a meeting, but was expected to arrange a solution in the coming weeks. A -month review of Harry and Meghan’s agreement with the Palace is due on March . The couple, who stunned the Queen by quitting their posts last January, are understood to have wanted to increase the time frame before a deal becomes permanent. Harry is keen on retaining his military appointments and under the current arrangement, they still have royal patronages including Meghan’s of the National Theatre. But senior advisers are understood to have been alarmed at the pace at which the Duke and Duchess have signed mega-money deals in the corporate world.As part of their bid for ­“financial independence” from the taxpayer, they agreed to pay back more than £.million of public funds used to refurbish their ­ Frogmore Cottage home on the Windsor estate. But they also agreed to “continue to uphold the values of Her Majesty”, something recently called into question when US chat show host Oprah Winfrey advertised a vegan coffee on her personal Instagram page which Meghan has invested in.Sources have confirmed courtiers are taking a “renewed in-depth look at the couple’s business deals” to seethey are in line with the Queen’s values. Harry, , and -year-old Meghan live in the ­millionaires’ playground of Montecito, Calornia. The pair are in a legal battle with the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday publishers, Associated Newspapers.

Iris Jones and Mohamed Ahmed Ibriham have been cruelly separately by visa issues, which has seen the junior side of the relationship remain in Egypt. Plans for Mohamed, who is  years younger than his -year-old lover, to come to the UK are currently on pause as he attempts to get a spousal visa. Distance has not dampened the Middle Eastern manaposs passion for Iris however, who is waiting for him in her Somerset bungalow. Posting on Facebook, he wrote: Until the end of my le, my love for you, my dear, my sun and my moon, my queen Iris Mohamdy. Do you and your partner have an age gap  Let us know in the comments section below Iris is finding the time apart from her boyfriend dficult and is suffering headaches from the stress.  She told the : When I was over there I was spending £ a day on accommodation, and when you work out £ a day for three months, I’ve come back skint. She added: “I get days when I’m all right and other days when I’m just crying all the time. “I’m separated from someone I love, it’s so hard. I haven’t got time on my side, his lawyers know that. “I’ve had to go over there three times and come back without him. “I can’t go back to Egypt, that country does not suit me. “It’s too hot, it’s too dusty, I don’t like the food and the fumes from the traffic is absolutely horrendous. Half the cars on the road would be crushedthey were in Britain.” Even though Iris is lonely without Mohamed, she said she has managed to reconnect with her family in recent months. Her sons Stephen, , and Darren, , were concerned about the age gap of the relationship initially, but Iris recently told the Mirror that they had come round.  She said: My boys are now accepting of the fact that this is genuine. We genuinely love one another.” The pensioner spent Christmas with her sons but did not speak to her new love on Christmas Day “because he is a Muslim and he doesn’t celebrate it”. The couple do make time to talk every day and are still smitten with each other. Iris added: “I didn’t think this would happen at my age – falling so deeply in love with someone half my age – but you can’t help who you fall in love with.

Chuck Stacey, who owns an IT firm, struggles to breathe as he delivers his stark message in a harrowing video that he recorded while being treated for Covid- - a disease he had dismissed as a bad flu. Seriously ill with the virus and now filled with regret, the American man, who has an oxygen tube up his nose, tells the camera: “I didn’t wear a mask. I should’ve. I didn’t. “I believed this was just the flu and it was all going to go away and it was political. I didn’t think a mask would help.” Click here for our live blog with the latest updates on the coronavirus pandemic and restrictions in the UK. As he struggles to breathe, Chuck, from Inlet Beach, Florida, adds: “You don’t want to end up like me. I’m having trouble breathing. I may have to be intubatedI get any worse.” He didnapost take the virus or face masks seriously even though the US has the worst outbreak in the world, with , deaths and . million confirmed cases. He even attacked workers at a local Donut Hole shop for wearing face masks to protect themselves and customers from the disease.In May, Chuck wrote on Facebook: “I have to say I have had it with the masks that the employees are being forced to wear. “It’s just another example of the continued overreaction to this situation. Please stop so when we come to eat we can enjoy our meal without feeling sorry for the employees.” This week, in the video recorded from his hospital bed, Chuck urged skeptics to change their beliefs and do what is necessary to protect themselves and others. He says: “If wearing a mask can reduce your chances of getting this even by five per cent, just wear a mask. “Do it for your children, your loved ones. Do it for yourself.”Chuckaposs friend, Daniel Uhlfelder, shared the video on Twitter.Referring to US President Donald Trump, who has consistently downplayed the virus and peddled misinformation, Daniel wrote: “My friend didn’t wear a mask because he believed the lies from our leaders. Now, he’s close to being intubated. He asked that I share this.”Chuck shared additional videos in which he said he wore a face shield instead of a face mask at the advice of his doctor because of his “claustrophobia,” which he described as “debilitating”.  He explained: “My doctor came up with the idea of a face shield with social distancing and being responsible with hand sanitiser and [minimising] my contact in the field. I own an IT company so I can work from home. It’s worked for almost a year. “Nothing is  per cent on this virus and evenI would’ve wore a mask I could’ve still gotten it. But the fact of the matter is we have to do everything that we can do to protect ourselves and to protect the people that are really at risk.

Zack King from Hackney, east London, ed home one day to find his one-year-old feline Billy with an unexpected note attached to his collar informing him that heaposd been paying their neighbour frequent visits. His girlfriend, -year-old Olga Shipunova, replied to the sweet surprise back in September and theyaposve since become pen-pals, exchanging around  handwritten notes with the help of Billy. Zach, , said that the unexpected relationship made possible thanks to their cheeky apospostcatapos has been a highlight of the coronavirus lockdown. He also said that theyaposve been sharing recipes and television recommendations with their unknown neighbour who even kitted little Billy out with a proper mailbag. Zack, who works in advertising, said: It was really sweet when it happened - we had a note saying aposyour cat always comes and sees meapos - we know that heaposs a friendly cat. Olga replied and itaposs been back and forth a little bit - itaposs really her replying and we add a few nice recommendations and stuff.  Iaposd saved them all and shared them with family and friends because theyaposre animal lovers and it just occurred to me that I should probably put it online. My favourite note was when she asked what she could treat him with - she was kind enough to say he could have salmon, and we let her know that he loves everything. Zack said that the relationship is still ongoing and the latest note has been attached to Billy for the last  hours - but they have no idea when their British Shorthair will be paying their pen pals his next visit. Zack shared the story on Twitter which quickly amassed more than , likes and retweets.He said: I thought a few people might get something out of it - it was nice to see that people shared it. Itaposs definitely something we look forward to - when the cat flap goes and we suddenly notice that the note isnapost what weaposve attached and thereaposs a new note.  Billy is very cheeky and inquisitive - he doesnapost do things by half -heaposs sleepy heaposs sleepy andheaposs playful heaposs playful. Billy himself has been a highlight of lockdown - and the notes, extra so - especially as the winter months drew in and we found it a bit tougher with fewer connections. The first note the couple received read: Your cat likes to come visit us when he is outside.  He will sit at the door and meow to be let in. Itaposs actually hilarious and we love him!! We have no idea where he is coming from. Whataposs his name  We call him Billy : From your friendly neighbours! Olga and Zack replied: Weaposre glad heaposs making friends with the neighbours! And his name is Billy!!! So you guessed right.  Give him lots of chin scratches! We lost his name tag, we need to get him a new one xx The pair regularly exchanged notes, with the delighted neighbour describing Billy delivering their notes like a carrier pigeon, but much cuter obvs. What started off as general chit-chat turned into recipe sharing, including instructions on how to whip up a batch of wasabi mash, and how to make the most incredible hummus.

The WHO has been attempting to send in the team of global experts from a number of countries for months and scientists say it is essential to find out how the virus jumped species into humans. The mission is not thought to be intending to probe claims that the virus originated in a Chinese lab, which many scientists have dismissed. Today we learned that Chinese officials have not yet finalised the necessary permissions for the teamaposs arrival in China, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told an online news conference in Geneva. I have been in contact with senior Chinese officials and I have once again made it clear the mission is a priority for the WHO, he said of the trip he said was developed with Beijing. The mission was due to be led by Peter Ben Embarek, WHOaposs top expert on animal diseases that cross the species barrier, who went to China on a preliminary mission last July. Two members of the international team had already set out on their journey to China. One has now turned back and the other is in transit in a third country, emergencies chief Mike Ryan said.  However, he added: We trust and hope that is just a logistic and bureaucratic issue that can be resolved very quickly. Ahead of the trip, Beijing has been seeking to shape the narrative about when and where the pandemic began, with senior diplomat Wang Yi saying more and more studies showed that it emerged in multiple regions. Ryan has previously called this highly speculative.  China has dismissed criticism of its handling of early cases that emerged in late , although some including President Donald Trump have questioned Beijingaposs actions during the outbreak.Washington, which has announced plans to leave the WHO, has called for a transparent investigation and criticised its terms under which Chinese experts conducted the first phase of research.

She has travelled and trekked throughout the world but now lives in Argyll amongst the scenery she loves. www.heatheryheightsDuring wintry weather and shorter days it can be tricky fitting in longer walks and time for exploring the outdoors.What is fantastic about Knapdale and Kintyre is that we only have to go a short distance to gain truly spectacular views. The three walks in this edition y from relatively short, using tracks and paths to the lovely viewpoint of Castle Dounie, to challenging, where the terrain is tough underfoot and good route finding skills are required. All three start at Crinan harbour before climbing up through oak and birch woods to gain open vistas with views to Jura, Scarba and Mull. The convoluted ridge walks are rugged and wild, the steep sides sweeping down to the Sound of Jura where tides race and swirl. If you are lucky you may see pods of dolphins or even whales.. At the car park a signboard shows the Crinan Trail. This is the shorter of the routes but all three start and finish together. Leave the car park and turn left. Keeping to the road by the shore you will see a trail marker post ahead leading you briefly along the shore before the path heads into oak woods. After m the path bends sharply left. To the right a faint trail heads west towards the Sailor’s Grave but your route starts its steep muddy ascent to the forestry road above.. On reaching the road turn right, after m you will reach a bench and the first junction to your left. Here you have a choice either come back from the track ahead or to your left. All routes can be undertaken in either direction. I suggest for the longer routes you go straight on and for the Crinan Trail you go left.. For the Crinan Trail follow the waymark posts and arrows. After .km the route turns right onto a path and winds up and down with glimpses of views to come. Turn left at a sign for a viewpoint. This will take you up to the knoll atop which the remains of Castle Dounie, a prehistoric dun, command spectacular views over the sound towards the Gulf of Corryvreckan. There it is said the Cailleach Bheur, a giant witch, once washed her plaid in its whirlpools. Enjoy the vista before ing down to the junction and turn left. The path now meanders down to the forestry road. Turn right and head north round the coast above Adnoe Point and back to your path down to Crinan harbour.. For the longer walks, go straight ahead at the bench . Follow the track for nearly km, which leads you round a couple of hairpin bends and above Adnoe Point, before turning south. Keep your eyes open for the waymark posts and turn left onto a path. Head uphill for m. At the viewpoint sign turn right up to Castle Dounie and enjoy. To your south is the ridge that leads to Creag Mhor.. Immediately after dropping from Castle Dounie you will see a broken down wall on your right. Follow this for a short distance until you can start to work your way up onto the ridge to your right, by a couple of birch trees with coners on the skyline above. The ridge walk is convoluted, airy, rough and summits numerous lumps and bumps with fantastic views. Keep to the crest or east side as the drop-offs to the west are impressive but not to be dallied with. The highest rocky bump of Creag Mhor is parallel to the north end of the rocks offshore.. After  minutes of knobbly and exposed ridge walking #you do not fancy tackling navigation along walls in woods # this is now the time to keep an eye out for an obvious wide firebreakin the trees, below to your left. This leads you at a ° angle straight to a forestry track in the valley below. To check you have the right point look across from the firebreak and you should see a wall continue the line on the other side. Head down the firebreak to the track and turn left. This will take you back to the junction by the bench where you can turn right on the forest road then left todown the path to Crinan harbour.. If you wish to adventure on* and are confident with your route finding then continue south on the ridge # crossing over an old wall not on the map # to where it suddenly drops to a tiny col with forest directly ahead. Ahead is a steep little rise with walls on it. One drops to the right but it is the one going southwest into the forest you need to follow, for the next m. Keeping the wall directly on your right, circumnavigating the odd boulder and ducking the odd branch, you will see that the deer have created quite a path and that the way is often clear. Eventually it drops you very steeply down to a stream with another wall directly ahead. Turn left, southeast, up the stream with the wall on your right # it is boggy # until you reach a quaint waterfall on your left. A small break in the wall to your right allows you to escape the trees that have fallen across the wall higher up. Continue with it on your left across a tree harvested area and up the bump ahead. You will pop out onto a track end.. Follow this short track down to the forest road below. Turn right and almost immediately turn left onto a grassy track that crosses a stream and heads east up into the forest. After m you will come to a sharp left-hand bend. Directly in front of you a wall goes steeply up into the trees. This is your route up to Bealach na Moine. It leads up slippery, mossy rock for m, over a barbed wired fence , up a very rough and eroded track for nearly m, past a spring hidden with fallen trees, then over more pleasant grass and moss to the col. This last section makes you realise why it is worth the effort as views open up east and west. Turn right over a couple of steep little hillocks on the ridge. Suddenly ahead you will see your goal, the trig point and the summit of Cnoc Reamhar, also known as Gallachoille Hill and a Marilyn to boot. It really is a fantastic view.. Toeither descend the way you came or drop down from one of the breaks in the ridge to the north end of the small lochan on the west side of the summit, and follow the faint Landover track north to the spring. Re-join your ascent route, taking care on the way down. Turn rightat the forest road it is now an easy km back to the junction with the bench. Turn right then left after m, following the path back to Crinan harbour.*You can also drop down the firebreak and turn right on the track to join the route up to Cnoc Reamhar,continuing along the ridge does not appeal.The described routes and accompanying information are there to be used as a guide and do not replace the use of map and compass and the skills required to use them. Whilst every effort is made to ensure the route is accurate at the time of going to print please be aware that track and path closures can happen at any time. All walks are undertaken at your own risk. Please continue to adhere to current guidelines as set out by the government, exercise responsibly and use appropriate clothing and equipment for your chosen outdoor activity.

The sector in Scotland accounts for around  per cent of UK production and is worth about £ million annually.One fth of these exports go to the EU, amounting to more than , tonnes a year.This is clearly a disastrous Brexit outcome for Scottish farmers and like all other aspects of Brexit, foisted on Scotland against its will.A terrible negotiating failure on the part of the Tory government, and a devastating blow to an extremely valuable part of Scotland’s farming industry, I am sure it will not be the first damaging impact to be highlighted once the deal is fully analysed.Alex Orr, EdinburghSir,The report on the Piers and Harbours Asset Management Plan and Fees and Charges –  , submitted to the Argyll and Bute Council Harbour Board meeting of December ,  makes interesting reading.At a time when budgets are tight and councils have had to make hard decisions about where to cut services, it is dficult to understand why the council budget should be used to supplement the funding of dedicated ferry infrastructure for which CMAL should be responsible.The asset management plan allocates £,, for planned marine infrastructure works for the year  , of which only £, , is devoted to multi-use facilities. The remainder, £,,, is mostly allocated to single-use ferry facilities, and a huge proportion of that is to provide overnight parking for CalMac ferriesreaders will have to make up their own minds about the merits of spending £,, for an overnight berth at Fionnphort, and £, on a feasibility study for a breakwater at Lismore.CMAL pay back around half of the £,, to the council through harbour dues for the use of council-owned piers, however, that still leaves a whopping £ million gap in the required funding.If past experience of other CMAL projects is anything to go by, the planned eight per cent increase in council harbour fees and charges up to   is not going to cover it.Fergus Gillanders, KilmelfordSir,Last year, , was challenging and, although many people like to give generously to charity at Christmas time, it may have been dficult to make a donation this festive season.It#s not too late # you can still help support the Royal National Institute of Blind Peopleby collecting and donating used stamps from cards and parcels you may have received.Your stamps will be recycled and turned into vital funds that will help RNIB support children with vision impairment.

Food and drink is a staple in households across Scotland for Hogmanay, and it is certainly something that can remain the same, even with these uncertain times.A pot of soup to bring in the bells never goes amiss, and youd be forgiven for thinking that a slow-cooked stew is something of legend at this time of year.But while many families would plan to head out for a New Years Day meal, this will not be going ahead this year.Alternatives could include trying out some new recipes at home, and having a New Years meal at home. Bake some goodies to bring in the bells with, such as traditional Scots tablet or shortbread.Zoom have lted their -minute time limit across the New Year period, so set the camera at the bottom of your table and invite however many guests youd like!First footingA tradition throughout Scotland on Hogmanay, the normal act of first footing will certainly be missed this year, but there may be a way to salvage it.Traditionally, first footing involves the first person who enters the house after midnight bringing gts. It has been adapted through the years, and some now visit neighbours with a tipple and a song before moving on to the next house.While were not allowed in other peoples houses this year, we can certainly adapt the tradition.Ask one of your household to draw the short straw and brave the cold just after midnight and emulate a first footing with your immediate bubble. Or, have a virtual first footing, and make sure to call your loved ones and wish them a Happy New Year.TelevisionAs always, there will be a raft of content available to watch on TV on Hogmanay. Therersquoll likely be old favourites including the likes of Still Game.As ever, there will be several Hogmanay specials to help us bring in the bells from the comfort of our own home. Over on BBC One, Susan Calman will be getting ready for Hogmanay  with ldquoa studio of stars.Live eventsThe events that Scotlandrsquos festive season is famed for wonrsquot be going ahead in person this year.

Naturally, this would not be the last time an IndyRef would be brought up this year.On January , the UK confirmed its first two cases of Covid-.FebruaryBy February , the forthcoming coronavirus pandemic seemed a million miles away ndash with only three cases confirmed by this point.Attention instead was on Storm Ciara ndash a powerful and long-lived cyclone which battered parts of the country with gusts of up to mph.Flooding and heavy wind caused damage to buildings and train services, and on February , a -year-old man died after falling on icy surfaces and banging his head during the storm.Another major news story to unfold in the last year was surrounding former finance secretary Derek Mackay MSP.Once tipped to become the next First Minister, the Scottish Sun revealed the now shamed politician had been pestering a -year-old schoolboy on social media.The paper reported the -year-old MSP had contacted the boy out of the blue without knowing his age the previous August, then sent him  messages over six months.MarchThen came March ndash a month that can only be described as the month coronavirus pandemic really hit home in Scotland.On March , Scotland had its first confirmed case of the virus in the NHS Tayside, followed soon after by its first death on March .By March ,  cases had been confirmed in the country, with the virus clearly beginning to spread into other health boards.The inevitable news then came ndash with all pubs, cafes and restaurants being forced to close on March , before a nationwide lockdown on March .On the same day, Alex Salmond was cleared of sexually assaulting nine woman while he was the First Minister.As the BBC reports, a jury found the former SNP leader not guilty on  of the sexual assault charges facing him, while another was found not proven.A further charge of sexually assaulting a th woman had previously been dropped by prosecutors. Throughout the trial, Mr Salmond said he was innocent of all charges.On March , Clap For Carers was launched - coined up as a way to show appreciation for those on the NHS and other frontline services during the pandemic.The event saw people taking to their doorsteps and windows at pm every Thursday to clap, cheer, ring bells and play bagpipes to show their support.The last formal clap took place on May , followed by an extea Clap for NHS on July  marking the nd anniversary of its establishment.AprilOn April , the Queen made a rare broadcast to the UK and wider Commonwealth, in which she thanked people for following social distancing rules and said the UK ldquowill succeed in its fight against the coronavirus.Echoing the words of Vera Lynnrsquos wartime song, she added ldquoWe will meet again.On the same day, Scotlandrsquos Chief Medical Officer Dt Catherine Calderwood resigned after facing intense criticism for breaking lockdown rules twice to visit her second home during the pandemic.Dr Calderwood concluded with the First Minister that her position was untenable given the need for consistent and trustworthy public health messaging.Sticking with the pandemic, all eyes were on -year-old war veteran Tom Moore on April , who raised millions of pounds for NHS charities for walking more than  laps of his garden.In less joyful news, just four days later on April , Scotlandrsquos new temporary coronavirus hospital the NHS Louisa Jordan opened to receive Covid patients.MayOn May , Boris Johnsonrsquos senior advisor Dominic Cummings faced calls to resign after an investigation alleged he travelled  miles from London to his parentrsquos home in Durham while displaying coronavirus symptoms during lockdown.On May , Cummings held a press conference in the Downing Street Rose Garden, in which he said: ldquoI donrsquot regret what I did. The following day, Tory MP for Moray Douglas Ross, resigned as a Scotland Office minister over his views on the alleged breach.JuneOn June , a man with a kne stabbed six people, including a police officer and hotel staff, in the Park Inn Hotel in Glasgow.The attacker, Badreddin Abadlla Adam, was shot dead by a police officer on the scene.Police said the incident was not being treated as terrorism.JulyAfter a tough few months, beer gardens were allowed to reopen from July  ndash taking advantage of some warm weather that was about to come.Following weeks of guidance, Scotland made it officially law to make it compulsory to wear a face covering in shops across Scotland on July .AugustPupils in Scotland finally began ing to classrooms on August , without the need to socially distance ndash with pupils initially not having to wear face coverings. This was later changed on August , requiring the need for masks in corridors, canteens and other communal areas.The following day, on August , three people died after a passenger train derailed in Aberdeenshire.The . ScotRail service from Aberdeen to Glasgow Queen Street hit a landslide near to Stonehaven following heavy rain and thunderstorms.The victims were named as driver Brett McCullough, , conductor Donald Dinnie, , and passenger Christopher Stuchbury, .SeptemberOn September , the NHS Protect Scotland app was released to the public on iOS and Android devices, providing anonymous and Bluetooth-enabled contact tracing for those who download it in Scotland.On September , Nicola Sturgeon announced a ban on meeting in households as she came down hard following a rise in cases across the country.A pm curfew on pubs, similar to that already in place in England, was also confirmed.OctoberOn October , Margaret Ferrier, MP for Rutherglen and Hamilton West, was suspended by the SNP and referred herself to the police after it became known she had travelled from Scotland to Westminster the previous weekend, despite awaiting the outcome of a Covid test.She then chose to travel home again by train, despite being notied of the positive result.And on October , James Bond actor Sir Sean Connery died at the age of .The Scottish actor, best known for his portrayal of the  spy, died in his sleep in the Bahamas ldquohaving been unwell for some time, his son said.NovemberA new five level, or ldquotier, system of lockdown was introduced in Scotland on November , bringing in new targeted restrictions to dferent parts of the country.And after an agonising two-decade long wait, Scotlandrsquos menrsquos team finally reached the finals of a major football tournament after beating Serbia on penalties.A masterclass penalty save from keeper David Marshall sent Scotland through, with subsequent celebrations leading to the rise of now Tartan Army-favourite Yes Sir, I Can Boogie, to the top of the charts.DecemberWhat could only be described as a potential light at the end of the tunnel, the first coronavirus vaccinations were administered in Scotland on December .Thousands of people have so far been given their first dose of the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, which after two doses is thought to be % effective against Covid-.However, the good news didnrsquot last long, and following an outbreak of a new strain of Covid in the UK, the co-ordinated plan for Christmas across the UK was cancelled on December .Nicola Sturgeon announced a travel ban to other parts of the UK during the festive period, with people within Scotland only allowed to ease the rules on Christmas Day ndash not between December  and  as previously planned.On Boxing Day, Scotlandrsquos toughest levels of lockdown came into effect across all mainland areas, with schools now no longer resuming in the classroom until at least January .The tough new rules mean non-essential shops, pubs, restaurants and gums will close for at least four weeks."},{"url":null,"title":"steak-pie-scottish-new-years-day-tradition","story":"SCOTS love a steak pie to celebrate the New Year and cannot get enough of them, according to an industry expert.But therersquos a surprising reason as to why itrsquos become an annual tradition across the country.Bruce McColl, the member services manager for the Scottish Craft Butchers Association, was able to provide some insight into our January  delight.He said: ldquoOne theory holds that steak pie became the national dish at New Years because January  wasnrsquot generally taken as a holiday so families were too busy to cook, said Mr McColl.ldquoThey would buy steak pies to feed their families instead, this continues to this day as people want a delicious meal after the previous nightrsquos celebrations.ldquoSo it was essentially one of the first ready meals.Steak pie then could be the nationrsquos hangover cure on what is often the roughest morning of the year for many, after a night of celebratory drinking.Mr McColl added: ldquoThe other train of thought is that people would have it as their main meal on Hogmanay before they started to drink.ldquoItrsquos a good meal to be made in advance so a lot of people have it as their main meal before the bells.ldquoAnother theory is that because it is a big meal you can keep warm and serve to visitors throughout the day, as people come to the house.Steak pie, it seems, fits Scotlandrsquos New Years celebrations perfectly - whether as a meal which can feed a number of visitors popping in throughout the day, soak up the booze from the night before or to line onersquos stomach for a big night ahead.Do you enjoy a steak pie on January   Let us know in the comments."},{"url":null,"title":"selkirk-klaus-animator-helps-make-online-nativity-film","story":"BORDERS film animator Amanda Aiken worked on an Oscar-nominated movie last year.But recently the -year-old lenther talents to Selkirk, helping to create an online nativity play for the town and surrounding communities.Aiken, , has been making films since she was a teenager, and last year she had the opportunity to work on an Oscar-nominated animation, Klaus, which can be found on Netflix.\"[Klaus] has been my largest project so far,\" said Aiken. \"Ive worked on smaller features before but this was my first big animated film.\":Borders hotel shows off unusual decoration for festive periodKlausis an origins story of Santa Claus and the tradition of writing letters to Santa.

UK citizens will be allowed to stay in the EU for  days in any -day period without a visa, and the same will apply for EU citizens in the UK.The European Commission says the choice to end free movement ldquoinevitably means that business travel between the EU and the UK will no longer be as easy as it currently is.People heading from the UK for business have been told by the Government to check the requirements of the country they are travelling to.British passport holders will no longer be able to use the EU passport queue at airports and other borders.Will I need a visa for my holiday From , you will have to purchase a pound visa-waiver for holidays and short stays.UK nationals will not need a visa for short trips to EU countries theyre just going on holiday.But they will have to pay for a visa-waiver ndash this will cost euroand will be issued under the European Travel Information and Authorisation System.Can I work in the EU From  onwards you may need extra documents to work or study, or for trips longer than  days.Details of this have yet to be confirmed and it will likely depend on what you are doing and where you are going.But those going to work or study abroad, plus those just going on business trips, might be affected from January , , onwards.Will I need a blue passport No, your current passport is still eligible.Pre-Brexit, you could travel to EU countries on your passport right up to the point it expires ndash and that willcontinueto be the case this year, and will be until the end of the transition period on December .However, next year, the rules are changing.These changes were announced prior to the trade deal and arent expected to be affected by it.Under the new rules, fromJanuary , , when you visit most EU countries and Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, your passport will need to have at least six months left on it until expiry and be less than ten years old on the day you travel.Will security change The UK will lose access to a iety of key EU databases - used by the police- covering things such as criminal records, fingerprints and wanted persons.However, the UK will still have access to other systems which include cross-checks on fingerprints across Europe. This means that security co-operation will no longer be on ldquoreal-time access.The UK and the EU have reached an agreement on extradition, and the UKs role in Europol, the cross-border security agency, allows it to sit in on meetings but not have a direct say in decisions.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was \"absolutely confident\" the deal \"protects our police co-operation, protects our ability to catch criminals and to share intelligence across the European continent in the way that we have done for many years\".What about fishing The value of fish being caught by the EU in UK waters will be reduced by % and will be phased into transition over a five-and-a-half-year period.Once the transition period is over, the UK will fully control access to its waters and could make much deeper cuts.What is the impact on EU citizens living in the UK While Brexit affects everyone in the UK, the most immediate direct impact is on the . million people living here who are citizens of other EU countries.If you are a European Economic Area or Swiss citizen living in Britain, you wont have to leave the UK because weve left the EU.

And it includes nursery schools, as well as primary and secondary schools.Ms Sturgeon said: \"I want to be clear that it remains our priority to get school buildings open again for all pupils as quickly as possible and then keep them open.\"However, right now, two factors mean that it is not consistent with a safety-first approach for all children to attend school in person.\"First, the overall level of community transmission is too high. We need to get transmission down before schools can safely reopen. A period of online learning will also, in turn, help us do that.\"The second reason is that there is still signicant uncertainty about the impact of the new iant on transmission amongst young people.\"We, therefore, have to adopt a cautious approach.\"So most pupils will be learning online for at least the rest of the month.\"This decision will be reviewed on January  whether they canto school on February .Meeting people outdoorsFrom tomorrow,the rule on outdoor gatherings will change.Previously, up to six people from two households are able to meet outdoors. Given the greater transmissibility of this new iant, the Scottish Government willconsider it necessary to restrict that further.From tomorrow, a maximum of two people from up to two households will be able to meet outdoors.Children aged  and under will not be counted in that limit, and they will also be able to play outdoors in larger groups, including in organized gatherings.However, for everyone  ndash including  to -year-olds - outdoor exercise should only take place in a way which is consistent with the twopeople from twohouseholds rule.Working from homeAnyone who is able to work from home must do so.It will only be a reasonable excuse to leave your home to go to workthat work cannot be done from home.The Scottish Government are asking people and businesses to take this \"really seriously\" because the situation is at least as serious now as it was then.The law already requires many businesses in certain sectors to close in Level .Every business is being asked to look again at their operations and to make sure that every singlethat can be done by people working at home, is being done in that way.Shielding advice changesIf you were shielding and you cannot work from home, our clear advice now is that you should not go into work at all.Hospitals near capacityNicola Sturgeon confirmed that thetotal number of Covid- patients in hospital is close to its April peak.In terms of hospital beds, NHS Ayrshire and Arran is currently at % of its Covid- capacity, and three other health boards - Borders, GreaterGlasgow  Clyde and Lanarkshire - are above % of their capacity.The total number of patients in intensive care in Scotland is already above normal winter levels. Indeed, all mainland health boards have now exceeded their normal intensive care unit capacity.And it is important to be clear that people who are in hospital and ICU now are likely to have been infected  days to twoweeks ago.Other restrictions will also come into effect includingplaces of worship closing,no wakes, two-metre distancing in canteens and further premises closing.The fortnightly review will not simply be a choice between opening and closing schools - we will always seek to maximise the number of pupils we can safely get back to classrooms and nurseries.What help will be provided Grants areavailable for businesses required to close as a result of restrictions.

Thorne Security says it could have a system in operation for £,, less than half the amount the  previously thought it would cost.The system would include four cameras to cover Main Street, Longrow, Burnside Square and the area around Hall Street and the cross.Four special television screens at Campbeltown Police Station would allow the police to watch the pictures from the cameras. The images would be recorded on an industrial-quality video recorder at the station. The pictures could alert the police to trouble or help them trace offenders.The team from Thorne Security will be visiting Campbeltown at the end of January to demonstrate the equipment.The secretary of the , Sergeant Douglas Reid of Campbeltown police, has already contacted the Scottish Office for more details about the funding package. Sergeant Reid said: ‘The  is fully committed, following the tremendous public response, to go in as far as possible along this road.’The  is already planning to apply to other local and national bodies for contributions towards the cost of the system.The Scottish Office’s challenge competition will make funds available for groups representing local communities to bid for money to fund CCTV systems.Applicants from dferent areas will bid in competition with each other for a share of the government cash.The first town centre security camera system in Scotland was set up in Airdrie three years ago. New research shows that in the first two years after the system was set up, the crime rate plunged by  per cent.The Scottish Office says there is no evidence that crime was simply being shted to areas outwith the reach of the cameras. Instead the total amount of recorded crime actually fell.FIFTY YEARS AGOMcCartney again!Mr Paul McCartney, ex-bass guitarist with the Beatles, has recently purchased from Mr A Revie, Loch Ranachan Farm, which comprises  acres and adjoins his other farm, High Park.Mr McCartney has been spending a few days on the farm with his we and family over the festive season.One happy Rangers fanMr Crawford Morans of  Albyn Avenue, who is employed with the Ministry of Social Security, has had a good ending to the old year.

In the Clyde, however, the Board of Trade did not insist on this in respect of vessels trading exclusively within what is known as the smooth water area.This area was within an imaginary line drawn from Skipness Point to Fairlie. On the date in question, the accused conveyed a cargo from Glasgow to Tobermory via the Crinan Canal.As soon as he had left Crinan, he was in contravention of the regulations, having entered the more hazardous waters off the west coast.On behalf of the accused, an agent stated that he had traded with the Bloodhound for nearly  years. During the war, the ship had been requisitioned by the Ministry of Shipping, and under the orders of that department had been sent outside the limits of the smooth water area.The accused had naturally thought that what he had been doing during the war, when he traded to ports on Islay and the Ayrshire coast, he was free to do now.Sherf Macmaster Campbell imposed a penalty of £."},{"url":null,"title":"leader january 1 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Food and drink is a staple in households across Scotland for Hogmanay, and it is certainly something that can remain the same, even with these uncertain times.A pot of soup to bring in the bells never goes a miss, and youd be forgiven for thinking that a slow-cooked stew is something of legend at this time of year.But while many families would plan to head out for a New Years Day meal, this will not be going ahead this year.Alternatives could include trying out some new recipes at home, and having a New Years meal at home. Bake some goodies to bring in the bells with, such as traditional Scots tablet or shortbread.Zoom have lted their -minute time limit across the New Year period, so set the camera at the bottom of your table and invite however many guests youd like!A tradition throughout Scotland on Hogmanay, the normal act of first footing will certainly be missed this year, but there may be a way to salvage it.Traditionally, first footing involves the first person who enters the house after midnight bringing gts. It has been adapted through the years, and some now visit neighbours with a tipple and a song before moving on to the next house.While were not allowed in other peoples houses this year, we can certainly adapt the tradition.Ask one of your household to draw the short straw and brave the cold just after midnight and emulate a first footing with your immediate bubble. Or, have a virtual first footing, and make sure to call your loved ones and wish them a Happy New Year.As always, there will be a raft of content available to watch on TV on Hogmanay. The official TV guide has not yet been released, but therersquoll likely be old favourites including the likes of Still Game.As ever, there will be several Hogmanay specials to help us bring in the bells from the comfort of our own home.

There was heavy traffic and, needless to say, Irsquod never driven a bus before and hadnrsquot expected to at this moment either.ldquoYou mean drive the bus  I foolishly asked.ldquoThatrsquos why you are here, isnrsquot it  he replied.I was on the bus with two other learners, as well as the instructor. We had been given some rudimentary instructions by him as hersquod driven the bus into the busy city centre, but I hadnrsquot realised we would actually have to drive the bus through busy streets.That was the first time I had driven a bus. It was, of course, an assessment of my capabilities. I negotiated as best I could and quickly learned what a tail swing was, as I nearly shaved off the nose of a woman who was standing on the edge of a pavement waiting to cross the road!The gearstick felt like it had been cemented to the vehicle, making changing gears a Herculean effort, with the engine roaring as I struggled to crunch it into gear. I drove slowly and cars began honking their horns in frustration.There was a big L on the rear of the bus, but I think when people see a bus in the city centre they assume the person driving actually knows how to drive a bus!It was a stressful  minutes and, when I finally pulled over, the instructor looked at his notes shaking his head. I cannot repeat what he said, but it was a generally negative assessment with lots of adjectives.Yet I wasnrsquot written off and was told I needed six full days of lessons as a minimum before sitting my test. Against everyonersquos expectations, including mine, I passed first time.I had done it and realised one of my lersquos dreams.There was a specic reason I needed a bus driving licence: I wanted to be a driver guide and take people around Scotland on tour. My le had undergone some dramatic changes and my le ambitions had changed as a result.It wasnrsquot, of course, about money or climbing a career ladder, but about the hopeful expectation it would make me rich in experiences and give me a new angle on le.My head and heart were full of Scotlandrsquos stories, and this seemed a perfect way to use my love of history and folklore, and share my passion for the landscape that held so many personal memories for me. I felt my le was about to be transformed and indeed it was.So that day I passed my bus driving test was a day of utter joy. Although over  years ago now, I can still feel the elation.I worked for dferent tour companies at dferent times in my le over the following  years. It was something I couldto whenever I needed it. During the last period of my time as a driver guide, a transport manager called Ronnie worked miracles as he juggled my rota to fit round my very complicated childcare arrangements. I will be forever grateful to him for his understanding.Were my expectations of the job realised or did I have an over-romanticised image of it  Irsquod say a bit of both. I tried my best to showcase Scotland, but I quickly understood people travel for dferent reasons with dferent interests.But it opened a window on the world for me. I met so many people from dferent walks of le and dferent countries and cultures. It taught me so much about the way humans behave towards each other and how we handle and respond to experiences in dfering ways.We were all on mini le journeys together, usually three days, sometimes five. In this brief fleck of time, a small group of people would be together amidst the splendour, and sometimes challenging conditions, of Scotland. When connections were made, it was because of shared values, regardless of cultural dferences.I began to see the tours as a metaphor for the way we live our lives, not just in observing others but myself as well. I had never thought the job would be a lesson on the philosophy of le, but that is partly what it became for me.It revealed to me that happiness, enjoyment and appreciation is a default within us, not something to be found, bought or acquired, or even weather dependent!That now seems so obvious but it took years for me to truly understand how we can become so easily trapped in the hedonic treadmill. I know thatrsquos a fancy term, but its meaning is simple: that as we go through le, we quickly take things for granted and so seek new and higher levels of satisfaction which we believe will give us happiness. While we can get a rush of pleasure and satisfaction in new things or experiences, we soon then take those for granted as well. So the cycle continues. We become like dogs chasing our tails in pursuit of what we think will make us happy or give us a more fulfilled le.The tours taught me that appreciation is the key to this. You donrsquot have to be a tour guide to learn this lesson, of course, as we all have our lersquos experiences that teach us. But that treadmill is so easy to fall into, even when you know it offers a  dawn. It can take a conscious effort to climb out of it.That is when we need what is called a hedonic reset: another fancy term for stopping that chase of our tail and taking time to appreciate what we have. This can be done by temporarily depriving ourselves of things we take for granted and so regaining our appreciation of them.A simple example could be when we go camping. I love it, but when I get home I appreciate my bed, my shower and central heating in ways I didnrsquot before we left on our camping trip!The virus has forced a reset on all of us it has taken away many things we took for granted: travel, staying with friends, family meals, a coffee and blether with a friend, hugging loved ones, being with loved ones, browsing in a bookshop. We will all have our list.It has been heartbreaking, with devastating consequences for so many peoplersquos livelihoods and emotional wellbeing, as well as a tragic loss of le.Itrsquos an unwanted, brutal and forced reset, but the le lesson I learnt on the tours has helped me understand that appreciation is the key to resilience and getting through this as best as we can.When times relax, as they hopefully will soon, I know how much I will appreciate hugging my daughter I havenrsquot been able to hug for  months, being able to tell stories to a live audience and have a coffee with a friend in a real cafe. And travel to the places I love within my own country.Perhapsthere is any positive out of this, I hope it will be that I will never again fall into that treadmill of taking things I have for granted.So I say Happy New Year to you, and I mean it in a heartfelt way I never meant before."},{"url":null,"title":"vet-column-consider-welcoming-new-pet","story":"ONCE your new puppy or kitten has settled into your household, there are several things to consider, ensuring your new pet is kept fit and healthy.Register with your veterinary surgeon. This gives immediate reassurancea problem does arise with your pet.At Dunedin Vets, we offer free puppy and kitten checks and for all new pets as soon as you acquire them this may be carried out by telephone during these Covid- times. Lots of advice is given by vets, qualied veterinary nurses and reception staff.Everyone is thinking about vaccination against coronavirus for humans just now. Vaccination has been the major controller of lethal diseases since the process was developed by Edward Jenner centuries ago.We must vaccinate our pets to prevent several fatal conditions. Pups can be vaccinated from six weeks of age. However, vaccinating at  and  weeks of age is the new normal during this Covid- pandemic, when most vaccinations are given.Pups should be kept isolated until two weeks after the first vaccination, then limited contact with other dogs until after the second vaccine. Boosters are given annually against parvovirus, distemper, hepatitis leptospirosis and kennel cough.It is advisable to vaccinate your kitten against cat flu, feline enteritis and feline leukaemia. Two vaccines are usually given three weeks apart from nine weeks of age. Kittens should be kept isolated until one week after the second vaccine. Boosters are given annually against cat flu, feline enteritis and feline leukaemia.Rabbits can be vaccinated against myxomatosis and rabbit haemorrhagic disease , of which there are two strains. One vaccine against the two agents can be given from six weeks of age. Boosters are given annually.Everyone loves a new puppy or kitten, but please be aware of unscrupulous dealers who take advantage of the kind and loving nature of the majority of people.Recently, Kimberly Mackie visited Dunedin Vetsrsquo Tranent surgery with her new puppy Poppy. Poppy is a Jack Russell cross Chihuahua, so is a very small pup. However, Poppy arrived with diarrhoea and very dehydrated, weighing only a few hundred grams.Poppy was examined by vet Chris Monk, who immediately saw how ill little Poppy was.Mum had bought her in all good faith from a family home. It was soon discovered that Poppy had been microchipped and had a vaccination in Eire. Poppy was an import from Eire, a victim of the illegal puppy farming trade.It is so dficult for new owners to know the origin of their pup, especially when the sellers can seem so plausible. Ask to see the parents or at least the mother and other pups in the litter, although they find many ways to circumvent these questions. It is also so dficult toa puppy or kitten once you have cuddled them and instantly fallen in love.The good news is that Poppy, after fluid therapy and medications, and lots of loving care from Dunedin Vets staff and, of course, his forever mum, has made a full recovery and is developing her own special character.We must also consider other preventable conditions which our pets may be susceptible to.Most puppies and kittens are born with a roundworm infestation. Worms are passed to them before birth by their mothers and through motherrsquos milk. This is obviously not very pleasant and potentially these worms pose a risk for humans, especially children.Tapeworms are rarely a problem in puppies and kittens, although one type is actually transmitted by fleas.We recommend worming puppies and kittens at eight,  and  weeks of age with a quality wormer in tablet or liquid form, which will kill most worms.Remember, there may be no obvious signs of worm infestation.Worming should be carried out every three months for the rest of your petrsquos le.Many puppies and kittens arrive at their new home with a population of external parasites. These include fleas and mites.Fleas are passed from one animal to another. Although there are dferent types of dog and cat fleas, they donrsquot mind what they jump onto to feed!Fleas are two to three millimetres long and move quickly through the coat. Flea droppings are black and gritty, and turn reddamp cotton wool is applied to them.Fleas can transmit several diseases, cause allergies and general irritation. Fleas live on your pet, and in the house.You must use a suitable insecticide spray to destroy flea larvae, which can survive for months in the environment. Your veterinary staff can advise what is best for your pet and your home.The rabbit flea is unusual in that it doesnrsquot move very fast. They are often found along the edge of catsrsquo ears and are dficult to remove, so are called lsquostick tightrsquo fleas. Cats pick them up when hunting wild rabbits.Walking dandruff mitesare very common in puppies, kittens and bunnies. They are too small to see but occasionally skin scurf appears to move, which is actually the mites, hence the name.Mange mitesare minute parasites which bury into the skin. Some are passed from mother to young and some spread from pet to pet. Some cause intense scratching, some cause hair loss. Some can be very dficult to treat, requiring specialised anti-parasitic washes or spot on treatment.Ear mites live in the ear canals, causing irritation, lots of wax production and a smell.At Dunedin Vets, we strongly recommend taking out insurance for your pet at a young age. Many breeders will provide initial insurance cover, and many vets will offer free insurance with certain companies for a few weeks. This gives peace of mind whilst you are considering which insurance to purchase. We suggest you look for a lsquolelong coverrsquo policy so your pet will always be covered.Consider a pet health club for your new arrival. Many veterinary practices, including Dunedin Vets, offer this type of scheme. Basically, you spread the cost of your petrsquos preventative healthcare over the year rather than being faced with large bills at booster time, so allowing you to budget monthly for this.Dunedin Vetsrsquo pet health club offers many other benefits and discounts. During these dficult times, many people are finding this a great way to ensure the best care for their pets without burdening themselves financially.Puppies, kittens and bunnies bring so much love to a family and help so much in your wellbeing ndash choose wisely, and look after them well, and you will have a friend and companion for le."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-peeps-past-december-29-31-1995-1970-1920","story":"lsquoPLEASE drink up... the pub is on firersquo was a headline in the East Lothian Courier on December , .Time was called early at the Auld Hoose pub in North Berwick last Wednesday after a fire broke out in the public bar.Customers spotted smoke coming from the floor near a fireplace about pm and the local fire brigade was alerted.The premises were evacuated ndash including an upstairs flat occupied by Jean Borthwick and her Labrador dog, Freeway ndash as landlord Ian McMinn tried to tackle the blaze with a fire extinguisher containing powder.But help was soon at hand in the shape of his brother Hugh, a local fireman, and the rest of the retained crew who began fighting the dense smoke and flames.Sub-officer McMinn explained that cracks in the old hearth at the pubrsquos real fire had caused joists and beams on the floor to burn.AN EAST Lothian pupil became the first from his high school to be accepted to study at the University of Cambridge, reported The Haddingtonshire Courier of December , .Ian Graham, son of Sergeant and Mrs Graham, Tranent, has been accepted for entry into Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in October .Ian is at present in his sixth year at the Ross High School.He was Dux of the School in his fth year and is at present Head Boy.He is a young man of high intellectual ability but at the same time he is an accomplished games player, playing in the School XV and also in the Badminton Club.He is an office-bearer in the Literary and Debating Society and last summer was a gold medallist in athletics at the Scottish Schools Athletics Championships.A MAN was fined pound after being caught stealing a bird from a train station, as reported in The Haddingtonshire Courier of December , .In the Burgh Court, on Friday, before Bailie Main, James Kelly, railway porter, Church Street, Haddington, pleaded guilty to having, on Tuesday, st, stolen a cockerel from a hamper lying in the booking-hall of the station.The Fiscal stated that, about eight orsquoclock on the night in question, a booking-clerk heard a person entering the booking-hall on tip-toe.On going out, he found Kelly alongside the hamper.He made the excuse that the label had been torn off the hamper, and that he was putting it on.The label was afterwards found lying on the floor, but it was discovered that the hamper had been opened and the cockerel removed."},{"url":null,"title":"7am-wait-worth-mum-bonnie-babies-champion-2020-harris-tait","story":"Harris Tait, who celebrated his first birthday on December , was announced as the winner in last weekrsquos Courier.He lives on East Lintonrsquos Longstone Avenue with mum Kirsty, , and dad Andrew, , a maintenance team leader at Torness Power Station.Kirsty described Harris as a ldquofunny and cheeky little boy with ldquosuch a little personality.She added: ldquoHe knows what he wants and is a determined little guy, which I think he takes from me and Andrew.Kirsty, who has been on maternity leave this year but is ing to work on Monday as a customer trade manager at Asda in Livingston, said Harrisrsquo win had been a boost to the family after what has been a tumultuous year.She said: ldquoItrsquos not really been the greatest year and hersquos not been able to interact with other kids and I thought, lsquoWhat have we got to lose rsquo so decided to enter him.ldquoYou never think that you are going to win competitions like these.When the results were announced in last weekrsquos Courier, Kirsty said she was ldquobuzzing and ldquoa bit emotional.

And it includes nursery schools, as well as primary and secondary schools.Ms Sturgeon said: \"I want to be clear that it remains our priority to get school buildings open again for all pupils as quickly as possible and then keep them open.\"However, right now, two factors mean that it is not consistent with a safety-first approach for all children to attend school in person.\"First, the overall level of community transmission is too high.

Given the greater transmissibility of this new iant, the Scottish Government willconsider it necessary to restrict that further.From tomorrow, a maximum of two people from up to two households will be able to meet outdoors.Children aged  and under will not be counted in that limit, and they will also be able to play outdoors in larger groups, including in organized gatherings.However, for everyone  ndash including  to -year-olds - outdoor exercise should only take place in a way which is consistent with the twopeople from twohouseholds rule.Anyone who is able to work from home must do so.It will only be a reasonable excuse to leave your home to go to workthat work cannot be done from home.The Scottish Government are asking people and businesses to take this \"really seriously\" because the situation is at least as serious now as it was then.The law already requires many businesses in certain sectors to close in Level .Every business is being asked to look again at their operations and to make sure that every singlethat can be done by people working at home, is being done in that way.If you were shielding and you cannot work from home, our clear advice now is that you should not go into work at all.Nicola Sturgeon confirmed that thetotal number of Covid- patients in hospital is close to its April peak.In terms of hospital beds, NHS Ayrshire and Arran is currently at % of its Covid- capacity, and three other health boards - Borders, GreaterGlasgow  Clyde and Lanarkshire - are above % of their capacity.The total number of patients in intensive care in Scotland is already above normal winter levels. Indeed, all mainland health boards have now exceeded their normal intensive care unit capacity.And it is important to be clear that people who are in hospital and ICU now are likely to have been infected  days to twoweeks ago.Other restrictions will also come into effect includingplaces of worship closing,no wakes, two-metre distancing in canteens and further premises closing.The fortnightly review will not simply be a choice between opening and closing schools - we will always seek to maximise the number of pupils we can safely get back to classrooms and nurseries.Grants areavailable for businesses required to close as a result of restrictions.

I will set out our decisions shortly.However, I can confirm now, in summary, that we decided to introduce from midnight tonight for the duration of January, a legal requirement to stay at home except for essential purposes. This is similar to the lockdown of March last year.However, before I set out Cabinetrsquos decisions in more detail, I want to explain in some detail why they are so necessary.In the last few weeks, there have been two signicant game changers in our fight against this virus.One, the approval of vaccines, is hugely positive and offers us the way out of this pandemic.But the other - the new faster spreading iant of the virus - is a massive blow.Possibly the most simple way of explaining the challenge we face right now is to compare it to a race.In one lane we have vaccines - our job is to make sure they can run as fast as possible.Thatrsquos why the government will be doing everything we can to vaccinate people as quickly as possible. I will say more about that later.But in the other lane is the virus which - as a result of this new iant - has just learned to run much faster and has most definitely picked up pace in the last couple of weeks.To ensure that the vaccine wins the race, it is essential to speed up vaccination as far as possible.But to give it the time it needs to get ahead, we must also slow the virus down.And because it is now spreading faster, that means even tougher restrictions are necessary.The evidence is now compelling that the new iant is up to % more transmissible than previously circulating strains, and that it may add as much as . to the R number.And according to recent analysis of PCR test samples, it appears that the new iant already accounts for almost half of all new cases in Scotland.That increased and faster spread is undoubtedly driving the very serious situation we now face.Todayrsquos case numbers ndash , new cases, with % of tests being positive - illustrate the severity and urgency of the situation.No new deaths were reported today ndash because yesterday was a Sunday and registration offices were largely closed ndash but since I updated Parliament before Christmas,  deaths have been recorded in the daily figures. That again reminds us of the continuing grief this pandemic is causing.But this is not just about one dayrsquos numbers.We are now seeing a steeply rising trend of infections.Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say that I am more concerned about the situation we face now than I have been at any time since March last year.In the week from  to  December, the seven day incidence of cases per , of the population increased by % - from  per , to  per ,.Test positivity has risen sharply too.The next update on the numbers of Covid patients in hospital and intensive care will be published tomorrow.I would expect these to show that, nationally, the total number of Covid patients in hospital is close to its April peak. And in some boards, the pressure is already very real.For example, in terms of hospital beds, NHS Ayrshire and Arran is currently at % of its Covid capacity, and three other health boards - Borders, Greater Glasgow  Clyde and Lanarkshire - are above % of their capacity.The number of people in intensive care is still signicantly lower than the April peak ndash which partly reflects the fact that treatment of Covid has improved signicantly since last spring.But even so, the total number of patients in intensive care in Scotland is already above normal winter levels. Indeed, all mainland health boards have now exceeded their normal intensive care unit capacity.And it is important to be clear that people who are in hospital and ICU now are likely to have been infected  days to  weeks ago.That means that these numbers reflect what the level of new cases was around  weeks ago.Given that the number of cases has increased signicantly since then, we can expect to see signicantly increased pressure on the NHS over the course of this month.Contingency plans remain in place to double and then treble ICU capacitynecessary.And the NHS Louisa Jordan continues to be available to help meet demand - as indeed it has been doing in recent months. , patients have attended there for scans and outpatient appointments nearly , NHS staff and students have been trained there and it is currently being used for Covid vaccinations.In short, NHS services are coping at present ndash although the pressure on frontline staff is considerable - but already in some areas the position is fragile, and getting more challenging.Andthe rate of increase in case numbers that we have seen in past two weeks was to continue unchecked, there would be a real risk of our NHS being overwhelmed - even with contingency plans in place.In fact, our modelling suggests that without further intervention, we could breach inpatient Covid capacity within  or  weeks.And, of course, a sharply increasing number of cases, in human terms, means many more people becoming ill and dying.All of that explains why we have to act quickly and decisively.The situation in some other parts of the UK - where case numbers are already much higher than here, and where the contribution of the new iant is already greater - shows what may lie aheadwe donrsquot.As things stand, we estimate that we are possibly about four weeks behind the position in London and the south east.The rapid acceleration in London began when it was at about  new cases a week, for every hundred thousand people. Thatrsquos the level Scotland was at a week ago.London is now seeing  new cases a week per ,. Test positivity is around %. And pressure on NHS services is acute.We have an opportunity in Scotland to avert the situation here deteriorating to that extent.But we must act quickly.The advice of our clinical advisers is clear that the increased transmissibility of the new iant means that the current level  measures may not be sufficient to bring the R number back below .It is essential that we further limit interaction between dferent households to stem the spread and bring the situation back under control, while we vaccinate more people.In short, we mustfor a period to a situation much closer to the lockdown of last March.Let me therefore set out in more detail the decisions Cabinet has reached.It is important to stress that these are not decisions taken lightly. I am acutely aware of the impact they will have and I know they will not be welcome.But they are in our judgment essential.As government, our clear and overriding duty right now is to act quickly to save lives and protect the NHS.We know that delay or preication in the face of this virus almost always makes things worse not better - evenit stems from an understandable desire that we all share to wait for more data or evidence.To turn to the decisions in detail. The decisions I will speak about a bit later on schools, let me be clear at this stage, they will apply to all parts of Scotland. However other decisions that I will outline will apply to those parts of Scotland currently at level , which of course is all of mainland Scotland, and they are effectively an enhancement to level .The island areas currently in level  will remain there for now, although we will continue to monitor them very carefully.These additional level  restrictions - essentially ing us to a position similar to the lockdown of last March - will be in place for the whole of January. We will keep them closely under review.However, I cannot at this stage rule out keeping them in place longer, nor making further changes. Nothing about this is easy.The first measure is that our fundamental advice, for everyone, is to stay at home.That is the single best way of staying safe.We consider that this stay at home message and advice is now so important that, from tomorrow, it will become law, just as it was in the lockdown last year.This means it will only be permissible to leave home for an essential purpose.This will include, for example, caring responsibilities, essential shopping, exercise and being part of an extended household.In addition, anyone who is able to work from home, must do so. It will only be a reasonable excuse to leave your home to go to work,that work cannot be done from home.We are asking people and businesses to take this really seriously ndash as we all did in March, during the first lockdown, - because the situation is at least as serious now as it was then.The law already requires many businesses in certain sectors to close in Level . We now need every business to look again at their operations, and to make sure that every singlethat can be done by people working at home, is being done in that way.Businesses have already shown a tremendous capacity to adapt during this pandemic and Irsquom very grateful to them for that - and we need them to consider their operations again, as we all work together to reduce transmissions.The Economy Secretary will be speaking to business organisations about this, including this afternoon. We will also engage with unions on these issues. And we will continue to considermore regulatory action is required.We are also providing new guidance for people who are in the shielding category.If you were shielding and you cannot work from home, our clear advice now is that you should not go into work at all.The Chief Medical Officer is writing to everyone who falls into this category, and his letter will count as a Fit Note for those who need it.Unlike the lockdown last year, the frequency of outdoor exercise is not being limited.It is important for physical and mental health that we can get outdoors for fresh air and exercise as much as possible.However, from tomorrow, the rule on outdoor gatherings will change.As of now, up to six people from two households are able to meet outdoors. Given the greater transmissibility of this new iant, we consider it necessary to restrict that further.From tomorrow, a maximum of two people from up to two households will be able to meet outdoors.Children aged  and under will not be counted in that limit, and they will also be able to play outdoors in larger groups, including in organized gatherings.However, for everyone  ndash including  to  year olds - outdoor exercise should only take place in a way which is consistent with the  people from  households rule.In addition, strict travel restrictions remain in place across Scotland. From tomorrow,you live in a level  area - as the majority of us do - you cannot leave your home except for an essential purpose. When you do go out, stay as close to home as possible and stay away from crowded places.And it remains the case ndash and let me stress this point - that no-one is allowed to travel into or out of Scotland unless it is for an essential purpose.Presiding OfficerA number of other measures will come into effect on Friday of this week.It is with real regret that we consider it necessary for places of worship to close during this period for all purposes except broadcasting a service, or conducting a funeral, wedding or civil partnership.I am well aware of how important communal worship is to people.But we believe that this restriction is necessary to reduce the risk of transmission.While up to  people will still be able to attend funeral services, wakes will not be possible during January. And a maximum of  people will be able to attend wedding and civil partnership services.Presiding OfficerI know how devastating restrictions like these are and I give an assurance that we will not keep them in place for longer than is absolutely necessary.There will also be additional measures in relation to businesses, in addition to the tightening of the essential retail definition that took effect from Boxing Day.The current  metre exemption for workplace canteens will end ndash so canteens will have to ensure that employees sit  metres or more apart, rather than  metre.The number of non-essential services which remain open will be further restricted.Premises which will need to close as a result of these changes will include, for example ski centres, showrooms of larger retailers, and clinics offering cosmetic and aesthetic procedures.I know that many businesses have already been hit by the restrictions which were put in place on Boxing Day.And of course I know that the vast majority of businesses have taken their responsibilities seriously, and have invested in Covid safety measures.In addition, the move to home working has brought challenges for workers and employers. I am hugely grateful for the way in which businesses and their staff have responded to those challenges.Grants are of course available for businesses required to close as a result of restrictions. That support is in addition to support through the UK wide furlough scheme.The Scottish Governmentrsquos financial support for businesses during the pandemic currently totals more than pound. billion.However, we will continue to assess what more the Scottish government can do ndash either in closure grants or other forms of support - to help businesses and those who work for them.We will also work with councils to ensure community and social support for those who need it, including for parents balancing work and online learning.We will confirm additional resources later this week.Presiding Officer,The final substantive issue I want to address - before giving an update on vaccination - relates to schools.We announced before Christmas that most school pupils would learn remotely ndash rather than in school ndash until Monday  January.I can confirm that we have now decided to extend that date and keep schools closed to the majority of pupils until  February. We will review this again in mid-January.The change will apply to all pupils - except vulnerable children, and children of key workers. And it includes nursery schools, as well as primary and secondary schools.There is no doubt that of all the dficult decisions we have had to take today, this was the most dficult of all and its impact is of course the most severe.The evidence to date makes clear that thanks to the hard work of school staff and pupils, schools in Scotland have been low-risk environments for Covid. We will work with our partners to ensure that remains the case.That will include ongoing work on testing in schools and discussions about when, in the context of the overall programme, it will be possible to vaccinate school staff.And I want to be clear that it remains our priority to get school buildings open again for all pupils as quickly as possible and then keep them open.However, right now, two factors mean that it is not consistent with a safety-first approach for all children to attend school in person.First, the overall level of community transmission is simply too high. We need to get transmission down before schools can safely reopen. A period of online learning will also, in turn, help us do that.The second reason is that there is still signicant uncertainty about the impact of the new iant on transmission amongst young people.We therefore have to adopt a cautious approach at this stage.So most pupils will be learning online for at least the rest of the month.We will review on  January whether they can - as we hope -to school on the  February.I know that remote learning presents signicant challenges for teachers, schools, parents and young people, and we will work to support children and parents throughout this.The Scottish Government, Education Scotland and local authorities are working together to further improve the remote learning options which are available for schools.And it is also worth highlighting that since schools ed after the summer, more than , devices ndash such as laptops ndash have been distributed to children and young people to help with remote learning. More devices are being distributed by councils on a weekly basis, and in total we expect our investment ndashwhich builds on existing local authority action - to benefit around , disadvantaged children and young people across Scotland.I also want to stress one final point.Just as the last places we ever want to close are schools and nurseries - so it is the case that schools and nurseries will be the first places we want to reopen as we re-emerge from this latest lockdown.They remain our priority.That is why we are considering whether and to what extent - consistent with our overall duty to vaccinate the most vulnerable first in line with JCVI recommendations - we can achieve vaccination of school and childcare staff as a priority. Many teachers will of course be vaccinated over coming weeks as part of the JCVI priority list.The fortnightly review will not simply be a choice between opening and closing schools - we will always seek to maximise the number of pupils we can safely get back to classrooms and nurseries.Sothe evidence tells us we can get some pupils back safely, we will do that.However ultimately, the best way of enabling more pupils tomore quickly is by reducing community transmission of the virus as much as possible.And all of us ndash by accepting and abiding by the wider restrictions I have set out today - have a part to play in achieving that.Before I leave the issue of education, let me remind the chamber that we already had plans in place for the staggeredof universities and colleges. We will be considering this week whether any further change is necessary.Presiding OfficerBefore I close today, I want to give a brief update on our current expectations around vaccine supply.The Health Secretary will give a more detailed update on vaccination in a statement the chamber next week.However, I can confirm today that well over , people have now received their first dose of the vaccine.The first doses of the Astra Zeneca vaccine are being administered today.In total, over the period to the end of January - including the more than , already administered - we expect to have access to just over , doses of vaccine. Obviously, we hope that increases.These will be split roughly equally between the Pfizer and Astra Zeneca vaccines.However, we anticipate that some of the Astra Zeneca portion will be available only in the last week of January.We do not yet have certainty on supply schedules beyond January but will keep Parliament updated as these become firmer.However, our current expectation, based on assumptions about supply and the new advice on doses being administered up to  weeks apart, rather than , is that by early May everyone over , and people under  with specic underlying conditions, will have received at least the first dose of vaccine.That is everyone who is on the JCVI priority list, and comprises more than . million people.Once everyone on the priority list has been vaccinated, we will start vaccinating the rest of the population, and will do this in parallel with completing second doses for those on the priority list.Those timetables are of course heavily dependent on vaccine supply. And for that reason, they are at this stage cautious.However, I have tasked our vaccination team with exploring and keeping under ongoing review all options to speed up the rate of vaccination and bring these timescales forward as far as possible.I am grateful for the many offers of assistance we have received and while many of them may not prove possible or practical to take up, they will be consideredThe Health Secretary will say more about all of this in her statement next week.Presiding OfficerTo conclude, this is most certainly not the new year statement I wanted to give.And I know it is a statement no one wanted to hear.But as I said at the beginning, we are now in a race between the vaccine and the virus.The Scottish government will do everything we can to speed up distribution of the vaccine.But all of us must do everything we can to slow down the spread of the virus.We can already see ndash by looking at infection rates where ndash some of what could happen here in Scotlandwe donrsquot act.To prevent that, we need to act immediately and firmly.For government, that means introducing tough measures ndash as we have done so today.And for all of us, it means sticking to the rulesIt means continuing to follow the FACTS guidanceAnd it means ndash above all ndash staying at home.That is again our central message.Stay Home. Save lives. Protect the NHS.If we do this, we give the vaccine the time it needs to get ahead and ultimately win the race.I know that the next few weeks will be incredibly dficult.Irsquom sorry to ask for further sacrices, after nine long months of them. But these sacrices are necessary.And the dference between now and last March is that with the help of vaccines, we now have confidence that these sacrices will pave the way to brighter days ahead.So ndash for everyonersquos sake and safety - please stick with it and stay at home."},{"url":null,"title":"new-lockdown-rules-scotland-covid-restrictions-explained","story":"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the new rules on Monday afternoon, asthe latest restrictions came into effect from midnight today in all Level  areas of the country andwill continue throughout the month.Speaking at Holyrood, Ms Sturgeon said: \"I can confirm now, in summary, that we decided to introduce from tomorrow, for the duration of January, a legal requirement to stay at home except for essential purposes.

The electors are counted with the results read aloud with the Vice-President presiding over the session and declaring both the winner of the presidency and the vice-presidency.In theory, the meeting is the final step in reaffirming Bidenrsquos victory - however, it is required by Federal Law and is the final way of ldquocertying the election results.Does the Constitution require the Congress meeting Yes, the Constitution requires Congress to meet and count the electoral college votes in order to establish who will be the president and vice president.Usually, this event is a box-ticking exercise, however, more scrutiny and interest has been placed on the meeting due to the legal challenges from the Trump campaign.Donald Trump has spent the last  years at the White House. :Why January th is a key date in the US election - a look at the next stepsWhat time is the session The session begins at  p.m. EST, which is pm in the UK.What happensthere is no clear winner In the event that no one can be named as the next President and VP, the House decides the presidency, with each congressional delegation having one vote. While this is unlikelythere are a number of legal challenges from Donald Trump and some members may raise objections.Can members object and how are objections raised Yes. Importantly however, this joint session is the last official chance for objections, aside from court cases that have been raised by President Trump and his legal team.Congress members can object to the votes of inidual electors and make the final call on the winners of any states that are unable to resolve their disputes. After a tally from a state is read any member can stand up and object to that states vote on any grounds. However, this will not be heard unless in writing and signed by a member of both houses. If there is such a request that meets the criteria, both the House and Senate will debate the validity of the objection andthey both do not agree, the original declaration is passed. If enough legal challenges are not resolved then the states could be voted for by the houses.This means that the Democrat-controlled House and Republican-controlled Senate could potentially split on which votes to accept. However, this would require a number of states to be exceptionally close and a number of legal challenges to be passed.In the event that this occurs and it is a tie in the electoral college votes, Vice President Pence who oversees the count could have a casting vote in declaring the winner. This is unlikely however as Joe Bidens electoral win over Trump was a rather healthy -.US Vice President Mike Pence Are members expected to object The decision to object has caused a rt in the Republican Party.

For the safety of one teacher the education of - children is cancelled. Teachers and school staff should all be prioritised for inoculation at the earliest opportunity. During the month-long closure all school staff can have two doses of the vaccine. Not to do this is illogical and causes greatest harm to the largest number.The dficulties in the health service are manest in the number of staff self-isolating or ill and thus unavailable for work. Those staff are also terried of catching the disease and exporting it home. The general NHS has been effectively destroyed and elective care abandoned, and it may never recover. It is scandalous healthcare staff are not also inoculated now to protect them while caring for the sick.Test and trace is only effective for contained local outbreaks of a disease. When that disease is widespread it is pointless. Someone clear one day can be infected the next day. If the structures for test and trace are available, and school children, teachers and NHS staff are contained in place, surely testing should be abandoned and inoculation substituted The Scottish Government and Ms Sturgeon are trapped in a failure whirlpool of their own making and the nation is being harmed permanently by blind adherence to failing policies, tardiness, dishonesty and lack of contrition. Propaganda is no substitute. Can anyone rise to the challenge and make the changes required Gavin R Tait, East Kilbride.JOHNSON WAS BETTER THAN STURGEONAND so the predicted lockdown measures have been enforced ndash the two leaders, the Prime Minister and the First Minister, now paying the price for their rash and foolish decisions in November of allowing us a Christmas holiday period ndash despite advice and suggestions by the health experts, advisors, the National Health Service representatives, to desist from such a policy as did many of your contributors. But as we know, at that time popularity was the name of the game ndash from one man whose desperation and very existence is to be liked and popular and from one woman whose desperation and very existence is to be listened to and to be hailed as \"one of the people\".Yesterdayboth leaders spoke, and for the very first time, in my opinion the Prime Minister spoke and behaved and delivered in a much superior manner to the First Minister the former articulated seriouslyand as a statesman told what had to be done, for a total of eight minutes the latter, as usual, rambled on seriously , explaining what had to be done and, of course, sympathising with us all, for what appeared to be an eternity.I know the situation cannot be taken lightly, but this sort of repetitive approach, taken every time by the First Minister when she speaks, makes her watchers and listeners turn off the TV or radio, despite what she and her ardent followers may think.Walter Paul, Glasgow G.NOT JUST MS FOOD...THE new coronavirus lockdown was a shock-down for some people. And no doubt there are those who will ignore it, even flout it. But most Scots recognise the need to take drastic action to prevent even more deaths and stop the NHS being completely overwhelmed.So, the big surprise for me was walking into Marks  Spencer in Glasgows Argyll Street on Tuesdayfor milk and bread, and discovering I could also buy jeans, a jacket, shoes, any item of clothing I wanted.There has been during this pandemic many cases of one rule for the politicians, their families and advisers, and another for the public. Is there also one rule for the big stores and another for the little business-owner If MS is allowed to sell more than just \"essential\" items, whats stopping someone who primarily sells clothes putting in a couple of tables and shelves stacked with baked beans, cereal boxes, and chocolate biscuits  Could they claim exemption too Andy Stenton, Glasgow G.HELP FAMILIES WITHout BROADBANDTHERE is a basic problem experienced by families on low income who are advised to have their children educated by remote learning. Not everyone living in near poverty can afford internet access and most providers now insist on the phone line being included in the service. Many people on benefits rely on the BT basic service for economical phone provision and are understandably unwilling to switch. Unless the authorities do something about this situation, many will continue to lose out and these are the most vulnerable and those most in need of assistance which is up to now being ignored.James Evans, Dumbarton.NO QUEUE FOR EU MEMBERSHIPTHE film Groundhog Day sees a weatherman, played by Bill Murray, reliving the same dayover and over again. I experienced the same feelings as Bill Murrayrsquos character reading Ronald J Sandfordrsquos letterwhich reheats several of the  scare stories.First of all, when Juan Manuel Barroso gave his opinion it concerned the possibility of Scotland, then part of the EU within the UK, remaining an EU member even on independence. That possibility has of course been rendered totally irrelevant by Brexit, and unless someone wants to argue that an independent Scotland would simply be unacceptable to the EU, then the issue is done with.On independence, therefore, we will not be members of the EU for a period that might be longer or shorter, depending on the above considerations. However, this makes even more attractive the suggestion by Dr Tim Rideout, an influential member of the Scottish Currency Group, that on independence, Scotland could seek membership of EFTA , committing to the European Economic Area, which would give us access to the single market, freedom of movement and more. Subsequently, a referendum could be held on whether to apply to join the EU, depending on the outcome of negotiations, butthe terms were unsuitable, we could stay in EFTA.Lastly, Mr Sandford, Spain has consistently taken the view that as long as Scottish independence is achieved by constitutional means they will have nothing to say. Alfonso Dastis, Foreign Minister to Mariano Rajoy, has said ldquo [Scottish independence] happens legally and constitutionally, we would not block [EU membership]. His successor in the Sanchez government, Josep Borrell, has said ldquoWhy not  If they leave Britain in accordance with their internal regulation,Westminster agrees ...,These scares ldquoare old. Old. Theyrsquore getting old .Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.PM COULD DO ANOTHER U-TURNBORIS Johnson has decreed that Scotland wont get another independence referendum until  , although under the Brexit agreement Northern Ireland is entitled to hold a referendum every seven years.However, as Mr Johnson is infamous for chopping and changing his mind, for example telling children in England at am that they could go to school, and at pm telling them they couldnt go back, I look forward to Mr Johnson doing another U-turn and agreeing that Scotlands future should be a matter for the people of Scotland to decide, and that a referendum would be a \"particularly jolly event\".Ruth Marr, Stirling.Read more: Letters: No question that this a hard Brexit for Scotland to endure"},{"url":null,"title":"youtube-removes-talkradios-channel-platform","story":"The Google-owned site had initially suspended the radio stationrsquos channel for what it said was a breach of its community guidelines, with reports suggesting it may have been linked to rules around Covid- misinformation.However, later on Tuesday YouTube said: ldquoTalkRadiorsquos YouTube channel was briefly suspended, but upon further review, has now been reinstated.A spokesperson added: ldquoWe quickly remove flagged content that violate our community guidelines, including Covid- content that explicitly contradicts expert consensus from local health authorities or the World Health Organisation.ldquoWe make exceptions for material posted with an educational, documentary, scientic or artistic purpose, as was deemed in this case.YouTube operates a three-strike system, wherea channel receives three strikes for posting content which is found to breach the sitersquos rules within a -day period, a channel is permanently removed.The video  has not confirmedtalkRadio had any strikes against its channel before Tuesdayrsquos incident.Earlier on Tuesday, talkRadio said it had not been notied why its account had been removed from YouTube, adding in a later statement that it felt the video  was ldquomaking decisions about which opinions the public are allowed to hear, something it said ldquosets a dangerous precedent and is censorship of free speech and legitimate national debate.Later the News UK-owned radio station said it was ldquopleased to receive the statement from YouTube.Internet s and wider social media sites have been under increased pressure during the pandemic to better combat the spread of misinformation, particularly  claims and conspiracy theories around the virus itself and the vaccines developed in response to it.In response to this, YouTube has previously taken action against other users for rule breaches linked to coronavirus misinformation ndash including conspiracy theorist David Icke ndash removing his channel last year for making  claims about the virus."},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  January is dark and dreary  It  39 s not the time to try to change your life","story":"The first thing the dentist will notice is a tender patch behind my incisors.

The wording of it is that lsquothe roads authority shall take such steps as they consider reasonable to prevent snow and ice endangering pedestrians and vehicles over public roadsrsquo.ldquoThe thing to take from that is that it doesnrsquot say they must do X, Y and Z, itrsquos that they shall take such steps THEY consider reasonable.ldquoUltimatelythe local authority think what theyrsquove done is reasonable then thatrsquos all they have to do in terms of the Act.ldquoThe lawrsquos evolved to interpret that to mean that they have to do whatrsquos reasonable in the circumstances, and so what they really have to do is have a winter maintenance policy.ldquoThat usually starts with A-roads and then works through priority lists, which is why most peoplersquos streets never get gritted because they never get down that far on the list.Mr Calderwood explained that legally, it is accepted that councils have finite resources and so have to prioritise the roads most used or at risk. This can include routes close to schools or fire stations, as well as A-roads.However, once this policy is in place, councils must stick to it or they may be liable for legal action.ldquoThe main route to take a case against the local authorityyou slip on ice or your car skids off the road because of ice is to see whether theyrsquove actually followed their own policy, he said.ldquoSotheir policy is that they grit A-roadsit hits -C, or something like that, then you can check records and see whether they actually carried out their policy that day. If they didnrsquot carry out their own policy then they are negligent and are liable for any losses that resulted from that.ldquoIn short, they get to decide what they do, but they have to stick to it. They canrsquot change their policy that night because there arenrsquot enough gritters available.Mr Calderwood explained that Thompsons wins several cases each year where councils have failed to follow their winter maintenance policy, often resulting in le-changing consequences for their clients and large payouts from the public bodies.ldquoIt always baffles me as a lawyer as to why councils donrsquot put the proper resources in place, he said.ldquoIt costs them a lot of money to pay claims out and I would far rather see them put the money in place to stop the accidents happening in the first place.The solicitor added that premises occupied by iniduals or businesses need to be maintained and cleared by the occupier. So a supermarket would have to ensure its car park is gritted, while iniduals are responsible for their own driveways and paths."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-universal-credit-claimants-near-500-000-help-requests-soar","story":"Citizens Advice Scotland has pointed to an  per cent increase in people in Scotland now claiming Universal Credit since the start of the pandemic in March  as the scale of the Covid- crisis is made clear.The pound uplt to Universal Credit payments was introduced by the UK Government in April  in response to the first Covid- lockdown which left thousands relying on the benefit.But it is due to expire in March ndash with no indication from Westminster as to whether it will be extended or made permanent, despite speculation Chancellor Rishi Sunak could do so at Marchrsquos Budget.Writing in The Herald, Debbie Horne, senior policy officer at Citizens Advice Scotland, has highlighted that her organisation has provided a staggering , pieces of advice to people on Universal Credit so far during the pandemic - stressing that is ldquomore than double the advice given on Universal Credit in the financial year ending March .She added: ldquoFor all the uncertainty that exists right now, one thing the Citizens Advice network can be sure of is that Universal Credit will continue to be one of our biggest areas of advice over the course of .ldquoMajor decisions on the future of Universal Credit payments will be made in a few short months.

Meanwhile, our business has been reduced by approximately  per cent.#This has hit us very hard, particularly since we are not in receipt of the government subsidy that other transport operators enjoy.”Services on the St Margaret’s Hope to Gills Bay route will be suspended for a week from Sunday, February , when MV Alfred will go into dry dock. The service will resume on Sunday,  February .“We regret the suspension of service and apologise to our customers for any inconvenience caused,# Mr Banks said.#The MV Alfred must go into drydock for annual surveys. We had planned to cover the MV Alfred’s absence with the MV Pentalina, but we have managed to negotiate a slight reduction in harbour fees for the MV Pentalina’s current berthing at Hatston Pier, which is subject to our not using the ship for business purposes for a three-month period.#The harbour fees for the MV Pentalina have had a signicant impact on our business throughout the pandemic and we simply cannot afford to lose the relief, which has been very dficult to obtain.”In another cost-saving exercise, the Gills Bay office will be closed with effect from January , for one month, after which it will be reviewed.Mr Banks added: “The purpose of this is to reduce costs and minimise staff exposure to the virus, during what is a particularly quiet period.#During this time, all calls will be directed to our St Margaret’s Hope office customer services team, so there will be no impact on passenger service. We regret that there will be no indoor waiting or toilet facilities at Gills Bay during the closure.“We are hopeful that by making these short-term business alterations now, we can safeguard the business through the coming months, and be ready to welcome passengers back on board safely, when conditions allow.“We would like to thank everyone for their support during this incredibly dficult time and very much look forward to welcoming you back to our service during the better months to come.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

His stake in GB News will be in a personal capacity, the company added.The businessman is also co-founder and chairman of ARK Schools, a multi-academy trust of  schools, and funded political website UnHerd.Mr Neil, who will also host a prime-time programme on GB News, said he was hugely encouraged by the confidence investors had shown in the business.He added: ldquoWersquore thrilled to have such a broad range of high-calibre investors who share our belief that many British people are crying out for a news service that is more erse and more representative of their values and concerns.ldquoGB News is a massive undertaking in a fiercely competitive market but wersquore confident therersquos an appetite for a fresh approach to news in Britain, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.Chief executive officer Angelos Frangopoulos said GB News was an opportunity to add plurality to the UK media sector that is not so London-centric.He said: ldquoThis is a signicant investment in British journalism at a time when itrsquos needed most.Discovery Inc, the US-based network which has a documentary partnership with the BBC in the UK, was the first major investor with reports of it investing around pound million.The full amount raised was not revealed but is understood to be in the region of pound million.The channel says it expects to reach % of British television households via Freeview, Sky, Virgin Media, YouView and Freesat.

I get a flu jab every year and I get it at my local pharmacy, itrsquos not complicated.Earlier, vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said % of deaths could be stopped by vaccinating the top nine priority groups laid down by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation .When asked how long it would take to give jabs to those groups, Mr Zahawi said: ldquoIrsquom very hopeful that by the spring we will get through the nine categories.On Tuesday evening, Prime Minister Boris Johnson suggested that regulatory approval of batches of the new Oxford vaccine was a bottleneck stopping more jabs being released to hospitals and GP surgeries.He said a ldquorate-limiting factor was the approval process and this would now be ldquoratcheted up.The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agencysaid it was working quickly while not compromising safety.An MHRA spokesman said: ldquoWe are working closely with the manufacturer, AstraZeneca, to ensure that batches of the vaccine are released as quickly as possible.ldquoBiological medicines such as vaccines are very complex in nature and independent testing, as done by the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, is vital to ensure quality and safety.ldquoNIBSC has scaled up its capacity to ensure that multiple batches can be tested simultaneously, and that this can be done as quickly as possible, without compromising quality and safety.At the same time as the NIBSC tests batches, vaccine manufacturers conduct their own quality tests.Manufacturers then send evidence to the NIBSC in the form of a document called a batch-specic lot release protocol.Meanwhile, the Government has denied reports that a shortage of glass vials for the vaccine is causing any delays.A spokeswoman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: ldquoThere is no shortage of vials for the UK. We have been monitoring the requirements across the supply chain from supplier through to patient for some time.ldquoThere are clear supply chain plans in place for both the supply and onward deployment of all vaccine candidates.ldquoThis includes materials, manufacturing, transport, storage and distribution.AstraZeneca and Pfizer have also both reportedly dismissed suggestions they cannot supply the vaccine fast enough.Oxford Biomedica, the main manufacturer of the ldquoraw vaccine in the UK for the Oxford AstraZeneca jab, has said it is running at full production.copy -.

They phoned me back an hour later and said they had seen something.”Joanne, who is a keen sportswoman and coaches netball, continued: “I didnt feel that sick at the time so I continued to play sports and netball. I played a match the following week but I still had the cough and when I came home from the match I began to cough up blood.“Although I contacted Dalriada on call I still didnt feel that sick so I went to bed but when I got up the next day it was worse so I went to AE.“I was admitted to hospital because my lung collapsed and I couldnt breath. I was told I had a carcinoid tumour which is very rare on my left lung and attached to my windpipe.”Throughout lockdown Joanne regularly attended the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast for treatment.She said: “I started my chemo and laser surgery and I seemed to spend the whole of lockdown between the Royal and my bed.“In November the consultant told me they had lasered enough of the windpipe to do me over Christmas as they had to free up the hospital due to Covid.“I need an operation to remove a quarter of my windpipe and my left lung with everything being bypassed and directed into my right lung. Once I get the operation the tumour should hopefully be taken all away.”Unfortunately Joanne received news that her operation has been delayed.She said: “I was built up for the operation both physically and mentally. After I was told I went into a depression because they said it would be four months.“I have two or three good days but then the rest are bad and at times I am so ill I have to stay in bed. One minute you are doing  miles an hour and then everything just stops.“But I am very lucky to have the support of my daughters and husband as I know the situation is very hard on them too.”Joanne decided to focus on trying to give something back Action Cancer NI and with the help of her father in law, Raymond Lennox, has been creating bespoke wooden planters, bird feeders, Christmas tress and Christmas plaques.The items are being sold at Blossom and Birch, Broughshane Street in Ballymena, which has hosted a number of events in aid of charity, one of which included a gallery night featuring art work by David McAneaney who also works at the florists.Joanne commented: “Between Raymond and myself we have been making a range of items and there has been a big demand for them. It has been good for us both as it has kept us busy and focused. “It is something to keep your mind off things and it keeps us going.”Despite the impending lockdown Joanne and Raymond hope to continue their fundraising efforts and anyone who is interested in purchasing an item can contact Joanne via her facebook page.

There is certainly nothing going on therethat instils confidence in me going forwards.Whether or not our Education Minister is solely responsible, I can#t say - but I do think he is out of touch with what is going on on the ground.I think he is out of his depth and I think it is time that either another party or another Education Minister had a go because it is myself and colleagues like me who are having to manage his indecision.Terry McMaster, principal of Drumahoe Primary said throughout the pandemic planning process, schools had not be listened to, nor had concerns been addressed in a timely manner.One such instance was the th hour announcement that the transfer test scheduled for this weekend would not go ahead. Yesterday it was decided they would not.I think all along, it should have been the Department of Education that said to the two private companies who run the transfer test, #You are not using the schools, we have closed the schools because it goes against the advice of the chief medical officer and the chief scientic officer#.I think that schools have not really been listened to which is a pity because they know the needs of the children best and the needs of the parent but they have not been consulted enough in the process.The Department of Education said it has worked throughout the pandemic to maintain the education of children, to reduce the risk of outbreaks and to respond when these occur.As a result of the current public health situation, all primary and secondary schools will provide remote education. The situation will be kept under ongoing review dependent on public health advice, a spokesperson said.The Minister stressed that these decisions were not made lightly as he is aware of the negative impact on children#s learning and mental health and well-being of not being in school. On the late postponement of the transfer test, the spokesperson said Mr Weir has previously written to selective schools to advise them to ensure that contingency admissions criteria are in place in the event that entrance tests cannot be operated.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Stay at home message legally enforceable on Friday Former Real IRA leader Michael McKevitt#s funeral takes place in LouthSouth East Antrim UDA issue threat against First Minister Arlene FosterSammy Wilson defends Portrush visit after day trippers head to the coast despite lockdownNorthern Ireland transfer tests cancelled and schools #closed to mid-term#Latest EducationCoronavirus Northern Ireland: GCSE and A-Levels cancelledViewpointOpinionNorthern Ireland pupils failed by last minute Stormont decisionsNew lockdown for Northern Ireland... it’s back to square one as police get powers to curb travel and GCSEs and A-levels may be axedMark BainOpinionEducation Minister Peter Weir gave transfer test every chance... now calls will only grow to ditch it Latest from Belfast Click and collect ban will further setback retailers, says industry bodyHow does the Moderna Covid- vaccine work Sudan set to normalise ties with Israel after signing US dealft whale washes up dead on Norfolk coastFamily of George Nkencho awaiting meeting with Garda watchdog,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Liam McBurney PA WirePA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueFirst Minister Arlene Foster. Liam McBurney PA WireAndrew Madden and Eimear McGovernJanuary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailAn order for people in Northern Ireland to stay at home will become legally enforceable on Friday, it has been confirmed. The advice is to be put into legislation from midnight on Thursday, with additional powers being given to the PSNI to enforce the measures.The move was agreed by the Executive after it met on Tuesday, along with the tightening of other measures.Amongst the additional restrictions agreed are:Private garden gatherings - maximum of six people from one household or support bubble only, with children under  counting towards the permitted total.Gatherings reduced to maximum of six people from two households. Children under  are now counted towards the permitted total.Outdoor exercise permitted with one person from another household - to allow, for example, those living alone to go for a walk with a friend.People will only be allowed to leave home for medical needs, to buy food or to exercise. Those who cannot work from home will also be allowed leave. It was agreed the measures will last until February  with a review expected on January .Schools in Northern Ireland are also set to undertake remote learning until the mid-term break, it was also confirmed.First Minister Arlene Foster said discussions on exams are ongoing with Education Secretary Gavin Williamson, with a decision to be made by Thursday.Mrs Foster said the rising coronavirus cases and hospital admissions were causing grave concern.She added: We confirm that all educational establishments will move to remote learning until the half-term break in the middle of February.It will be reviewed up the end of January. But we want to give those educational establishments the vision ahead into February. So, that is what is happening.That applies to primary schools, post primary schools and indeed to nursery schools as well.Childcare, however, will continue, eventhat is in an educational setting. Childminders will be able to operate as well.Mrs Foster denied the Executive had failed to agree on a way forward for exams.She said: Our educational grading and our GCSEs and A-levels are very integrated into the wider UK system.There#s ongoing discussions with Gavin Williamson, secretary state for education in Westminster, actually the Executive have mandated our education minister to get clarity for these issues.By the end of the executive on Thursday, we will have complete clarity in relation to GCSEs and A-levels.Deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill said the decision to close schools was a reflection on how serious the situation is with the pandemic.She said an Executive meeting could be held on Wednesday to discuss the issue in relation to exams and called on the Education Minister to bring forward proposals.Childcare and special education schools are to remain open, the Deputy First Minister said.Speaking after the Executive meeting, Ms O#Neill said: The message will be stay at home.This will provide additional powers to the PSNI, for example to be able topeople to their homes when they actually come out for reasons that are not allowed under the reasons that you can actually leave your home.There are also additional restrictions to household mixing. So, in private homes and gardens, both indoor and outdoor gatherings will be restricted to members of one household, or a member of your support bubble.There are obviously some exemptions that are for people who live in homes so those things will carry on.Outdoor and indoor gatherings will be restricted. The current position is that  people can meet outside that will be reduced to six people. Again, that#s a necessary intervention at this time.There is still little clarity on transfer tests for entry into grammar schools, which were initially cancelled only for the Association for Quality Education to announce they will hold a single exam in February.On Tuesday, it was confirmed a further  people in Northern Ireland had died after testing positive for Covid-. , new cases of the virus have been reported. It brings the death toll to , and the total number of confirmed cases since the outbreak to ,.

My dependency on it was getting worse,that was possible.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClosePatricia Quinn and Jonny Dobson confirm their marriage FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":truePatricia Quinn and Jonny Dobson confirm their marriage Things finally began to turn around when, as Jonny puts it, he grew a conscience.I was stealing from people and I really didn#t want to be that sort of person so I stopped doing it, he said.I also wanted to quit drugs because of how they were making me feel. Gradually, I managed to wean myself off them.Alcohol, however, was a tougher nut to crack.I#d been trying to quit since I turned , he said.I was bingeing, getting sober for two weeks, then bingeing again... the vicious cycle just went on and on.To complicate matters, Jonny started self-harming.He began by scraping himself, but that soon morphed into something more sinister.I#d been using broken bottles and ended up cutting a vein open in my leg, said Jonny who, by March  - just before he met Tricia - had pretty much given up on le.I#d cut my wrist, severing my median nerve. I was really on a downward spiral and couldn#t see a way out of it, he said.By then, he had been sleeping rough outside an off licence on the Ormeau Road.Someone who works with homeless people finally intervened, taking him to the Stella Maris hostel, where his le would, not immediately but ultimately, turn around.Having met and fell in love with Tricia there, the pair left Stella Maris together in June, moved to a property in Co Down.But although there was emotional salvation, neither party could defeat the demon drink and within a year both of them were back living in the hostel.We had really tried to make an effort but it fell apart, said Jonny.We were also on the streets for a while. Tricia broke her ankle and I had to stay sober because she was in a wheelchair.The onset of the Covid- pandemic coincided with Tricia going into rehab - for a third, and what she is adamant will be the last, time in her troubled le.After Tricia took that big step, Housing First [a service provided by DePaul Charity] found us temporary accommodation in north Belfast because we were both sober at that stage, he said.They spent a year there until their landlord sold the property and they ended up sleeping in a tent in dferent campsites, before then finding another bricks-and-mortar home but it was on the third floor which was a concern for Tricia, who has epilepsy.Through sheer, collective determination, however, they were able to save some money and acquire a one-bedroom apartment last August - their marital, dry home.I haven#t had a drink in eight months and Tricia hasn#t touched it for nine and half, said Jonny.That might not sound like much but that#s massive for us. Previously, I#d never stopped for more than six weeks in my entire le.Jonny is now halfway through an Open University course in planetary science and astronomy and, while he spends the day studying, his new we devotes her time to attending AA meetings and helping others who want to quit.I#m from an alcoholic family, said Tricia, who spent six years on the streets.I was in a children#s home from the age of . I left at , had four kids by the time I was .I didn#t actually drink back then I only started when I was .Unlike her husband, Tricia has never taken drugs but didn#t have any friends.I had some traumatic experiences when I was in my twenties, she admitted.I#d been having problems sleeping until I tried red wine. I didn#t actually like the taste of it but it helped me get over.Tricia told of how she tried to get sober back then but, after a spell in rehab got wine to celebrate coming out.She said she lost virtually everything. Friendless and aged , she ended up on the streets.Drink cost me so much, she said.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClosePatricia Quinn and Jonny Dobson FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":truePatricia Quinn and Jonny Dobson She is still in touch with some, but not all, of her children.Tricia was in and out of Stella Maris for years, trying, and failing, to turn her le around.I was institutionalised, I didn#t know how to be on my own or live on my own, she said.I was drinking straight vodka, and most of my le was a blackout.Some memories she does retain, however, still haunt her every waking moment.I remember sleeping outside McDonald#s with a girl called Catherine Kenny, but she#s dead now. She died on the streets. Catherine called an ambulance for me once, after I#d had a serious epileptic fit.I ended up on a le support machine. When I woke up in the Ulster Hospital I didn#t know where I was or how I#d got there... but all I could think about was drink. I signed myself out of hospital and went straight to the off licence. Then I went back to Stella Maris...Another more pleasant memory: meeting Jonny - although she spent that first night in jail.I thought he was gorgeous, she recalled.I was sitting beside him while he was watching a film, and I got arrested! I#d been arguing with a girl - a friend, actually - and ended up in the cells overnight.When I got out of the police station the next day, I went looking for Jonny.He told me he slept rough on the Ormeau Road so I went up there and found him. That#s where it started.Tricia puts her sobriety purely down to rehab - specically a spell in Cuan Mhuire, Newry, that began at the start of the first Covid- lockdown.I desperately wanted to get sober, she said.Jonny had a small relapse when I was in there. He phoned me drunk. I told him he had to get sober for both our sakes, and he did.After signing up to AA and finding a sponsor, Tricia now attends two virtual meetings a day.She is also helping other alcoholics by giving talks about my journey.She added: If you told me this time last year I#d be sober nine and a half months and married - there#s no way I would#ve believed it.The couple tied the knot at City Hall on December .It was just me and him. My brother was the only guest. It was perfect, said Tricia.The boss of Housing First got us a car, made me a posy and baked me a cake.Tricia - who has one granddaughter aged seven, and two grandsons, aged eight months and five months - said  has easily been the best year of her le.They hope to honeymoon in Poland, when the lockdown restrictions permit.Getting married is the third best thing I#ve ever done, she said.The first was getting sober. The second was getting myself a sponsor in AA and doing the steps, and the third was getting married. I couldn#t have done the third one without the first two.She added: It was so hard to get sober but I think the hardest part is staying there.Christmas was very dferent for Tricia who said last year she was in blackout.Jonny was sober but I was wandering the streets before we went to my dad#s for Christmas dinner, she recalled.This year, Mr and Mrs Dobson had Christmas dinner at Tricia#s dad - only this time they both remember it.The worst part of living on the streets was not knowing who might end up dead beside you the next morning, said Tricia.Jonny added: For me, it was not having access to any facilities. You#re just constantly dirty and broke and you have no options.He added: It#s the first time we can say we#re happy. We#ve got money in the bank, we#ve got options, a bit of security it#s a whole dferent le.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Stay at home message legally enforceable on Friday Former Real IRA leader Michael McKevitt#s funeral takes place in LouthSouth East Antrim UDA issue threat against First Minister Arlene FosterSammy Wilson defends Portrush visit after day trippers head to the coast despite lockdownNorthern Ireland transfer tests cancelled and schools #closed to mid-term#Latest Northern Ireland“Blind man on a galloping horse” could have foreseen problems with NI Protocol, Ian Paisley saysPaisley calls for the removal of the NI Protocol as an ‘impediment to trade’Nigel Dodds# mother Doreen passes away at Enniskillen nursing homeFollow Covid rules carefully, urges chief scientic adviserExams ‘not likely to go ahead in Northern Ireland’Latest from Belfast “Blind man on a galloping horse” could have foreseen problems with NI Protocol, Ian Paisley saysTeacher assessments will replace GCSE and A-level exams this summer – WilliamsonNeil Young sells % of back catalogue rights to Hipgnosis SongsCompetition watchdog to investigate Nvidia takeover of UK chip designer ArmRichard Sharp taking over as BBC chairman during turbulent time for corporation,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He had actually sent copies of them off to Walt Disney and got a very polite rejection letter but he was very proud of the fact he got a letter with Walt Disney#s signature on the bottom.Terry adored his grandchildren Patrick, Peter, Craig and Rory, and Paul believes he must have dug out some of his old Bubble Fairy stories to tell them when they were young.Paul said Gail used her free time in lockdown to start typing her father#s notes and the family decided to use his most complete stories to use as the basis for The Bubble Fairy.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseTerry Moorhead#s daughter Gail FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueTerry Moorhead#s daughter Gail Hats off to Gail, it was no mean feat, because she#s partially sighted, added Paul. Deciphering my dad#s scribbles in pencil on old pieces of paper was not at all easy for her.She typed it up and we thought we would do a family vanity project for dad.He was obviously published a lot through print journalism but he never got to publish the book, which would have been a thrill for him.My sister just thought to gather everything he had written as best as we can, put it in a book and get it published.The book#s illustrations were drawn by Patrick, who is in his final year of animation at Ulster University. Peter completed the design and layout, Paul was responsible for production and Gail was in charge of editing the final book.Paul said his only regret is that his mother and father didn#t get the chance to see The Bubble Fairy.We#d like to think that he#s up there somewhere and we#ve done him credit, he continued.

He describes it as not having memories so much but more memories of memories after seeing videos and hearing stories about him.In a loving tribute, the family also included some photos of Terry with his grandchildren at the end of the book.Only  copies of The Bubble Fairy were printed to give to friends and family for Christmas Day but Paul saidthe feedback is positive then they will consider publishing it on a wider scale.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Stay at home message legally enforceable on Friday South East Antrim UDA issue threat against First Minister Arlene FosterFormer Real IRA leader Michael McKevitt#s funeral takes place in LouthSammy Wilson defends Portrush visit after day trippers head to the coast despite lockdownBrexit delivery issues: How Amazon, John Lewis, Dunelm and other companies have been affected by Irish Sea borderLatest Northern IrelandPandemic has had #devastating impact# on cancer servicesMan who allegedly fired stun gun at woman during Belfast burglary refused bailGCSE and A-level exams in Northern Ireland cancelled – Peter Weir#Blind man on a galloping horse# could have foreseen problems with NI Protocol, Ian Paisley saysCoronavirus: DUP MPs attend Commons despite speaker urging MPs against attending #unless absolutely necessary#Latest from Belfast Welsh NHS chief warns Covid- patient numbers could double from first wavePostcode gang members to serve over  years after murdering two youths at partyMore than half of population could be vaccinated by late March – Tony BlairEvictions of renters should not be allowed during lockdown, Government warnedPandemic has had #devastating impact# on cancer services,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Restrictions were later loosened in the run up to the festive season but that has led to the current spike in virus cases.August Pubs which do not serve food - #wet pubs# - were busy preparing to open their doors for Monday, August , but were hit by a hammer blow as the Executive changed the date to September .However, this date was also cancelled because of a rise in Covid cases.Mrs Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill finally threw wet pubs a leline and permitted them to reopen from September .John Bittles, who owns Bittles Bar in Belfast city centre, estimated he lost around £, due to loss of trade.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseMichelle O#Neill FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueMichelle O#Neill August Education Minister Peter Weir stood by his assertion that the controversial A-level grading system was fair following a backlash from principals and pupils after exams were cancelled last summer because of the pandemic.The Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessmentthen failed to uphold over a third of teachers# estimated grades.Just five days later, Mr Weir performed a U-turn and allowed teachers# predicted grades to be used after strong political opposition to use centralised standardisation.November Families in Northern Ireland were told they could reunite for five days over Christmas after ministers from across the UK agreed to relax coronavirus restrictions.Up to three households were initially permitted to mix in bubbles from December  to December .Christmas plans were then thrown into disarray on December  after the Executive agreed to reduce the five day bubbling arrangements to just one day.The decision came as health officials said they believed a new strain of Covid- was circulating in the region.November Northern Ireland entered a two-week circuit breaker to slow the spread of Covid- and protect health services. Mrs Foster said the tough, carefully timed, intervention was needed to give the best chance to have a safe and happy Christmas and further into the new year period.Unfortunately, the circuit breaker didn#t have the desired effect.Chief Scientic Adviser Prof Ian Young highlighted how the figures for Belfast traffic congestion during the brief lockdown was simply too high and showed the people did not stay at home.

Just turned, went upstairs.I could hear the noise in the front room, a bag being filled... and he came downstairs and said #look, I have to go#, asthe conversation with my father had terminated.He said to my mother: #Don#t worry, I#ll be back to see you frequently#. And that was the only dissent he ever showed throughout his le until that day. He was on the run, then, basically living in one house or another.Mr McGuinness said he thought it absurd when his brother was appointed as Education Minister, having only attended UCB - University College Bogside.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseMartin McGuinness FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueMartin McGuinness Here#s a guy who had no academic background whatsoever in the formal sense... failed the -plus along with his older brother.How#s he going to handle the situation  But he took charge of a £.bn budget.Mr Paisley, the North Antrim MP, spoke of accepting McGuinness in later years, given that he had considered members of the IRA who killed police officers and bombed cities and towns as people to be absolutely detested.It never left me, the fact who Martin McGuinness was, he said. I wasn#t a fool to this, but someone  once said to me: #What made you do the arrangements with the former terrorist Martin McGuinness #And I said: #The word former#.Julie Hambleton#s sister Maxine was one of  people killed in the IRA Birmingham pub bombings in .

PA Wire PA Images FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueThe Department of Health has warned services could be hampered by the pandemic. Shaun Keenan, Local Democracy ReporterJanuary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThousands of adults and children missed out on potentially le-saving scans after services grounded to a halt due to Covid-, it has emerged.New figures show the number of patients waiting more than nine weeks for hospital treatment increased to more than , at the end of September.That’s compared to fewer than , on the same date last year.South Eastern Trust patients suffered the worst of setbacks among the six health trusts with a % increase in the number of people waiting more than nine weeks to either get a diagnosis or the all-clear.The data – which have been analysed by the Shared Data Unit – shows the impact of coronavirus on Northern Ireland’s health services.Read MoreLisa Smyth:OpinionConsequences of cost-cutting and staff shortages have never been so starkLockdown in NI #a result of underfunding and chronic lack of nurses#Health boards were asked to suspend all non-urgent elective treatment earlier last year as the NHS was put on an “emergency footing”.The latest data includes waiting times for diagnostic scans including MRI, non-obstetric ultrasound, PET and X-ray scans.The statistics show that , people have been waiting more than two months for a CT or MRI test up to September  in the South Eastern Trust.The health board has a total of , waiting for treatment, with , getting treatment under nine weeks despite the pressures hospitals are facing due to coronavirus.The pandemic has also led to a a backlog of patients awaiting treatment across Northern Ireland.Elsewhere, in total, almost , waited in total for treatment up to September last year across the country – a , increase when compared to the year prior.The Southern Trust had the most patientson their waiting lists, an % increase in the number of peoplewaiting more than nine weeks for treatment.The Belfast Trust also had a % increase in their waiting numbers, , of those waiting more than the set target for an MRI or CT scan.The Department of Healthhad previously set a target of % of patients waiting no more than nine weeks for a diagnostic test, with no patient waiting longer than  weeks by March this year.The Northern Trust – which had the highest number of patients on waiting lists in  – reduced that number from , to ,. Around , of those patients have waited more than two months for diagnostic test.Meanwhile, the Western Trust had the lowest numbers anywhere in Northern Irelanddespite more than twice the numberof people waiting several months for treatment.Jodie Moffatt, head of early diagnosis at Cancer Research UK said she was “very concerned” about the impact the virus will have on cancer.She added: “Theof time people are waiting for a scan will be having a negative impact on their diagnosis.“Those patients could be diagnosed with a more aggressive, later stage cancer. That will limit the treatment options available to them also.“There is a cohort of patients out there that have not been diagnosed yet – and who knows what state they will be in when they are.”The DoH said they expected the figures would be “even worse” following the Covid- pandemic.However, a spokesperson for the DoH said while elected waiting times were “unacceptable” before the pandemic, Covid- had “inevitable and serious impact” on waiting lists here.A DoH spokesperson said: “The minister of health remains committed to these priorities albeit the timescale and the scale at which the unacceptable waiting lists can be tackled will be greatly influenced by the ongoing impact of Covid-.“The availability of sustained and substantial investment and additional staffing will also be critical in reducing waiting times and the minister will work with his Executive colleagues in this regard.”Consultant radiologist Dr Nick Screaton, vice president of the British Institute of Radiologists said the backlog had a “big impact” on those with more advanced cancer and heart disease.He said there would need to be a “multi-faceted approach”a solution was to be found over the next “five-year period”.“We need to recruit from abroad and I know trusts are already making great efforts to do that,” Dr Screaton said.“It is important to reinforce the scanner capacity as well – it isn’t just a workforce issue. For example those hospitals with only one scanner cannot operate a ‘hot’ and a ‘cold’ one for Covid and non-Covid patients.“Smaller hospitals are more likely to have been hit harder in the amount of scans carried out.“The NHS will also have to think more broadly about doing things dferently. I think people will be much more willing to listen to the idea of regional diagnostic hubs as a result of the crisis.”Belfast Related ContentHealth PremiumLisa SmythOpinionConsequences of cost-cutting and staff shortages have never been so starkThis time last year, thousands of healthcare workers were staging strike action in a row over patient safety.

Barman Andy Nutt is preparing to pour the last measure at the well-known local pub.Reporter: Liam Tunney::  Dec   addthis, Knobbsrsquo Tavern closed in March, just before the pandemic arrived. In the week leading up to its final hurrah, we caught up with barman Andy Nutt and a few regulars.A well-known County Derry pub that has been in operation since  will close its door for the final time on Thursday.Knobbs’ Tavern in Kildoag, between Claudy and Donemana, was originally a grocery store that serviced the local area, but the community it sustained has been shrinking.On Saturday, they held a packed farewell concert, and when the County Derry Post caught up with a few of the regulars on the Friday afternoon, they were in reflective mood.“We’ll miss the yarns and the company,” said previous owner, Jack Knobbs, who was perched at the corner of the bar with his dog, Honey.“It was originally what they call a licensed shop and the first time it was opened as a bar was in . Until , the shop was still here and the bar could only hold maybe seven or eight people.“It would have been mostly locals in the bar and then in  they built on the upstairs and it would have hosted a lot of music – mostly country and western music.” googletag.cmd.push Jack is quietly spoken but points me in the direction of black and white photographs on the wall, where he featured in the Kildoag Wanderers FC side and the local cricket team in a previous era.Both teams used the bar as their base, and the social aspect the rural pub brought to the area is something Jack feels will be greatly missed.“The place would have been packed out on a Saturday night – people would have come from Donemana, Waterside and Claudy for the music.“We just enjoyed the craic. You had the odd tall story told. It’s hard to beat a good story, evenit’s not true!”Mervyn McComb lays claim to being the bar’s oldest customer. “I’ve been coming here about  years,” boasts the -year-old. googletag.cmd.push  “I was in it when the old bar was in the other room. Then, when they opened up the lounge, the place was packed to the rafters. “A lot of old bars seem to be closing up, there’s not the customers there used to be. It’s going to be badly missed. “It’s local people that come here.”Right on cue, a loud cheer erupts from the men as another regular walks into the bar, while Ian informs me the bar has its own taxi driver in residence.Barman Andy Nutt prepares to explain further. He mutes the small television mounted above the bar. This is serious stuff now.“There were six women arrived from Cumbria in England on a Tuesday night. They were on a biking tour and on their way to Park.“They came in and asked to use the toilet and I said that was no bother at all. One of them askedthis was a bar and I said it’s been called many things, but you could definitely call it a bar.“She askedthere was any chance they could have a drink and to cut a long story short, they ended up leaving the bikes here!“They stayed all night so I said I would get them a taxi man to get them back to Park. I rung up Eddie Curry and askedhe could do a run.“Eddie said ‘I’m definitely not going to Park’. Then I told him it was six women and he asked what time I wanted him down!     “I got a text from them that evening then – I think they were in Portrush.“It said: Andy, no Guinness at pound., no gin and tonic at pound. – we shouldn’t have left you!”The tale is typical of the kind of comical, slightly embellished yarns that used to be commonplace in bars across the country, but rural decline is threatening to silence them.Mervyn McComb’s son, Ian, believes that people make the bar what it is.“It’s a good wee bar, with great people in it,” he says. “There were memorable nights here every weekend. It was always good craic.“There used to be bands in upstairs and the place would have been jammed. It always did a good trade, was well run and there was never any trouble. “I’m  now so I’ve been coming here maybe  years. It will be sorely missed and it’ll hurt the community.”The range of presentation cheques that adorn the bar’s walls give an indication of how the community will suffer without its hub. Each year, the bar ran a charity drive and the evidence of their impact is clear in the many comments left on social media following news of Knobbs’ closure. Nicola Doherty fondly recalled a vintage tractor rally held at Knobbs’ after her father had beaten cancer.She commented: “We held our first tractor run in there when my dad beat cancer and bought a vintage tractor. “We hoped for a few tractors to show up and to raise a couple of hundred, but the place was packed, and we raised pound, for the Sperrin Room. “Great memories, I’m sad to see it close the doors.”The doors will indeed close, but Saturday night’s punters were treated to the nostalgic sight of the rafters reverberating to the sound of the Father and Son Remo band in the lounge above. There is a black cat that Jack Knobbs says follows him to and from his house to the bar on every visit.It sits almost sentry-like on the windowsill outside Knobbs.On a bright summer’s afternoon, Jack’s feline companion would be treated to a breathtaking view of the Faughan valley, but on Knobbs’ farewell night, Storm Jorge’s wind and rain battered its weary walls.The storm will have calmed by Thursday, as Andy Nutt prepares to close the doors. There is no doubt that Jack Knobbs will be there to oversee what will be an emotional moment.Knobbs concedes to the march of time.“I’m just a customer now,” says the former owner.“Sometimes I sit too long.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Until now. Liam Tunney talks to an ex-member of the infamous Gorilla Gang, who were responsible for many a headache at Slaughtneil discoThe Slaughtneil GAC committee used to meet every Monday evening. The meeting was supposed to be a general meeting about club business, but usually got bogged down with the disco. Discussions often revolved around two groups of boisterous young men in particular – the Gorilla Gang from Draperstown and the Banana Gang of Bellaghy. The latter were set up in reaction to the former, whose name was notorious around south Derry throughout the s. “The name was actually originally meant to be ‘Guerrilla Gang’,” an ex-member told the County Derry Post. “About  or , things were getting hot and heavy and the likes of Ballinascreen was getting saturated by the British Army. googletag.cmd.push “There would have been fighting with the UDR or the Brits, andthey came into Draperstown, the Gorilla Gang would have gathered up a posse and put them out. “There were two or three gangs in Draperstown at that time. One of them was the Wombles and the other one was the Sixtown Clowns. “They all used to fight amongst each other at small discos that used to be on round Draperstown before Slaughtneil started. “The police knew about the Gorilla Gang. I had a few older brothers that went to Spain, and on their way home they were pulled in at London airport and quizzed about the gang!” googletag.cmd.push As the disco’s popularity began to grow, the three gangs soon set their grievances aside as the possibility of taking their local scuffles to a wider field presented itself. “The disco took in the whole of south Derry, so there was more boys to fight with outside your own town,” he recalled. “It was just like that at those times around dance halls. In the early s, before Slaughtneil, the older Gorilla Gang would all have been over in Dungiven fighting at the Castle. “There were a wile lot of boys in the Gorilla Gang that were mad for fighting, and then everyone started making up their own gangs to fight us.     “I think that’s where the Banana Gang came out of, that they were going to get the Gorilla Gang at Slaughtneil. “I think the Banana Gang gave the Wombles and the Sixtown Clowns a bad beating one night and then they didn’t want to go anymore. “Well, they were mad to go, but they couldn’t because they were scared of the Banana Gang. They came to the Gorilla Gang and askedthey could join up.” The merger prompted a rivalry that lasted throughout the late s and caused the Slaughtneil bouncers no end of trouble. Our ex-member feels that the gangs’ propensity for bravado and fisticuffs helped boost the crowds that flocked to the hall on a Friday night. “Four carloads of us would leave the town to go down to Slaughtneil. We didn’t chance taking the bus, becauseyou were fighting, the bus driver wouldn’t let you on,” he said. “I remember going down to Slaughtneil and being told these Banana Gang boys were gonna be there, and two nights in a row, we went down, and they weren’t there. “The third night we went down, we thought they weren’t turning up, so maybe only five or ten of us went and we got some beating from the Banana Gang that night – they all turned up! “God help them bouncers. I don’t think Slaughtneil would have been Slaughtneil without it. Everybody was going, girls and all, to see what was going to happen next week. “If there was a small scuffle in the car park, threats were made about who was going to be there next week that wasn’t there tonight.  The characters’ nicknames roll off the ex-member’s tongue. Bungle. Flan. Rocky. Numan. Turk. Goggles. Nelly. Bruce. Shiny, who ‘couldn’t beat eggs’ but drove the getaway car. The King, who would run out onto the pitch and shout, ‘I’m the King of the Gorillas and I eat bananas for breakfast’ before a dust-up. Johnny the Donkey, who played the role of negotiator when the gangs were thrown out of the car park and arranged to meet halfway between Draperstown and Bellaghy to finish it off. An eclectic mix, but one name resonated more than others. “Flathead was the feared name. He was a real tight boy, he would have fought anybody man to man,” he said. “We would have said, ‘you boys will be in trouble next week, we’re taking big Flathead with us’, and everybody would have been at Slaughtneil the next week for the big punch up outside! “Even the bouncers were a wee bit scared of big Flathead because he was big for his age. There were some characters about.” While the rivalry between the two gangs was intense, it never created any lasting grudges and the member recalled how, by chance, he encountered one of his nemeses years later. “I hadn’t seen this boy for years, until I was going along one day in the car through Rocktown and heading for Bellaghy,” he said. “I saw a man walking along the road in the pouring rain and I stopped to seehe wanted a lt. “He hopped in anyway and was talking away to me and when he was getting out of the car, whatever way he turned sideways I recognised him. He caught on then to who I was too. “We were good friends at school, but then he was in the Banana Gang and I didn’t really want to let him know that I wanted to kill him, and he didn’t want to let me know either!” Time and people move on. The exploits of the Gorilla Gang may seem shocking when viewed through a st century lens, but our ex-member says it was a dferent era. “When I look back, I never knew of a man being hurt badly. When I hear the gang mentioned, it makes me laugh,” he said. “There were no mobile phones, no fancy cars. Anybody that had a car, it had cost them maybe pound. That whole thing is just lost. “I know it wasn’t good going to all them dance halls and fighting, but at the same time, no one was doing drugs or anything, it was just a punch-up. “Just a locka lads with a few beers in them, that fell out with another group of lads and there were a load of myths and legends that never even happened. “There were a few nights when I was younger that I maybe woke up in the morning with a black eye and a cut forehead and I said to myself, ‘oh my God, what am I at ’, but apart from that, I’ve no regrets. “We were all young cubs. Apart from the odd bleeding mouth and a bust lip, there wasn’t much harm done.” “God help them bouncers, those men got some torturing! Them boys did some organising to keep that all going. “For a club on top of a mountain, they did well to actually get people to get up there. There’s not even a pub.” It’s unlikely south Derry will ever see the likes of the Gorilla Gang again, but their mention invokes howls of recognition and intrigue. With a chuckle no doubt brought on by the memory of discos past, the ex-member had one idea that might have some under lockdown pining for its end. “I couldn’t say that I’ve any enemies out of it, put it like that. If we could get a Banana Gang-Gorilla Gang reunion night gathered up, I’d say we could have a good laugh!” See also: If you build it, they will come: Slaughtneils field of dreamers Spinning the soundtrack to a timeless era South Derrys ballroom of romance The goose that laid the golden egg Bringing Muhammad to the south Derry mountains The night a TV star came to Slaughtneil  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Joe Cassidy and captain Ciaran McNally took Michael McMullan on an wander into the past... Twelve years before helping Cathal Scullion to strike gold in an Ulster Club final, Joe Cassidy was setting up goals. This time, in the colours of Ballynease PS. A week after losing the  Castle Cup final, by virtue of a last minute goal, to a Johnny McBride and Bosco ONeill inspired Moneymore, the sides met again. googletag.cmd.push The shoe was on the other foot this time. Only a goal would save Bellaghy, thought Cassidy as he stood over the late free. With the benefit of hindsight, only Ronaldo would have found the net from the environs of right wing. Ciaran McNally began his run from full-back. He took a complete gamble. “I just swung at er with an auld scuffed box, and she fell into the net,” laughs McNally, who was the teams goalkeeper  months earlier.  Joe Cassidy and Ciaran McNally celebrate success with Ballynease PS This was the start of McNally and Cassidys winning run. They were on Bellaghys Ulster minor winning team six years later. Under McBrides captaincy, the Bellaghy duo played for Derry in the  All-Ireland minor final defeat to Westmeath. googletag.cmd.push By that time, Cassidy had secured the first of six senior medals as a list for the  win, which ended Bellaghys eight year absence from the pinnacle of Derry football. McNally had to wait until his debut year of  for senior glory and he would pick up four more championships and captain them to Ulster glory. “The best team, more often than not, always wins the championship,” Cassidy begins. “We had two dferent Ulster minor winning teams– two complete new sets of players.” Sam Maguire winners Karl Diamond, Danny Quinn and Joes older brother Damian were also to the fore.     “There was the likes of Gerry McPeake, Seamus Birt, Damian Brown and Benny Lee, boys that had a bit of experience.” The pieces of the puzzle were slotting into place to rule the Derry club scene. ---- Kilmacud Crokes goalkeeper Mick Penders late penalty save, from Damian Cassidy, denied the Tones a second All-Ireland on St Patricks Day , but after going on to dominate the race for the John McLaughlin Cup, Crossmaglen became their nemesis in Ulster. “They beat us in and . Both times, there wasnt the kick of a ball between the two teams,” McNally outlines. The  All-Ireland final, between Dublin and Galway, was the video of choice on the Bellaghy bus as they headed to their  Ulster semi-final date with Enniskillen. The irony wasnt lost on Joe Cassidy. Dublin had three men sent off, including then Derry senior boss Brian Mullins. Later that afternoon, Bellaghy also finished with  men as they bowed out of Ulster. “In those first four of five years, we got to Ulster finals and semi-finals regularly,” McNally adds. Without an Ulster title, Bellaghy were going to underachieve, he remembers thinking at the time. Joe Cassidys thoughts also flash back to the  final and having it won until John McEntees late equaliser. In the replay, Bellaghy were also a point up going into injury time. Cassidy remembers Damians free dropping in around the Crossmaglen square. If they even had kicked the ball dead the title was theirs, he laments. “The ball got played out to the wing to Oisin McConville and he ran about  yards,” Joe adds. “With hindsight, the best thing wouldve been to do a Sean Cavanagh and pull him down....wed have been Ulster champions.” Three passes later, Cathal Short – who played on the same UUJ Freshers team as Cassidy and Gareth Doherty months earlier– slid the ball past Kevin ONeill and Cross were on their way to their first All-Ireland. Lavey knocked Bellaghy out of the  championship, before Seamus Birt and Colm McElwee took charge at the start of a three year stint that brought three league and championship doubles. For, Joe Cassidy,  was their best chance of winning an All-Ireland. By , Paul Diamond – who Cassidy rates as one of the best he played with – was out of favour. Gone was the experience of Danny Quinn and Damian Cassidy. “For us, hewas a leader. He was one of those boys I loved playing with, he could hit you with a pass from about  yards away and not all midfielders had the ability to do that. Damian was the same. You just needed to make a half a step and Damian had the ball popped in your hand.” After a comfortable win over Lavey in the  county final, Bellaghy were back knocking on Crossmaglens door in the Ulster final, but super-sub Michael Moley scored the winner. Ballinderry qualied for the final the following year, after beating Lavey out the gate at Bellaghy. Joe Cassidy, who was stewarding at the game, remembers Conleith Gilligans fist pump towards a vocerous Shamrocks support after being replaced late in the game – as a bring on Bellaghy type salute. “That county final was one of my favourite ones. It was at Ballinascreen and it was on a Sunday night. There was an unreal atmosphere and a young group ofboys brought flares. “I remember walking behind the band...McNally and dferent boys were giving Gilligan a few welcome messages, so they were. Louis McPeake scored Bellaghys goal but they needed points from man of the match Damian Cassidy and Gavin Diamond to seal victory. That season ended with that defeat by Enniskillen. Without the elusive Ulster title, Bellaghys dinner dance in Arbys the following February was like a ghost town, Cassidy remembers. “Even though we had won the league and championship double...because you had done so bad in Ulster, it nearly looked like a bad year. There was a real dead atmosphere. “Youre expectations were to win an Ulster and, after seeing what Crossmaglen had done, the ultimate was to win an All-Ireland.” Despite a winning start to the  season, Bellaghy werent firing on all cylinders. Danny Quinn was player coach and was taking  percent of the training.  Ulster Club Champions  “Mammawas manager. You would land at training and everything was organsied, so he had those traits,” stated Cassidy. “Before that era , training was pretty pre-historic. My first innovator with training was Henry Downey at school. In around the club scene, Dannybegan to innovate things, he was coming off the back of county level. Mickey Moran came on board as Bellaghys trainer later in the summer, following Sligos exit out west. “That sortve gave us the kick up the backside that we needed, with someone of Mickeys level coming in. His training was top drawer.” One of Ciaran McNallys recollections of their Ulster winning campaign was how damn lucky they were to even get to Clones. The wheels almost coming off the wagon against Lavey in Greenlough. “It was a one or two point game, with a few minutes to go,” McNally remembers, when a loose ball pinged around in the Bellaghy penalty area. “I think it even hit the post and was heading across the line. All anybody had to do was get a toe to it and we were gone, then we ended up winning Ulster.”Joe Cassidy goes past Martin Calf in the  Ulster Club final. A six point win over Loup didnt satisfy the Bellaghy fans who now had lofty expectations. “People around the town were taking it for granted that wed beat the Loup and we, as players, could feel that, McNally continues, knowing it was going to be a battle. “I remember getting slated after it and people were saying youse were terrible and I remember saying....we won.” There was a draw with Slaughtneil in semi-final before Fergal Doherty, in his second senior season, hammered over a point in the early stages of the replay. “He would have been nervous in around the changing room, he was young at the time,” his captain outlines. “I remember the roar and relief from himand it was great from our respective.” The final was another showdown with their rivals Ballinderry again. It was a damp squib. Both McNally and Cassidy acknowledge almost falling over the line in a - to - victory. “Somebody needs to just stop that man,” McNally remembers thinking as the Shamrocks defensive rock Niall McCusker ferried the ball from corner back, up the wing before his diagonal ball went out for a . “The ball then came in, dropped short and we cleared it. Then came the relief with the final whistle.” ---- With three-in-a-row now secure, Bellaghy needed a win over Castledawson to keep their league hopes intact but an ankle ligament injury sustained in that game put Joe Cassidys Ulster club hopes in doubt. Bellaghy received a bye in the first round of Ulster, following Cargins suspension dished out after their final with arch-rivals St Pauls. Cassidy came on as a sub late in their semi-final victory over Cavan champions Gowna, who Bellaghy also met on their way to the  title. On the other side of the draw, Castleblayney disposed of Crossmaglen in the quarter-final before falling to Errigal Ciaran. “I had an idea ...you dont break up a winning team and we had played well in the semi-final,” Cassidy admits. Bellaghy won the toss and elected to play against the breeze. Bellaghy owned the ball in the first half but a litany of wides saw them trail - to - at the break. Peter Canavan had fired over the bar for the games first score, but never got a kick off David ONeill who dominated the Tyrone legend in the air. Cassidys worst nightmare was being paired off against Neilly in training games. “Between him and Sean Marty , I dont know how many roastings I got over the years.” Birt gave Cassidy the nod to warm up at the interval and six minutes into the second half, he entered the fray. “I was coming in fresh and the first ball I got, I turned and fired this thing over the bar from  yards. You looked like a super player but the breeze was carrying it.” Bellaghys defence, which included man of the match Peter Diamond, held Errigal scoreless for a full  minutes until Mark Hartes consolation goal in stoppage time. Six minutes before that, Cathal Scullions goal put the game to bed and Bellaghy could savour the march to glory. “Karl Diamond put the ball into the corner,” Cassidy recalls, with the help of watching the game again in his father Dan Joes Ballynease museum of GAA. “Gavin Diamond came off the shoulder, I flicked it to Gavin and it became a two versus one. He put it into Chubberwho put it into the back of the net.” Cassidy and McNally, interviewed separately, both speak with a laugh of Scullion swinging his jersey over his head in celebration. “I will never forget Peter Docon the terrace, jumping up and down. At that stage, you knew you had it. There is no better feeling when you have trained your whole le to try and win something,” Cassidy enthused. For McNally, it was always about learning from defeats and the steeliness it helps to generate. “I always tell people its not all badit makes you come back the following year that bit more determined.” It took Scullions goal to cement the result. Some years later, Ciaran lost his fatherand mothersuddenly but he clearly remembers his father telling of the sheer joy on the Clones steps, as Bellaghy eventually ended their Ulster losing streak. “The supporters were so disappointed in previous years. To have that picture in your head, of us being home and hosed, it was special.” At the final whistle, McNally embraced goalkeeper Ciaran Donnelly before being whisked off to the presentation area by an Ulster Council official. After years in the Ulster wilderness, the Tones skipper stood alone, before bellowing into the microphone to urge the throngs of joyous royal blue clad players and fans to join him. McNally didnt tempt fate. No speech was prepared, but two things came flooding back. He firstly made sure to commiserate with Errigal Ciaran. He knew the drill, having had one hand and four fingers of the other on the Seamus McFerran Cup before McEntee, Moley and Short – on three separate occasions - pulled it out of Bellaghys grasp. He also had a sincere word of thanks for Seamus Birt and Colm McElwee who took an awful lot of abuse following defeats to Cross and Enniskillen. “I hope you are as quick to come forward and thank them,” McNally told the Bellaghy faithful. “They done a lot of work, won us three-in-a-row and an Ulster.” Following the customary post game meal in Paudge Quinns restaurant, the team bus – rocking from the sing-song inside – rolled into the middle of Bellaghy. The players marched up to Muldoons shop and back to the Diamond, before heading to the club to celebrate long into the night. “Those are the nights you will never forget,” Cassidy insists. “There is no tomorrow, just endless partying, craic and everybody is in good form. There is something special about waking up the morning after a club final. There is no hangover, you just cant wait to get to speaking to people and meeting your family.”  Ciaran McNally rasies the Seamus McFerran aloft in the Clones tunnel. His younger brother Ryanlooks on. In the All-Ireland semi-final, they were defeated by eventual winners Crossmolina. It was an emotion Bellaghy knew only too well. Crossmaglen , Ballinderry and St Galls also beat the Tones on their way to lting the Andy Merrigan Cup. Patrick McAndrews goal gave the Mayo men a - to - interval lead. With eight minutes to go, two Gavin Diamond points had the margin down to two points before Ciaran McDonald was sprung from the bench. “He was carrying an ankle injury, but the next thing he came on and fired over a couple of absolute reevers and they beat us by four,” states Joe Cassidy, who one of Bellaghys only two scorers that day. Later that night, in the wee small hours, Ciaran McNally sat out on the swing in the family garden. Staring into oblivion, until the birds began to chirp. It was time to reflect. “I just couldnt go into the house,” he said. Despite people trying to soften the blow earlier in the night, McNally knew it was going to be a long way back. For Cassidy, he feels he speaks for everyone of that era - highlighting the regret of not winning an All-Ireland. “After that, managers came in and tried things and what youll find is...managers will generally get the blame, iniably from players – and I include myself in that,” Cassidy said. “It is only with experience and hindsight, you realise it had f**k all to do with management. It was to do with hunger and lots of us were making excuses.” Ballinderry beat them in , a final Bellaghy played better than their grind a year previous. First round defeats at the hands of the Shamocks and Glenullin prevented them from getting back to a decider until Slaughtneil beat them in the  final. Under the tutelage of Damian Cassidy, they realised that John McLaughlin wasnt a million miles away again. “One of his main attributes as a manager is his ability to get best that he can out of squads. Every night at training, he challenged you, states Joe, who was top scorer in the  championhship. Their - to - win over Loup in  took Bellaghy to  on the roll of honour. It was followed up by an Ulster win in Crossmaglen but that was the last hurrah in the winners enclosure. St Galls, with future Bellaghy boss John Rafferty at the helm beat them in an Ulster final. “Money couldnt buy what I got out of it,” McNally sums up of his career. “The only travesty about it is that you get too far down the line before you realise it. It was taken for granted.” “You see things now, with families all gathered aroundtaking photos...we didnt do that because we thought thats the way it was.” Its a regret. McNally got his hands on championship silver in four of the first five years of his senior career. “If I had a few lean years before it, you maybe wouldve knew to appreciate it,” he concludes. When Joe Cassidys lofted ball landed in the Moneymore goalmouth all those years ago and McNallys fisted goal brought silverware back to Ballynease, it was only the beginning of a journey to the steps of the Gerry Arthurs stand...a day when Bellaghy were kings of Ulster.

Michael OKane took on the role at St Colmcilles Primary School in Claudy after Easter this year, with schools already closed by the first Covid- lockdown. He was nominated for the award by parent Fiona Garrett, who told presenter Stephen Nolan that Mr OKane had helped her children with two particularly tricky transitions. “My son Matthew was transitioning from P to big school and my daughter Oacuterlagh-Janetransitioning from nursery to P,” she said. “My daughter has a statement of special educational needs. During lockdown, she became very distressed at the sudden change of routine and Mr OKane really helped with this. googletag.cmd.push “He did this by doing videos to show her where her new classroom was going to be, what it would look like, who her new classroom assistant was going to be and how to sanitise your hands properly. “He also helped my son with the P leaving transition. My son started becoming distressed at not seeing his friends and the fact they wouldnt get a last opportunity to all be together. “Mr OKane arranged a wonderful Year  leaving mass, where he shot a beautul photo and video of the group together with his drone. “Matthews short, but positive experience of Mr OKane actually inspired him to want to become a teacher now.” googletag.cmd.push Miss Garrett said Mr OKane had gone beyond the call of duty to make sure parents were looked after too, and said he was a special person. “He is so good with children who have special educational needs. He goes above and beyond, going that extra little step just to make everything run smoothly. That takes a special person,” she said. “He goes out of his way to be so approachable and friendly. “Hes in the thick of it with the children, showing them how to use their talents and getting the best out of everyone, including his staff. “He really cares for his school family. Absolutely anything is possible with the right support and Im so grateful.”     Michael admitted it was a shock to receive a call from Stephen Nolan, initially askinganything was wrong, but he regained his composure to pay tribute to the schools staff. “I only started here at Easter and I inherited a fantastic school with fantastic staff and I dont think Ive done too much myself – everybody in the school has really pulled together,” he said. “Im just looking out the window here on a dreary Monday morning and thats the sort of thing we need to hear. Im in shock here, but Id just like to thank the staff, and in particular Fionas childrens teachers. “Theres a fantastic team in Year  who made children feel comfortable in coming back to school. “Its been tough, but everybody has gone above and beyond from teachers, classroom assistants, our building supervisors and cleaners. “Im going to relay this to all the staff because it will lt everybodys spirits,” he added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Sinn Feacutein MLA Martina Anderson said she is to meet the Norths Minister for Sport this week to discuss the proposal. The talks with Minister Deirdre Hargey take place on Wednesday amid mounting support for soccer to be reorganised on an all-island basis. The Foyle MLA said: “The past year has been hugely damaging for all sports, given the loss of gate receipts and other revenues. “Having two soccer federations on an island this size never made commercial or sporting sense and there had already been signicant support, North and South, for existing proposals to create an all-island structure. googletag.cmd.push “However, in the wake of the Covid pandemic and the impact it has had on the game, more and more soccer clubs are assessing their long-term sustainability and finding that the appeal of an all-Ireland league is obvious. “Structured proposals are already in place and signicant progress has been made regarding potential sponsorship of an all-island league. “It is also abundantly clear from the success of other all-Ireland sports such as rugby, boxing, golf, GAA, hockey and cricket that we can achieve great things when we work on an all-island basis. “This should not be a politically sensitive issue but rather one of what makes best economic and sporting sense to soccer clubs throughout the island. googletag.cmd.push That is the basis on which we will pursue our discussions with the minister and as we continue to progress this issue in the time ahead.”      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Eileen received the vaccine from Dr Michael McKenna at her local GP surgery on the Falls Road, Belfast. The rollout of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine follows approval from the Medicines  Healthcare products Regulatory Agencylast week and paves the way for a signicant acceleration of Northern Ireland’s vaccination programme. Speaking at the vaccination clinic, Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride said: “Today marks the first phase of our population vaccination programme and is a positive step forward. The vaccine programme will transform the situation but as always we must all remain patient. googletag.cmd.push “First and foremost we must act to protect those most at risk of severe disease and death. As approved by the MHRA and recommended by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationprioritisation will be given to those aged  years and over. The programme will then be rolled out based on age and other clinical vulnerability factors.” The JCVI has recently updated its guidance and has recommended that as many people on the JCVI priority list as possible should be offered a first vaccine dose as the initial priority. Dr McBride said: “The evidence has very clearly shown that both the Pfizer BioNTech and the Oxford Astra Zeneca vaccines provide very high levels of protection after the first dose. googletag.cmd.push Providing that level of protection on a large scale will have the greatest impact on reducing death and hospitalisations, protecting the Health and Social Care system. It is the right thing to do for the public health.” Speaking after receiving her vaccine, Eileen said: “I am delighted and privileged to receive the Covid vaccine today. I feellikeI can really look forward to the year ahead now that I have been vaccinated. The nurses, doctors and staff have all been brilliant today so I would also like to say thank you to them.” Dr McKenna said: “We are very pleased to get this vaccination programme started for this vulnerable group of people.     Many of this group will have been virtually housebound since the start of the pandemic so today’s vaccinations are very welcome. I, like other GP practices, look forward to vaccinating more of my patients who are  or over in the coming weeks, moving on thereafter to other patient groups.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Students save a considerable amount of time by using the laneway to get to and from school.The former Down Council attempted to secure funds to upgrade the laneway and carry out a much-needed resurfacing and lighting scheme but liaising with representatives from a number of statutory agencies including the Housing Executive and Roads Service, the ownership issue could not be firmly established.Describing the laneway as a ldquovital link for residents who live at the Langley Road area in particular, Cllr Walker hopes that, with the publicrsquos help, he can find out who owns the land.ldquoThere are several street lights along part of the laneway but the Department for Infrastructure insists that it is not responsible for the land, he said.Cllr Walker says it is necessary to find out who owns the laneway as work is starting to upgrade Ballynahinchrsquos masterplan which includes a number of new walking trails in and around the town.ldquoWhy not include Beedhamrsquos Lane in the planned trails andwe could find out who this piece of ground it could pave the way for its upgrade, he continued.ldquoPeople could be forgiven for thinking that it leads to a farm. Given that we are in the midst of winter, the laneway is an awful state and children who are walking to school are literally getting covered in mud.Cllr Walker has suggested that it would not cost a signicant sum of money to upgrade the laneway which he suggests has the potential to become a key component of the townrsquos planned new walking trails.ldquoIf anyone can help me identy who is responsible for this piece of land could they contact either myself, the Langley Road Residentsrsquo Association or Newry, Mourne and Down Council, he said.Cllr Walker added: ldquoThe upgrade of this particular laneway has been raised on numerous occasions in the past, but nothing has ever been done.ldquoGiven the high volume of pedestrian traffic which uses it, itrsquos important work gets underway to upgrade it.ldquoIn seeking to find out who owns the laneway I hope that it can be determined of this particular piece of ground is a registered right of way..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd December 2020 Caldwell.jpg","title":"Caldwell’s goal seals cup win  ","story":"DOWNrsquoS U- hurlers will have cause to celebrate Christmas with a little more cheer after they clinched the Peadar Oacute Laithaacutein Cup with a two-point win over Meath in Navan on Sunday.Two minutes into injury time, and with the sides deadlocked at - apiece, it looked aswe were heading to extra time when Ryan Byas struck over a wonderful m sideline.Meath looked to have sealed victory from a doggedly tough Down side with virtually the last play of the contest.However, straight from the resulting puck-out Michael Dorrian raced clear of midfield and floated the sliotar towards the edge of the box.Francis Caldwell reached highest and as he slipped past both Cottrell and Ennis in defence.A deftly-placed one handed flick out-foxed Jack Fagan as he lunged out to intercept the sliotar. He could only watch on but as it bypassed his attempts and nestled in the back of the Meath net.Finn Turpin opened the day with the first score of the game inside a minute. Downrsquos captain, Tom McGrattan, knocked over a free a minute later, but by the end of the first quarter Meath were in front as midfielder Joey Cole got the next three scores.McGrattan levelled matters from play shortly afterwards, as both defences were kept busy.On several occasions in the first half, Down threatened the Meath rearguard as goal chances went begging with James Clarke, Michael Dorrian and Caldwell all having attempts saved, blocked or bundled away from danger.Down struggled in the middle of the park and found it hard to win any puck-outs against a physically strong Meath team.They did though throw themselves into every tackle. Jarlath McCollum, Deaglan Mallon and James Higgins played out of their skins, harrying, hustling and shutting down any potential danger as Meath tried in vain to breach the Down defence.A McGrattan free and a Caldwell point saw Down edge into a two-point lead in a very scrappy final ten minutes of the half.With less than three minutes to the whistle, Meath hit a purple patch with four unanswered scores, two courtesy of the dangerous Ryan Byas and the others from corner men Rory Fagan and Josh Harris.Playing with a slight breeze in the first half, Meath knew thatthey were to ensure a victory on home soil, they would surely need some daylight between themselves and their northern opponents before the change of ends.Thankfully for Down, Turpin, Dorrian and Clarke kept Meath on their toes as they eventually managed to engineer the last score of the half.Oisiacuten Coulter popped the sliotar over from out near the side-line to leave just two points between the sides at the end of the half.Within the opening two minutes of the restart, Oisiacuten Coulter continued a good vain of form and had the sides level for the fth time, as both sides refused to yield.Joey Cole pointed four minutes later as the Royals introduced Matthew Cully to full forward, his introduction would breathe new le into their attack.Down initially struggled to handle the burly full forward, who ended the day with three superbly-taken points whilst under severe pressure from their Ulster counterparts.The lead changed hands again as two McGrattan frees and a Michael Dorrian point gave them a slight edge with the game fast approaching the second water break.A Jack Meagher score, followed swtly by Matthew Cullyrsquos first of the day, when he picked Downrsquos pocket after a quick puck-out had failed to reach its intended target, shook Down. Instead of leading going down the home straight, it was level at - each.With  minutes played Denis Darby won a sideline for the home side and when Byas hit the sweetest of strikes straight over Pearse Smythrsquos crossbar there were scenes of jubilation and euphoria from the Meath bench as surely it looked asJustin Coyne would be presented with the cup.Sean Young had this young Down side well drilled and it was a credit to the teamrsquos spirit that within the next  seconds Downrsquos goal machine, Francis Caldwell ensured that it would be a victory for Down in the strangest of seasons five days before Christmas.After seeing Tom McGrattan lt the cup, a delighted Young was magnanimous in victory and praised Meath for the high standard of Hurling that made this contest such a thriller.ldquoWe knew coming into the game today this would be a very dferent challenge than last week, he said.ldquoMeath are always a big strong physical side with a spread of talented Hurlers in their ranks. We knew it wasnrsquot going to be easy to play them in their back yard, it was going to be a monumental task to get over the line.ldquoI thought the game was nip and tuck in the first quarter as our main objective was not to concede any early goals playing against a stf breeze in the first half. I canrsquot praise the boys enough, our bench helped us over the line and it was a superbly taken goal from Francis.Meath: J Fagan, R Ennis, H Cottrell, E Cole, P Connelly, J Coyne, K OrsquoGorman, J Cole , E Grehan, R Byas , J Meagher , S Donnelly, R Fagan , J Harris, S Cunningham .Subs: M Cullyfor Harris, E McCormack for Donnelly, D Darby for Cunningham.Down: P Smyth, J Higgins, D Mallon, J McCollum, N Kelly, C Savage, F McFall, R OrsquoNeill, J Duggan, F Turpin , T McGrattan , M Dorrian , O Coulter , J Clarke, F Caldwell .Subs: S Milliganfor OrsquoNeill, F MacManus for McGrattan..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd December 2020 Castlewellan.jpg","title":"Castlewellan woman’s releases debut children’s book  ","story":"A CASTLEWELLAN woman has joined the ranks of childrenrsquos book authors.Kathleen McPolin, who is a Speech and Language Therapy Assistant in Downpatrick SureStart, has just published the first in an exciting new series featuring the farm-based adventures of Boomer and Blanky.Produced by Shanway Press in Belfast, the books are aimed at encouraging early yearsrsquo interest in reading and promote new vocabulary.Part of Kathleenrsquos work with SureStart over the past  years has been helping to facilitate rhythm, rhyme, and story sessions each week for children - with their parents or s.ldquoBecause this age group have short attention spans, I find the books that really capture their attention are the colourful ones with few words but yet have a story to tell, explained Kathleen.After finding it dficult to get the right books to cover everyday topics such as transport, weather, clothes, and food in a short-story style, Kathleen decided to create her own.ldquoChildren love to see the same characters appear regularly in their books.

He had lived in London most of his le, leaving Saul at the age of .Engaged to be married, but struggling to find the right ring, he found himself back in Northern Ireland on business he decided to call on his uncle Will, his only surviving Irish relative.It was the eve of the longest night of the year, a few days before Christmas, and a bitterly cold late afternoon. On the side of a rural road, devoid of street lights, all but hidden by trees, was an old fashioned car, with smoke escaping from its engine.Standing beside the car, kicking it was a young woman in a bridal dress. She appeared to be beating up the motor. Jim applied the brakes of his vehicle and rolled down the window.lsquoCan I help rsquo The young woman looked at him with burning blue eyes, turned away and thumped the boot. lsquoUseless piece of junk,rsquo she shrieked. The young woman attempted to give the car one last kick, missed and ped with a thud on to her rear. Jim got out of his car. Trying not to laugh he rushed over to the young woman and attempted to help her to her feet.She pulled her arm away and with an effort dragged herself up using the carrsquos half open door. She ripped of her shoe and attacked the window screen. She turned to Jim. lsquoWhat do you know about fixing cars rsquo Jim shrugged.The bride pierced him with fiery blue eyes.lsquoAre you going to a fancy dress party rsquo he asked. lsquoI am going to be married,rsquo she replied. She banged the roof of the car with her shoe a number of times, hopping about attempting to put the shoe back on to her foot. lsquoLet me give you a lt,rsquo suggested Jim.In order to steady herself the bride hung on to Jimrsquos shoulder and finally won the battle of the shoe. lsquoThought yoursquod never ask.rsquo She lashed out at the motor with her fist, missed, spun around and fell into Jimrsquos arms.Saul Church was only a mile away. The lady could not walk to her own wedding, besides it was growing dark. She grabbed his coat in near panic. lsquoMy ring,rsquo she cried. lsquoIrsquove lost my engagement ring!rsquo She dropped on to her knees. lsquoThis is a nightmare and you are not helping.rsquoJim walked at speed to his car and grabbed a torch as the bride crawled around the ground, feeling the earth in a vain attempt to retrieve the ring. Jim ed and shone the torch about the trees and grass. She grabbed his leg and pointed towards her car.lsquoItrsquos cursed, the car is cursed, and so are you.rsquo She bit him on the knee. lsquoGet off me,rsquo he shouted. She sat back on a muddy mound. lsquoI may have overreacted,rsquo she said. lsquoIs my lipstick smudged rsquo She wiped her hand across her lips. rsquoI think it might be smudged.rsquoJim did not answer, choosing to rub his knee, shine the torch, find the ring and hightail it to his unclersquos house as fast as possible. lsquoItrsquos all go,rsquo she said, trying to make conversation. lsquoIf my father could see me now, he would be so proud.rsquo The young woman adjusted her veil. It slowly drooped on to the side of her head and from there drted towards her lap. She picked it up and tossed it away.Jim located the ring beside the front wheel. lsquoIrsquove got it, Irsquove got the ring.rsquo He retrieved it and gave it a amateur polish. It was silver with an small amber stone as its centre piece. He read the inion lsquoTo M.K, Saul rsquo. It must have been handed down through her intendedrsquos family.lsquoYou great big sexy man. The bride jumped to her feet. Well done.rsquo She kissed him on the nose. lsquoItrsquos a lovely ring,rsquo said an embarrassed Jim. lsquoI am engaged, havenrsquot got the ring yet.rsquoThe bride grabbed the ring and placed it on to her finger lsquoThen you had best get a move on, you donrsquot want to lose her.rsquo She took out a hanky and blew her nose with considerable force.Jim noticed in the torch light that she was muddy and dishevelled, her face and red hair littered with spots of mud.lsquoYou donrsquot have a driver rsquo he asked. lsquoSmelly little man, didnrsquot trust him, kicked him out a mile or so back,rsquo she replied. Jim had spotted a somewhat sad looking gentleman on the road a few minutes before. lsquoShall we go rsquo asked the bride, as she gathered up her dress and walked towards his car, tripping over her loose shoe, all the while muttering under her breath.They didnrsquot speak much during the short trip to the church lsquoYes, I am looking for a ring. Where did you get yours rsquo Jim inquired.                                                                    lsquoYou like it rsquo asked his odd passenger as she struggled in vain to apply lipstick. Jim smiled and nodded his head. The bride inspected her ring lsquoItrsquos very nice, expensive,rsquo she boasted. lsquoWas it handed down through your fianceacutersquos family rsquo The bride didnrsquot reply. lsquoI live in London, I am visiting my uncle Will, do you know him, Will OrsquoBrien rsquoJim noticed that the young lady was gazing out of the window, looking slightly lost, she was not in the mood for conversation. The car came to a halt outside the little church. Warm lights beamed from inside. Jim thought it was an odd time of day to get married and a strange time of year. A few indistinct people stood around the grounds of the church.The bride opened the door, lsquoIrsquom here,rsquo she said and fell out of the car, lsquoIrsquom alright,rsquo she said painfully, stood up and slipped. Steadying herself, she kicked his car and her shoe dropped off. She picked it up and without so much as a thank you, disappeared, muddy and wet, into the church, resembling a worn-out scarecrow more than a bride. Jim waited a moment before driving off.Uncle Will and Jim talked and joked as they caught up with all the news over tea and cake. lsquoDid you ever meet Maureen Walsh rsquo asked Uncle Will. Jim shook his head as he helped himself to an extra slice of cake.Your grandfather was meant to give her lt to her wedding. She and he didnrsquot hit it off.rsquoUncle Will poked the dying embers of the fire. lsquoHe wasnrsquot one for bathing,rsquo he mumbled under his breath.lsquoShe died a few hours ago.

It was slightly bizarre, as one was a track and field meet, and the other a cross country race.As most of us donrsquot know what day it is, let alone which month, this blending of two dferent seasons seemed acceptable to many.The ANI Winter Track Series, spread over two nights, included a range of distances with East Down ACrsquos Neil Curran opting to give the km a blast. He has mostly been training solo since March and was glad of the opportunity to mix with some speedy competitors.He raced well and was pleased with third place in his heat. He recorded a time of .. which is only five seconds off his PB for the distance and proves that he remains in good form, despite the lack of racing to keep him sharp.In  his attempts at this distance exceeded the  minute barrier so this represents commendable progress overall. Keep at it Neil.The first cross country event of the  autumn season was also the last of the year. The Bobby Rea Memorial had been scheduled and rescheduled as restrictions rose and fell, but finally got away on Sunday at the Billy Neill playing fields in Comber.There was a limit on the entries and waves were allocated to permit social distancing. Sadly there were no spectators allowed. East Down AC had only three runners taking part as the change of date had affected overall attendance.The first to test the underfoot conditions were the senior men with Aaron McGrady representing East Down.The race got underway after a short period of silence in honour of John McKeag, the Ballydrain Harriers stalwart who sadly passed away the previous Monday in his th year.Aaron had hoped to fit in this particular race as a marker for his form ahead of the Intermediate Championships scheduled for mid-January but now likely to face abandonment due to the lockdown proposed to be implemented for six weeks after Christmas.The race consisted of two laps of .km each, the shorter distance designed, like the ision of the runners, into waves of up to a maximum of  runners each, to prevent mass overtaking to comply with social distancing requirements.As only half of the over  entries turned up, it was necessary to use only two waves.Aaron was drawn in the first wave alongside the faster runners and though he prefers to start relatively slowly and then set out to catch those in front, he doubtedit would be possible on this occasion so he was well to the fore from the off and came through at the end of the first lap in fourth place.However he stuck with his pre-race plan and when the runners re-appeared at the end of lap two, he was in third place behind Mark McKinstryand Craig McMeechan , and comfortably maintained his position until the finish line.He said afterwards that he was happy with how the race had gone and had no regrets about his tactics. The first three recorded times were ., . and . respectively, which is pretty hot running on a cross country course that was holding a fair amount of overnight rain. Well done Aaron.The second race was for senior and masters women and East Down AC again had only one representative mdash the ever-enthusiastic Sharon Madine.Sharon started conservatively in the second of the two waves, but proceeded to make steady progress and at the end of her two laps she had a time of . against her name. When the results of both waves were combined she placed overall th but first in the over- category. Well worth the efforts Sharon.The third and final event of the day was for Male Masters and again a sole East Down AC runner mdash the evergreen Dee Murray. Another who seems to have lost none of his competitive edge during the pandemic, Dee simply turns up and runs as hard as he can.On Sunday this meant that his time of . gave him th place overall and second in the over- category. Well done Dee.In spite of the absence of spectators, all who turned up said that it was well organised and they were glad to have taken part. As one of the few interested official observers, I have to agree with that.Sandwiched between these two events was the East Down AC annual Xmas predicted K at the Downshire Estate on Thursday evening.This is a fun event where runners try to guess how long they will take to cover the distance and then without a watch or other timing device do their best to match it. With the emphasis on accuracy and pacing rather than speed the way is wide open for all to snatch the prize.The top five were impressively close to their predicted times with fth place going to Johnny Holmes, who was seven seconds out. Deirdre Weatherall and Colin Shields tied for third equal - each with a five-second deficit.Seamus Savage was four seconds off his guess, which was good going, but it would have been hard to beat the winner Maureen Kelly who was a mere one second to the better of her guess. She was delighted to top the table and over the moon to find that her prize was a hamper of goodies as well as a pound voucher for Bells Supervalu Crossgar. Congratulations Maureen.Even though the runners had to be split into waves and social distancing was enforced, it was the best that was on offer due to current circumstances and it was a good boost to club morale. Instead of charging the normal entry fee, members were asked to donate food items which have been duly delivered to the Fountain Foodbank in the town.All in all it was a successful night for all concerned and an uplting end to a less than inspiring .

Itrsquos something I always dreamed of growing up.Conor has spent several spells out on loan in recent years in order to build-up his first team experience, readying him for a career between the sticks for Celtic.He got his chance to impress against Lille and Kilmarnock r as Celticrsquos form hit a rocky patch, but being selected by Lennon for the win over Hearts at Hampden Park was a huge confidence boost.ldquoI have to thank all of the staff and the manager for putting trust in me, said Conor.ldquoIt was a huge honour in such a big game. Thankfully, I was able to repay that trust with the two penalty saves. I have put a lot of work in and gone on loan spells waiting for my chance. The coaches have helped me a lot throughout the club.Sundayrsquos cup win clinched the domestic treble for Celtic for the fourth successive campaign, something that has never before been achieved. It is also the th time Celtic have been crowned Scottish Cup winners, with the Downpatrick man admitting the team has a lot of work to do to try and achieve its aims and targets this year.ldquoThe final was only my third game for the club, so Irsquom taking each day as it comes. As a team and as a group, this win could be a major factor in turning things round, he added.Conorrsquos family watched his cup final heroics at home in Downpatrick as fans were not allowed to attend the match due to coronavirus restrictions. However, they were over the moon with his achievements.ldquoI donrsquot think I have any fingernails left after that, laughed his beaming dad Gary. ldquoWe didnrsquot know up until the last minutehe would get the nod to play or not. We knew he did well in the European game and certainly made a case for himself. He only found out on Thursday from Lennon that he would be playing.Whilst there was undoubted pride from his dad, Gary said Conor has deserved his break due to how hard he has worked.ldquoHe has put so much time into Celtic over the years and done all the right things. All the close family are so proud of him, his mum Pauline, his younger brother Jack. He was superb.ldquoConor very much wants to be able to go on and make himself number one for Celtic. He is only  and this was just his third appearance, so hersquos been doing well. He had a loan spell at Dundee and did very well there and that has put him in good stead.Gary said Conor has also been drawing high praise from his Northern Ireland manager Ian Barraclough after breaking through for the senior team too.ldquoBarraclough has spoken really highly of Conor. He did very well for him when he was the manager at under-age level and the boss knows what he can do in training, he said.Conorrsquos family are no strangers to sporting success either. Younger brother Jack has played Irish League football as a goalkeeper, but has more recently focused his attentions on Gaelic Games, putting in some super displays for the Down Gaelic football under- side..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd December 2020 Lions.jpg","title":"Lions Club thanks public’s generosity  ","story":"THE public has been praised for its response to a Christmas appeal spearheaded by Downpatrick Lions Club and the ICare charity.The organisations asked people for gts and cash donations tom help disadvantaged teenagers and young people across the district.Lions club president Raymond Crea recently presented a cheque for pound to ICare representative Joanne Murray who is the charityrsquos home care support services manager.Many of the gts people donated were distributed locally with the SureStart organisation the first to take delivery of a large selection of gts including toys, toiletries and clothing which will go a long way to helping families over the festive season.SureStart manager Pauline Gunstan expressed her thanks to Downpatrick Lions, the ICare charity and all those who contributed to this appeal.A number of other organisations will also benefit from generous donations as a result of the joint initiative.Downpatrick Lions Club would like to thank everyone for their generosity and wish them a merry Christmas and a happy and healthy New Year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd December 2020 Strangford.jpg","title":"Strangford primary school receives digital accolade  ","story":"A LOCAL primary school has become one of  primary schools in Northern Ireland to have been awarded the prestigious Digital School Award.The award to St Josephrsquos Primary School in Strangford, in recognition of its commitment to digital learning, is backed by tech companies HP, Microsoft and RM Education with the support of Ck and the Department of Education.The Digital School Award is part of an innovative scheme promoting excellence in digital learning and teaching, aimed at equipping pupils with cutting-edge digital skills.To achieve the award, the school was assessed in five key areas mdash Leadership and Vision, Digital Learning Teaching and Assessment, School Culture, Professional Development and Resources and Infrastructure.Assessor Peter Heaney said in his report: ldquoThis school has embraced the use of digital technology to deliver effective teaching and learning. The pupils I spoke to were confident and articulate users of the digital resources at their disposal. The school has developed effective support links during the pandemic to support distance learning.St Josephrsquos also received a special recognition badge last month for Cyber Resilience and Internet Safety, becoming the third primary school in Northern Ireland to be awarded this badge.The school had completed a pioneering education initiative developed to encourage online safety and cyber resilience amongst pupils in schools.The assessment report noted: lsquoSt Josephrsquos is a dynamic school which has a careful, considered and planned approach to developing and delivering a safe and secure digital technology learning environment for their pupils and have fully engaged their parental community in this development.rsquoPrincipal Laura Fitzsimons said: ldquoWe are delighted to have been awarded these prestigious titles which highlight the schoolrsquos continual investment in resources and training.ldquoWe are very pleased and proud of our teachers, student digital leaders and all our pupils for their commitment to digital learning.ldquoIt was particularly pleasing to receive this positive news in light of the challenging times which we are currently living in..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd December 2020 Talking.jpg","title":"Talking about coercive control  ","story":"TODAY there are mothers and their children from the wider Downpatrick area living in refuges run by Womenrsquos Aid.There may be more over the Christmas and New Year period as the festive time can be a dangerous time for people living with their abuser.The prospect of a six-week lockdown means that demand for help is also set to increase as Womenrsquos Aid supported , women and children during the last lockdown.Eileen Murphy, chief executive officer of the charity, has in her -plus years of working provided support to women from the Downpatrick area.Based in Newry, she works closely with the South Eastern Domestic Violence Partnership run by the local Health Trust and in partnership with other agencies, including the PSNI.ldquoOur refuges run at % capacity but we also work with many women who never stay in our refuges, said Eileen.She is all too aware of the worry and fear that some women will be experiencing over the holiday period.ldquoMothers will be trying to make the best Christmas Day possible for their children, no matter the situation. They will be hoping that he [the abuser] will be OK, she explained.ldquoI have seen over the years that women and children develop this radar with antennas scanning all the time to judge his mood, howrsquos he walking, howrsquos he eating, scanning constantly all the time, thinking is it safe, is he OK, are we annoying him  It will not matter as he is only one who can control his behaviour.While Eileen is keen to highlight that Womenrsquos Aid will provide   help to women, she also wants to dispel some myths about domestic abuse and violence and to talk about coercive control mdash any act or a pattern of acts of assault, threats, humiliation and intimidation or other abuse that is used to harm, punish, or frighten victims.ldquoOne of the main things we do for women when they come into the service is to help her understand that there was not anything she did as therersquos nothing she could have done which would have stopped him, she said.ldquoWe have women who have had to beg to have a shower and we have women who phone us who are literally hiding in a hedge as hersquos walking up and down the street trying to find her.ldquoA lot of us think its black eyes and broken bones but the real damage is the psychological torture that is going on where women and children are terrorised in their own home. They are led to believe that everything is all their fault, they are at the root cause of whatever incident. When you are living with that  , you are only surviving.Womenrsquos Aid recently launched an awareness campaign called lsquoUnlock Your Lockdownrsquo to highlight their services to women who are living in fear or under threat.Eileen said: ldquoI would say that any woman who is worried at how she is going to get through Christmas andit is to do with her partner, then I would say to ring us and have a chat. We donrsquot force anybody into the service and we donrsquot make women leave home, thatrsquos always their choice.ldquoWhat we do is to work with her and help her to determine where she is and whatrsquos the best option for her. It can be either just one phone call to her engaging in full services for anything up to two years.She stressed that the first thing Womenrsquos Aid do when a women calls them is to assess the risk she and her children are in.ldquoThe first we do is assess the risk, to find out how safe she is, where she is, where her children are, what is the immediate priority  she stressed.ldquoDepending on the level of risk, we may had to do several dferent things. It could be that a woman is hiding out at a family member or friendrsquos house, so it might involve the police or social services.Then we try to manage the risk and reduce it as much as possible and then we try and work with out how best to help her move forward and to keep her safe. For the top % of women who come to us, we would hold a Multi-Agency Risk Assessmentconference and then we would work with them on a continuous basis.ldquoHowever, I would like to stress there is no such thing as low level risk of domestic abuse for women because the only person who is in control of whether that risk is high, low or medium is the perpetrator.She is dismissive of abusers where an incident of abuse involves either drink or drugs.ldquoIf you keep terrorising the people that you love and continually use the excuse of alcohol or drugs I donrsquot buy that, said Eileen.ldquoWhat drink and drugs to is give him an excuse for violence. When itrsquos over he will say it was the drink or whatever. But I always say to that isI woke up tomorrow morning to see my partner battered or bruised and he told me I had done it last night with drink in me, would I take a drink again  Yet these guys continue to do it.ldquoThere is no doubt about that we work with traumatised women and children and people try and deal with it in many dferent ways.

People who do not qualy on grounds such as having a sibling will lose out on a place, which is profoundly unfair.The grammar schools themselves, and their supporters, share some blame for the current situation. Aside from a handful of people, such as the academic Dr William Kitchen on these pages , there has been a serious failure to challenge the emotional rhetoric around testing.Northern Ireland needs grammar schools, albeit perhaps a smaller number of them. It also needs outstanding non grammar schools. There should not be a winner-takes-all system.Meanwhile, it is good to hear teachers such as the retired principal Hugh McCarthy, opposite , to the head of St Ronan’s Primary School in Newry, Kevin Donaghy, speak up about what the latter describes as the “disaster” of school closures.We need always to be mindful of that disaster. Instead of thinking in terms of long closures and cancelled summer exams, we need to think in terms of getting pupils back to class as soon as is practicable.• Dr William Kitchen: Grammar schools in Northern Ireland are right to stand by academic selection• Hugh McCarthy: Education is le-changing and it is shameful to deny it to children• Closing NI schools a disaster for children – principal• Dr William Kitchen: Scrapping the transfer test this year could be the end of grammar schools in NI• Ben Lowry: Covid will be used to undermine grammar schools——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

As someone who manages a large freight business I can state categorically that the reality is massively dferent. We are separated from the rest of the UK because we were deemed expendable by the DUPs erstwhile allies in the ERGand their English nationalist Tory cousins.We are being patronised that there are no controls on NI GB movements as though we should be grateful we can trade within our own country without customs.

No amount of spin can ignore these facts that there is a regulatory border down the Irish Sea separating us from Great Britain. Given that these barriers to trade were imposed on us by the Northern Ireland Protocol agreed between the UK government and the EU, it is incumbent on the UK government to activate the appropriate safeguarding measures under Article  of the protocol to protect businesses from the turbulence of obstacles being erected on our biggest trading route.Article  says thatthe application of the protocol leads to “serious economic, societal or environmental dficulties that are liable to persist, or to ersion of trade, the Union or the United Kingdom may unilaterally take appropriate safeguard measures”.• Alderman Mark Cosgrove is the Ulster Unionist Group leader on Antrim and Newtonabbey Borough Council and is the party’s business spokesperson.

Is it beyond us to deliver a project which would have the potential of bringing our people together as well as positively selling Northern Ireland to the wider world I propose that work be commissioned to examine the potential for a regional sports museum to be builtwhere there exists the necessary infrastructure to build such a facility and connect it to local visitors but also for those arriving internationally.\"Another Northern Ireland sporting great Joey DunlopOver the years Northern Ireland and our people have punched well above our weight in terms of sporting success. Whether that be road racing, horse racing and show jumping, golf, athletics, boxing, snooker, rugby, inidual footballers we’ve produced, the talent within Gaelic football and hurling etc.We are also home to other rich sports such as handball, road bowls, rounders and we have a proud history of success and development opportunities for those competing in disability based sports and events.In Joey Dunlop, George Best and Alex Higgins we have arguably the most naturally gted in their respective sports.But there are so many other iconic iniduals and teams who have excelled over the last century, bringing joy and positivity to this place, our people and also helping position Northern Ireland’s place in the world, securing the respect and admiration of others along the way.Such a museum could play host to preserving magical moments like the Dennis Taylor  snooker final black ball finish, Mary Peters heroics on the track, Joey Dunlop and Jonathan Rea on the back of motorcycles, our Golfers winning majors, Ulster Rugby heroics, AP McCoy Champion Jockey, our warriors in the ring and the many special Ulster County and Club performances which saw successes at Ulster Provincial and all-Ireland level etc.So my question is: do our leaders genuinely want to celebrate success and the achievements of the incredible people who make up this place  If so then a golden opportunity to do something about it exists.

Sinn Fein longed for a ‘no deal’ Brexit, the SNP too. Chaos is their natural constituency. Instead, we have ato order after a five-year long national psychodrama.The prime minister is now in ‘levelling up’ mode, just what we need. Interventionism is winning, not free-market mayhem. We can expect to see massive infrastructural investment, and investment support for businesses.Even a new foreign policy is emerging, recognising the importance of new diplomatic networks, as well as new trade deals. We have many friends. A few of them are more precious, and many of them more steady, than some of our immediate neighbours.Sir Keir Starmer has rightly moved on from Brexit to argue for national renewal, saying now is not the time for a second Scottish independence referendum. We must reform the constitution first. He appears unafraid of the word ‘federalism’ in a UK context.Lastly, the present Taoiseach seems reasonable, though the bar was not set high by his predecessor. We can do business with him, but not via his Shared Island Unit, I would suggest.We have done ourselves immense damage since .

He said on Monday night that the empty shelves at Tesco’s huge Knocknagoney store on the outskirts of east Belfast were“noticeable”.Tesco told the News Letter that it had “a good supply of products coming into Northern Ireland” but admitted that “there has been a short delay on certain products”. It said it was working “to get these back on the shelves as quickly as possible and direct customers to alternatives where we can”.In Sainsbury’s large Forestside store in south east Belfast an entire aisle of vegetables was virtually empty and – as revealed by this newspaper yesterday – hundreds of items are disappearing as they sell out and being replaced on an emergency basis by products sourced locally, including own-brand produce from rival supermarket Spar.Read More Read MoreDays after Brexit, many products vanish from Sainsbury’s in Northern Ireland and...To a lesser extent, there were signicant gaps in Marks  Spencer’s Forestsidefood store and in Lidl’s Castlereagh Road store.A spokesman for MS said that they had been well-prepared for Brexit and their stores were “receiving regular deliveries”.\u2028Two months ago MS set up a single “export centre”in Motherwell to handle all of its deliveries to Northern Ireland and the Republic.Asda said that it had“not experienced any issues in getting Asda lorries across the [Irish Sea] border following the end of Brexit transition period” and so “this isn’t the reason for any availability issues”.At the other end of the grocery spectrum, small business Causeway Organic supplied about  households on the north coast with vegetable boxes– until receiving an unexpected message on Monday.Owner Jonathan Owens, who said he had spent months nurturing the business, was forced to email his customers on Monday night to say that his importer had told him “there is an extra layer of red tape they were previously unaware of on top of what I’d already gone through involved in bringing the pallet across into NI”.Last night Mr Owens told the News Letter that he had been forced to suspend his business and would be refunding his customers.He said: “The impression I got from the people helping me in Belfast to manage orders was the [customs] commodity codes was all that was required to get vegetables through ports.”Now as I understand it you need aphytosanitary certicate for each and every item on the pallet, which would potentially double the cost of every item.”Mr Owens said that he was still hopefulthat he could find another supplier, but added: “If it just becomes insurmountable, then bluntlythat’s the end of the business.”He expressed derision for the Secretary of State’s public insistence that “there is no border in the Irish Sea”.He added: “It’s incredibly hard not to be angry.

In , he was a member of a crew of just eight leboat volunteers from across the UK who flew out to aid the relief effort in flood-stricken Mozambique.Together, the team faced the dangers of crocodiles, hippos, poisonous snakes and anti-personnel mines, navigating rivers that had burst their banks, in a rescue mission to bring desperately needed medical relief to , people in villages marooned by flood waters.ldquoWe had five small D class inflatable leboats, and had to ferry doctors and medical supplies to areas that had been written off as impossible, as helicopters couldnrsquot land there and they were inaccessible by road, he said.ldquoIt was so hot that the soles of my boots melted. We had to spend the night on sandbars where we took turns to keep watch, as the crocodiles were very keen to join us.Since he joined the crew, Mike has combined his volunteering with his paid job in the South Wales Fire and Rescue service. He joined the service back in , at just , and progressed from his position as a firefighter, to the lead instructor for recruit training, finally finishing his career in  as Chair of the Water Rescue group, and a member of the servicersquos all Wales flood response team.Over the past four decades, -year-old Mr Kingston has seen huge changes in the way the RNLI operates.He has seen Penarth leboat station move from its original home in the deck chair store underneath the current Coffi Co building on the Esplanade, to its current location just up the road in a purpose built, modern leboat station.ldquoIrsquom sure the people of Penarth will remember the hand held maroons that were fired off by a leboat crew member to call the rest of us to the station for a launch, he said.ldquoBut even before that, I remember when the Pier Master would get us down to the station by firing the maroons out of a small cannon.ldquoNowadays, technology has moved on and we use pagers, mobiles phones and computer systems to respond to a shout.ldquoThese systems are a lot more sophisticated, but itrsquos still the same feeling when yoursquore called out of bed in the early hours of a freezing cold January morning.ldquoNo matter how times have moved on, one thing that remains constant is the unbelievable commitment of the whole RNLI team.ldquoThere have been so many highs and lows over the past  years. As all the team will know, itrsquos good to feel that yoursquore part of a team, giving something to your community.ldquoBut there have also been some sad times when people have lost their lives.

These projected figures are the highest we have ever seen in this County and are likely to reach almost , cases per , in the seven-day period up until Christmas Day.If you compare that with the figure of  cases per , when we entered the local lockdown, you can see how serious the current situation is. We can no longer be complacent.We know from the first and second waves that as case numbers increase, more people get seriously unwell, and we will inevitably see more deaths from Coronavirus - many of which can be avoided,we act now.We are deeply concerned that hospitals and primary care services across Cardf and the Vale of Glamorgan are now under unsustainable pressure due to COVID-, and sadly, but inevitably, the number of people who are becoming very sick is increasing daily.Each and every one of us has a responsibility to act now. We must all follow Welsh Government coronavirus regulations, butyou can also take further actions to protect those you love, then we urge you to do so.We should not meet with anyone outside our household bubble and keep contact with people outside our household to an absolute minimum until the current threat has passed, but especially in the run-up to Christmas.We know that staying away from loved ones will be painful for many, especially at this time of year, butwe do this now, we will be doing everything we can to protect our family and friends for the months to come.We know many people think that the vaccine is going to become more widely available, so everything is going to be okay. Regrettably, that is simply not the case. If we donrsquot change our behaviour now,many people will die before the vaccine is rolled out, people who donrsquot need to die, possibly people who you know.The full roll out of the vaccine will take many months, so now is not the time to be complacent. Very few of us are immune and the virus is still prevalent in our communities and our hospitals. By practising social distancing, washing our hands regularly and wearing face coverings we will all be doing our bit to help.So, our message is simple.Wash your hands regularly oryou canrsquot do that use sanitiser hand gel.Please try and stay at home and only go out for essential reasons andit is essential to go out, please do so in quieter periods.If you do go out, wear a mask when required and keep socially distanced by at least  metres, wherever possible.Please do not mix with other households or your friends.Work from home,you can do so.If you develop symptoms such as a new and continuous cough, a temperature, or a loss of taste or smell please self-isolate with your household and arrange a test.These small steps can really help us all to keep our communities safe.As a Health Board and Council, we are fully mobilised in the fight against COVID-. Doing so continues to be a huge challenge and is one that we will best achieve,we do it together, just as we did in the Spring.We are asking every one of you to achieve this challenge together.Letrsquos stop the spread, and letrsquos keep the Vale of Glamorgan, the NHS and our loved ones safe.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Hospitality businesses would have joined them on pm Christmas Day, with a level four lockdown coming into place on Monday, December . The five day lsquorelaxationrsquo period would have still been in place according to these rules, but a change from three households mixing to two.But on Saturday, December , all this changed as prime minister Boris Johnson held a press conference to update the UK on the rapid spread of the new strain of coronavirus and announcing that the South East of England, including London would be moved into tier four.Tier four means residents must stay at home with some limited exemptions ndash which includes workunable to do so from home, however, working from home is strongly advisedit is possible. Non-essential services must also close. People also must not enter or leave a tier four area.This also saw a change to Englandrsquos Christmas restrictions, with households banned from mixing, apart from single households, which would be allowed to form a bubble to avoid isolation.Areas in the lower tiers were still allowed to continue to mix with up to three households ndash however, only on Christmas Day.So, what did this announcement mean for Wales The announcement by the prime minister was focused specically on England, but it was followed by Walesrsquo first minister making an announcement of his own the same evening. He announced that the tier four lockdown would come into place from midnight on Saturday, December , meaning businesses had a matter of hours to come to terms with the news and people rushed out to do some last-minute Christmas shopping before all the non-essential retail closed.Some of the supermarkets across Wales have now taken their lsquonon-essentialrsquo items off sale.The festive period bubble rule has also changed, with a maximum of two households allowed to mix on Christmas Day.MORE NEWS:Mr Drakeford said in a statement on Saturday evening that the pattern of transmission in London and the South East of England, which is linked to the new iant of coronavirus, is ldquoremarkably consistent with the rapid acceleration of transmission in Wales in recent weeks.Also in the statement, the first minister said that latest evidence had suggested the new strain is present throughout Wales and that it needed an ldquoimmediate response.After meeting with the Welsh Governmentrsquos Cabinet on Saturday and taking into consideration advice from senior medical and scientic advisors, he said: ldquoThe situation is incredibly serious. I cannot overstate this.ldquoWe have therefore reached the dficult decision to bring forward the alert level four restrictions for Wales, in line with the action being taken in London and the South East of England.Dr Chris Williams, incident director for the Novel Coronavirusoutbreak at Public Health Wales said in a statement: ldquoAs indicated by the Welsh Government, the immediate introduction of new restrictions is related to the identication of a new more transmissible iant of Coronavirus. Public Health Wales has been working with UK partners to investigate and respond to this iant.ldquoIt is normal for viruses to undergo mutations, and we expect this to happen. Although the iant is easier to transmit, there is currently no evidence that it is more severe.ldquoWe are reminding people that all current guidance relating to Coronavirus continues to apply to the new iant, including advice relating to symptoms, social distancing, self-isolation, and vaccination.ldquoThe new iant shows up as positive in Public Health Walesrsquo existing Coronavirus tests, and people must continue to seek a test in the usual waythey develop Coronavirus symptoms.ldquoIf you or a member of your household develop a cough, fever or change in sense of taste or smell, you must self-isolate immediately and book a free Coronavirus test by calling .ldquoPublic Health Wales urges everyone to follow the rules, to avoid transmission of Coronavirus and to protect everyone in our communities, including the most vulnerable. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And light does more than create a festive mood mdash light brings hope.ldquoFor Christians, Jesus is lsquothe light of the worldrsquo, but we canrsquot celebrate his birth today in quite the usual way. People of all faiths have been unable to gather as they would wish for their festivals, such as Passover, Easter, Eid and Vaisakhi. But we need le to go on.ldquoLast month, fireworks lit up the sky around Windsor, as Hindus, Sikhs and Jains celebrated Diwali, the festival of lights, providing joyous moments of hope and unity mdash despite social distancing.ldquoRemarkably, a year that has necessarily kept people apart has, in many ways, brought us closer. Across the Commonwealth, my family and I have been inspired by stories of people volunteering in their communities, helping those in need.ldquoIn the United Kingdom and around the world, people have risen magnicently to the challenges of the year, and I am so proud and moved by this quiet, indomitable spirit. To our young people in particular I say thank you for the part you have played.ldquoThis year, we celebrated International Nursesrsquo Day, on the th anniversary of the birth of Florence Nightingale. As with other nursing pioneers like Mary Seacole, Florence Nightingale shone a lamp of hope across the world.ldquoToday, our frontline services still shine that lamp for us ndash supported by the amazing achievements of modern science ndash and we owe them a debt of gratitude.ldquoWe continue to be inspired by the kindness of strangers and draw comfort that ndash even on the darkest nights ndash there is hope in the new dawn.MORE NEWS:Do you know what happened to this poor kitten How Sully came together at Christmas through the power of the artsAll the supermarket opening times over Christmas and New YearldquoJesus touched on this with the parable of the Good Samaritan. The man who is robbed and left at the roadside is saved by someone who did not share his religion or culture. This wonderful story of kindness is still as relevant today.ldquoGood Samaritans have emerged across society showing care and respect for all, regardless of gender, race or background, reminding us that each one of us is special and equal in the eyes of God.ldquoThe teachings of Christ have served as my inner light, as has the sense of purpose we can find in coming together to worship.ldquoIn November, we commemorated another hero ndash though nobody knows his name. The Tomb of the Unknown Warrior isnrsquot a large memorial, but everyone entering Westminster Abbey has to walk around his resting place, honouring this unnamed combatant of the First World War mdash a symbol of selfless duty and ultimate sacrice.ldquoThe Unknown Warrior was not exceptional. Thatrsquos the point. He represents millions like him who throughout our history have put the lives of others above their own, and will be doing so today. For me, this is a source of enduring hope in dficult and unpredictable times.ldquoOf course, for many, this time of year will be tinged with sadness: some mourning the loss of those dear to them, and others missing friends and family members distanced for safety, when all theyrsquod really want for Christmas is a simple hug or a squeeze of the hand.ldquoIf you are among them, you are not alone, and let me assure you of my thoughts and prayers.ldquoThe Bible tells how a star appeared in the sky, its light guiding the shepherds and wise men to the scene of Jesusrsquos birth. Let the light of Christmas mdash the spirit of selflessness, love and above all hope mdash guide us in the times ahead.ldquoIt is in that spirit that I wish you a very happy Christmas. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I get a flu jab every year and I get it at my local pharmacy, itrsquos not complicated.Earlier, vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said % of deaths could be stopped by vaccinating the top nine priority groups laid down by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation .When asked how long it would take to give jabs to those groups, Mr Zahawi said: ldquoIrsquom very hopeful that by the spring we will get through the nine categories.On Tuesday evening, Prime Minister Boris Johnson suggested that regulatory approval of batches of the new Oxford vaccine was a bottleneck stopping more jabs being released to hospitals and GP surgeries.He said a ldquorate-limiting factor was the approval process and this would now be ldquoratcheted up.The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agencysaid it was working quickly while not compromising safety.An MHRA spokesman said: ldquoWe are working closely with the manufacturer, AstraZeneca, to ensure that batches of the vaccine are released as quickly as possible.ldquoBiological medicines such as vaccines are very complex in nature and independent testing, as done by the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, is vital to ensure quality and safety.ldquoNIBSC has scaled up its capacity to ensure that multiple batches can be tested simultaneously, and that this can be done as quickly as possible, without compromising quality and safety.At the same time as the NIBSC tests batches, vaccine manufacturers conduct their own quality tests.Manufacturers then send evidence to the NIBSC in the form of a document called a batch-specic lot release protocol.Meanwhile, the Government has denied reports that a shortage of glass vials for the vaccine is causing any delays.A spokeswoman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: ldquoThere is no shortage of vials for the UK. We have been monitoring the requirements across the supply chain from supplier through to patient for some time.ldquoThere are clear supply chain plans in place for both the supply and onward deployment of all vaccine candidates.ldquoThis includes materials, manufacturing, transport, storage and distribution.AstraZeneca and Pfizer have also both reportedly dismissed suggestions they cannot supply the vaccine fast enough.Oxford Biomedica, the main manufacturer of the ldquoraw vaccine in the UK for the Oxford AstraZeneca jab, has said it is running at full production..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: More than half of population could be vaccinated by late March  u Tony Blair article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
