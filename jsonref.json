But the forum has been criticised over its inaction, and before the May election the government quietly postponed fuel standard improvements for Australian refiners until 1 July 2027, in line with the petroleum industry’s demand.The trade minister, Simon Birmingham, said the issue of Australia’s fuel standards would be considered as part of the bilateral negotiations.“As part of the free trade negotiations we will consider everything that is put on the table. Whether we agree to it is a different matter,” Birmingham told  Australia.“It is not Australian practice to simply adopt European standards – we urge and encourage common adoption of international standards where possible.“But we will work through in a practical way any of these issues and see what may be possible in the Australian context, but ultimately we will only be doing any agreement if it is in the overall benefit of Australia.”On the likelihood that Australia’s commitment to the Paris climate agreement will need to be enshrined in the new FTA, Birmingham said Australia would be happy to comply.“Our commitment to Paris is firm and resolute and we are happy to reinforce that commitment in any forum.”Along with industrial and environmental concerns, Australia and the EU are attempting to negotiate through a host of agricultural barriers, with Australian farmers hoping to gain further access to Europe’s highly protected market.Europe is pushing for Australian action on so-called “geographic indicators”, which would prevent Australian producers using a suite of brand names it deems to be its intellectual property, such as feta, gruyere and gorgonzola.Australian cheesemakers have expressed concern that the proposed ban on product names could require expensive rebranding and cost jobs.Asked about the progress being made on the FTA, negotiations for which began in June 2018, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said it was “complex”.“It is just step by step by step by step,” he said. “But there is a real keenness to engage with Australia.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6479d0a66c842c7dce4cfc50dad5734f2807bff3/0_273_6720_4033/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04cdfe41a80e502ed6ed5b92a0e95e7a","title":"margaret atwood handmaids tale sequel the testaments profile","story":"As excitement mounts for The Testaments, the sequel to The Handmaid’s Tale, we talk to publishers and fellow writers about the great novelistThe hoopla around the launch of Margaret Atwood’s The Testaments is more reminiscent of the unveiling of an iPhone or something Pokémon-related than that of a mere book.

At 8.15pm doors will open to a four-storey Gileadean Glastonbury, featuring guest appearances from actor Romola Garai, activist Caroline Criado-Perez, Guilty Feminist podcaster Deborah Frances-White, plus a discussion of Atwood’s legacy with authors Jeanette Winterson, Elif Shafak, Neil Gaiman and AM Homes.It’s an inventive, slightly surreal programme of events that – like Atwood – is a bit political, a bit geeky, a bit cerebral and unapologetically big on silly hats. It’s the ultimate hashtaggable celebration of a novelist who in the sixth decade of her career, having written more than 50 books of fiction, poetry and criticism, has mastered both Twitter (1.9 million followers) and Instagram (82,300). You know a writer has become a global phenomenon when the support act for their launch event includes two rivals for this year’s Booker prize. Winterson and Shafak’s novels were both longlisted, along with The Testaments, back in July.At 11pm on the night of the launch, the tiny, sprite-like 79-year-old Canadian author will emerge to read the first extracts of a 432-page book that has been kept under the tightest of wraps. Only her closest associates have glimpsed the manuscript – apart from the Booker judges, who have described it as a “terrifying and exhilarating” follow-up to her 1985 novel. Publisher Liz Calder, who was one of Atwood’s longest-standing editors, is on this year’s judging panel. While she’s not allowed to reveal anything about the book’s content, she will say: “It represents not the work of a writer who might be at the end of her career but it’s like her peak, it’s amazing in that sense.”All we know is that The Testaments is set 15 years after the final scene in the first book, in which narrator Offred is hauled into a van by heavies, who might be from the resistance or the regime that extinguished so many of the human freedoms we take for granted. When Atwood leaves the stage at midnight, fans will finally lay their hands on a book many have waited 34 years to read.Atwood’s books have sold millions. She has won the Booker, for The Blind Assassin in 2000, and had five other novels shortlisted. She has yet to be given the Nobel prize for literature but that is widely seen as an error to be righted. When an embarrassed Kazuo Ishiguro was honoured with the award in 2017, he apologised to the Canadian writer: “I always thought it would be Margaret Atwood very soon and I still think that, I still hope that.”While she has been prolific throughout her career, there is little doubt that the Emmy award-winning TV adaptation of The Handmaid’s Tale has helped make Atwood a superstar. It has connected the novelist to a vast new audience fascinated by her vivid nightmare of an America in ecological meltdown and a totalitarian regime that is systematically stripping women of hard-won rights, leaving many as little more than walking wombs. The timing has been crucial. Since the election of President Trump, the novel’s depiction of misogyny and witch-hunts feel chillingly prophetic and the red-cloaked handmaids have become an international symbol of women’s resistance.But even before these developments, the novel had become a modern classic, translated into more than 40 languages, studied in schools and adapted into a film, an opera, a ballet and a graphic novel. “I’m a serious writer,” Atwood once said. “I never expected to become a popular one.”“She couldn’t have seen that The Handmaid’s Tale would do what it did,” Winterson says. “She’s just got on with her work right from the beginning and allowed all this success to happen. But The Testaments has come at the right moment for her as well as us because she’s now a real sage.”Sage she may be but this level of ceremony, cosplay and cult worship – involving no fewer than 120 Waterstones branches – is usually reserved for long-dead authors or Harry Potter. Certainly, the craft sessions and costume competitions celebrating her new novel seem a little kitsch, especially for a writer who delivers such apocalyptic prophecies about environmental havoc, predatory capitalism and overnight assaults on human rights. However, Atwood wouldn’t necessarily see the contradiction:“She always takes herself seriously, but she has a great respect for play and inventiveness,” says her British agent, Karolina Sutton. She recalls an occasion three years ago when she accompanied Atwood to the basement of a King’s Cross pub for the Kitschies, awards that celebrate speculative fiction. The prize was a knitted octopus tentacle, so Atwood insisted they wear homemade orange molluscs on their heads. “That’s what’s unusual about her, to have someone so intellectual who is so playful.”Still, when you’re reading about totalitarianism in The Handmaid’s Tale or man-eating mutants in the Oryx and Crake trilogy or child sexbots in her 2015 novel, The Heart Goes Last, you may relish her wit and verve, but you never lose the eerie feeling that each feature of her dystopias might soon materialise in our own society – if they haven’t already. In recent years, Atwood has been hailed a prophet for creating stories about climate disaster, lab-manufactured meat, the western fertility crisis and human organs grown inside pigs, as well as societies increasingly ruled by misogynistic strongmen, years before they were on most people’s radar.“She’s always before her time. Each novel is about something people become incredibly interested in half an hour later,” says Carmen Callil, founder of Virago Press, the publisher of books by women, who back in the mid-1970s was the first to bring Atwood’s work to a UK readership. When she first met the author over a lunch at Mon Plaisir in Covent Garden, she says she found her so “ferociously clever” that she “exploded my mind”.Atwood is a writer with many gears she can turn out transfixing character studies of Victorian women, poetry about sex between snails, essays on the history of debt and apocalyptic stories about bioengineering. Many novelists only dare to write about technology once it enters the mainstream, but she is interested in it from its inception – and rarely does it feel heavy-handed because it’s never been a chore for her to explore science in her fiction. It’s a quick hop from organ harvesting to sexual intimacy to high farce.Callil says: “There is this tradition of women’s writing that uses irony and lightness of touch to deliver monstrous concepts and beliefs. It’s that ironic voice that has helped her seamlessly move from one generation of reader to the next. That is the test of a great writer.”The Handmaid’s Tale remains Atwood’s most protean novel, with so much to say about how quickly and easily democracy can be dismantled. It remains one of the finest novels ever written on the relationship between sex, power and the social position of women. The novelist Valerie Martin, who was the first person to read it in manuscript, predicted a hit: “I told her: ‘You’re going to be very rich,’” Martin says. “Usually you read speculative fiction and squirm when sex comes up but she really gets how dangerous it is.”Lennie Goodings, publisher of Virago Press, who has known Atwood since the late 1970s, agrees. “I love the sexual politics of her books. She gets sex and I think it’s because she understands power. She’s not a moralising writer but she’s a great observer and very honest. When you read her, you feel enlarged as a human being.”Many novelists have written warnings about a future that come to seem eerily prescient. But Atwood is rare in that she has been around long enough to see systems come and go, witness various waves of feminism – and the reactions against them – and managed to respond in a second book. Such longevity, and depth of experience, is a surely a new experience for a writer.Born in 1939, a few months after the outbreak of the second world war, Atwood spent much of her early years in the wilds of Canada, where her father, Carl, an entomologist, was studying leaf-eating insects. Her childhood was unusual. Her mother, also called Margaret, was a dietician who liked being in the wilds so she didn’t have to do housework. There was no mains electricity and few roads. Atwood – known as Peggy to her family and close friends – and her older brother, Harold (her sister, Ruth, was born later, in 1951), were schooled at home with textbooks that their mother obtained. If they worked through enough pages, they were left to their own devices.This isolated childhood in the wilderness made Atwood fearless and pragmatic. Martin describes how when the family were staying on an island, the writer and her brother “dug a hole for an outhouse and nobody told them to stop so they dug this really, really deep hole. It’s still there, I believe, one of the wonders of the family. She knows how to get along without anything and if you have that knowledge, it makes you not care so much about unimportant things.”By then, she had married the writer Jim Polk, a relationship that ended in orce in 1973. Shortly after, she became involved with novelist and ecological campaigner Graeme Gibson. The couple, who live in Toronto, have been devoted to each other ever since and have one daughter, Jess, born in 1976 and now an art historian who lives in Brooklyn with Atwood’s grandson.Gibson has been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, and also suffers problems with his legs – but friends say he still travels with Atwood. The couple are used to an itinerant lifestyle, often spending several months a year in Norwich (where Atwood writes in local bookshop cafes). Earlier this year, they went on a boat around Australia and New Zealand. However, Gibson’s health may mean Atwood has to reduce the amount of travel she undertakes. “She’s being very brave about it and so is their daughter, Jess,” Martin says. “They’re going to figure out how to deal with it as they go along.”One senses Atwood wants to seize every opportunity for fun. She delights in playing the mischievous granny, dispensing eldritch predictions. During a recent appearance at the Moon festival in Greenwich – one of many eccentric grassroots events she supports – she stood in front of a packed-out theatre and sang the opening of Carl Orff’s Carmina Burana before performing bird calls. Bets are on as to whether she will break into song or cast a spell when she appears at the National Theatre, the night after the midnight launch, to discuss The Testaments for the first time.At the event, which will be livestreamed to more than 1,500 cinemas worldwide, BBC broadcaster Samira Ahmed will chair a Q\u0026ampA session with fans who have tweeted their questions to #askatwood, and actors (including Lily James) will read extracts from the book. Tickets sold out in a day, though 500 UK cinemas will be screening the event, which the organisers claim is comparable to the popularity of a Marvel movie. Atwood may be two months shy of her 80th birthday, but her star is still on the rise, a regular fixture at red-carpet events and in women’s fashion magazines.Martin believes that now that The Handmaid’s Tale has entered popular mythology. “In some ways, the book has been spun away from her,” she says. “Perhaps what’s happening with this new novel is that she’s pulling it back in.”I ask how much control Atwood likes to have. “A lot…” Martin replies, drily, “although not consciously at all. It’s necessary to control things in her world. She pays attention and is very good at understanding market forces and what people respond to.”Such is the iron-clad security around the sequel that predicting its content is a little like writing a horoscope. Atwood has dropped a few breadcrumbs here and there. “Everything you’ve ever asked me about Gilead and its inner workings is the inspiration for this book,” she has said. “Well, almost everything! The other inspiration is the world we’ve been living in.”“That’s part of what The Handmaid’s Tale is about,” Winterson says. “How would we respond to the issue? And we probably will respond in a totalitarian way. When the first big smash hits the west, I’m sure martial law will be introduced. Given that the west has moved so sharply to the right, I can’t imagine it won’t be an excuse for those powers to shut down all the things that have worried them so far. Just as it is at the beginning of The Handmaid’s Tale, when none of the women can get money out of their bank accounts any more.”Novelist Naomi Alderman echoes the point. Atwood mentored Alderman for a year while she developed the concept for her bestselling novel The Power, a sci-fi story about what happens when teenage girls discover they have the power to electrocute others. The part of The Handmaid’s Tale that still unnerves her most is when women are robbed of their financial independence: “How simply it happens, how easily, how convincingly. Just cut off all women’s credit cards and bank cards. Just declare it illegal to employ a woman,” says Alderman. “It’s something that could happen to all of us, without any new technology needing to be invented. All it would take would be a bad government, a war, a stolen election. That possibility is never going away.”Nevertheless, when it comes to the current gender wars, Atwood refuses to stick to a feminist script. She has faced a backlash for calling for due process for a University of British Columbia professor who was accused of sexual misconduct last year. But she has always expressed ambivalence about the feminist tag.Goodings says there is nothing “sloppy” or “sentimental” about her view of women: “She is so much about equality but one thing she always says is that if women are going to be equal to men, we must also see that they do bad things too. There was a school of feminism that felt sisterhood was everything and that if women ruled the world, it would be entirely different, but she doesn’t have much truck with that. She’s pro-women but she doesn’t want to whitewash the truth.”Martin says Atwood isn’t necessarily comfortable with the idea of being a famous feminist. “It’s sad how some people absorb what they find in her work on such a banal level,” she says. “People who dress in costumes and go stand around the street is sad to me. When she talks about power, she’s careful to make clear that the women are in power as well and what we’re talking about is human tendencies, not just male and female tendencies. But obviously the condition of women historically is of interest to her.”Winterson believes Atwood is a “proper feminist” because she has helped champion so many other women – but can understand why she has resisted the term. “It’s the fear of being labelled, just as she resisted the science-fiction label and wanted to call it ‘speculative fiction’. Labels are annoying and usually they are limiting. I used to hate being called a gay writer because I knew damn well it was about patronising men trying to limit the scope of the work.”“No one will influence her choices,” says Karolina Sutton. “She doesn’t chase trends, she’s not interested in following success. If there’s something that interests her about humanity she will write about it.” Sutton, an agent with many big-name authors on her roster, says she has never met anyone as “superhuman” as Atwood. “She’s ahead of everyone in the room… she doesn’t make mistakes. She’ll be asked to write a 3,000-word piece about a subject that’s just thrown at her – on plastics or the Russian revolution. If there’s a phone at hand, she will do it.”Friends say she can be very tough. “I’ve seen her make strong women quail,” says Calder. But they all speak of her generosity. “She’s big-hearted,” Winterson says, “and the older I get, the more important I think that is, to be big-hearted towards life and not worry too much about your own position within it.” Atwood also likes a prank. Alderman says that the day after they first met, she tricked her into thinking she could speak Anglo-Saxon. “It seemed believable! Who was I to say? She got a good laugh out of that one.”Atwood is reportedly in good health and has always been disciplined about her diet. Martin jokes that she is so productive – baking pies, hosting large dinners, knitting sweaters, signing books and lending support to charities and community campaigns – that she must have a secret double chained to a desk in a windowless room in Saskatchewan, maniacally typing her manuscripts. “I’ve spent a lot of time with her, days on end, and I never see her write!” Martin laughs. “I don’t get when she does it! I think she’s made out of space-age plastic or something.”Calder, who was Atwood’s UK editor in the 1980s and 90s, notes that she constantly renews her working methods. She was the first person to use the story-sharing website Wattpad she even invented, with her stepson, a remote book-signing device called the LongPen that allows her to sign books for fans all over the world. Calder also describes how one year, Atwood decided to overhaul the process by which her books were edited, having grown fed up with responding to different editors around the world: she called a summit. “We all trooped to Toronto where she presented us each with the new manuscript which was beautifully tied up with a blue bow. We read solidly for two days without consultation and we didn’t discuss it until we had to put our suggestions to her – it was immensely practical.”The “summits” continue to this day, and often conclude with a snowy walk to her house for supper. In January, a smaller group flew to Toronto, where it was minus 20C, to discuss The Testaments. Sutton says: “It’s an editorial process like no other and she makes it very special for everyone. There’s always more theatre, it’s more creative. But no one can dictate to Margaret Atwood! She will say: ‘Well, everyone wants it to be a different book but it is my book and it is what it is.’”Atwood might joke that “all the books are compensation for being short” but she’s rarely self-deprecating. Goodings says she’s not embarrassed by her power. “She wields it cleverly, I think. She’s still very ambitious.” Without her, the end of the world wouldn’t be half so entertaining.The Testaments is published by Vintage (£20).

Sudanese-Australian writer Yassmin Abdel-Magied walked out of the event midway, later writing in the  that Shriver’s argument – that fiction writers shouldn’t need to seek permission to write on minority cultures – “became a celebration of the unfettered exploitation of the experiences of others, under the guise of fiction”.But on Sunday night, Shriver, speaking to an intimate crowd of 150 at Sydney’s Bookoccino event, said her only regret in the controversy was the way it was reported. Abdel-Magied’s opinion piece sparked an international uproar and debate, with stories in the New York Times and the New Yorker. The Orange prize-winning novelist on Sunday reiterated her arguments from the keynote, warning of the dangers of “a larger cultural cowardice”.Best known for her novel We Need to Talk About Kevin (adapted for film in 2011) and books such as The Post-Birthday World and The Mandibles, Shriver is in Australia to deliver the John Bonython Lecture on Tuesday on the topic of “Creativity in the age of constraint”.Presented by the Centre for Independent Studies, Shriver is expected to cover political correctness, identity politics and the “hypersensitivities of the #MeToo movement”.She will also appear on ABC’s Q\u0026ampA on Monday night where she will be joined by Black Lives Matter activist DeRay Mckesson, dean of the Columbia University school of journalism Steve Coll, and writers Ruby Hamad and Benjamin Law.During the Bookoccino conversation, hosted by journalist Helen McCabe, Shriver expressed her views on “identity”, pointing to a section of her Brisbane writers’ festival speech she thinks caught the least attention in the media storm.She resisted the idea that people should be defined as part of the “groups we’re a member of, and what order we are in the social hierarchy”, saying she doesn’t believe “race, gender or sexual proclivity” are forms of identity. This line of thought led her to penning a controversial essay in the Spectator in 2018, in which she expressed her disagreement with Penguin Random House’s ersity quotas.Shriver also spoke about the #MeToo movement, US and UK politics (including Donald Trump and her pro-Brexit stance) and called upon her fellow fiction writers to follow her lead to speak out against what she sees as anti-democratic restrictions on creativity.“What I find most mysterious is why, given the kind of person that is traditionally attracted to becoming writers – why are more of my colleagues not also having the same response? Basically, it’s a ‘fuck you’ response, and it’s healthy,” she said.She further denounced the notion of “safe spaces”, as well as words as “a form of violence”, saying “cultural appropriation” was “antithetical” to the spirit of fiction.“The ‘identity politics’ crowd seem to have successfully installed an ethos whereby, to subject someone to an opinion which they disagree, is a form of assault. In which case, I am all for assault,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abc50c829604ebeba3f43a4b28c38c467a93e4c4/0_176_3425_2056/master/3425.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ec853dd62b0b345ec25c5e50a06a027","title":"why dont doctors trust women because they dont know much about us","story":"The medical community have known for a century that women are living in constant pain. They’ve done nothing about itIt’s frustrating to have questions that don’t get answered. It’s altogether disturbing to find out that those questions haven’t even been asked.When I was diagnosed with endometriosis at age 23, I didn’t know enough to ask the right questions. I assumed my gynaecologist had all the answers, and listened carefully to his thoughtful explanations. I thought I knew it all. Or at least that he knew it all. But I was wrong.It was only after more than a decade of feeling weak, second-rate, wimpy and writing myself off as a hypochondriac that I started to formulate the questions that needed to be asked. This time the questions weren’t about what was happening to my body. They were about how there could possibly be such a lack of knowledge about a disease that has been in the medical textbooks for more than a century.A century of diagnosis and medical science still has no idea what causes endometriosis or how it works, and we are no closer to a cure. How could this possibly be? And while there are many doctors working in the field who are making a huge difference to the lives of people with endometriosis, there are many more who remain ignorant of the disease, who still push tired old myths about its cures, and who treat people with the disease as hysterical.Not long after I started looking into this I discovered the problem was worse than I even imagined. As I write in my book, Pain and Prejudice, women wait longer for pain medication than men, wait longer to be diagnosed with cancer, are more likely to have their physical symptoms ascribed to mental health issues, are more likely to have their heart disease misdiagnosed or to become disabled after a stroke, and are more likely to suffer illnesses ignored or denied by the medical profession.Most shockingly of all, many women are living in constant pain and don’t know that it’s not normal they don’t appreciate that they don’t have to live like that at all.I discovered that there are 10 chronic pain conditions that predominantly affect women which have very similar symptoms and that once a person has one, they’re more likely to accumulate others. Endometriosis, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, painful bladder syndrome, migraine headache, chronic tension-type headache, temporomandibular joint disorders, chronic lower back pain and vulvodynia affect at least 50 million US women alone.I discovered that some of these pain conditions have a high rate of co-occurrence with autoimmune conditions including rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, Sjogren’s syndrome and thyroid diseases.You know what else I discovered? That these conditions are all beset by delayed diagnosis that a high proportion of women and gender-erse people eventually diagnosed with these conditions will first be told they have a mental health condition, or are too concerned about their health.You know what else I discovered? That many of these conditions can be well-managed if caught early.Why are women still being treated as hysterical, overly emotional, anxious and unreliable witnesses to their own wellbeing?Why do doctors still treat their patients who are female, people of colour or gender-erse differently to their white male patients?Why don’t they trust us?The answer turns out to be quite simple. They don’t really know much about us.As Dr Janine Austin Clayton, the director of the US Office of Research on Women’s Health, told the New York Times: “We literally know less about every aspect of female biology compared to male biology.”To find out why that is, I had to travel back centuries. From the beginning of medicine, woman’s difference to man has marked her as inferior. In ancient times, it was the womb – the most obvious point of difference – that was thought to be the corrupting force, causing all manner of ills experienced by women. Plato characterised the womb as a voracious animal wandering the female body and sucking its life force. In the early modern era, medicine switched its attention to the nervous system, blaming illness among women on “weak nerves”. In the early 20th century, when the endocrine system was discovered, raging hormones became the chief source of blame, intermittent with our corrupted mental states.All manner of biological theories have been used to justify women’s subordination to men. At the heart of most of them is the idea that women’s reproductive processes – menstruation, pregnancy, breastfeeding and menopause – consume so much energy that attention paid to any other pursuit would simply strip away their femininity, and the fulfilment of their ultimate purpose: to be good wives and mothers.All too often supposed cures involved punishment, intended to turn a “difficult” woman into a “good” one. Clitorises were cut off, wombs and ovaries removed, forced feeding and “rest” were prescribed. Leeches were attached to labia and cervixes, and psychological cruelty was inflicted in the name of restoring health and dignity.But none of these cures were proven, and most of the causes were entirely theoretical – because women have rarely been studied in detail by medical science. You just need to look at a textbook to see that the default human is a slender white man, and any difference has always been considered a deficit: uninteresting and not worthy of scientific pursuit.Eight of the 10 prescription drugs taken off the market by the US Food and Drug Administration between 1997 and 2000 owing to severe adverse effects caused greater health risks in women than men. A 2018 study found this was a result of “serious male biases in basic, preclinical, and clinical research”.Making matters worse, medical students are never taught about this knowledge bias. It just doesn’t come up in medical schools that almost everything we know about human biology comes from the study of men. And maybe, just maybe, the women crowding their waiting rooms – the women who they can’t help – are there not because they’re hysterical or making it up or like being sick or want the attention, but because they are sick and in pain, and medical science has no answers for them.The astonishing lack of curiosity about female illness is hidden by the great strides that have been taken in breast cancer and obstetrics. These areas of medicine are not without their problems but there is no doubt advancements in these fields have saved millions of lives.But women are more than reproductive machines.And, while women who live in chronic pain aren’t dying horrible deaths in the prime of their lives – like those who died in such large numbers in childbirth or from breast cancer – evidence shows that chronic pain does lead to anxiety, depression and suicide. For many others, it keeps them at home and out of the workforce, unable to fully take part in life.I wrote this book because too many women are in pain, and that pain is not taken seriously. It is at once expected and denied. This deprives us of our full humanity. We deserve better.• Pain and Prejudice by Gabrielle Jackson is published in Australia on 3 September (Allen and Unwin, $29.99), and in the UK on 14 November (Little, Brown, £13.99)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5934595e9b5026b4cd40aee0957bbdbc66ffee75/0_356_7175_4305/master/7175.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7710ad5af4ff2c038fef62573d9ecaab","title":"we want wow factor oxfam to open first charity superstore","story":"Outlet in Oxford industrial park, including on-site cafe, is aimed at turning perceptions on their headOxfam is to open its first superstore on the outskirts of Oxford in an experiment aimed at turning perceptions of charity shopping as outdated on their head.On the edge of a sprawling business park off a ringroad to the south-east of the city, a squad of 20-plus staff and volunteers have been busy sorting through new merchandise and donations to stock the shop in readiness for its opening on 7 September.Inside the entrance of the hangar-style industrial unit, about 12 times the size of the average Oxfam shop, a lengthy wall of display units is filled with products from its eco-friendly Sourced by Oxfam range including Fairtrade chocolate and coffee, bamboo coffee cups and lunchboxes and packs of Christmas cards.Everything else is very different in the vast and airy space, which the charity wants to be more than just a shop. “Our aim is for this to be an enjoyable and fun ‘destination’ shopping experience,” says Oxfam’s trading director, Andrew Horton. “Customers will be able to shop ethically, but we want this new store to have the wow factor. We want people to linger, to chat over coffee. We have a 10-year lease on this unit and if it is successful we will roll it out in other locations.”The space includes the first on-site cafe, which will serve a changing menu of “world foods” as well as tea and coffee. “The cafe will be at the heart of a new community space where we will host free talks and events for school groups, for example,” Horton said. Oxford is, of course, where the charity was founded more than 75 years ago and the first Oxfam shop opened its doors there in 1948. It now has 610 shops in the UK, and a growing online operation, but logistics can be tricky in its shops in towns and city centres, where there is also intense competition among charity shops on the high street. The pilot superstore was inspired by the Swedish children’s charity Erikshjalpen,  which created a larger-format store in an accessible location and not on a conventional retail park.The Oxfam superstore’s neighbours include a Premier Inn and a David Lloyd fitness centre. “We decided that opening on a retail park would be a challenge – coping with typical opening hours of 10am to 8pm was going to be a tough ask in terms of staffing,” Horton said. “This suits us better and we will only open four days a week.”A drive-in donation point at the rear of the shop is intended to make it easier for people to donate larger items and in bulk. Among other new ideas being tested are a “market stall” area with 12 booths for local ethical B Corps, lending libraries for electrical goods and others. Oxfam will also sell secondhand white goods for the first time, with a one-year warranty, through the local company Rework.Oxfam has also emerged as an unlikely rising star on the UK’s fast-growing online fashion scene as it casts an increasingly canny eye over branded cast-offs and vintage styles handed in to its shops every day. There is a large mezzanine area in the new superstore devoted to online sales, where Oxfam will photograph high-value vintage fashion items, sought-after homeware and books and post them on Pinterest and other social media.Oxfam’s operations manager, Emma Joy, says: “We take the view that people who donate want us to try and raise as much money as we can. Recently we received a brand new 1984 Sony Walkman still in its box which we sold online for £1,000.”Cancer Research UK reopened its redesigned premium store on London’s Marylebone High Street in January, offering brands such as Chanel, Fendi, Gucci and Celine in an effort to upgrade the charity shopping experience. Barnardo’s has also given its homeware sections a modern makeover.Amid the high street doom and gloom, UK charity shops have boosted UK retail sales, but Horton says Oxfam’s priority is to boost donations and the size of its volunteer workforce.The national volunteer workforce is currently around 23,000 strong, and he is building a pool of 150 for the new store. Among them is Rosemary Shurgold, a retired health visitor who has volunteered at Oxfam’s Cowley Road shop for 12 years. “I love Oxfam and I absolutely love this new store,” she smiles. “You’d have to pay me to stay away.”• Sign up to the daily Business Today email here or follow  Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76ac1bd05bf4f80b984bb128c95721d5672d7965/0_352_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b2e7b6b942ff5f28bd2752ae180e4bd","title":"term starting english schools arts emergency subjects","story":"A new school year is about to begin. This means that I might soon arrive at a school and do a poetry workshop with some younger teenagers. It could well go like this. They make it clear that they don’t like poetry. I tell them poetry comes in hundreds of different shapes, sizes, rhythms and moods one way we can make poems is in a group and without writing anything down. For example, the people who are in charge of us in life have ways of showing they are fed up with us, angry with us, or through which they try to control us punish us, even. What do such people say? I suggest they go into pairs and say these kinds of things to each other – in role, as parents, teachers, carers. We select the best lines. Then I say, can we create this into a scene? They suggest that all the lines should be said to just one of them sitting in a chair the rest stand in a semicircle around him, and as they each say their line they point at the boy in the chair and then step back, while the semicircle repeats a chosen chorus.We have made a snapshot of one aspect of their lives. It has rhythm, structure, solo and chorus, movement and mimesis. Later they can perform it for others, write a transcript of it and “publish” it on a school blog. We can talk about what we have made: what worked? Was it like any other poems or plays?This is the arts in action. There should be a place for it in all schools, but it is becoming desperately difficult to find the time, staffing or resources to make it happen.Why? Because school means choices, and there are competing ideas about what school is for. The position firmly in place now in England, thanks largely to the influence of Michael Gove during his time as education secretary, is that our schools should focus their attention on producing units of sellable labour power (school leavers), and these units should be seen as being more or less able to compete in what ministers call the global labour market there is an agreed amount of knowledge that needs to be transferred from teachers to pupils so that they can become these competitive units. Capacity to compete has to be measured by putting in place tests at key moments throughout a person’s school life so that by the end, school will disgorge a graded set of units – some of whom have this knowledge, and about a third of whom do not.There is another way. The world is becoming increasingly changeable and unpredictable, so why should education make the knowledge being passed on so finite and certain why ide all of it into measurable units? And why ask education to jump to the economic system’s demands and solve its woes? Doesn’t the new world of climate change, automation, fake news and global digital communication make it necessary for young people to be more flexible, interpretive, critical and creative? Why has so much been added to the curriculum, with the consequence that the GCSE course in many schools has lengthened to three years plus much more homework, reducing time for the arts and cutting down on scope for teachers to devise courses and materials away from what’s required in national exams? There should be room in education for schooling to be more responsive to events, more focused on varying interpretations and more able to create artistic and technological responses to the world as it changes. There should be more time both in and outside of lessons for students to follow personal and cultural interests.All this requires the delivery of knowledge – plenty of it – but in ways that ask students to do things with that knowledge rather than to just absorb it. Some of this knowledge may be difficult or even impossible to measure, but so be it. The arts investigate the properties of the world by playing with materials – such as stone, paint, fabric, synthetic substances, the human body, the human voice and of course language. They investigate the mind’s responses to the material world and to other people, past and present, and to how we organise ourselves into societies, institutions and groups. The arts always involve change and transformation. In the process of making something – a dance, a film, a song, a textile design, whatever – we change “stuff” in order to create something new. In changing stuff, we change ourselves.This is fun. It’s absorbing. It’s emotional. It touches us and moves us. It’s social: in doing the arts we find out what we need from each other. But it’s also about survival – surviving as iniduals, as groups, but also as the human race. It may not be a sufficient means to keep barbarism and despoliation of the planet at bay, but I believe it is a necessary condition for this, because the arts keep coming back to the question: what is the “us-ness” of us? It’s about time the arts had a guaranteed place in schools and the way they enhance students’ lives was properly recognised.• Michael Rosen is a writer and broadcaster, and a former children’s laureate"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17317bc121791e9f875968656d03cc2545e32880/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23869e4240d0a1f8b871cf612a026aa5","title":"observer guide autumn culture books art films tv theatre classical music dance","story":"Long-awaited albums, audacious political theatre and TV fit to follow Game of Thrones, plus film, dance, classical and more… our critics preview the new seasonYou know Oscar season is approaching when the weather gets chillier and the options at the cinema get a little more literary – and so autumn duly brings two star-laden adaptations of major modern American novels.First comes The Goldfinch on 27 September: Donna Tartt’s epic Pulitzer prize-winner sprawls in a way some pundits thought more suited to a TV miniseries, but building on the Oscar-nominated success of Brooklyn, director John Crowley is tackling it for the big screen, with Ansel Elgort heading the cast as semi-orphaned wanderer Theo Decker, and Nicole Kidman ideally cast as Mrs Barbour.On 30 November, Jonathan Lethem’s celebrated detective odyssey Motherless Brooklyn hits cinemas courtesy of director and star Edward Norton – venturing behind the camera for the first time in 19 years.Both are challenging projects: will they do their source material justice? Meanwhile, you have some catch-up time if you haven’t read either novel – otherwise how can you say “the book was better” with any kind of airy authority? Guy LodgeAny UK tour by Ariana Grande will always be emotional. Fresh off a run of August London dates and a special performance in Manchester for Pride, the singer now takes her huge album of last year, Sweetener, around the rest of the UK she’s recently added a further two London dates at the end of October.Our own Charli XCX, meanwhile, wondered whether she would ever release another album proper. But after five years of innovative mixtapes and arresting standalone singles comes a full-on studio effort – Charli – on 13 September, studded with guests as erse as Christine and the Queens, bedroom pop auteur Clairo and self-styled queen of New Orleans “bounce”, Big Freedia.Charli’s former tour mate, candid US singer Halsey, has hinted – in a mocked-up mugshot in the video for her track Nightmare in May – at an October release date for her own “loud” third album, widely expected to be called Manic. Halsey has described the writing process as one of “learning to forgive myself”. Kitty EmpireSince Game of Thrones slayed the world – let’s forget that damp squib of a final series – the fantasy genre is back in televisual vogue. Screenwriters have been raiding the bookshelves for similar sagas to adapt and the first wave of Westeros-influenced series arrive this autumn.Most promising, though, is the BBC and HBO’s ambitious adaptation of Philip Pullman’s His Dark Materials trilogy. With a cast led by James McAvoy, Ruth Wilson, Lin-Manuel Miranda and, of course, an armoured CGI polar bear, confidence in its success is so high that a second series is already commissioned. George RR who? Michael HoganAfter her triumphs with Enron and The Effect, dramatist Lucy Prebble turns her unswerving gaze on the death of Alexander Litvinenko. Based on the book by the ’s Moscow correspondent Luke Harding, A Very Expensive Poison considers how in 2006 the Russian spy, MI6 informant and Putin critic died of radiation poisoning after drinking a cup of green tea in a central London hotel. The play is at the Old Vic until 5 October: John Crowley directs Tom Brooke and MyAnna Buring play the Litvinenkos, Reece Shearsmith is Putin. Susannah ClappKen Loach brings the same scalding anger to the gig economy in Sorry We Missed You as he did to the benefits system with I, Daniel Blake. And, in Newcastle upon Tyne, the films also share the same location. This portrait of a family strained to breaking point by a treadmill of hard graft and mounting debt is superbly acted and unwavering in its focus. The deliberate pacing and edgy, restless camera give the story a cruel momentum and sense of the walls closing in on a hapless delivery driver who just wants to do well by his kids. Wendy IdeDid Helen really exist? Did the most beautiful woman in the world actually provoke the destruction of one of the greatest cities of all time? And why are there so many different versions of the story, from Homer to Shakespeare to Hollywood? This magnificent show plunges us deep into the myth and the reality, bringing alive the captivating characters of this ancient civilisation through sculptures, paintings, vases and fragments of literature, proving that there was a real Troy, and revealing its fate. From 21 November to 8 March. Laura CummingWe are quite possibly in UK rap’s golden age, and autumn’s live shows epitomise that. Two of this year’s Mercury prize nominees, the powerful Little Simz and raucous Slowthai, are both touring the country, as is one of Afroswing’s finest, MoStack, riding high off his debut LP. Ladbroke Grove star AJ Tracey will be playing Ally Pally, while Charlie Sloth’s infamous Fire in the Booth show will be getting a September live edition with a first-time festival in Sheffield (with the somewhat dubious title of Fire in the Park), featuring the likes of Giggs and Yxng Bane. Grime don Skepta is heading up a phenomenal Warehouse Project line-up in November (rising stars Octavian and Flohio are among others playing that day). Finally, the release of Kano’s Class of Deja has arguably been the biggest grime moment of the year (second only to Stormzy at Glastonbury) – accordingly, Kano’s tour this October is a must, culminating in a show at the Royal Albert Hall. Tara JoshiBen Lerner’s third novel, The Topeka School (3 October), is an education in the sympathetic imagination, a deep and bracing intellectual challenge, a powerful political statement. As usual, Lerner plays winningly in the fertile ground between fiction and memoir, as usual he is often hilarious and occasionally infuriating. Wider-reaching, subtler and kinder than his earlier works, this is a novel to cherish.We return to Gilead in another Booker-longlisted novel, Margaret Atwood’s The Testaments (10 September) which carries powerful messages for the #MeToo generation. It’s striking that this novel is published just before another highly anticipated book, She Said by Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, the journalists who broke the Harvey Weinstein scandal. Both should be required reading.Zadie Smith’s short stories are predictably luminous, insightful and full of glorious prose. It’s hard to believe that Grand Union (3 October) is her first collection, drawing as it does on more than a decade of writing for the New Yorker. She’s already one of our best novelists and essayists this reminds us that her short stories are right up there too.Jonathan Safran Foer is always fascinating on the subject of vegetarianism – his Eating Animals persuaded me to (almost) give up meat. We Are the Weather (10 October) shows the clear link between industrialised animal farming and climate breakdown in a book of scintillating relevance and authority.In these times of political turbulence and an increasingly rabid and scrofulous commentariat, the sanity, wisdom and clarity of Rebecca Solnit’s writing is a forceful corrective. Whose Story Is This? (5 September) is a scorchingly intelligent collection about the struggle to control narratives in the internet age. Alex PrestonTwo of the UK’s most accomplished satirists, Chris Morris and Armando Iannucci, both launch films this autumn. But the pair, who previously collaborated on the TV series The Day Today, take markedly erging approaches with their respective projects. Morris, who skewered Islamist terrorism in Four Lions, turns his focus on the US law enforcement agencies that manufacture threats in order to justify department funding. The anger in The Day Shall Come is to be expected the stab of poignancy comes as a surprise. Iannucci, meanwhile, has left his habitual political arena (Veep, In the Loop, The Death of Stalin) and adapted Dickens’s David Copperfield. The Personal History of David Copperfield stars Dev Patel in the title role and opens the London film festival. WIMargate expanded as a centre for art with the opening of the Carl Freedman Gallery in the old Thanet Press building, next to Tracey Emin’s studio, in May. Its second exhibition, Gossamer, curated by Zoe Budeaux, brings together 22 artists – including Uday, Louise Bourgeois and Sarah Lucas – who work with tights or stockings, and will open on 28 September. Also from 28 September, actor and art collector Russell Tovey curates Margate NOW, a town-wide festival of music, art and drama, including events in unexpected places from the railway station to the shore. And all of this accompanies the opening of the Turner prize show at Turner Margate (28 September) with one of the strongest shortlists in many years, bringing together Lawrence Abu Hamdan, Helen Cammock, Tai Shani and Oscar Murillo. LCAnticipation around Martin Scorsese’s plan to dramatise the real-life story of mob hitman Frank “The Irishman” Sheeran, who was involved in the notorious disappearance of labour union leader Jimmy Hoffa in 1975, has been cranking up for years. Now it’s finally hitting cinemas on 8 November, with Robert De Niro as Sheeran and Al Pacino as Hoffa – but with only a brief window before it streams on Netflix on 27 November. This is familiar ground for Scorsese but the pedigree is high: Steven Zaillian (Schindler’s List) wrote the script and Joe Pesci, Harvey Keitel and Anna Paquin co-star. Killian FoxBritish ballet promises some intriguing major debuts by dancers. The Royal Ballet’s Marcelino Sambé marks his recent promotion to principal dancer by reprising his raffish Lescaut for Kenneth MacMillan’s Manon, opening at Covent Garden in October, before taking a lead role as Franz in Coppélia on 28 December. Expect buoyant technique and giddy charisma from this young ace.Northern Ballet’s Antoinette Brooks-Daw is moving into the company’s top rank following rich turns in Cathy Marston’s Jane Eyre and Victoria. Catch her displaying her narrative chops in Morgann Runacre-Temple’s Kingdom of Back – part of a new mixed bill along with David Nixon’s Dracula (Leeds, Doncaster and Canterbury, SeptemberOctober).And then there’s former Washington Ballet star Brooklyn Mack who joins English National Ballet as a guest artist. Fresh from a well-received stint at American Ballet Theatre, he has roles in Christopher Wheeldon’s Cinderella (Manchester, Southampton, October) and Anna‑Marie Holmes’s Le Corsaire (Milton Keynes, November). Sara VealeTwo starkly different views of the capital arrive on the streaming service this autumn. In a period of flux for the real royal family, it seems timely for sumptuous biopic The Crown to return with a fresh cast. Oscar-winner Olivia Colman succeeds Claire Foy as the Queen, with Tobias Menzies as Prince Phillip and, deliciously, Helen Bonham Carter as Princess Margaret. Covering the period from 1964 to 1976, it glides majestically on to Netflix on 17 November.The other comeback is more surprising but entirely welcome. Top Boy, writer Ronan Bennett’s down-and-dirty thriller about Hackney drug gangs, was bafflingly axed by Channel 4 six years ago. Now it’s been revived on Netflix with the backing of Canadian superstar Drake. The reboot, which drops on 13 September, sees Dushane (Ashley Walters) and Sully (Kane “Kano” Robinson) return from exile to reclaim their territory, only to find an ambitious new generation are now running things. Rappers Little Simz and Dave join the cast, alongside exciting new discovery Micheal Ward. (See feature on page 20.) MHAway from the superhero glut of summer, autumn has become the new season for more grown-up sci-fi escapism: recently Interstellar, Arrival and Blade Runner 2049 all opted for the cooler months. The biggest-budget project yet from American auteur James Gray (revered in France, underrated everywhere else), Ad Astra stars Brad Pitt as an astronaut venturing deep into the solar system in search of his father it premieres in competition at the Venice film festival and opens shortly after, on 18 September.Unpredictable as ever, two-time Oscar-winner Ang Lee (Brokeback Mountain, Life of Pi) returns with Gemini Man (in cinemas 11 October), a high-concept, hi-tech thriller with Will Smith as a hitman pursuing his younger self – it sounds a bit derivative of Rian Johnson’s Looper, but in Lee we trust.If Hollywood fantasy doesn’t do it for you, seek out Aniara (out now, reviewed page 32), a fascinating, meditative Swedish mission to Mars. In this version of space, no one can hear you scream, but at least you can hear yourself think. GLA decade on since landfill indie seemed to consign guitar music to the dustbin of history, a new wave of innovative, boundary-pushing releases is on its way to expand the genre’s horizons. Erstwhile Sexwitch vocalist Bat for Lashes embraces a dreamy 80s vibe on her forthcoming album Lost Girls (AWAL, 6 September): saxophone solos, arpeggiated synths and lyrics about female vampire biker gangs feature.Alabama Shakes frontwoman Brittany Howard releases her debut solo album, Jaime (Columbia, 20 September). Dedicated to her sister, who died of cancer when they were teens, it has a tender, expansive sound, encompassing soulful ruminations on love, spirituality, and growing up as a mixed-race child in the deep south.Angel Olsen follows up 2016’s excellent My Woman with the magisterial yet delicate All Mirrors (Jagjaguwar, 4 October), preceded by a mesmerising new single of the same name with a cinematic black-and-white video.Finally, Michael Kiwanuka’s meditative, assured third album Kiwanuka (Polydor, 25 October) s psych-gospel, politics and self-acceptance, as well as nodding to his Ugandan heritage. Kathryn BromwichTate Britain is gathering new momentum this year, after the success of Van Gogh and Britain and Mike Nelson’s elegiac Duveen Commission. Huge crowds are anticipated for its autumn exhibitions. These include William Blake, from 11 September, which doesn’t focus on one particular area so much as the all-embracing originality of his vision, entering his mind through the works, and recreating the tiny room where they were made. Two Turner prizewinners follow: Mark Leckey (from 24 September) builds a life-size replica of a motorway bridge on the Wirral, where he grew up, as the scene for new video and audio works. And Steve McQueen brings his mass portrait of 70,000 primary school children to the museum: the nation’s future, from 12 November. LCWritten for the Venice carnival season, Handel’s early-career gem Agrippina, about one woman’s lust for power, and rivalry in love, is staged for the Royal Opera House by the director of the moment, Barrie Kosky, with a glittering lineup led by American mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato, British countertenor Iestyn Davies and British soprano Lucy Crowe. Packed with explosive music and showpiece arias, this is a story for our times, of leadership and failed diplomacy. The Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment and cast are conducted by the Handel specialist and harpsichordist Maxim Emelyanychev. Fiona MaddocksNot one, not two, but four short new works by our greatest living dramatist have landed, fully formed, in the Royal Court’s lap, and are being staged in one quadruple bill. Which is basically Christmas come early for theatre fans. As usual with the publicity-averse Churchill, there’s not much known about them yet, but Glass is reportedly about a girl made of glass, Kill deals with gods and murderers, Bluebeard tackles a serial killer’s friends, and Imp concerns a secret in a bottle. James Macdonald, with whom Churchill worked on Escaped Alone, directs the lot for a limited three-week run (18 September to 12 October). Holly WilliamsOn his 2017 album Peasant, Richard Dawson harked back to early medieval England to chronicle a nation at war with itself. No need for distant historical allegories on his latest record 2020 (Weird World, 11 October), which is less a snapshot of contemporary Britain than a full-scale narrative immersion. The Newcastle folk-rocker, whose interests extend to Sufi devotional music and beyond, tells first-person stories of ordinary Englanders trapped in an increasingly cruel system, which sucks their souls dry for profit. Listening to civil servants unravelling at the thought of depriving yet another poor soul of their disability living allowance may sound like hard going, but 2020 is funny, freaky and unexpectedly melodic as well as desperately moving – you won’t hear a better song about the hell of working in Amazon-style distribution warehouses than Dawson’s 10-minute Fulfilment Centre. KFIt’s farewell to Sarah Frankcom, who’s been a brilliant head of the Manchester Royal Exchange – but she should go out with a bang with Light Falls (from 24 October). A new play by Simon Stephens is always an event, but even more exciting is the man doing the music: one Jarvis Cocker. Light Falls connects five relatives living in cities across the north, and looks at how they’re drawn together after a devastating event. More cheerful, perhaps, will be The Boy in the Dress – the RSC’s new musical version of David Walliams’s children’s book, with songs by Robbie Williams and Guy Chambers. The story of Dennis, a 12-year-old who likes football and dresses, is adapted by Mark Ravenhill, and opens 8 November. HWENO’s ambitious season explores the Orpheus myth – the grief-stricken hero tries to rescue his lover from the Underworld – with four operas from the 18th century to the present. Directed by the choreographer Wayne McGregor in his ENO directorial debut, Gluck’s Orpheus and Eurydice stars Alice Coote and Sarah Tynan Harry Bicket conducts. Offenbach’s comic Orpheus in the Underworld is one long, naughty, can-can dancing party. Ed Lyon and Mary Bevan head the cast. Sian Edwards conducts, Emma Rice directs. The unmissable rarities are Harrison Birtwistle’s ritualistic masterpiece The Mask of Orpheus, director Daniel Kramer, conductor Martyn Brabbins and Philip Glass’s Orphée, inspired by Cocteau director Netia Jones, conductor Geoffrey Paterson. Discounts if you book the series. FMYou might think we’ve no shortage of Ibsen – but two new productions look to be bold, essential reimaginings. Hedda Tesman is by Cordelia Lynn (whose Three Sisters has recently been at the Almeida), and promises to breathe new life into Ibsen’s classic, Hedda Gabler, for touring company Headlong. Haydn Gwynne stars in the title role (Chichester Festival theatre, 30 August-28 September the Lowry, Salford 3-19 October). A new version of A Doll’s House, written by Tanika Gupta – who moves the action to Calcutta and invites us to look at the play’s gender politics through the lens of British colonialism – opens at the Lyric Hammersmith on 6 September. It’s the first production by the west London theatre’s new artistic director, Rachel O’Riordan, and stars the captivating Anjana Vasan. HWGentlemen, start your engines because Mama Ru is strutting, sashaying and shantaying our way. After becoming a global phenomenon over the past decade, the long-awaited UK edition of RuPaul’s Drag Race launches on BBC Three in October, with 10 home-grown acts competing to be crowned “the Queen of Great Britain”. Guest judges include Graham Norton, Maisie Williams, Cheryl, Alan Carr, Stacey Dooley, Andrew Garfield, Michaela Coel, Lorraine Kelly and Twiggy, alongside stalwart Michelle Visage. Self-empowering positivity and upbeat bubblegum camp have rarely been more needed. They better werk. MHLondon’s annual Open House weekend (21-22 September) always delivers an embarrassment of architectural riches, providing free access to more than 800 buildings usually off limits to the public, accompanied by a programme of tours and talks. Where else can you take in Lambeth Palace and the Marx Memorial Library in a single weekend? Marking the centenary of the Addison Act, which made “housing for all” a government policy, some of London’s key postwar housing schemes will also open their doors for the first time. They include Alexandra Road in Camden, the Golden Lane Estate and Ernö Goldfinger’s twin monuments to brutalism, Trellick Tower and Balfron Tower. Other London landmarks, such as the BT Tower and 10 Downing Street, will be available to visit by online ballot. Catherine SlessorBranden Jacob-Jenkins – who has had hits here with An Octoroon and Gloria – brings his 2014 play Appropriate to the Donmar until 5 October (see review, page 40). The Lafayette family return to their late father’s house, a former plantation in Arkansas – and this, being a Jacob-Jenkins play, is a slanted, subversive take on the classic American family drama. It’s directed by Ola Ince (The Convert), and stars Monica Dolan.There’s more family feuding in Fairview – which won Jackie Sibblies Drury this year’s Pulitzer prize for drama, and which promises to rip the genre to shreds. At London’s Young Vic from 28 November, directed by Nadia Latif, this race drama should provoke, unsettle and dazzle audiences here too. Annie Baker is back at the National Theatre – which staged her hugely acclaimed plays John and The Flick – with The Antipodes, in which people sit around a table, telling, examining, and categorising stories. Intriguingly, Baker herself co-directs with Chloe Lamford, who is also designing the show (21 October-23 November).

Since 2000, in fact, when he and Matthew Holness created spoof horror author Garth Marenghi, who’d transition from Edinburgh stage to Channel 4 show (all the while penning books like Afterbirth, in which a mutated placenta attacks Bristol, and Black Fang, which asks the question: what if a rat could drive a bus?)Ever since, Ayoade has appeared in everything from The Mighty Boosh (as the belligerent shaman Saboo) to Danger Mouse (an evil snowman). He has presented every TV show, from the rebooted The Crystal Maze to his celebrity adventures on Travel Man. He has also directed everything from music videos (for bands like Arctic Monkeys, Radiohead and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs) to feature films (his 2011 debut Submarine and a film of Dostoevsky’s The Double in 2014). And now the pinnacle of his career: joining us for a webchat on Thursday 5 September at 12pm BST.His latest project is a book called Ayoade On Top, a sort-of-memoir-cum-ode to the film Gwyneth Paltrow once called the worst she’s ever been in: View From the Top, in which Ayoade argues for the canonisation of “this brutal masterpiece”.

A school is forced to become an academy if it is “eligible for intervention” under law. The order is triggered by a school being classed as inadequate by Ofsted. Previously it could also be triggered by poor performances in exams but that condition was dropped by the education secretary, Damian Hinds, in 2018.Do parents get any say in the matter?No. Governing bodies, parents and councils get no input in the DfE’s intervention to force academisation. They also have no say in which trust the school is forced to join, meaning the chain may be based hundreds of miles away. Critics say this is a derogation of local democracy.What happens to the school?The school’s legal relationship becomes a contract between the trust that manages it and the DfE, cutting ties with local authorities. The school’s land and buildings are effectively leased to the trust. Head teachers are stripped of their autonomy, with budget and staffing decisions made by the trust. In most cases the school’s existing leadership is dismissed. The school’s governors lose legal responsibilities, and there is no requirement for trusts to consult with parents. Often the school is renamed and a new uniform adopted. The trust retains a proportion of the school’s funding for its administration and executive costs.There is little evidence either way. Previously, three-quarters of schools rated as inadequate by Ofsted later improved without forced academisation. The National Audit Office has concluded there is a lack of capable Mats able to improve schools in difficulty.The increased pay and pension contributions form part of the £14bn in education spending announced by Williamson and Boris Johnson last week, with most of the increase directed towards core school funding.Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the pay increases for new teachers were “desperately needed” to improve recruitment.“At present, the government is missing its recruitment targets every year, and a third of new teachers leave the profession before they’ve completed five years’ service,” he said. “That’s a crazy situation that needs an immediate remedy.”The DfE said Williamson would also ask the STRB to look at the way teachers qualify for salary increases, including the use of progression pay points. “Progression will continue to be linked to performance ensuring the investment best supports the recruitment and retention,” the DfE said.Mary Bousted, the National Education Union’s joint general secretary, said the government was admitting it was “bonkers” for each school to set its own pay policies.“The NEU wants the government to go further and reinstate statutory progression pay points, in negotiation with teacher unions, so the pay system is transparent, open and fair and so that proper incentives are put in place for experienced teachers to stay in teaching,” Bousted said.The DfE will also introduce a programme of “ambassador schools” to champion flexible working for teachers.“We know that the lack of flexible working opportunities is often cited as a reason for leaving. Other sectors have embraced flexible working and the benefits it provides – I want to see the same in schools,” Williamson added.Angela Rayner MP, the shadow education secretary, said: “After sitting at the cabinet table agreeing to years of real terms pay cuts for teachers, Boris Johnson and Gavin Williamson have finally admitted that austerity has failed our schools. But even now, teachers will have to wait years for the promised pay rise, and there is every chance that if there is a disastrous no-deal Brexit this will be yet another promise that isn’t kept.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6d891a098d01933511514286d8bc7a95c59334e/0_361_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b6eb11a6d7f1fa72a188027e433f1d1","title":"to save fish unblock uk rivers swansea university scientists","story":"Swansea University scientists say the proliferation of weirs, dams and culverts is now creating a threat to wildlifeNear the mouth of the River Afan in Port Talbot, south Wales, a pair of seagulls were to be seen last week pecking in a leisurely way at a dead salmon lying on a gravel bank. It was an unusual sight. Salmon are rarely found in the Afan these days.The scene may have been unexpected, but it nevertheless illustrates a growing problem, say researchers – one that already affects rivers across Europe and could pose even greater threats to habitats and wildlife in future. Increasing numbers of dams, weirs, sluices and other barriers built in rivers over the past 200 years are, they say, fragmenting waterways, isolating habitats and weakening wildlife populations.The salmon on the Afan provides a good example, according to Peter Jones, a postdoctoral researcher at Swansea University. “It was lying on gravel in front of a weir. It would have been trying to get upriver, and although there are fish steps at the side of the weir it would still have had its progress slowed, and been left vulnerable to predators such as otters. The gulls are probably just having an opportunistic snack.”Jones is a member of a Swansea-led project called Amber (Adaptive Management of Barriers in European Rivers), which aims to find ways to halt the fragmentation of European rivers and the dangerous isolation of their habitats. “Flowing rivers are healthy rivers – and by flowing we don’t mean just water, we mean sediment, energy, nutrients and organisms,” said the project leader, Professor Carlos Garcia de Leaniz.The trouble is that very few rivers today have flowing, healthy waters. Apart from abstraction by water companies and farmers, which lowers river levels, more and more barriers are being revealed by the Amber project, which is funded by the EU.“In Europe we have detected 460,000 barriers, and by the end of the year we estimate that we’ll have 600,000,” said de Leaniz, director of Swansea’s Centre for Sustainable Aquatic Research. These dams and weirs pepper Europe’s rivers and prevent migratory fish from swimming upstream to reach their spawning grounds in river headwaters. They also stop vital nutrients flowing downstream to the sea, to the detriment of coastal marine ecosystems.Amber is intended to provide a European overview of the problem. In addition, a second, very detailed survey – called Reconnecting Our River – has been established to study the nearby River Afan. The lessons learned here could be applied to other UK rivers.“Technically the Afan is considered a free-flowing river because there are no big dams on it,” said Josh Jones, another researcher with the Swansea team. “In fact, our work shows there are about 600 barriers inside its catchment area, including weirs, culverts, pipes, channels and sluices.“In many cases, no one can remember why these were built. But each one contributes in some way to the fragmenting of the river environment.”It is also thought that the dams, weirs and culverts built on the Afan over the centuries may be playing a part in slowing its restoration as a salmon and trout river.In the 19th century coalmine waste and other industrial pollutants killed most fish in the Afan it was not until the middle of the 20th century that its waters were cleaned and restored.However, salmon and trout have been slow to return and the researchers point to the hundreds of barriers that have been placed across the Afan and may well be delaying the restoration of fish stocks in the river.Scientists also warn that, as the climate crisis increases its grip on the planet, river fragmentation will become an even greater problem. Pools of still water created by dams and barriers will become vulnerable to rising temperatures, for example. “That risks triggering major changes in wildlife,” added Richard O’Rorke, another Swansea researcher.The crucial point is that river barriers will need to be removed – which is likely to be costly. A major aim of Amber, and also of the Reconnecting Our River project, is to highlight ways of alleviating problems of river flow without spending vast sums.“It may be that, instead of knocking down a large dam to improve water quality in a river, we can interfere with smaller structures and make less expensive changes that will still bring significant improvements,” said O’Rorke. “That is a specific goal of this research.”All major rivers in Europe are now disconnected from the sea, and this has had a catastrophic impact on many species, according to campaigning organisation Amber.• Salmon and eel have become extinct or are threatened with extinction in many UK rivers, and the presence of dams and weirs is partly to blame.• In the Netherlands and Germany, barriers along the River Rhine prevent the migration of sturgeon and shad.• In Spain and Portugal, salmon have disappeared from all but a handful of rivers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da47c888c55040252c06299761e7e20406d573ae/0_315_4724_2834/master/4724.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e311ea6517004df8e10b5b924bd03db","title":"uk funding to tackle climate emergency needs to more than double","story":"Charities write to Sajid Javid requesting increase of spending from £17bn to £42bn over next three yearsBritain’s biggest environmental groups have warned the government that funding to tackle the climate emergency must be more than double next year to avoid an even greater cost from catastrophic ecological breakdown in the future.Writing to the chancellor, Sajid Javid, as he prepares to announce on Wednesday his spending priorities for the year ahead, more than a dozen leading environment charities, including Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth as well as other leading organisations such as Oxfam and Christian Aid, said urgent action was required to raise spending.Spelling out their demands in a costed roadmap for meeting the climate emergency, the groups said that government spending needed to increase from roughly £17bn a year at present to at least £42bn over the next three years. Further increases would be required in the future should the government wish to meet its promise of net zero carbon emissions by 2050.Although broadly welcoming the 2050 target, promised by Theresa May among the final acts of her premiership, the charities said the date needed to be brought forward by several years and that policy and funding arrangements were not yet in place.In the letter to Javid, the organisations urged the chancellor to demonstrate that he understood the gravity of the challenge by holding a climate and nature emergency budget to unleash a clean industrial revolution in Britain.Also signed by charities including the Woodland Trust, WWF and Islamic Relief, the letter said higher state investment would encourage more private spending to bring about a low-carbon economy, telling Javid: “Your department holds the key to ending the UK’s contribution to climate change and reversing nature’s retreat, while also setting off a positive economic transformation.”Boris Johnson had said there would be greater funding for big infrastructure projects but without giving specific details for low-carbon schemes. Polling carried out for the charities by Opinium found a majority of people want ministers to spend more on the climate emergency and nature more broadly.Among the priorities put forward by the groups are an £11.6bn expansion in transport spending, including a UK-wide car scrappage scheme to remove heavily-polluting vehicles from the roads.As much as £2.6bn per year should be spent on rewilding projects and other land management schemes, billions should be ploughed into buildings and industry to boost environmental sustainability, while more funding should be given to help communities disrupted by the transition to a low-carbon economy.John Sauven, an economist and executive director of Greenpeace UK, said: “No one in government is still trying to argue that this is not an emergency, and yet no one in government is acting as though it is.“We are still constantly pumping carbon into the atmosphere, and trying to ignore the problem will leave our children with a damaged world and a planet-sized debt. There’s a strong economic case and an overwhelming moral imperative for the chancellor to act.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79cf85ddb65acbe010d614d0d8d595774b35e66f/0_192_4592_2755/master/4592.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8cffca5f3af3c4ca9cd39acb0f98e708","title":"tell us about your treasured charity shop finds","story":"To celebrate Second Hand September we would like to see photos of your favourite charity shop clothesThis September Oxfam is asking people to opt out of buying new clothes and instead go for secondhand items from charity shops.

He’s excited about the new collection. The first pieces went into John Lewis’s White City store that morning and he is visibly chuffed. He’s already wearing the trouser samples, which will go on sale in November, and it looks like he’ll be living in them for a while. He’s his own best customer. “I personally like a dishevelled, worn garment,” he says. “I like that patina things take on when they look well-worn.”The tagline for the collection made exclusively for sale in John Lewis and Folk, is “Wear it out”. “It’s not fast fashion,” he says. “It’s important that people wear the garments out.” Folk already repairs clothes that are returned if they have been damaged. “If they can be repaired or upcycled, then the team will make sure that happens,” he says. The same will be true for It’s All Good Folk. “If something needs a minor repair we will replace the garment, if need be, then we can repair it and resell it, or we can make a charitable donation so it can be used and worn again.”Making clothes last longer is important, but it is only part of the story. Fashion has become an industry that even the people who work in it feel increasingly uneasy about. Designers and supply-chain managers like those in McAteer’s team are all too aware of news about microplastic-contaminated rain in remote parts of the world, about fashion brands burning clothes they can’t sell, and the unfathomable amounts of waste and pollution created by the production of fashion and textiles.McAteer’s team are keen to drive change within the business. When John Lewis approached Folk to collaborate on a menswear line, it made sense to do things a little differently and rethink the way the collection is sourced and made. He employed the services of sustainability consultant Dan Holmes. “We have been studying how we can make our supply chain, suppliers and ourselves do things better,” said McAteer. The result has motivated the team and re-energised the whole business.A lot of it made both common and business sense, like making sure factories were close to fabric suppliers so they were no longer shipping a material from, say, Japan to Poland, to cut down on air miles. “It’s always a balance,” says Holmes. “Is a recycled fibre better than organic? Is organic better than BCI – which is Better Cotton Initiative? It’s all about trade-offs. Is the focus on ocean plastic or climate change?” These are the questions all brands – big or small – should be asking. But there are no easy answers or quick fixes. “There are definitely people doing it much better,” says McAteer. This is a starting point. The whole team is really excited about the fabrics we’ve chosen to use, from BCI cottons to the organic cottons, recycled nylons, polyesters. It is definitely positive and we are pretty happy.”Rethinking materials and sourcing is all very well, but it still doesn’t address the issue that we are fundamentally making too many clothes. That’s why McAteer is so determined to communicate the “wear it out” message to ensure that nothing ends up being worn a few times before ending up in landfill.He shows me the video he made to promote the new collection and its underlying message. It was filmed in Glasgow, inspired by the early days of Folk, when he and a couple of friends would go on a road trip and take pictures. It perfectly encapsulates the Folk spirit – utilitarian clothes to have a good time in. It’s the details that are all important: the seams designed to flatter the lines of the body, the subtle logo printed on the side of a jacket, the fit that allows you to move.Cathal McAteer grew up in Cumbernauld, outside Glasgow, in the 1980s, with little interest in school and an obsession with clothes and design. He got himself a milk round at 12 so that he could save up money to buy cool stuff he was into, and, by the time he was 16, he was working in Glasgow’s cult designer boutique, Ichi Ni San.In 1990, Glasgow was the City of Culture (the Independent dubbed it “City of Couture”) and was enjoying its moment in the style spotlight with a thriving music and fashion scene. McAteer was at its epicentre, modelling for the store and soon travelling to the shows in London and Paris, in search of new collections to sell. Already, he was dreaming of his own shop and label.He moved to London in the late 1990s and, after a few years working for brands including Nicole Farhi, he was convinced there was a niche for a new label for people like him and his friends. In 2001, Folk was born. The name was suggested by a friend – the perfect unassuming tag for a quietly cool Modern British brand that was to gain a following of people in the know, tuned into the worlds of music, art and design, as well as the finer details of utility tailoring.Eighteen years on, Folk has grown a loyal and dedicated following. Womenswear was introduced in 2012 along with accessories, shoes and the odd bit of furniture and a selection of other products that have caught McAteer’s eye and share his values. There are now five stores and regular collaborations with artists, designers and musicians.The collaboration with John Lewis meant McAteer had to make sure his manufacturers were signed up to the partnership’s Responsible Sourcing Code of Practice that sets out expectations on pay, working hours, child labour, worker rights and the right to freedom of association as well as responsible sourcing of materials, with factories being audited by third-party companies. It meant asking some of his suppliers who weren’t already on the list to sign up, which he says is due diligence and good for them, too.While you could argue that if Folk is serious about reducing its impact, it wouldn’t be expanding with a new collection in 12 John Lewis stores, but fashion is a business and McAteer wants to grow in a measured way. The irony is, the brand now has a greater access to more sustainably sourced materials which were previously too expensive for him to buy in smaller quantities.McAteer doesn’t believe people should pay more just because a product is made in a more sustainable way. That, surely, should be standard. Through economies of scale, It’s All Good Folk is cheaper than the main Folk line. A print shirt is £75, while a T-shirt made from Global Organic Textile Standards (GOTS)-certified organic cotton is £40.As he zips up his minimalist twist on a classic MA1 jacket, which is made of recycled polyester, he talks me through the collection. All the pieces are based on archive favourites, redesigned for today – which means not just the fabrications but the styling, too. There’s a shirt that was originally made in cotton but has been reimagined in a new low impact viscose called EcoVera. The original version felt stiffer, this one has a lovely drapey feel to it.“It’s all Good Folk is designed with the Folk ethos at heart – that’s unrestrictive clothes designed beautifully with every detail marked off,” says McAteer. “And then we apply this new ethos in that we make these garments in the best possible way, with a trusted manufacturer, using fabrics that are locally sourced next to the manufacturer in great factories. And we will make those garments as clean as possible. We will be scrutinised. But let’s do the best we can… we’re asking all the questions.” This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

For decades it operated quietly, diligently under the radar of public scrutiny, shepherding its anxious clients through a mystifying array of global tax evasion schemes until the release of the Panama Papers in 2016 metaphorically pissed on everyone’s chips. Next thing you know, the office has been raided, its directors are in jail and the golden age is over, or at least under audit.Now the culprits are back to give their side of the story via the medium of Steven Soderbergh’s The Laundromat, a whip-smart, fiendishly entertaining contender at this year’s Venice film festival. As impersonated by Gary Oldman and Antonio Banderas, Jurgen Mossack and Ramon Fonseca amble about in posh tuxedos or brocaded smoking jackets, clutching dry martinis and speaking directly to camera. They could be obsequious waiters or mischievous performance artists, the Gilbert and George of disaster capitalism. They’re here to tell us all about “the secret life of money”, about futures and equities and the proliferation of shell companies that can be used to hide billions.“That’s the story? Empty shells?” snorts an unimpressed journalist and she may well have a point because judged at face value, the subject’s dry as dust. All the same, The Laundromat - “based on actual secrets” and adapted from a non-fiction book by Jake Bernstein - does a fine job in making a drama out of this financial crisis. Soderbergh (whose CV includes films such as Traffic, Side Effects and Erin Brockovich) understands the importance of putting human faces to dry statistics. He reveals how the tentacles of financial misrule eventually extend to touch honest-to-God human lives.Mossack and Fonseca prize discretion above all things, except possibly money. Naturally, they would “prefer not to know” about the sometimes shady provenance of the clients on their books. The drug kingpins and sex traffickers. The traders in human organs. But happily Soderbergh has no such qualms. So he throws in the tale of a murder inside a business hotel and another about a philandering businessman who buys his daughter’s silence with inflated share options. These case studies are presented with a twinkle of good humour. They play like jaunty little sitcoms but carry the distinct whiff of sulphur.The film’s prize asset, though, is Meryl Streep, playing the role of Ellen Martin, an elderly widow on the trail of her late husband’s insurer. Ellen chases the paper trail from one shell company to the next, determined to hold someone to account, until she finally finds an address for the corporation’s head office. This turns out to be a safety deposit box on the seafront out in Nevis.“Now is the time for action,” vows Ellen, which is all well and good. But viewers hoping for a Hollywood happy ending or even a clear-cut resolution won’t find it here. The film’s too astute and the situation’s too parlous. Earnestly, helpfully, Mossack and Fonseca explain that in fact they are just the tip of the iceberg and that this particular ship has already sailed. Lined up behind them are row upon row of unprepossessing grey men in business suits, sitting behind desks, mainly thinking about lunch. Everyone’s compromised, everyone’s implicated. The machine’s wholly broken. Everything comes out dirty.•\u0026nbspThe Laundromat is released on 27 September"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dae5feb3af88787717c64bc55ae24ed877eedce8/0_0_6016_3608/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9270f2db3573b134813e3a1e53f3c3cc","title":"grubs up a third of britons think well be eating insects by 2029","story":"Research finds belief that scoffing crickets or worm burgers will be commonplace Nearly a third of Britons believe insects will eventually be part of mainstream human diets in the UK amid mounting challenges in food production, new research reveals.Manufacturers, supermarkets and restaurants are all scrambling to cash in on a changing food landscape in the UK as consumers embrace flexitarian diets – where a largely vegetable-based diet is occasionally supplemented with meat – and experiment with meat alternatives and plant-based eating.The damaging environmental impact of global meat production has spurred interest in edible bugs as an alternative, sustainable food source. Unlike cows or pigs, insects can be bred in significant numbers without taking up large amounts of land, water or feed.Insects are also nutritious, containing essential proteins, fats, minerals and amino acids. Bugs for consumption are typically bred in large-scale factory conditions.Mark Buckingham, chair of the ABC, said: “We are delighted to see UK consumers embrace innovation as the future of farming. Using cutting-edge technology and growing techniques will enable the UK to deal with the serious challenges of keeping our farmers competitive, maintaining a safe, affordable food supply, and protecting our natural environment.”The global edible insect market is set to exceed $520m (£430m) by 2023, according to recent research. The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation says at least 2 billion people regularly consume insects. But while more than 1,000 species are eaten around the world, they hardly feature in the diets of many rich nations.In the UK, crickets and other insects have so far been predominantly limited to quirky pop-ups or sales through online outlets, while they also feature on a few restaurant menus.Last November, Sainsbury’s became the first major UK grocer to stock edible crickets, selling the roasted insects as snacks in small bags from the UK brand Eat Grub in 250 of its stores.Helen Browning, chief executive of the organic food and farming group the Soil Association, said: “Insects can be used to convert waste food very efficiently and there are a few large ‘insect farms’ now established across the world, targeted at animal and fish diets.“There is clearly interest in insects for humans too, but how quickly these markets will develop remains to be seen. For many people in the UK, there is a bit of a ‘yuck’ factor, though of course in many cultures they are a normal part of the diet.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22e24c4c32eb5908dfc5107350c696fc2b119dc5/135_102_4313_2590/master/4313.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6a97abdaab528b8b074ea69499f6aea","title":"jade moore england midfielder world cup hype","story":"• England midfielder frustrated at poor scheduling• Moore: ‘I don’t get why we cram games in’The England midfielder Jade Moore has expressed frustration that poor scheduling is stunting preparations for the new Women’s Super League season, which kicks off at the weekend, and disrupting attempts to capitalise on the World Cup as a result.England play Norway in a friendly on Tuesday night, following a 3-3 draw in Belgium on Thursday, and Moore has been forced to withdraw from the camp having picked up a thigh injury.With the opening weekend of the Barclays FA WSL on 7‑8 September, just days after players return from international duties in Euro 2021 qualifiers and friendlies, there is little time for clubs to ready their senior internationals for the new campaign.With the international calendar set by Fifa and the FA juggling the women’s domestic schedule the task of making all competitions fit together is complex. Moore, though, cannot understand how with fewer teams in the league than the Premier League, meaning fewer games, there is such a struggle to fit everything in.“I don’t know who does the league or how they plan it out but I never understand how we don’t have enough weeks in the year to play a game a week,” she said. “I don’t know whether that’s just me. I actually really like playing midweek because it breaks my training week up, it doesn’t make it so monotonous. But I don’t get why we cram games in. And I do get the ‘well, you’ve got a good squad, you’ve got enough money etc, like, that’s the way football is going to go’ argument. But we don’t have many teams we don’t have what the Premiership have. We’re not playing 50-odd games a season.”While frustrated at the ongoing problems, the 28-year-old is well aware that the switch from a summer to a winter season has improved things.“We rolled from a summer, into an international tournament into a summer league into international qualifiers. And as you actually map it out, there’ll be players if they’ve not been injured, that will go 18 months cycles or 24 months cycles where they’ve never had more than probably seven days off. And then you look at injuries and maybe somewhere along the line they’re over-use injuries and just inevitable.”With talks of a possible Fifa World League gaining pace, the calendar for those at the top is only going to get tougher. “The thing is, as players we want more games, but we also want it to fit better.

There must be the maximum respect. Today I was treated well and wasn’t insulted, other times it hasn’t happened like that and it’s not nice.”It is not the first time the Sardinian club’s supporters have targeted an opposition player, with Everton’s Moise Kean suffering similar treatment when he played against Cagliari for Juventus last season and both Blaise Matuidi and Sulley Muntari having previously suffered racist abuse. Cagliari escaped punishment over Kean after the Italian Football Federation ruled the chants had “an objectively limited relevance”.Lautaro Martínez had earlier opened the scoring in the 27th minute before the hosts levelled through João Pedro five minutes after the break. Inter are now top of Serie A on six points after two rounds along with Torino and the champions, Juventus.Elsewhere Luis Alberto struck the equaliser as Lazio claimed a 1-1 draw against Roma in a lively derby, also in Serie A.Roma, for whom Chris Smalling was an unused substitute, went ahead with a penalty from Aleksandar Kolarov after 17 minutes following a handball by Sergej Milinkovic-Savic. Nicolo Zaniolo also hit a post for Roma.Ciro Immobile and Joaquin Correa both hit the woodwork as Lazio pushed for a leveller and it eventually arrived when Alberto struck just before the hour.Lazio finished strongly with Marco Parolo hitting the crossbar and Manuel Lazzari having what would have been a late winner disallowed for offside.“There are inevitably regrets, because we had so many chances and you have to win games like that,” Lazio coach Simone Inzaghi said. “We could have used a bit more luck.

Cut the phone line. Gum the Real Madrid email servers with a barrage of online phishing scams. If Daniel Levy really is the master of the dark arts of transfer window brinkmanship, Tottenham Hotspur’s chairman will surely have a few Monday morning plans for Christian Eriksen.A helicopter trip to the Isle of Jura perhaps, or a long drive through the pine forest wastelands in a lead‑lined limousine.Anything, in fact, to keep the most vital creative cog in this team away from a bar of phone reception before La Liga’s transfer window closes on Monday evening.With Eriksen moving through the collisions like a breath of cold, clear air Tottenham were an incisive attacking machine for the opening 40 minutes of this game, not to mention a convincing facsimile of the team that found its way to Madrid on the first day of June.After half-time Arsenal began to find their own rhythms, their three‑man midfield taking a grip of the centre. As Eriksen’s influence waned, the home team dominated and should have won this game, instead taking a point from a 2-2 draw that left the white shirts spread across the turf in a frieze of disappointment at the final whistle.Tottenham looked what they are: an excellent team that remains a little thin when it comes to creative quality, the playmaking duties entirely dependent on the man with the No 23 shirt who drifts with such elegant severity between the lines.They might have put this game away in the second half as Harry Kane hit the post with the score at 2-1, played into space by the most perfectly weighted little nudge from Eriksen. But Arsenal might also have scored four times in the same period and just looked to have more attacking depth over 90 minutes. As indeed they do: for all the frustrations of some supporters Arsenal have signed three ready‑made top-class attackers in the last three seasons. Spurs, arguably, have not signed one since Jürgen Klinsmann.The Emirates Stadium had been rocking at kick-off on a warm September afternoon. Son Heung‑min was excellent in that opening period, as was Eriksen, a constant high-pressure presence, with a beautiful intensity in his passing.Eriksen even poached the opening goal, helped by a surge and a neat pass from Son and also by terrible goalkeeping from Bernd Leno, who palmed a soft shot from Érik Lamela into Eriksen’s path in front of goal. His skill in that moment was just to read the play and end up standing in the right place to tap the ball into the net.Prompted by Eriksen Spurs were finding wide-open spaces down the side of the Arsenal centre-backs. With 18 minutes gone there was a moment of mild hysteria as Son hared towards goal and David Luiz simply turned and ran away as fast as he could, like a frontline deserter spooked by the first heavy cavalry charge. Presumably David Luiz was trying to anticipate the run of Kane behind him, a man playing a game of slapstick defensive chess three moves ahead and on a different board.Eriksen kept finding space. His third shot at goal in that period was a free-kick that Leno again palmed down and which led to the second goal. There are late tackles. There are very late tackles. And then there is Granit Xhaka’s attempted full stretch lunge at Son here, a tackle so late it appeared to have taken place 17 years from now during a chance meeting at a Florida beach resort with both men safely retired, the moment looped back through time via an FA flux capacitor in a bunker at Stockley Park.Kane ked the penalty kick hard and low into the corner. At which point Arsenal surged back. Alexandre Lacazette’s fine finish before half-time was reward for their efforts. Nicolas Pépé was bright throughout, with that lovely way of taking the ball on the half-turn with either foot. And Pierre Emerick-Aubameyang drifted in to poach a high class close-range equaliser.As Spurs held on or looked to break, it was Eriksen who turned cleverly and found neat little passes to keep the game just about under control. There was even time for an authentic Moussa Sissoko charging-hoof-over-the-bar right at the end. A point was hard-earned and probably deserved. But it is a mark of where Spurs stand, how precarious their momentum, that the season can now start in earnest if they can smuggle their best creative player through the Spanish transfer window’s final spasms.None of this is new. For four seasons Mauricio Pochettino has propelled this Tottenham team on its way as various parts have fallen off, steering with his knees, fixing the cam-belt with his free hand, mocked occasionally for merely reaching finals and second places rather than actually winning the sport’s biggest domestic trophies. The margins are fine at this level. By late Sunday afternoon Tottenham had a point from this game and at least half of the final 10 months on Eriksen’s contract. They will seize on both with some relief."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbc0bfa98e256918776b3fa0aa1d599b1d50d083/398_1020_8300_4980/master/8300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c66a297a954bd970cb1b1826bcde59f8","title":"home office planning to end family reunion for children after brexit","story":"Exclusive: Current system for asylum-seeking minors set to end the day after UK leaves EUThe Home Office is preparing to end the current system of family reunification for asylum-seeking children if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the  has learned.The government has privately briefed the UN refugee agency UNHCR and other NGOs that open cases may be able to progress, but a no-deal Brexit would mean no new applications after 1 November from asylum-seeking children to be reunited with relatives living in the UK. Even if there is a deal, the future of family reunion is not certain.Lawyers and campaigners say they will be trying to get through as many claims as possible in the next two months, warning that the impact on migrant children stranded alone in countries such as Greece and Italy could be “fatal” as more head for the Channel to try to cross to the UK irregularly.“UNHCR urges the UK government and its European partners to work together to ensure that appropriate arrangements remain in place for asylum seekers, refugees and stateless people.”The Home Office has previously been criticised for making it difficult for young migrants to join family in the UK but lawyers say it is still a vital route for highly vulnerable child migrants, many of whom live on the streets in mainland Europe.Efi Stathopoulou, the project coordinator at Refugee Legal Support in Athens, said the family reunification route was the only way she could persuade vulnerable young people to engage with the authorities.“Children come here very afraid,” she said. “There have been cases where it was very obvious they were being exploited. Without the possibility of a safe way to reach the UK, these young people will simply vanish to try to cross the Channel at Calais on lorries or boats.”Stathopoulou said Greek authorities asked her earlier this year to help speed up claims if a no-deal Brexit looked likely in order to get as many children as possible processed before the deadline.Family reunification is vital because of widespread homelessness and exploitation faced by migrants in Greece.“I’m here when they make calls to their relatives in the UK it’s so hard to see, there is so much emotion, their aunts and uncles just want them to be together.”The Home Office confirmed that once the UK left the EU, the only commitment would be to cases not resolved by that date.A spokesperson said: “Deal or no deal, cooperation will continue on asylum and returns as it is in the interests of the UK and the EU. That is why we have taken proactive action to ensure that whatever the circumstances, ‘Dublin’ requests relating to family reunification that have not been resolved on the date we leave will continue to be considered under existing rules.”There has been a huge surge in sea arrivals to Greece in the past month, putting pressure on already overcrowded and dangerous reception centres on the Greek islands.In the first six months of 2019 alone, there were nearly 700 requests through Greek authorities to the UK to take charge of an asylum seeker under the “Dublin” asylum law. Since 2013, there have been 2,450 such requests.The only other legal route for any asylum-seeking child to reach the UK from within Europe is the Dubs scheme, named after Lord Alf Dubs who pushed it through parliament.MPs and campaigners hoped the Dubs scheme would resettle about 3,000 children but ministers controversially set a limit of 480. About 270 children have so far come, according to charity Safe Passage, which has lobbied for more safe routes.Beth Gardiner-Smith, the chief executive of Safe Passage International, said: “If the government fails to protect family reunification, the consequences could be fatal. Too often children risk their lives on lorries and dinghies because the legal process is taking too long. If they lose that right altogether, these dangerous journeys will only increase.“We know that if the political will is there, swift and safe transfers are possible a no-deal Brexit does not mean transfers must stop.”If the UK leaves with a deal similar to that negotiated by Theresa May, the future of asylum cooperation will be renegotiated as part of the transition period.Claude Moraes, a Labour MEP, said he would be raising questions with the Home Office about the plans and believed that the department would have to share responsibility if it wanted Europe to take back asylum seekers from the UK."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e583d3ab87869464228762e16f8693ea0b1f542/0_204_5315_3190/master/5315.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4d44e7bbef2ddafb298604c13b61c1a","title":"five ways sober curious success not drinking","story":"Staying alcohol-free at social events can be daunting, but be open to the new experience and own it“The first step is to get really clear about why you are abstaining,” Warrington says. “Maybe you’re sick of hangovers, want to perform better at work, or have a health and fitness goal. It can help to write these reasons down somewhere you can access them easily, to remind yourself when you feel your resolve wavering.”Once you’ve established your reasoning, Warrington says that you should continue to attend social functions, seeing them as “sober firsts”. “Weddings can be extra challenging, as these are some of our booziest get-togethers,” she says. “Go into these and any other ‘sober firsts’ with an open mind, and stay curious about what the experience will be like sober. If you’re used to drinking, staying sober can even be a different kind of altered state – with all the surprises, the highs and the lows.”With the alcohol-free market expanding, and some estimates anticipating it to grow by a third in the next three years, there are plenty of options available to replace your usual tipple of choice at a social function. Warrington recommends a tonic with bitters as being “more grown up than ordering a Coke”, while a record £57m was spent on non-alcoholic beers in Britain over the past year.Kate Bee, the founder of Sober School – a sobriety training course for women – emphasises the need to be confident about your decision. “Really own it and never apologise for not drinking,” she says. “Instead, smile brightly and say: ‘I’m not drinking at the moment and I can’t believe how much I’m enjoying it.’ Even if you have to fake that enthusiasm it’s worth it. It’s much harder for people to pressure you to drink if you’re happy being alcohol-free.”When undergoing such a potentially life-altering change, it is important to discuss what you are doing with friends and gain their support, according to Warrington. “Let your friends know about your journey as that can be one of the most powerful means of encouragement,” she says. “And when they see you’re capable of it, they might decide to try it for themselves, too.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58cac676cd3261b7972dbe19803dfb8d0feec639/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=370c3e82b3985a8c5fb90c395e4b9198","title":"how to cool down after exercise","story":"We are taught from childhood that warming up is a must in preparation for any exercise. It allows us to gear our muscles up for the strain we are about to place on them and prevent injury. More importantly, it steadily increases the heart rate and circulation, which loosens joints and increases blood flow to the muscles. These all help towards an effective workout.But cooling down is as important as warming up. It prevents dizziness, helps return the heart rate back to normal and prevents chronic venous insufficiency (CVI). Also known as “blood pooling”, CVI occurs when the blood in blood vessels expands during prolonged exercise, making it difficult for it to return to the heart from the legs.According to many health and fitness instructors, the total cool-down period should last three to 10 minutes, or until you are ready to stop. Areas to target depend on which part of the body you trained. For example, if you have been working your legs, you will need to do lower body stretches or a slow walk. There are many helpful tutorials online.The best way to measure whether you have cooled down effectively is purely based on common sense – if you feel your heart rate has reduced, that’s enough. If you wear a heart rate monitor, that will also tell you once your heart rate has returned to normal. There is no research to prove stretching after a session will help reduce soreness, but if you feel it helps, there is no harm in it, do so – it is down to personal preference. Cooling down methods, including foam rollers, a sports massage or dry needling are worth investigating. If you experience any pain when stretching, stop, and consult your doctor or a physio if the pain is there the next day, and, more importantly, warm up more thoroughly next time.Callum Nicholls is a trainer at Third Space and Barry’s Bootcamp.

Lucy Vine raises a glass to the month of neverending summerAt the risk of alienating any weather-grumps out there, I’m going to start by saying this in caps: GOD I LOVE SUMMER. I love the sun and the paddling pools and the noise from literally everyone in the world standing outside my local pub. I love people at work turning up in shorts and moaning happily about back sweat. I love constantly losing my sunglasses and looking blank when my mum tells me the names of the blooming flowers in my garden. Summer is clearly the very best of seasons. Full of joyful socialising and people actually smiling at each other.What I don’t love, however, is this thing we all seem to do whenever the end of August arrives – that oddly British tradition where we all look at each other and go: “Well then, that’s summer done for another year.”The reason this irritates me is simple: because it’s not true! The season isn’t over just because August is over. In fact – to paraphrase Frank Sinatra – the best month is yet to come. September should always, categorically, be included when we think of our summer months.September is, almost without exception, lovely. It brings its own kind of magic to the season, with glorious sunshine, but also red-golden falling leaves and long, bright, breezy days. You can still sit outside, still go barefoot in flip-flops, still enjoy a tasty early evening Grey Goose vodka cocktail. My favourite drink for those sunny September weekends was recommended to me by a bartender last year. It’s the Grey Goose le Grand Fizz – a delightful, heady mix of Grey Goose vodka, St-Germain elderflower liqueur, fresh lime and soda water, with ice. It’s everything September-y in a glass cool, refreshing, delicious joy. And there is nothing more perfect than sitting on a roof terrace somewhere with friends, the sound of clinking ice around you.I will admit, sometimes I get accused by loved ones of being cynical. A determined pessimist, one might say. But not in September. There is something about this month that draws out the optimist in me. Something new and exciting in the air that creeps in – I am happier, more inspired, and I see it in others around me, too. People are wider-eyed, refreshed, ready to take on new projects and plan new adventures. It’s the time of year to begin again, to achieve, to try. It’s an opportunity to elevate every occasion. September is when I plan my trips, it’s when I arrange to see friends, it’s when I date. September energises me. I feel magnetic, sociable and playful in September, I feel brave and bold. It makes me restless in a good way twitchy for parties and spontaneous fun.September is a dreamy month, as well, if you prefer cosy evenings in. You’re no longer under pressure to get outside for the sake of making the most of the sun. Cardigans can make a comeback from that distant, forgotten shelf in your wardrobe. The new season of telly begins, and with it all the 60-minute dramas starring Richard Madden you can handle. Plus, after months of picking at smoothies and salads, you can eat proper meals again. Pasta! Roast dinners! Potatoes! And there’s nothing like an after-dinner cocktail in your garden of an early evening to top off your day. My favourite post-dinner drink is the Grey Goose Espresso Martini with Grey Goose vodka, a single original finest quality espresso, coffee liqueur and a pinch of salted dark chocolate powder to garnish.And so, the campaign starts here join me in giving September the credit it deserves. It’s time to stop treating the ninth month like summer’s ugly stepchild. It’s time to stop drawing the blinds down on the season before we should. It’s time to embrace our inner optimist and this wonderful, joyful, neverending summer.Check out some more cocktail recipes at greygoose"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ffeac2e0923b2d15ea9af0b985ea4d0218ccd1c/0_0_1731_1039/master/1731.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10f69bb1d4d9c32a325322db821a8e04","title":"celebrate the day how to plan a gathering at the last minute","story":"Summer is the season for spontaneity, so why not make the most of bright days and long nights with a spur-of-the-moment do? Here’s our guide to making it a night to rememberWhen was the last time you had an impromptu get-together? There’s always a good reason not to. On Friday night, you’re tired from work. Saturday comes, and you just want to relax after a busy week. And on Sunday, well, it’s Monday tomorrow!But there are really so many reasons to organise a do at short notice, from a surprise bank holiday heatwave to keeping the holiday vibes going after you’ve returned from a sunny beach trip abroad. To make sure your last-minute shindig is one to remember, here are a few tips to elevate your soiree without breaking a sweat.Curate the guest listForget Facebook. In 2019 we WhatsApp. Forming a WhatsApp group for your party creates a space for invitees who don’t know each other to break the ice, and keeps your guest list to only people who know you well enough to have their number, not whoever you feel obliged to add as you scroll through every person you’ve ever met since 2006. If two invitees are exes, invite both, tell them to discuss who (if not both) should attend, and assure them they’ll both be ejected if they start rowing in the kitchen. As far as inviting colleagues goes, best to limit it to people in your after-work drinks crew.Choose a second-in-commandPerhaps the most important tip is to select a good friend to help you keep an eye on food and drink, playlist coups, general tidying and other party admin to keep your own stress levels low. They can even subtly begin the party exodus on your command, so long as they’re the sort of pal you can turn to and say: “Right, I’ve had enough, get everyone out now.” We all need a friend like that.Democratise the playlistThere’s nothing more irritating than guests commandeering the music, but once the drinks have started flowing, people will inevitably try their luck. Avoid this by inviting your guests to help with the playlist. Ask each to send a couple of suggestions when they confirm they’re coming, whack it all together on Spotify and then dilute it with your own picks – it’s your party, you deserve that.Don’t be precious over glassesYou can get those plastic throwaway champagne flutes and martini glasses nowadays, but frankly it’s a waste of money and plastic. We’re in Britain, so chances are your household will have at least 20 perfectly useable mugs of varying taste levels in your cupboards, and anyone who judges you for using these shouldn’t be on the guestlist in the first place. There’s enough plastic being dumped into the world without you adding extra because you can’t be bothered to wash up at the end of your do – and that’s what the aforementioned second-in-command is for, anyway.Encourage photography, not selfiesInstagram is a wonderful thing, but in the age of Stories, selfies and #squadlife, it’s easy to forget that photos used to be something you had to wait for. That is, you had to finish a roll of film, then go and get it developed, and all with no idea of what the results would look like. But that was part of the fun of course, and – dare I say it – encouraged people to take better, more spontaneous and authentic photos. So, rather than posing for endless posts, why not pick up four or five disposable cameras and distribute them among your friends to take pics throughout the evening? The classic Kodak single-use is still great for colour shots, or for a touch of perennial monochrome cool, try Ilford’s range of black and white disposables.Make some nibbles to rememberIt’s really easy to make simple food feel a bit fancy with just a few additions. Fill paper cups with salted popcorn mixed with spices like za’atar and sumac for a warming, Middle Eastern twist, or toss some walnut halves in a pan with soy sauce to make a crunchy salad topping brimming with umami. You can also roast broccoli with olive oil, salt, garlic, fresh chilli and lemon juice for plant-based finger food that’s surprisingly tasty – and won’t have your guests feeling lethargic a couple of hours after eating. A homemade dip is an easy way to impress too – tzatziki is a personal favourite, and I like to use Nigel Slater’s recipe, minus the dill.Don’t forget the detailsIt’s the little things that make a party flow: lime wedges stored in the fridge, waiting to be plopped into drinks wifi password shared before guests arrive extra toilet paper lots of – and I can’t stress this enough – kitchen roll and sun cream! Try and pre-empt the sorts of details guests might need during the party, and have them out, ready and signposted. If nothing else, it’ll stop them interrupting you in the middle of dancing to Beyoncé.Check out some more cocktail recipes at greygoose"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31b79a7e2987eaafcaffc6a5d4f8cc7940d4c479/0_0_1733_1040/master/1733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9eaf594b0978f249bbff150ec2b4ef70","title":"its about the morning afters why the joy of friendship isnt found in the big moments","story":"Great friendships aren’t forged on the big nights out, but the spontaneous moments when the phones are forgotten about, and conversation and laughter flows freely, says Lauren BravoMy best friend and I live on opposite sides of London, but we share a hairdresser. Once every two months, she makes the 90-minute journey to my flat and we both have our highlights done by Lesley, the fastest bleaching brush in the west. While she works, we gossip and cackle and unpack every idle thought and silly piece of trivia we’ve forgotten to tell each other during the intervening weeks. Afterwards we preen, we put music on and she goes through my bedroom and tries on my clothes. For a few hours it feels as though we’re teenagers again. Only with much better hair.Increasingly I’m realising it’s these small, informal moments-between-moments that really make a friendship. The getting-readys. The morning-afters. The shall-we-just-stay-ins.Far and away my favourite moment of freshers’ week at university was the night I spent holed up in a halls of residence dorm room watching a DVD of Fawlty Towers, with a group of new friends who, like me, had elected to skip the Crazy Wild West Hoedown happening in the campus bar downstairs. While everyone else cavorted in panic-bought Stetsons to Cotton Eye Joe, we watched Basil being hit unconscious by the falling moose’s head and congratulated ourselves on our choices.Those new friends went on to become my housemates, my pub quiz team, my unofficial counsellors and confidantes. They’re the people with whom I have staged a gleeful fake Christmas every December for the past 12 years, the festivities growing marginally more civilised as our lives have (we eat our turkey dinner around a table now – not, as in 2009, out of saucepans while sat on the stairs). And when we reminisce, our favourite memories are never the big-ticket items. End of year balls? Fine. Graduation? Cool, I suppose. But the spontaneous kitchen dance parties? Legendary. Likewise the best part of a big night out was rarely the night itself it was the Bloody Marys with brunch the next day, that clink of ice and hit of pepper, as we pieced together everyone’s juicy titbits from the night before like a great big gossip jigsaw.It’s how so many of my most cherished friendships were forged – not in life-changing experiences, but in leisurely hours spent talking nonsense, howling with laughter at nothing in particular. It’s easy to feel affection for everyone in the dazzle of a Big Life Moment, or the warmth of its afterglow. But it’s on the ordinary days, the rainy days and Mondays, that you find your true ride-or-dies.And that’s especially true as you get older. As people disperse across cities, counties, even countries, and friendship has to be increasingly meted out between the Big Life Moments the weddings, the birthday drinks, the housewarmings and baby showers. When the casual, everyday chit-chat we used to take for granted gets relegated to WhatsApp groups and Instagram likes, and IRL meet-ups have to be scheduled weeks in advance. Idling away time together becomes a rare luxury, while savouring it becomes all the more important. No longer the easy proximity and empty diaries, which meant you could fill an evening with one magic word: “pub?”The significant milestones can give you lovely reasons to celebrate, sure – but they can also pile on the pressure. How many times have you heard happy couples lament that they barely had a chance to exchange more than two words with their friends on their wedding day, before being swept away by a wave of excitable aunts? The hen weekends where you’re so stressed about the logistics of getting everyone from the pottery class to the knicker-making workshop that you forget to have a good time. The dinners where it takes so long to catch up on everyone’s top-line news that you’re still discussing mortgage rates and maternity leave by the time the bill comes. If we rely on the Big Life Moments to bring us together, we risk missing out on the deeper conversations and the daft interludes, both of which can make even the most ordinary of days feel like a special occasion.So it’s important to remember all of the other ways you connect with people – and the other people you connect with. Maybe it’s the friend who drags you to their weird evening class once a month, and rewards you with a good cocktail afterwards. The pal who will get up at dawn to drive to a car boot sale, then talk you out of buying a three-foot high stuffed fox (“it’s kitsch!”). Your film buff mate who will come over to watch arty foreign-language flicks with an armful of continental cheeses, knowing you’re both going to talk the whole way through, Espresso Martinis in hand. Your Eurovision crew, your board games gang, your summer solstice picnic posse. Here’s an idea: every time you say “we should do this every weekmonthyear!”, why not try … actually doing that?

This in turn would “make government housing delivery targets impossible to achieve and slow new building across the sector”, he said.Against a backdrop of falling owner occupation in Britain as first-time buyers find it difficult to get on the housing ladder, the government has promised to deliver 300,000 homes a year by the mid 2020s.Yael Selfin, the chief economist at KPMG UK, said 2020 would be a delicate year for the housing market. “Even if Brexit can be resolved relatively smoothly, the travails of the global economy will impact growth in the UK, making prospects for house prices relatively subdued,” she said.• Sign up to the daily Business Today email here or follow  Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eaf5d2aec2f80f1304a6f9e8a4a8e6ec158a76f0/0_1380_7300_4380/master/7300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c1940d8487468b10fe47b829d261a3a","title":"the man who gave birth podcast","story":"Freddy McConnell is a  journalist and trans man who in 2016 decided to begin the process of conceiving and delivering his own child.

Javid confronted Boris Johnson in a heated discussion about why his staff member had been fired without his knowledge.Yvette Cooper, the Labour chair of the Commons home affairs select committee, said: “Government advisers must not abuse their power by drawing the police into heavy-handed political stunts. This needs to be reviewed by the cabinet secretary and the politan police straight away.”Bowers added: “She should have been given warning of what the meeting was about. It may be that they needn’t have told her what evidence they had against her, but the nature of the meeting and fact that it could lead to dismissal, she should have been told about that.”He said the humiliation of her being marched out of No 10 would aggravate the element of unfairness in what happened to her and a tribunal judge “would hate that”.Unfair dismissal cases can only be brought if someone has worked for an organisation for more than two years, unless it is a case of discrimination or whistleblowing.Khan began working for the civil service in 2014 and became an adviser in 2018. It is not known whether she has unbroken service.There was outrage surrounding Cummings’ move to fire Khan last Thursday, with No 10 described as operating amid a “climate of fear”.The prime minister also faces being summoned to the Commons on Monday to answer an urgent question on the handling of the case."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3c84b68a61f87e87ab6f4ceb74fe2b634c13a90/0_0_712_427/master/712.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46a5d6117fe8233cf794193913e0d5fc","title":"get ready for brexit government launches information blitz","story":"Public advertising campaign said to be country’s biggest ever urges Britons to visit websiteThe billboards have been unveiled, the branded mugs have been ordered and the adverts will soon start following you around the internet after the government launched what it claimed to be the largest ever public information campaign in an effort to prepare the British public for leaving the EU.The Get Ready for Brexit campaign went live on Sunday, stating that the UK would be leaving the EU on 31 October and urging the public to visit a new website to check what they needed to do to prepare for a no-deal exit.The slogan appeared for the first time on a giant advertising screen next to a John Lewis store at the Westfield shopping centre in Stratford, east London, looming over visitors.Downing Street has previously briefed that the taxpayer-funded advertising campaign will cost up to £100m, although doubts have been raised over whether the government will realistically be able to spend that much on a campaign lasting just two months. One leading advertising industry source pointed out that this figure was substantially higher than the amount spent on traditional advertising in the UK by major consumer brands such as Amazon, Tesco and Asda in the whole of 2018.This suggests that either the government is overstating the amount it intends to spend in an attempt to draw extra attention or that Downing Street really is launching an advertising campaign that will be unequalled in its ubiquity.The Get Ready campaign, which shares its name with a song by the Temptations and an album by New Order, is likely to incorporate television, radio, newspaper and online adverts. Roadshows are expected to take place across the country, and online video tutorials are promised.According to the Times, a substantial order has been placed for branded mugs and T-shirts and there were claims that the government briefly considered reusing the Vote Leave slogan “take back control” on the official campaign.Theresa May’s administration spent relatively small amounts, measured in the hundreds of thousands of pounds, on publicly funded advertising campaigns supporting her abandoned withdrawal agreement in the run-up to the original Brexit deadline in March.Pro-Europe campaign groups have suggested the Get Ready campaign might not conform with government communications guidelines that ban adverts which could be construed as party political.Best for Britain’s chairman, Lord Malloch-Brown, claimed the campaign could be seen as using public money to support a potential Conservative general election campaign. He said it was factually inaccurate to claim the UK was ready for a no-deal departure from the EU.“The argument that the government is ready for Brexit may be one of the defining issues for a general election campaign,” said the pro-EU campaigner in his letter to cabinet secretary Mark Sedwill. “If the government’s campaign starts before 31 October, then government advertising that makes this claim will effectively be supporting the governing party’s re-election campaign.”However, pro-Brexit campaigners have already drawn comparison with the millions spent on leaflets delivered to every house in the UK during the 2016 EU referendum by David Cameron’s government in support of the remain campaign.This is not the first public information campaign called Get Ready for Brexit. Dutch port operators launched a website with the same name in January, suggesting foreign countries may have been doing their best to educate businesses on the risks of a disorderly Brexit for longer than the UK government."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71464038d28279564949464bfdec853776d52ebe/0_55_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=847dd7dc6ce738fc4f079a5e0214d0e7","title":"government to scrap plans for henry viii power to end free movement","story":"Legal experts warned against Priti Patel’s decision to change law immediately after Brexit deadlineThe government has been forced to scrap plans for a law that would end freedom of movement at midnight on 31 October in a no-deal scenario, according to reports.In a shift of policy, the home secretary, Priti Patel, had planned secondary legislation to stop freedom of movement for EU citizens into the UK, but has been forced to accept that the move could have landed the government in court.Her decision caused outrage when it was revealed last month, with the Liberal Democrats’ Ed Davey branding her plan “completely detached from reality … the next chapter in the never-ending saga of the utter mess they are making of Brexit”.Free movement of EU citizens does not end automatically as a result of a no-deal Brexit, as EU law continues to apply until its legal foundation is repealed.At 11pm UK time on 31 October the UK would, by default, become a “third country” in terms of relations with the EU, with no overarching post-Brexit plan in place and no transition period. The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the £39bn orce payment.The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports – making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO “most favoured nation” rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.WTO rules only cover goods – they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK’s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally – the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK’s trading relationship.The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azevêdo, has told Prospect magazine that “in simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none”.Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses – eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a “managed” no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.Theresa May had planned to end free movement through the immigration bill, but the proposed legislation, along with several other key new laws, have not made it through parliament because the Brexit crisis has choked the legislative process.Patel thought she could get around this using a so-called “Henry VIII power” but experts including Alexandra Sinclair, a fellow at the Public Law Project, told the House of Commons library researchers that any such move “might run into difficulties”.The Institute for Government’s programme director for Brexit, Joe Owen, said it would be “wide open to judicial review”.“On a practical level the plan is so close to impossible – if not entirely impossible – that one wonders whether the government is serious about making it work.”The shift in policy did not involve any assessment of how employers, landlords or Border Force officials would be able to distinguish between EU citizens already legally resident in the UK and those coming to the UK for the first time after a no-deal exit from the EU.In a statement which did not address points made by legal experts that free movement did not automatically end on 31 October, the Home Office said: “Freedom of movement as it currently stands will end on 31 October when the UK leaves the EU, and after Brexit the government will introduce a new, fairer immigration system that prioritises skills and what people can contribute to the UK, rather than where they came from.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6c94693b389ec03dce2474ffcf6f7bad0f8b41d/0_165_4487_2692/master/4487.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b27e08a37de61bfc7ce1fc2dfb85690","title":"javid greets britains big moment splash cash short termism austerity","story":"An end to austerity beckons, but the threat of recession resulting from a no-deal Brexit makes the chancellor’s strategy riskyAs Sajid Javid prepares to deliver his spending round statement this week, Britain is yet again on the brink of another week of Brexit chaos. But in his debut Commons set piece, the chancellor will be looking to make another point to distract from the turmoil to mark a potentially pivotal turning point: the end of austerity.Thanks to the hard work of people in Britain, he will undoubtedly say, the decade of fiscal restraint has now run its course. This is a big moment for the country: public services will get the money they badly need, and Britain will live within its means.There have been turning points in the public finances throughout history, when the spending taps are turned off and services are squeezed, before an eventual backlash as services come under strain, forcing the taps back on again.From the Geddes Axe cuts of the Conservative–Liberal coalition of the 1920s to fix the public finances after the first world war, and a similar act by the wartime coalition of the 1940s, there have been more than a dozen periods of belt-tightening in the past century.Since the spending squeeze imposed by the Conservative–Lib Dem coalition in the early 2010s, Britain has been subjected to one of the longest periods of restraint on record. More than half of current MPs have no parliamentary experience from before the banking crash, entering parliament since 2010 and knowing only the austerity age, as have millions of young voters who have turned 18 since.But for the first time since the imposition of austerity in 2010, Javid’s spending round is expected to mark the return of real-terms gains for overall departmental spending. That has not happened since 2007 – back when the chancellor was still selling risky bonds in the boom years of his investment banking career.But there is one big problem with declaring this return to normal: the political and economic situation is anything but. Britain is on the cusp of recession and a no-deal Brexit is likely to make matters worse.For that reason the spending review is only covering a 12-month period. The big decisions will need to come afterwards, given the huge scale of the uncertainty for the public finances should Britain crash out without a deal.The turning point this week is therefore more about the formalisation of a series of ad-hoc policy announcements gearing the country up for a showdown, rather than the proper end of austerity required.There are two issues it will confront. Javid says the spending round is about clearing the decks to allow greater focus on Brexit, but it will do anything but. Attempting to schedule time in the Commons this week is about running down the clock, robbing MPs of time to debate the impact of Boris Johnson extracting Britain from the EU do or die.It is also about paving the way for a possible general election. Leading voters to the polling stations is invariably accompanied by tax cuts or spending increases. Johnson will hope that splashing the cash sends a message: trust me. I can carry off Brexit and raise your living standards all at the same time.The Tories have shaken the magic money tree with abandon, producing crowd-pleasing dollops of cash for public services since Johnson’s elevation to No 10 in July.Taken together, the government’s announcements so far total about £6bn of extra spending and borrowing in 2020-21, with the largest chunk going towards reversing cuts to per-pupil funding in schools. The government will also reveal the cost of hiring 20,000 more police officers, and about £1.8bn has been announced for hospitals.But it is a high-risk strategy when a no-deal Brexit could sink the country into recession and damage the public finances, making it tough to bring about the end of austerity.The chancellor said last week that there would be no “blank cheque” for departments and that he would stay within the fiscal rules set by his predecessor, Philip Hammond.The chancellor probably has headroom of about £14bn to stay within the rules next year on the forecasts for the economy he is using, based on the assessment made by the Office for Budget Responsibility in March.But the promises shouldn’t be worth much, as the economy has changed significantly since then. Javid is escaping proper scrutiny by using these forecasts to talk about ending austerity while keeping the country’s finances on an even keel.The Resolution Foundation estimates that a true reflection of the finances to account for Britain skirting recession in recent months cuts his headroom by £10bn. According to Yael Selfin, the chief economist of KPMG, a no-deal Brexit could damage the public purse to the tune of about £40bn.“It would not make sense to rush any additional spending at this stage,” she said. “It makes sense to be prudent and say: ‘I’m going to hold back to leave a bit of margin for Brexit.’”Either way, the public finances will look very different by the end of the year, making this week’s spending review a short-term project: the promise to remain in keeping with the fiscal rules will be broken in months, if not weeks.All of this brings back ironic memories of the long-term economic plan, the ubiquitous soundbite of David Cameron and George Osborne. It had been the key plank of the 2015 election campaign, helping the Conservatives to win an unexpected majority against Ed Miliband.That too was electioneering rhetoric, but at least considered management of the economy over a longer period of time than Javid is working towards.Britain badly needs a long-term economic plan. But there is no such strategy as Javid and Johnson look to get through the next few weeks.The UK has significant scope to raise spending on public services, given historically low borrowing costs on the international market. The deficit has been cut down to a 17-year low. Rather than a panic-driven spending round, real issues must be tackled over the long term, such as reducing child poverty, improving social care, fixing the country’s productivity puzzle and reversing cuts to local council services.A turning point might have arrived. But Javid could be leading us dangerously in the wrong direction."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05dea2b553adc58b4d41dbb0e644d9e0e17fbae8/0_190_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e90280a5e7b41dd5d6ee55cbf5873893","title":"passports pets gb stickers brexit advice issued britons","story":"The Get Ready website uses multiple choice questions to offer tailored informationRenew your passport earlier than planned, buy a GB sticker for your car, and prepare to wait four months before you can take your ferret on holiday: these are all among the snippets of advice offered by the government’s new Brexit website for British citizens planning to travel to the EU after 31 October.The Get Ready site, which is accompanied by a major advertising campaign, launched on Sunday and unequivocally states that Brexit will happen by the end of next month. It asks users a series of multiple choice questions and spells out the precautions that iniduals should take immediately to make sure they are prepared for the UK to crash out of the EU without a deal.British citizens resident in the UK who have become used to easily travelling across Europe are warned to ensure that their passport has at least six months to run and told they may once again have to pay roaming charges on their mobile phones.They are also recommended to allow extra time for border checks at ports and airports and told to make sure they have travel insurance as the European health insurance card – which covers the cost of state-provided healthcare in EU countries – will not be valid in the event of a no-deal exit.People taking their UK-registered vehicles abroad will have to carry additional paperwork proving their ownership of the vehicle and potentially obtain an international driving permit, while British drivers will face a fine if they do not stick a large GB sticker on their rear bumper, even if they already have the country listed on their numberplate.Pet passports, which have made it easy for people who regularly travel abroad to take their cat, dog or ferret overseas, could become invalid in the event of no deal, with owners warned it could take up to four months to get the appropriate paperwork and blood tests from vets.Although the Get Ready site largely collates existing government advice, the list of suggestions spells out in exacting detail the impact Brexit will have on people and businesses. EU citizens living in the UK are reminded to apply to the settlement scheme “as soon as possible” if they want to remain in the country, while European students are warned that their Erasmus+ placements at British universities may no longer be valid.The advice is not detailed and does not spell out the seriousness of the consequences for Britons settled in Europe in the event of no deal. Under EU law they will become third-country nationals and will not be able to offer services to another EU country automatically or to travel for work in another EU country.The campaign group British in Europe has frequently protested that the British government has forgotten about them. The new website merely advises that “you may not be able to continue living and using services in the EU if you are not a resident”, without spelling out the gravity of the end of free movement for Britons living in the EU.The more complicated warnings are saved for businesses, although the website does not offer a hierarchy of risks. British companies are warned that they may need to pay for extra legal advice, should consider whether they need to appoint agents and representatives based in Europe, and warned of the extra regulation required if they want to continue trading in the EU after Brexit.The site warns manufacturers that they may need to change their labelling, companies that handle the data of EU citizens are told they may no longer be able to access it in the same way, and almost all companies are warned starkly: “You may not be able to trade goods with the EU if you do not get your business ready.”Most of the recommended actions are listed with a warning to “do it as soon as possible”, but with fewer than 60 days to go until the planned Brexit day, small businesses checking the website for the first time may not have time to do all the required work.However, the site shows that not everyone is affected by Brexit. British nationals who live and work in the UK, do not run a business and have no plans to travel abroad are told to sit back and relax: “Based on your responses, you do not need to take any action to prepare for the Brexit deadline of 31 October 2019.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c0a8153f69841924128c45acaf2bef684b382e0/0_622_2773_1664/master/2773.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=69bb5380c1533e187a62d3519837bee4","title":"scientists isolate drought resistant gene in barley","story":"Research led by Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, will help crops resist global heatingThe discovery of a gene in barley responsible for drought resistance will help future-proof crops against some of the effects of climate change, scientists believe.Researchers spent nearly five years isolating the specific gene – HvMYB1 – from more than 39,000 genes in barley. Tests proved that plants in which the gene is more prominently expressed are better able to survive drought.The scientists believes this finding will have important implications for the cereal industry as it faces increasing challenges from climate crisis-related drought.Peter Morris from Heriot-Watt University led the research team. “By increasing the expression of this particular gene in test plants and simulating drought conditions, we’ve been able to prove that plants in which HvMYB1 is more prominently expressed are able to survive prolonged periods of drought,” he said. “This is a significant finding that will allow more drought-resistant crops to be bred in the future.“Drought is already impacting yields, with the European cereal harvest hit particularly hard in 2018.

Nearly the same proportion said they had lost sleep over their dire finances, the charity reported.Disabled people and those with children were most likely to have gone without essentials, with nearly half of both groups reporting that this had happened to them at least once in the past 12 months.Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: “The benefits system is designed to help people with their finances in times of need, but too often our frontline staff and volunteers see a different story.“We’ve found people are losing sleep and unable to afford essential things like food and housing while receiving universal credit. It is totally unacceptable that our benefits system is not providing the financial safety net that people need.”A recent MPs’ report warned that the “spectre of destitution” hung over the UK’s poorest neighbourhoods as a result of benefits failing to keep pace with living costs, leaving poorer families at risk of being unable to meet basic food and housing needsThe average low-income couple with children would be £200 a year worse off this year as a result of the benefit freeze and poorer single parents £250 a year worse off, the Resolution Foundation has estimated.The freeze also contributed to a dramatic rise in child poverty in families with three or more children, up nine percentage points since 2013-14, and helped trap 4 million people overall in deep poverty, according to a recent report by the Social Metrics Commission.Citizens Advice called on the government to end the freeze on benefit rates and reduce the five-week wait for a first universal credit payment. Although the freeze is scheduled to end next April, this has yet to be confirmed.The charity said since the level of most benefits such as universal credit and tax credits was frozen in 2016, it was having “serious consequences”, with more than a quarter of people who claim benefits saying financial worries had made them feel lonely or isolated or affected their mental health.A government spokesperson said: “Tackling poverty will always be a priority for this government. There are no current plans to extend or maintain the benefit freeze after March 2020. Income inequality and absolute poverty are lower than in 2010, but we know some families need more support, which is why we continue to spend £95bn a year on working-age benefits.“Universal credit is supporting more than two million people and it’s working for the vast majority. Advance payments provide money urgently for people if they need it and there are measures in place to ensure repayments are affordable.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/304e59f71b304b5d2009031d840c559b1c8b6469/0_27_3716_2229/master/3716.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bdc00c9c29603c4369caf755e11a2f8b","title":"charles leclerc maiden f1 victory dedicated anthoine hubert","story":"Charles Leclerc described his maiden Formula One victory as the realisation of a childhood dream but one that he would find difficult to enjoy after the death of his friend Anthoine Hubert. Having won with an admirable drive at the Belgian Grand Prix, Leclerc also acknowledged that racing would always include an element of danger that could not be removed.Leclerc beat Lewis Hamilton to victory at Spa-Francorchamps but the 21-year-old spoke of how difficult it had been after Hubert died in the wake of a crash in an F2 race on Saturday.“We have lost a friend first of all and it’s very difficult in these situations, so I would like to dedicate this win to him,” he said. “I can’t fully enjoy my first victory but it is a memory that will live with me forever.”The pair had raced together since they were seven years old and remained good friends, sharing their ambition of making it to F1. “Since I was a child I’ve been looking up to Formula One,” Leclerc said. “Dreaming to be a Formula One driver.Hubert’s accident at the top of Eau Rouge took place at approaching 150mph and was extremely violent, involving an impact into the barriers and then a second blow from another car.Leclerc said: “It will always remain a dangerous sport. Once you are going at this speed, it is dangerous. Here Eau Rouge is quite dangerous because the wall is quite close. There will always be some corners which are challenging and more dangerous than others.”Hamilton, who chased Leclerc to the flag, also acknowledged what a strong job the 21-year-old had done all season against his Ferrari teammate, Sebastian Vettel. “His results speak for him,” he said. “It is not easy for any driver to jump into a top team like Ferrari against a four-times world champion with God knows how much experience and then to continuously, race on race, outperform, out-qualify and out-drive him.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e972ed217a9da30f2d74494d11195a8781f61824/0_233_3405_2042/master/3405.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6f61e8318d2e2e6c57aedcf2c195ce8","title":"western storm southern vipers super league heather knight","story":"• Southern Vipers 172-7 Western Storm 174-4• Heather Knight hits 78 not out in six-wicket winWestern Storm became the first team to win the Kia Super League title twice, repeating their feat from 2017 against the same opposition as they once again pipped Southern Vipers at the post, chasing down their target of 173 with six wickets in hand but only six balls to spare.Fittingly it was the captain, Heather Knight, who hit the winning runs, punching a four down the ground as she finished unbeaten on 78 from 53 balls having earlier become the only player to top 1,000 runs in the competition. “It was special,” she said.“I’m really chuffed for the girls. We deserved to win the final, the way we’ve played. It shows the fight of that group of girls – the belief we’ve had and built up over the last 10 group games.”Storm had wobbled from the first, their star of last season, Smriti Mandhana, departing first ball thanks to a brilliant ing catch by Marie Kelly at mid-on.While Rachel Priest hung around throughout the powerplay, helping Storm rack up 50 for one, her departure in the seventh over – stumped by Carla Rudd – slowed things. Western Storm then lost Fran Wilson and Sophie Luff in successive overs, leaving them 103 for four in the 13th over with 70 runs still needed.Western Storm’s dominance in the Super League has been founded on the depth of their batting, though: the side have won more matches than anyone across four years of the KSL, including all but one of their group stage matches this time. That depth proved crucial once again, the No 6 Deepti Sharma finishing with a 22-ball 39 that included a flurry of boundaries at the end to seal the deal.“I knew it was going to be a tough chase,” Knight said. “We just kept believing, just hanging in there, and we managed to keep the rate below 10 and then Deepti took the pressure off at the end. It’s been a tough summer, so it’s nice to finish on a high.”Danni Wyatt, who finished as the leading run-scorer with a tally of 466 and was named player of the tournament, had earlier helped Southern Vipers set an imposing total of 172 for seven in their 20 overs, hitting a 42-ball 73.It followed her effort earlier in the day as Vipers triumphed in a tight semi-final against Loughborough Lightning, chasing down their 144-run target with six balls to spare. It should have been an easy win for the Vipers after the openers Wyatt and Suzie Bates racked up 71 runs in the powerplay, but a mid-innings collapse left them relying on their middle order to finish the job.That match meant the opening pair had their eye in by the time of the final: they were able to continue where they had left off, plundering 62 from their second powerplay of the day, with even the usually reliable Freya Davies punished for 26 off her opening two overs.Only an astounding caught-and-bowled from Sonia Odedra, breaking out of her follow-through to fling out her left hand and snatch the ball at full stretch, was enough to cut off Bates in mid-flow as she departed for 26.Wyatt hung around long enough this time to bring up a 27-ball half-century that included two sixes to leg, but she was eventually dismissed in the 15th over, caught at long-on by Anya Shrubsole going for one big hit too many.That was the cue for the Vipers’ second middle-order collapse of the day – Maia Bouchier and Tammy Beaumont both also falling in the space of six balls – and it ultimately probably cost them the trophy.The occasion saw the final curtain fall on the Kia Super League, which is being replaced next season by the Women’s Hundred.“The KSL has proved that ambitious plans and innovative ways of working can deliver fantastic outcomes,” Clare Connor, the ECB’s director of women’s cricket and the woman who originally conceived the competition, said. “We will take those learnings forward with us over the coming years to ensure that more women and girls can aspire to play cricket at the highest level.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74e1ad70da568158c834e8f4b07bb547a3a43982/0_0_4928_3280/master/4928.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=440b44f12566a7b014010a05af7289cd 1440w","title":"german president asks poland for forgiveness at ww2 ceremony","story":"Frank-Walter Steinmeier makes speech at Warsaw event to mark 80 years since start of warThe German president vowed his country would never forget the atrocities of the Nazi period on Sunday as he asked forgiveness from Poland during a series of commemorative events to mark the 80th anniversary of the outbreak of the second world war.“In no other square in Europe do I find it more difficult to speak, and to address you in my native language of German ... I ask for forgiveness for Germany’s historical guilt and I recognise our enduring responsibility,” Frank-Walter Steinmeier said at a ceremony in Piłsudski Square in Warsaw.Steinmeier and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, joined a number of heads of state at the ceremony. Other events were held in Wieluń, which was heavily bombarded by the German air force on the first day of the war and Westerplatte, where the first shots of the war were fired when a German battleship opened fire on a Polish garrison in the early hours of 1 September.“It is hard to imagine that cataclysm of history today, the armed conflict which brought the most disastrous consequences in the history of mankind. We have to remember, and therefore we are gathered here today,” the Polish president, Andrzej Duda, said at the Warsaw ceremony.Poland’s nationalist government had hoped that the US president, Donald Trump, would be the guest of honour, but he cancelled at the last minute and sent his vice-president, Mike Pence, in his place.Despite the atmosphere of reconciliation, different politicians drew very different conclusions about the lessons of the war.There was a note of anger in Duda’s speech, as he said Europe should have stood up to the Nazis earlier. “Perhaps the second world war would not have broken out in the first place, if the states in the west had put up a decisive resistance against … the imperial ambitions of Hitler,” he said.By way of comparison, Duda also criticised western leaders who propose rapprochement with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, after Moscow’s actions in Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine in 2014. “Turning a blind eye is not the recipe for preserving peace. It is a simple way to give consent to further attacks,” he said.Putin was present at a similar commemoration 10 years ago, but was not invited this year because of the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and Russia’s new revisionist historical policy, which downplays the Nazi-Soviet pact agreed a week before Germany attacked Poland.The Soviet Union, in accordance with a secret protocol of the pact, invaded Poland from the east on 17 September. Putin called the pact a mistake a decade ago, but Russia’s foreign ministry has embarked on a campaign in recent weeks to show it as necessary and even a diplomatic triumph.Pence used his speech to talk as much about Soviet atrocities as Nazi crimes, paying tribute to Polish bravery and quoting the Russian writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn. The main problem of the 20th century was that men had forgotten God, he said.The European commission vice-president, Frans Timmermans, attended the ceremony in Westerplatte and had a different message. He said the best way to honour the memory of the war dead was by “working for tolerance, working for mutual respect, working to remove the feeding ground of those who propose intolerance”. Timmermans has been a vocal critic of the current Polish government.The Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, raised another thorny issue, using his speech at Westerplatte to demand Germany pay reparations for the devastation of Poland during the war.“We have to talk about, remember and demand the truth regarding those losses. We have to demand compensation,” he said. German officials have insisted that the matter is closed and they will not pay reparations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e9047ee9c25d1d0105531e47a38b9315eca4c4b/0_777_2674_1605/master/2674.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7da7c79059919778326f7467917cc1bc","title":"statue red army general prague vandals czech capital","story":"Monument has become focus of a row between the Czech capital and its Russian embassyA statue of a second world war Red Army general repeatedly targeted by vandals has been covered with a tarpaulin amid an escalating row between Czech officials and Russia’s embassy in Prague over its status.Authorities in the Czech capital’s Bubeneč district put the imposing monument honouring Marshal Ivan Konev under cover after saying they were no longer prepared to keep cleaning it following repeated paint and graffiti attacks.The move – announced by the mayor of Prague 6 municipality, Ondřej Kolář – has further inflamed passions over the 40-year-old statue, long controversial in the Czech Republic because of Konev’s role as an enforcer of Soviet military power in postwar eastern Europe.Kolář, a member of the pro-EU Top 09 party, said he had been forced to leave Prague after being given police protection, which was put in place on Friday after he received threats by email, social media and text message.“People were calling my office, threatening even my assistants,” he said. “A few have also come personally to the town hall, asking the receptionists where I could be found so they can beat me up.”The Russian embassy denounced his decision on its Facebook page as a “repeated disgrace” and noted that it was “taken on the eve of the 80th anniversary of the start of the worst military conflict in human history”. Konev was twice officially recognised as a hero of the Soviet Union by Stalin.The tarpaulin, supported by a large scaffold frame, was torn off three times after being fitted on Friday. Two men were arrested and charged with damaging the cover after they were observed leaving the scene in the early hours of Saturday morning. Czech media attributed the damage to “activists”, widely believed to be pro-Russian.Temporary fencing has been installed to foil further attempts to rip off the cover. A council spokesman said it would remain at least until 12 September, when the statue’s future will be discussed at a council meeting.At the weekend, a worker re-covered the monument, located on Interbrigády Square – a neighbourhood that also hosts the Czech defence ministry and army headquarters – while opposing groups of activists gathered under the watch of two police officers.Petr Lázňovský, 48, a pro-democracy campaigner waving a large Nato flag, called the controversy an example of the “hybrid warfare” he said Russia was waging on the Czech Republic.“The crucial point for me is that the Russian embassy, in its Facebook post, claimed it had received letters from Czech citizens wondering which side in the second world war would the Prague 6 mayor have preferred to have won,” he said. “They are implying that Mayor Kolář is pro-Nazi. This is unacceptable for me.”The statue, which is owned by the Czech state, was commissioned during the cold war by the communist regime that then ruled the former Czechoslovakia, in recognition of Konev’s supposed feat in liberating Prague from Nazi occupation in 1945 – an assertion dismissed by historians, who argue the city was already free when his forces arrived.Kolář insisted he did not dispute that Soviet forces “had liberated a great part of Czechoslovakia” and added: “We are grateful to those men in arms who sacrificed their lives for our freedom.”Russia reacted angrily last year after the council amended the original plaque and added others citing Konev’s lesser-known role in more notorious episodes – namely the suppression of the 1956 Hungarian uprising, the building of the Berlin Wall, and the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia that crushed the Prague Spring.Last month, the statue was defaced with red paint as Czechs marked the invasion’s 51st anniversary, prompting Kolář to say the council would not repair the damage.The mayor has previously offered to give the statue to the embassy so it can be displayed on its grounds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2583df5ad79ddb7c935ff72e8919bfe3afca7213/0_138_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bed8ca74ac7a390a6c744b08e2c42880","title":"leaked no deal report says lorries could face 48 hour delays at dover","story":"‘Clear and present danger’ to supply chain, say hauliers, with no sign of new customs processLeaked government documents which reportedly say there could be 48-hour delays at Dover in the event of a no-deal Brexit have moved hauliers to warn of the “clear and present danger” to the UK supply chain.Sky News said it had seen documents which suggest vehicles could face a two-day delay at the Kent port in a no-deal scenario, and the revelation has led to industry insiders saying the government has “failed to deliver”.Rod McKenzie, the managing director of policy at the Road Haulage Association (RHA), said it came as absolutely no surprise to him that such a document existed, adding that there was still no sign of a new customs process with just weeks left before the UK is expected to leave the EU.He had not seen the Department for Transport documents (DfT), but said he understood they were more recent than the leaked Operation Yellowhammer files which contained predictions of a three-month “meltdown” at ports in the event of no deal.“The Road Haulage Association has been saying this for quite literally years now that if there is a no-deal Brexit, there will be very substantial queues at the border,” McKenzie said. “We have got a very, very serious problem with the UK supply chain if there is a no-deal Brexit on 31 October from where we are now.“This is a clear and present danger to the supply chain on which we all depend, and we are calling on the government in the clearest terms to make it clear what traders have to do to trade with the continent. This they have failed to do so far.”Sky News said on Sunday night that analysis commissioned by the DfT suggested that on the first day of a no-deal Brexit, the worst-case scenario would be a two-day maximum delay for freight and vehicles at Dover, and an average wait of a day-and-a-half.McKenzie said any delay at the ports would cause a “very, very substantial traffic jam”, adding: “What we are saying is that we urgently need clarity from this government, having not had it from the previous government, we urgently need clarity from this government of what traders have to do to get ready for a no-deal Brexit.”On 7 August, the RHA was among organisations meeting Michael Gove, who is in charge of planning for no deal, plus the home secretary, Priti Patel, and the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, in Dover to discuss preparations for Brexit at the border. He said there have been “countless” meetings with both the current and previous government. “What we need is action, and we need action now. And there’s this gap between what they say they’re going to do and what they have so far failed to deliver.”Kevin Green of the Freight Transport Association – which speaks for the logistics industry – said he was concerned that there was “still much which the sector needs clarification on in order to ensure that Britain keeps trading after Brexit”.He added: “The sector is flexible and agile but needs to know what it is preparing for – and today’s report shows that there is still much that is uncertain. With so little time left, logistics businesses need the support of government to ensure that the UK’s interconnected supply chain is protected after the UK leaves the EU.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb675db88ef06a2afdbfeada5b73373266d20884/0_116_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=37418dee7e622f6414c3cfb2b61422b2","title":"hurricane dorian category 5 storm bahamas florida south north carolina updates","story":"Dorian made landfall at Great Abaco Island on Sunday, the equal strongest Atlantic hurricane landfall on recordThe prime minister of the Bahamas shared this earlier today. We are still waiting for news of the damage inflicted on Bahamian islands from the hurricane and if any injuries and fatalities have occurred.The hourly update has come through from the national Hurricane Center. Not much has changed – the hurricane is still over the Abacos, it is still life-threatening, residents urged to remain in their shelters.How are hurricanes or tropical storms rated?Hurricanes are rated according to their sustained wind speed. From 1-5, this scale estimates potential property damage. According to the US National Hurricane Centre, storms reaching category 3 and higher are considered major, because of their potential for significant loss of life and damage.Hurricane ratings and likely damage:Some updates from authorities about preparation and evacuation in Florida.For those interested in how hurricanes are named – that’s determined by the World Meteorological Organisation, which publishes lists it rotates every six years. There are 10 different lists, corresponding to 10 differing geographic zones, stretching from the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico and North Atlantic to the Northern and Southwestern Indian Ocean zones. Storms are named alphabetically in the year they occur. So Dorian is the fourth hurricane this year in that zone. The next one will be named Erin. Originally storms were only given female names, but in 1979, men’s names were introduced and now the genders alternate. The 2019 names will be used again in 2025, unless there is a storm so deadly or costly that using its name again would be inappropriate. For example, Maria, the hurricane that hit the Caribbean in 2017, will not be used again. Nor will Sandy or Katrina, that hit the US in 2012 and 2005 respectively.You can see a full list of names here. The prime minister of the Bahamas has tweeted an update. Doesn’t add a huge amount of information, but good to know that powerinternet is working in Nassau.Brian Kemp has announced that people living in a number of communities will be required to evacuate their areas from noon Monday due to the hurricane.The western eyewall of Hurricane Dorian is now over the eastern part of Grand Bahama, the northernmost island of the Bahamas, which has a population of 52,000 people.According to a new update from the National Hurricane Center “conditions will continue to deteriorate over the remainder of Grand Bahama Island tonight” and residents are warned to remain in their shelters and not to leave the shelter when the eye of the hurricane passes overhead.ZNS Bahamas, the broadcasting corporation of the country, has been publishing videos throughout the day from the Abaco Islands in the northern Bahamas, which are currently being hit by the hurricane.These are from earlier in the day, the most recent from four hours ago. It has been difficult to get news from the Abacos as the hurricane has caused an island-wide power outage, affecting landline, mobile and broadband services, according to the Bahamas Telecommunications Company.Residents on the Abaco Islands, in the Bahamas, which is currently being pounded by Hurricane Dorian, have posted videos on social media showing floodwaters halfway up the sides of single-family homes with parts of the roofs torn off. Car alarms blared across the island, which was littered with twisted metal and splintered wood.A statement from BTC, a telecommunications company, said Abaco was experiencing “an island-wide power outage” that has affected their landline, mobile and broadband services.The pummeling was expected to last for hours as the hurricane may slow to just 1 mph (1.6 kph), “prolonging its catastrophic effects,” the NHC said. Bahamian Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said in a nationally televised news conference that a “deadly storm and a monster storm” was battering the region. The islands’ homes are built to withstand winds of at least 150 mph (241 kph), but the 20-foot (6-metre) storm surge is higher than the average roof. “This will put us to a test that we’ve never confronted before,” he said. “This is probably the most sad and worst day of my life to address the Bahamian people. I just want to say as a physician I’ve been trained to withstand many things, but never anything like this.” A new update is in from the National Hurricane Center, which is still warning residents of the Abacos to remain in their shelters, saying the situation continues to be “life-threatening”.Residents in the Grand Bahamas are being warned not to leave their shelters as the eye passes over them, “as winds will rapidly increase on the other side of the eye”.Wind gusts are at more than 220mph (355kmh) and storm surges are 18-23 ft (5.5m-7m) above normal tide levels.‘I’m not sure I’ve even heard of a category 5’ says Donald Trump about Hurricane Dorian – videoAnd as a reminder, here are the previous times that Donald Trump has been equally surprised to learn of the existence of category 5 storms.Hurricane Dorian wreaks havoc on Bahamas as ‘catastrophic’ Category 5 storm – videoTrump tweeted earlier today that the hurricane will hit Alabama. The Birmingham office of the National Weather Service then tweeted that Alabama would “NOT” see any effects from Dorian.Despite their clarification, Trump repeated the claim at his press conference earlier today, saying:“And, I will say, the states – and it may get a little piece of a great place: It’s called Alabama. And Alabama could even be in for at least some very strong winds and something more than that, it could be. This just came up, unfortunately. It’s the size of – the storm that we’re talking about.

Photograph: iStockThe obsession with university education in Ireland means many school leavers are bypassing more suitable vocational routes, according to the new chief of the State body for further education and training.Andrew Brownlee, who takes over as chief executive of Solas on Monday, said higher education has played a massive and positive role in the transformation of the country.However, he said he is concerned there are in sufficient vocational pathways and options for students at second level.“We have a cultural issue in Ireland where there’s an almost obsession with people going into higher education. And I think there is an opportunity now to see if we have that balance right,” said Mr Brownlee.About 60 per cent of school leavers here progress to higher education each year, one of the highest proportions in the European Union, while comparatively few enter further education and training.However, Mr Brownlee – formerly a senior official in the Higher Education Authority – said further education offered a valuable route into employment or into higher education without having to make a four-year commitment.“We need to start getting that message across. I do think it’s the right option for a much more significant group of school leavers than are choosing that at present,” he said.Outcomes for further-education courses were excellent, he said, with 90 per cent of graduates either in employment or in others forms of education.“A 17- or 18-year-old doesn’t always know what the right option is. Sometimes a one year post-Leaving Cert course or 18-month traineeship can help in deciding what the best option is.“Maybe it’s higher education or something else – but they don’t have to make that four-year commitment. I think we have a real offering which we can make more of in the next few years.”He said Solas is exploring the idea of offering “taster” courses for further education and training courses during secondary school.There was a similar model in Scotland, he said, where such modules formed part of the equivalent of the Leaving Cert.Another area Mr Brownlee wants Solas to explore is whether further education options could be included in the Central Applications Office course preference process. They could gives students much greater visibility of college courses and further-education options when deciding on career options.Overall, Mr Brownlee said more work was needed to make the links between further-education courses and higher education clearer. At present, about one-in-five students going into institutes of technology have come from the further-education sector. While many further-education courses offer routes into certain third-level courses, this isn’t always clear or consistent, he said.Reform agendaMr Brownlee signalled that wider reforms will be needed to “unleash the full potential” of the sector over the coming years. He said there were more than two dozen types of programmes on offer which could be simplified.One criticism levelled at further-education colleges is that they mirror the secondary school year and close for the summer. Mr Brownlee said Solas will examine ways to ensure they are open for longer and meet the need for more up-skilling and “bite-sized” courses.“We’re going to look at how we develop a more flexible, year-round approach and how to use technology to deliver year-round courses . . . and find ways to ensure our facilities are open throughout the year and can service needs at different points in time.”He said Solas will work closely with trade unions who, he said, were “very important stakeholders”.“They are committed to the future of further education and technology as well and they recognise the need to develop and chance. Teachers and instructors are critical stakeholders in moving this forward.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4004072.1567346651!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"forestry industry rejects misinformation on commercial forests","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAn agriforestry site on Leo Murphy’s farm in Kilcock, Co Kildare. Photograph: Iain White As the Government unveils plans to plant 22 million trees every year over the next two decades, Ireland’s forestry industry has rejected what it has called “misinformation” about the environmental impact of commercial sitka forests, citing new data which shows the extent to which they contribute to reducing carbon emissions.Mark McAuley, director of Ibec’s Forest Industries Ireland (FII), the main body representing the sector, says Ireland’s forests are absorbing millions of tonnes of CO2 and are helping to lead the way in the fight against climate change.They absorb the yearly CO2 equivalent to that emitted by 1.67 million cars or 655,000 homes on top of long-term carbon capture, according to FII analysis.He has also strongly defended the widespread growing of sitka spruce in Ireland, which he describes as the workhorse of the forestry sector.Climate change activists from the Extinction Rebellion group, which shut down a Dublin city centre street on Saturday, interrupted the recent FII conference in the Botanic Gardens. McAuley says they were mainly targeting Minister for Climate Action and Environment Richard Bruton, and his organisation was unfairly subjected to collateral damage.He says forestry is “a big ticket item in fighting climate change” with the backing of the UN, wildlife broadcaster David Attenborough, the World Wildlife Fund and WHO.“Let’s get real and do the thing that works,” he says, noting that it is essential that landowners “get a few bob out of it” to encourage more planting. Sitka is being planted “because there is a return in it”, he says.A typical Irish forest would have 15 per cent of area for bioersity, including corridors and pathways, and 15 per cent for broadleaf trees. “It’s over-egged. People look at it and say, ‘it’s all sitka’, but it’s not true,” he says. “A plantation is mixed now. There’s no such thing as a pure coniferous plantation.”In addition to helping tackle climate change, forestry creates jobs, wealth, enterprises and exports, he says.While the Government’s climate action plan, published in June, proposed 8,000 hectares – or 19,768 acres – of new forestry every year in a bid to capture carbon emissions, it did not specify the number of trees involved. In its latest calculations, it suggests this will involve 2,500 conifers or 3,300 broad-leaf trees for every hectare planted. The target is for 70 per cent conifers and 30 per cent broad leaves.McAuley says current planting rates in Ireland are not what they should be – it would be lucky if 4,000 hectares were planted this year. There are systemic and policy blockages preventing the sector reaching the higher rate though he believes it can be done.Currently, there is a pinchpoint, which can be resolved only by getting 21,000 farmers back involved in forestry, McAuley says.McCauley says he has no problem with people saying they don’t like big swathes of sitka in their communities that they prefer looking out on traditional landscapes, but he objects to “falsehoods, such as it’s no good for climate change”.“Managed forests are particularly good at absorbing CO2 as they grow fast and when they are felled, the CO2 is stored in long-life timber products. Then the trees are planted again and you get a second load of CO2 being taken out of the atmosphere.“There are 770,000 hectares of forestry in Ireland, or 11 per cent of the country. As they grow, these trees absorb an extra 3.6 million tonnes of CO2 each year from the atmosphere which equates to the amount of CO2 emitted by almost 655,000 homes. Put another way, that’s the equivalent of taking over 1.67 million cars off the roads.”Forests are a natural carbon capture and storage system that will benefit the whole world for generations to come, he adds. “Forests clean the air that we breathe. Trees suck up carbon as they grow, lock it into timber products and displace less environmentally-friendly products.”More than 56.4 million cubic metres of timber will be harvested in Ireland in the next 10 years. “That’s 56.4 million tonnes of harmful CO2 locked away. At least half of the mass of timber will be sequestered in long-life timber products that go to building our homes.”More carbon-intensive building products such as steel and concrete are being displaced by using timber to build. “We should certainly be building our houses and civic buildings with timber, and great progress is being made in the design and technology of large timber buildings.”Current building standards limit timber buildings to three storeys, notwithstanding the performance of cross-laminated timber. London, in contrast, allows timber buildings of up to 12 storeys, he notes, while the portion of timber, such as wood chip, used for bioenergy is displacing fossil fuels.Ireland has the best conditions in the world for growing trees backed by a world-class forest industry, he says. “Sitka spruce tree grows fast and is what we need to produce construction timber. Houses all over the country are built with our sitka spruce. If we did not produce timber, we would have to import it. Sitka is the workhorse of the forestry sector it is often compared to the Friesian cow for the Irish dairy sector, given the thousands of jobs it has helped to create in rural Ireland.”Forestry figures770,000 hectares of Irish forests capture 312 million tonnes of CO2.The national forest estate absorbs an additional 3.6 million tonnes of CO2 every year enough to cover the emissions from 60 per cent of the cars on Irish roads.Every cubic metre of timber product stores about 1 tonne of CO2.The “timber mobilisation value” or money that will be earned by forestry owners, timber hauliers, forestry workers and contractors in Ireland between 2017-2035 will be €6.45 billion (FII analysis).Total employment in the forestry sector in Ireland is some 12,000 people, and expected to grow to 18,000 with expansion in line with the Government’s climate action plan."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4004502.1567370388!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"mike pence to arrive in ireland for first official visit as vice president","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPresident Donald Trump with vice-president Mike Pence. Photograph: Chip SomodevillaGettyUS vice-president Mike Pence begins his official visit to Ireland when he flies into Shannon Airport on Monday.Mr Pence will be greeted on arrival at Shannon by Tánaiste Simon Coveney in the late afternoon, marking the beginning of a three-day visit involving a mix of official and private engagements.Mr Coveney and Mr Pence will hold a meeting at the airport.The 48th vice-president of the United States will stay at president Donald Trump’s family golf resort at Doonbeg in west Co Clare for the two nights he will be in Ireland. He will travel by motorcade between the resort and Shannon where the vice-presidential jet, Air Force Two, will be based.On Tuesday morning, Mr Pence will fly from Shannon to Dublin for meetings, first with President Michael D Higgins at Áras an Uachtaráin in the Phoenix Park, and then lunch and a bilateral meeting with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar at nearby Farmleigh.Among the topics expected to be discussed at their meeting are Brexit, immigration and trade.Later this week Mr Pence will travel on to Iceland and the United Kingdom, where the UK’s exit from the EU on October 31st and a potential future UK-US trade deal will also be the focus of his trip.The Republican’s visit takes place at a critical juncture in the Brexit process, months after high-ranking US congressional Democrats ruled out a UK-US trade deal if a disorderly, no-deal Brexit undermines the 1998 Belfast Agreement, the peace deal underpinning the Northern Irish peace process.On Tuesday afternoon, the vice-president will attend a round-table discussion with Irish and American businesspeople working in the multinational sector in Ireland at the Phoenix Park residence of the recently appointed US ambassador to Ireland Edward Crawford.Mr Pence will fly from Dublin to Shannon aboard Air Force Two later on Tuesday before travelling on to Doonbeg where he will have a private family dinner at Morrissey’s, the pub and restaurant owned by his distant cousin, Hugh McNally.Among those travelling in the vice-president’s party are his wife, second lady Karen Pence, and his sister, Anne Pence Poynter who, along with her brother, greeted Mr Varadkar and his partner, Matt Barrett, for the annual St Patrick’s Day breakfast at the Pence residence in Washington in March.Family linksMr Pence’s mother, Nancy Pence Fritsch, whose father Richard Michael Cawley emigrated to the US from a townland near Tubbercurry in Co Sligo in 1923, will also be accompanying the vice-president on his trip.Mr Cawley’s wife’s family came from Doonbeg where, as a younger man, Mr Pence worked one summer behind the bar of Morrissey’s pub.Mr Pence was close to his grandfather who worked as a bus driver in Chicago for more than 40 years.He has regularly cited his grandfather and his arrival on April 11th, 1923 at Ellis Island, the famous US entry point for emigrants in New York harbour, in political speeches.He described him at the 2017 St Patrick’s Day breakfast attended by then taoiseach Enda Kenny as “the proudest man I ever knew and the best man I ever knew”.Last month Mr Pence tweeted about his plans to travel here this week, describing Ireland as a “country that is very near to my family’s heart”.His visit was brought forward by four days after Mr Trump cancelled a trip to Poland at the weekend. He decided to send Mr Pence in his place so he could remain at home to monitor Hurricane Dorian as it reached US east coast."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4004373.1567361509!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"political parties grapple with myriad issues ahead of renewed rivalry","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar’s Fine Gael has been characterised by a party strategist as the only grouping that can ‘protect the economy’. File photograph: Cyril ByrneThe  When asked what Fine Gael’s message would be for the autumn, a party strategist thought for a moment before replying, wryly: “Let’s keep the recovery going.”As anybody who followed the 2016 general election will know, that slogan has already been taken, and the lead party in Government is unlikely to return to it anytime soon.Opposition parties, the media and, ultimately, the electorate hammered Fine Gael for it three years ago. The economic growth on paper was not trickling down to the ordinary voter, who was still struggling to find work or to make ends meet.The point the strategist was making this week, though, was that it would be perfectly suited as a slogan in late 2019.“That came 3½ years too early. Look, we are never going to use it. But if you look at the situation now where we have virtually full employment and there is strong economic growth, that is the kind of message we would want to send out. Fine Gael is the only party that can responsibly manage us through the choppy waters of Brexit, while protecting the economy.”At this moment, the storm clouds of a no-deal Brexit are gathering on the horizon. It will dominate politics in the new Dáil term that begins in September.But as the parties return after the summer recess, there are also domestic considerations. It’s a little akin to Kilkenny legend Dick O’Hara winning an All-Ireland hurling medal on Sunday afternoon and heading straight back to Thomastown to milk the cows, because nobody else could do them.The parties also need to focus on non-Brexit issues such as the budget, health, housing, broadband and climate action and the not inconsiderable matters of four byelections and a general election occurring in relatively short order.Within Fine Gael, Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe is the key figure. He might have no choice but to draft his October budget for a hard Brexit, which will mean no latitude and little spending.The other significant message from the June elections was that climate change is now a huge issue. Expect more emphasis on this, including increases in carbon tax and concrete steps on the climate action plan. Fine Gael will also play the latest jobs figures and try to improve public perception of its performance in problem areas: namely health spending, broadband and its laggard image on climate change.Like other parties, the immediate emphasis will be on the four upcoming byelections which will serve as dress rehearsals for the main event.Donohoe has also assumed the director of organisation role once played by Phil Hogan. Already he has wielded the axe, dropping Ray Butler in Meath West and Julie O’Leary in Cork North Central, as well as choosing Frankie Feighan over John Perry in Sligo-Leitrim.While nominally the main Opposition party, Fianna Fáil’s journey through this 32nd Dáíl term has been a three-legged race, its ankle tied to Fine Gael’s for the duration.From Fianna Fáil’s perspective, it is writ that Brexit will determine the budget and also the timing of the next election.“Our focus politically will be on how well or badly the Government is delivering services,” says a senior FF strategist. “On education, social welfare, housing, health, broadband.” There will also be a stronger than ever focus on climate change.“When Paschal Donohoe is delivering the budget and if he finds a hidden stack of money, like the corporation tax windfall last year, we have to ensure it is used responsibly. Is the country adequately prepared for Brexit? In agrifood and customs? What happens in November and December when companies cannot maintain their employee levels?” asked the strategist.What can Sinn Féin hope for?Sinn Féin had a bruising encounter in the May elections. Faced with potential seat losses, the party’s main aim is to consolidate by limiting seat losses.Party leader Mary Lou McDonald reshuffled her front bench, partly in the light of the May results. There was a promotion for Imelda Munster and David Cullinane was put into the climate-change portfolio, which is now a big focus for the party. Though it won’t publicly say as much, it is clear it has moved its campaign for a Border poll to a medium-term, rather than short-term, priority.Housing, broadband delivery, health, are also big issues. The Greens’ success in the May elections has escalated climate change as an issue for all parties. When one talks to Labour, Fianna Fáil, the Social Democrats, People Before Profit and Sinn Féin, they all mention this issue and also their emphasis on a “just transition”.A just transition, unsurprisingly, is high on the Green Party’s agenda. It has a Private Members’ Bill tabled for the first week of the Dáil and is also going to put a huge emphasis on forestry.“The idea is there are 120,000 farmers and if each of them were to plant one hectare of native woods over the next five years on pockets of land, it would make a huge difference. It would give better support to farmers than doling out money to the beef industry, with all the difficulties that has,” said a party source.The third big issue for the Greens is what it calls the Green New Deal, which would look at financial gains from green investment in forestry, transport, insulation and renewable energy.Senator Kevin Humphreys of Labour also mentions just transition. Housing, health and transport will also feature heavily in his party’s autumn priorities.For the Social Democrats, Sláintecare implementation is a priority issue, as is childcare and the elderly, climate change as well insurance premium costs.People Before Profit is keen to build up a left alliance. Its Dún Laoghaire TD Richard Boyd-Barrett has focused on four policy areas: a living wage a housing movement climate change and a voting pact for the byelections, which will focus minds in all the parties.An index of selected articles available exclusively to our readers with an  digital subscription "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4004314.1567357777!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"british government launches get ready for brexit campaign","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Get Ready campaign is also likely to incorporate TV, radio, newspaper and online adverts. Photograph: Govvia The billboards have been unveiled, the branded mugs have been ordered and the adverts will soon start following you around the internet after the government launched what is claimed to be the largest ever public information campaign in an attempt to prepare the British public for leaving the European Union.The Get Ready for Brexit campaign went live on Sunday, stating that the UK will be leaving the EU on October 31st and urging the public to visit a new website to check what they need to do to prepare for a no-deal exit. The slogan appeared for the first time on a giant advertising screen next to a John Lewis store at the Westfield shopping centre in Stratford, east London, looming over shoppers arriving for an end-of-summer shopping trip.Downing Street has previously briefed that the taxpayer-funded advertising campaign will cost up to £100 million (€111 million), although doubts have been raised over whether the government will realistically be able to spend that much on a campaign lasting just two months. One leading advertising industry source said this figure is substantially higher than the amount spent on traditional advertising in the UK by big consumer brands such as Amazon, Tesco and Asda in the whole of 2018.This suggests that either the government is overstating the amount it intends to spend in an attempt to draw extra attention, or that Downing Street really is launching an advertising campaign that will be unequalled in its ubiquity.Minister in charge of no-deal planning Michael Gove said “ensuring an orderly Brexit is not only a matter of national importance, but a shared responsibility”, as he launched the adverts. He also referenced government polling that showed only 50 per cent of the population think it likely the UK will leave the EU on October 31st.The same research found that 42 per cent of small- to medium-sized businesses are still unsure of how they can prepare for Brexit. And just a third of the British public have looked for information on what they will need to do, suggesting large-scale ignorance of what Brexit will involve with less than two months to go until the expected departure date.Mugs and T-shirtsThe Get Ready campaign, which shares its name with a song by the Temptations and an album by New Order, is likely to incorporate TV, radio, newspaper and online adverts. Roadshows are expected to take place across the country and online video tutorials are promised. According to the London Times there has also been a substantial order placed for branded mugs and T-shirts, amid claims that the government briefly considered reusing the Vote Leave slogan “take back control” on the official campaign.Theresa May’s administration spent relatively small amounts, measured in the hundreds of thousands of pounds, on publicly funded advertising campaigns supporting her abandoned withdrawal agreement in the run-up to the original Brexit deadline in March.This is not the first public information campaign called Get Ready for Brexit. Dutch port operators launched a website with the same name in January, suggesting foreign countries may have been doing their best to educate businesses on the risks of a disorderly Brexit for longer than the UK government. – Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Lucy WorboysAFPGetty ImagesSouth Carolina’s governor has ordered a mandatory evacuation of the state’s entire coast as Hurricane Dorian threatens. Henry McMaster’s order goes into effect from noon on Monday, when state troopers will begin reversing lanes so that people can all head inland on major coastal highways.The order covers nearly one million people, many of whom are evacuating for the fourth time in four years.Mr McMaster says he knows some people will not be happy having to leave their home. But he says “we believe we can keep everyone alive”.The National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecasts the centre of Dorian is to stay off shore while paralleling the South Carolina coast starting on Wednesday afternoon. But a small error in the forecast could send the eye and strongest winds into the state.Earlier, Hurricane Dorian crashed into the Bahamas on Sunday as the second strongest Atlantic storm on record, and inched closer to the United States, with parts of Florida evacuating, and Georgia and the Carolinas bracing for wind and flooding. The NHC said Dorian made landfall on Elbow Cay in the Abaco Islands as a category 5 storm on Sunday with maximum sustained winds of 295 km per hour and gusts of more than 354 kmph. It made a second landfall on Great Abaco Island near Marsh Harbor. Millions of people from Florida to North Carolina were bracing to see whether Dorian avoids a US landfall and veers north into the Atlantic Ocean. Even a glancing blow from one of the strongest storms ever to menace Florida could bring torrential rains and damaging winds, and “a Florida landfall is still a distinct possibility,” the Miami-based NHC warned. Bahamas residents reported trees snapping and docks being destroyed before the brunt of the storm arrived. The pummelling was expected to last for hours as the hurricane may slow to just 1 mph, “prolonging its catastrophic effects,” the NHC said. On Great Guana Cay, just off Great Abaco Island, waves began washing over low-lying parts of the tiny 14 km strand of land that is only about 400m wide by mid-morning, resident Tom Creenan said.Although some residents left for Nassau and elsewhere days ago, some 200 to 300 are riding out the storm on Great Guana Cay, where power was already out and forecasters are predicting up to 61 cm of rain and 6.1 meter storm surges.FloridaAfter churning over the Bahamas, it is expected to veer northwest toward Florida, with the Miami-based NHC raising its alert on Sunday for parts of the state’s east coast to a tropical storm warning.With those warnings and the storm intensifying, adjoining Palm Beach and Martin counties issued mandatory evacuations for some residents, including those in mobile homes, barrier islands and low-lying areas. Other counties along the coast have announced voluntary evacuations.While not expected to strike Florida, the NHC cautioned residents to remain on alert and said “a Florida landfall is still a distinct possibility.”Communities further north in Georgia and South Carolina raised alert levels on Saturday, with residents filling sandbags as authorities tested infrastructure and hurricane drills.While Dorian could spare the US a direct impact, the NHC warned the category 5 storm on the five-step Saffir-Simpson Wind Scale would lash millions from Florida to the Carolinas with strong winds and punishing surf.“This has been a slow-moving storm,” Peter Gaynor, acting Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) administrator, told CNN, adding the hurricane was expected to stall off of West Palm Beach, Florida, on Monday and linger along the US coast until Friday. “This is a serious storm. You can’t take your eye off it. You have to make preparations now.”TouristsMost tourists who planned to leave the Bahamas got out before the main airport closed on Friday night.Jeffrey Simmons, the deputy director of Bahamas’ department of meteorology, said Dorian will cause prolonged periods of large swells and storm surges along the north coast of Grand Bahama and the north and east coast of Abaco.Potential damage to the Bahamas from Dorian could be exacerbated by the fact that its westward motion is forecast to slow, keeping it over the islands for longer, the Bahamas National Emergency Management Agency said in a statement.Bahamas prime minister Hubert Minnis begged residents of Abaco and Grand Bahamas to head for the main island to escape the “devastating, dangerous” storm.“I want you to remember: homes, houses, structures can be replaced. Lives cannot be replaced,” he told a news conference on Saturday, adding that 73,000 people and 21,000 homes were at risk from storm surges.Foreign affairs adviceThe Irish Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) advises tourists travelling to the Caribbean region to “exercise due caution and monitor local news and weather reports” in light of Hurricane Dorian’s impending arrival. In relation to the region’s hurricane season, which runs from July to October each year, DFA says “citizens with plans to be in the affected region during this period should consider the need to travel based on information relating to extreme weather projections”. “You should pay close attention to local and international weather reports and follow the advice of local authorities.” As there is no embassy or consulate in the Bahamas, DFA says they are “limited in the help we can offer you in an emergency situation. However, if you need assistance, you can contact the Honorary Consulate in Nassau or the Irish Embassy in Ottawa.”Flights affectedAer Lingus flights from Dublin Airport to Miami have been affected by the storm. On Sunday, a flight to Miami scheduled to leave at 3.50pm left early at 1.25pm due to Hurricane Dorian. The Aer Lingus Miami to Dublin flight on Sunday evening has also been brought forward by three-and-a-half hours, and is due to leave at 7.10pm local time, and land at 7.40am Irish time on Monday morning. Flights on Monday September 2nd with Aer Lingus in and out of Orlando have been cancelled, with the airline advising travellers to contact them to re-book. - Reuters "},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons august 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Order The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Death toll climbs to seven in second Texas mass shooting in a monthAt least two children in every class have contemplated suicide because of bullying, Diana Award study revealsTeachers\u0026#39 starting salaries to rise to £30,000Heart checks while you shop: NHS announces plan to have pharmacies check shoppers\u0026#39 heart health in bid to cut deathsNational Trust blames summer heatwave for missing visitor target as it sounds warning about climateComedian Kevin Hart suffers \u0026#39major back injuries\u0026#39 in South California crashVeterans who helped crack Nazi code reunited at Bletchley park on 80 year Polish invasion anniversary Boris is prepared to ignore the law to get Brexit through on October 31David Gauke and other Tory rebels consider siding with Labour as the effort to stop no deal beginsDay by day: How the most explosive week in politics for years might play out Facebook urged not to encrypt children\u0026#39s messaging accounts over NSPCC grooming fearsBoris Johnson warns rebel MPs: back me or be sackedTom Watson to face calls to resign when extent of ties to \u0026#39Nick\u0026#39 are revealed in underacted report Comment: Futile games in the Commons only damage our handComment: Tory rebels must back down, or risk a ruthless general election purgeRecord 336 migrants crossed English Channel in August Relief for Angela Merkel as AfD held at bay in German regional electionsCanal boat family facing \u0026#39eviction\u0026#39 from waterways for not moving barge often enoughAfD\u0026#39s failure to deliver knock-out blow will ease pressure on Angela Merkel as Brexit nearsComment: School uniform is a fine British tradition bordering on sadismWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/08/29/TELEMMGLPICT000084862335_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"clean eating soggy bottoms britains food lexicon has transformed","story":"The term \u0026#39soggy bottom\u0026#39 was coined by The Great British Bake Off stars Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry in 2010 Before The Great British Bake Off and the surging popularity of veganism, phrases like soggy bottom and Veganuary would have drawn blank stares from the British public.But they are now part of a dramatic transformation of our culinary lexicon which has taken place in the last 30 years, new research by BBC Good Food magazine reveals.Words which entered modern use in the 1990s include \u0027flexitarian\u0027 -

We have achieved that and are very satisfied in both Brandenburg and Saxony,” Alexander Gauland, the AfD leader, said. “But yes, we did not come first. There is still a piece missing and the work starts now.”The AfD celebrated significant gains despite failing to win first place in either stateThe AfD led in the Brandenburg polls for much of the campaign and was widely expected to win first place in a regional election for the first time.But it was held at bay by a late swing towards the established parties amid a dramatic rise in turnout.The result will ease the immediate pressure on Mrs Merkel and her chosen successor as CDU leader, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, who has endured a difficult first year in charge.But the CDU still suffered its worst ever result in its former stronghold of Saxony, and now faces a difficult task building a new coalition in the fractured regional parliament.The election leaves the CDU ided, after Mr Kretschmer pulled the party back in the polls by distancing himself from Mrs Merkel’s national government, and a right-wing faction held its own separate victory celebrations last night.The SPD was neck-and-neck with the AfD in the Brandenburg polls right up until voting opened, and the party was celebrating an unexpected comeback last night.But it still suffered significant losses at the AfD’s hands in a state it has ruled since reunification, and will now need two partners to build a new regional coalition.The AfD was hoping for a strong result in its heartlands in the former communist east to offset a disappointing 12 months which saw it come fourth in the European elections and fail to make a breakthrough in the more populous west.Alternative for Germany (AfD)Death toll climbs to seven in second Texas mass shooting in a monthAt least two children in every class have contemplated suicide because of bullying, Diana Award study revealsTeachers\u0026#39 starting salaries to rise to £30,000Heart checks while you shop: NHS announces plan to have pharmacies check shoppers\u0026#39 heart health in bid to cut deathsNational Trust blames summer heatwave for missing visitor target as it sounds warning about climateComedian Kevin Hart suffers \u0026#39major back injuries\u0026#39 in South California crashVeterans who helped crack Nazi code reunited at Bletchley park on 80 year Polish invasion anniversary Boris is prepared to ignore the law to get Brexit through on October 31David Gauke and other Tory rebels consider siding with Labour as the effort to stop no deal beginsFacebook urged not to encrypt children\u0026#39s messaging accounts over NSPCC grooming fearsDay by day: How the most explosive week in politics for years might play out Boris Johnson warns rebel MPs: back me or be sackedTom Watson to face calls to resign when extent of ties to \u0026#39Nick\u0026#39 are revealed in underacted report Comment: Futile games in the Commons only damage our handComment: Tory rebels must back down, or risk a ruthless general election purgeRecord 336 migrants crossed English Channel in August Canal boat family facing \u0026#39eviction\u0026#39 from waterways for not moving barge often enoughAfD\u0026#39s failure to deliver knock-out blow will ease pressure on Angela Merkel as Brexit nearsComment: School uniform is a fine British tradition bordering on sadismWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/28/17/john-shermer.jpg","title":"john shermer lightwave smart home apple disability tech","story":"IM Subscribe NowIM Subscribe NowCreated with Sketch.IM  Subscribe NowIM  Subscribe NowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Try Independent Minds free for 1 monthSee the optionsCreated with Sketch.When John Shermer quit his job his wife was appalled. But, he tells Andy Martin, he’s proud of building an ‘unknown little British tech company’ that can take on the likes of giants like AppleClick to followThe IndependentJohn Shermer, the founder of Lightwave, had some of his best ideas in borstal. He was teaching delinquent teenagers in Birmingham back in the 1980s. “I used to think software was some kind of lingerie,” he says.Then he discovered the Acorn BBC Micro. “There was this kid, aged 16, put away for a double murder. He couldn’t read or write. He’d pick a fight rather than answer a question. But if you put him in front of a computer, his behaviour changed – for the better.”If he got it wrong, he could start again. “He could fail without humiliation,” says Shermer when we meet up in London. The computer had infinite patience and it wasn’t judgemental.Which is what gave him the idea to build a dedicated computer room for the other inmates and develop what became known as “Tech4Good”, inspiring otherwise underskilled young people. Working for the NHS with EU funding, he was soon tailoring tech around Europe to improve the lives of anyone with a disability.There was a man in Antwerp with a brainstem injury who could only twitch a finger: Shermer dreamed up a glove with sensors that enabled him to type. He adapted a Psion organiser to give a voice to a woman who had lost the power of speech. The victim of a road accident who could only move his chin was able to operate a keyboard Shermer had tweaked. “The tragedy was that these were one-offs and not generally available,” he says.And everything cost too much. He made a plug-in power outlet you could control with the blink of an eye (literally). But each unit cost £150 each and he could only make a few hundred.The idea of starting his own company was to bring the price down and\u0026nbspmake more units – for anyone and everyone, with or without a disability. “The\u0026nbspNHS\u0026nbspwas spending millions but I didn’t think they were spending it wisely,” he explains, adding: “My wife was appalled when I quit.” But he got the price down to £10 per unit and was making 10,000 at a time.\u0026nbspNow 63, Shermer was born in West Bromwich. His father worked on Spaghetti Junction and the young Shermer would go to the factory on a Saturday to watch him putting it together. He built his own hi-fi from scratch aged 11. He was chronically dyslexic\u0026nbsp(as are his own children) but was saved by predictive typing and audiobooks. Shermer describes his job as “liberating people”.He was inspired in part by a meeting with Stephen Hawking in the mid-90s at the Dorchester in London, when they talked about the future of disability and tech. Lightwave started off, 12 years ago, enabling NHS patients to be independent at home.Even if they couldn’t move too well they could still turn the lights on and off and answer the phone. It was smart home technology before it became fashionable. “We changed the lives of thousands of people,” he says. “You had to make it simple and it had to be robust: people’s lives depended on it.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The fundamental physics is flawed. The waves won’t go through walls. The frequency is wrong.” Lightwave, however, uses a dedicated radio protocol.The emergence of the smartphone transformed the business for Shermer. “It’s democratising,” he says. Anyone can use their phone to control all the appliances in their home, remotely. In January 2012,\u0026nbspLightwave produced a pioneering “gateway” device for a house. “We made all the mistakes,” he says, “but now it works.”Lightwave is still based in Birmingham and uses local engineers.\u0026nbspThey design all their own apps. He started with two employees and now it’s up to 60-plus. He reckons that dyslexia helps\u0026nbspin some ways. “I can’t write long reports but I can stand and talk all day long,” he says.\u0026nbsp“I can’t code either, but I do have the ideas.” He carries a “daybook” around with him in which he sets down his latest brainwave.Shermer says that Alexa and other virtual assistants have also made a big difference on the domestic front. Fifty per cent\u0026nbspof all commands are now sent via voice. His own mother is 87. “She can’t use a computer but she can still talk to Alexa,” he says.Shermer is proud of being “an unknown little British tech company” up against the giants of the industry. “They’re still getting it wrong,” he says. Apple invited him to Ireland for talks. They wanted to put an Apple chip in all his products and gave him 48 hours to consider. Shermer said he didn’t need 48 hours and turned them down flat. “We’re dealing with people’s lives,” he said. “It has to work.” Now Lightwave products are on sale in Apple stores.How two childhood friends became sports-pub matchmakers‘Don’t be afraid of AI’: Daniel Pitchford debunks technology mythsHow Daniel Nivern created an international recruitment agency in ChinaWhether you have dementia or you’re easily distracted, it’s useful to have the kind of kit that can spot if you left the cooker on.\u0026nbsp “We don’t make gadgets,” Shermer says dismissively. “We make things that screw to the fabric of your house. Stuff that’s permanent and increases the value of your home.” Lightwave are also collaborating with housing providers and companies such as\u0026nbspHoneywell to create iPhone-ready homes. The technology is built into the architecture.Shermer now works with the likes of Google and Amazon. “But we stand our corner,” he says. He reckons that the larger companies are at a disadvantage in that they produce generic products, whereas Lightwave can be more bespoke. “They’re top-down, whereas we grew up looking at it from the user’s point of view.”Shermer reckons he could also come up with a much better system for Hawking if he was still around. “It was a slow, stilted conversation with him. He would take a minute to say ‘I agree’. And it was an American voice system. There are still tens of thousands in his situation who would benefit.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Friends, family, you know the drill. \u0026nbspIt will lend up to £10,000 at an APR interest rate of just under 50 per cent.\u0026nbspBusiness was booming until quite recently, with a successful flotation at 275p, which made a billionaire of founder James Benamor and attracted some big name investors.\u0026nbspSince then, it has been a rocky ride. Before yesterday’s update, the shares were trading at less than half their near 300p peak. They’ve since halved again.\u0026nbspBritain will pay a big price for Boris Johnson’s Brexit coupA major reason for that is this sort of lending coming under the beady eye\u0026nbspof the Financial Conduct Authority.\u0026nbspThe regulator has voiced concerns about the growth of the market, the loans’ affordability, the high incidence of repeat loans lenders like Amigo have on their books.\u0026nbspHard-up borrowers can easily get into a cycle of borrowing, and then borrowing again, which sucks money out of already strained budgets.\u0026nbspThe watchdog also worries about whether guarantors really know what they’re getting into. They are themselves often of limited means. Becoming liable for a loved one’s loan repayments is a headache many of them could do without.\u0026nbspYou can see why investors initially got excited by the company. It currently has 210,000 customers. There could be 10 million of them in its sector. Amigo and its peers have created a market among them that barely existed before its emergence, one that has been booming. Whether that’s a good thing is open to debate.\u0026nbspThe problem with the “subprime” sector is that there is within it a substantial number of people who really shouldn’t be borrowing at all, who are inclined to take out loans to make ends meet rather than to fulfil a purpose (such as buying a car to get a better job). \u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A notable feature of the results is an impairment ratio of more than\u0026nbsp30 per cent of revenues, up from 25.4 per cent and a deterioration of the proportion of loan balances fully up to date or less than 31 days overdue.\u0026nbspWhat can Britain learn from a Breton town’s bustling centre?Why the Bank of Mum and Dad is now a top 10 mortgage lenderM\u0026ampS faces ejection from the top tier of British businessIf that were so, why the need for a reset, which involves improving “credit and conduct policies” and prioritising new customers over relending to existing ones?The watchdog has already capped what payday lenders can charge. It followed up with a move on stores operating in the “rent to own” sector. The charges imposed on those whose bank accounts slip into the red via “unauthorised” overdrafts have similarly been addressed.\u0026nbsp“You can expect us to be consistent and predictable in our focus on affordability,” is what it has said on the subject of guarantor loans.

A dream come true, says David Barnett, but it won’t be an easy taskClick to followThe IndependentAt a time when comic book movies rule the box office, it makes sense that one of the most beloved series in recent years gets an adaptation, courtesy of Netflix.When it’s a comic that was written by Neil Gaiman, the man behind book-to-TV hits American Gods and (co-authored with Terry Pratchett) Good Omens, it seems even more of a no-brainer.But while the comic in question, Sandman, holds a special place in the hearts of readers of both the hardcore geek variety and those who would never class themselves as comic nerds, its journey to the screen has been a troubled one and for many years the series was dismissed as simply unfilmable.When DC Comics published the first issue of The Sandman, with a cover date of January 1989, the industry was in the throes of a revolution.Titles such as Watchmen and The Dark Knight\u0026nbspReturns\u0026nbspheralded a new direction.\u0026nbspIt was proclaimed “Comics aren’t for kids any more!” as the superhero genre became grittier and darker, drenched in sex and violence that was much more than a sock on\u0026nbspthe jaw and a KA-POW!\u0026nbspSound effect.Created with Sketch.

And that was largely thanks to a concerted effort\u0026nbspto bring in British writers and artists to overhaul some of their tired old plotlines and dream up brand new characters.tired tropes\u0026nbsp(DC Comics)A little before Sandman was published, DC brought out a comic called Hellblazer, featuring a British, street-level occultist called John Constantine who smoked and drank and screwed people over. Written by Jamie Delano, with art by John Ridgway, it set the tone for what was to come. In late 1988, DC started running ads for Sandman in the back of its comics. They showed a twinkle-eyed, pale-faced figure and the slogan, “I will show you terror in a handful of dust”.\u0026nbspIt was written by Neil Gaiman, with art initially by Sam Kieth and Mike Dringenberg and covers by Dave McKean. The advertising blurb was a slight mangling of a quote from TS Eliot’s “The Waste Land”. Gaiman was a name that no one outside of comics would have recognised at that point he’d been brought over to work for DC by forward-thinking editor Karen Berger after a smattering of comics work, including a graphic novel with the aforementioned McKean called Violent Cases. Sandman was published in the same format as the usual DC superhero comics, and billed as a “horror-edged fantasy”.Neil Gaiman: ‘I made Good Omens for Terry Pratchett’Sandman certainly wasn’t about superheroes, though they sometimes featured in slightly grotesque ways. It wasn’t really a horror comic, though it was often horrific. It was fantastical rather than the epic fantasy of the doorstep-sized novels that filled the bookstores. If it wasn’t these things, then what was Sandman all about?The clever answer is that it’s about everything. In 75 monthly issues, from 1988 to 1996, Sandman covered every conceivable topic, from myth and legend to love and loss to identity politics to horror to birth and death to cats that hunt humans and dogs that talk. In a narrower sense, it’s about the Sandman, also known as\u0026nbspMorpheus\u0026nbspor Dream, one of a group of immortal siblings known as the Endless who rule over realms that correspond to, really, the components of the human heart. Alongside Dream, the roll call\u0026nbspincludes Destiny, Despair, Delirium, Destruction, Desire and, of course, Death.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He rules over his domain where humans visit, fleetingly, as their bodies rest. He’s actually – whisper it – a bit boring. He doesn’t have much of a sense of humour, isn’t given to snappy rejoinders, and is often brooding over something, some lost love or threat to his realm. So it’s a good job that The Sandman comics are not really very often about him. They’re about the humans who interact with him, and their stories, their lives, which Dream sometimes just witnesses, and sometimes intervenes in.30th anniversary of the first issue\u0026nbsp(DC ComicsVertigo)Though Sandman is a narrative that covers much territory, not always in linear fashion, there is a silver thread running through all 75 issues (later collected into omnibus editions for easier reading) which begins with our introduction to Morpheus,\u0026nbspimprisoned for decades by an opportunistic Aleister Crowley-like English occultist. When he’s finally free, the Lord of Dreams returns to his realm to find it crumbling and in disarray, and sets out to retrieve his objects of power, fix things up, and make right all the chaos that has occurred in his absence.Gaiman was pretty much\u0026nbspunknown when he started writing Sandman (Getty)In early issues, he has to track down the denizens of his domain who have escaped while he’s been gone, and travel to hell to free a lover he wronged thousands of years previously. He meets Shakespeare and gods\u0026nbspand ordinary people thrust into ordinary situations. The series ends with his death but like everything that went before, nothing is as it seems in the land of dreams.The series was an instant hit. It was the comic for people who didn’t read comics, and the comic for those that did. Gaiman must have cast some bewitching hex, because he managed to build a fanbase that was full of cool people and outsiders and comic nerds and punks and pretty much everybody. Everybody loved Sandman. The singer-songwriter Tori Amos loved Sandman. The great American man of letters Norman Mailer called Sandman “a comic strip for intellectuals”. Charles Shaar Murray, the music journalist and author, writing in this very newspaper in 1997, on the release of the final volume of the collected Sandman story, called it “a major achievement. There is nothing quite like it anywhere else.”A plethora of artists have illustrated the Sandman comics. They include Colleen Doran, Jill Thompson, Bryan Talbot, Mark Buckingham, Malcolm Jones III, Charles Vess, Kelley Jones, Matt Wagner, P Craig Russell, and more. All have brought their own touch to Dream and the Endless, but of course the one constant has always been writer Neil Gaiman.In a way, Sandman is a timeless tale\u0026nbsp… And, as you’d expect, many of the stories within the wider narrative deal with how we dream, how dreams affect reality and vice versa, and what happens if we don’t dream… or dream too hardGaiman was pretty much an unknown when he started writing Sandman. He wasn’t even that well known a year or so later when he published, along with Terry Pratchett, the novel Good Omens. By the year 2001, when his first proper solo novel, American Gods, was out, he was a little better known, enough to be interviewed by CNN. He demurred at the suggestions that he was now famous, commenting:\u0026nbsp“I’m not and never will be a John Grisham.”Still, he had his fanbase by then, and it was quite a wide-ranging one. He is quoted in the same interview as describing his market as “a handful of beautiful goths and a handful of boys in dresses and a handful of sci-fi fans and a handful of nervous young girls with multicoloured hair and the people who look normal and the people who look like somebody’s mum. I exist at the intersection of a dozen Venn diagrams.”Now, though, it could be argued that Gaiman has certainly achieved Grisham-esque levels of literary fame, certainly since his 2013 novel The Ocean at the End of the Lane took up residence at the top of the bestseller lists. From then on,\u0026nbspGaiman\u0026nbspbecame a hot property.His works Stardust and Coraline have been adapted into movies, but it wasn’t until the rise of the big-budget, ambitious TV series, heralded by the likes of Game of Thrones and The Walking Dead, that his oeuvre found its natural home. American Gods and Good Omens have both been adapted for TV on Amazon Prime, and Sandman is next, snapped up by Netflix earlier this month.It’s not quite a case of a goldrush to mine Gaiman’s back catalogue for new hits though. For starters, unlike most of his other work, Sandman isn’t Gaiman’s copyright he did the work for DC comics, and the characters he wrote and created belong to them. DC certainly hasn’t been resting on its laurels with turning its intellectual property into TV shows… series such as Arrow, Supergirl, The Flash, Titans\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspDoom Patrol have been big hits. Shows that are more thematically aligned to Sandman, such as Constantine, based on the comic Hellblazer, appeared, while another adaptation at the darker end of the DC universe, Swamp Thing, has just debuted.Tennant and Michael Sheen in ‘Good Omens’, which Gaiman co-wrote with Terry Pratchett\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp(BBCAmazon)People have been trying to get Sandman on to the screen for almost as long as the comic has been produced. From the late 1990s, Warner Bros, which owns DC Comics, had been trying to get a Sandman movie made. Roger Avary, who worked alongside Quentin Tarantino on Pulp Fiction, was slated to direct, but fell out with the company and it never happened. New attempts were made one screenplay sent to Gaiman is said to have evoked the response from him that it was “not only the worst Sandman script I’ve ever seen, but quite easily the worst script I’ve ever read”.By 2013, when Sandman had been in and out of development hell more often than the character had been in actual hell (which was quite frequently the TV series Lucifer, starring Tom Ellis, is essentially a spin-off series of Sandman, featuring the version of Satan that Gaiman created for the comic), something more concrete appeared to be on the cards. Producer David S Goyer announced that he would be leading a film adaptation, working with actor and filmmaker Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Gaiman, with British screenwriter Jack Thorne on script duties.spinoff featuring Satan from ‘Sandman’ and his adventures on Earth (Fox)It underwent several rewrites and by 2016 Gordon-Levitt dropped out of the project, citing differences with the studio over how he thought the direction of the movie should go. The adaptation petered out, with the general feeling that the scope and breadth of Sandman was just too ambitious to be contained in the movie format.Good Omens review: Pratchett \u0026amp Gaiman’s whimsical book brought to lifeEnter, not Sandman, but Netflix. On 30 June\u0026nbspit was announced in Hollywood Reporter that the adaptation was back on, only as an ongoing series on the streaming TV provider, not as a movie. Which is pretty much the best result for a story of this size. David Goyer is back on board, as is Gaiman, whose stock in the TV world has massively risen since the adaptations of Good Omens and American Gods, which he\u0026nbspexecutively produced.One possible question mark people might have over the adaptation is whether the Sandman story has any relevance in 2019, more than 20 years after the main series ended (there have been many spinoffs, and DC recently launched a Sandman Universe\u0026nbspof titles featuring the characters, overseen by Gaiman but created by a new team of comic writers and artists). Good Omens is of a similar vintage to Sandman, but its apocalyptic themes were frighteningly recognisable in this year’s Amazon Prime adaptation, and American Gods was brought up to date nicely with its story of the old gods fading as faith in them wanes, and the new gods of technology, money and sex on the rise.Starz’s ‘American Gods’, Gaiman’s first solo novel\u0026nbsp(Starz)In a way, Sandman is a timeless tale. It’s character-driven rather than plot-heavy, which suits the Netflix model of delving into characters’ backstories and fleshing out the source material it adapts. And, as you’d expect, many of the stories within the wider narrative deal with how we dream, how dreams affect reality and vice versa, and what happens if we don’t dream… or dream too hard. And dreams are not merely the stories we tell ourselves in our sleep they can be hopes and ambitions and wishes for ourselves and others. Perhaps there’s something to be said, also, about how willingly we submit to non-real states, especially online, which wasn’t a real consideration when Gaiman first wrote the series.Overall, Netflix certainly seems a safe pair of hands, and if anyone can do justice to the sprawling story of Dream and the Endless, then this old comics fan thinks it’ll probably be them. Another misgiving aficionados of the comics might have is that over its 75 issues, The\u0026nbspSandman didn’t really plough the sort of neat, linear furrow that TV series like to follow. Sandman is about everything, and that’s sometimes a big ask for a TV show to take on… and which led to the general opinion that it was simply not a thing you could adapt.It’s also a truth that great comics – or novels, for that matter – don’t necessarily make great TV shows or movies. To revisit an earlier point, a comic book isn’t just illustrated fiction. It’s a collaborative medium, it’s its own way of telling stories. It’s writing and art that come together to make a way of communicating a narrative that is different from anything else. Sometimes, that story is best suited to the form in which it was first birthed. And even if it all goes wrong, at least we still have the comics.But people are undeniably excited about a Sandman TV show. The beautiful goths, boys in dresses, sci-fi fans, nervous young girls with multicoloured hair and the people who look normal who were Gaiman’s turn of the millennium fanbase. As will, finally, thanks to Gaiman rapidly becoming a household name, “the people who look like somebody’s mom”.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

So often are locals now being asked a single repeated question – “where’s the dam?” – there are proposals to create special signage to point daytrippers in the right direction.The Chernobyl effect is what some are calling it – although, says Martin Thomas, chair of Whaley Bridge Town Council:\u0026nbsp“Obviously there’s no danger of radiation here.”Created with Sketch.

The town is at threat from the dam wall collapse at the nearby Toddbrook ReservoirOn a sunny day, it is easy to see why there is a flood (no pun intended) of visitors arriving.The place –\u0026nbsppopulation 6,000 –\u0026nbspis as picturesque as any of its more famed Peak District neighbours, Buxton, Bakewell and Edale included. There are good pubs, quaint cafes, independent shops and art galleries –\u0026nbspas well as all-important chippy –\u0026nbspdotting the higgledy-piggledy streets. Both the Peak Forest Canal and River Goyt run through the valley. The walking on the hills offers unrivalled views.“It’s always been a lovely place,” Cllr Thomas, who has lived here 35 years, tells The Independent. “But perhaps it’s been a bit of a secret. The difference now is that it suddenly has a national profile. People have seen it is on the news, and they’ve come along to have a look for themselves.”Whaley Bridge residents gather at evacuation centre after dam collapseVisitors are intrigued by what happened, too, the 65-year-old reckons. Many ask about those seven August days when emergency workers, engineers and a now famous RAF Chinook helicopter worked around the clock to secure the failing Toddbrook Reservoir. Plenty walk through Memorial Park to see the towering 188-year-old dam itself.“As a story, it has everything,” Cllr Thomas says. “Near disaster, heroism and a community pulling together. No-one’s saying visitors come just to look at the dam – although it is impressive – but, if they’re looking to spend a day in the Peak District, they are now considering Whaley Bridge in a way they didn’t before.”Certainly, there is much evidence to support the claim.The not-for-profit Footsteps community café in Market Street –\u0026nbspwhich Cllr Thomas is a director of –\u0026nbsphas taken more than £2,000 since it reopened on 8 August,\u0026nbsp after the evacuation ended. In the same period last year, that figure was just £804. A display in its window showing pictures of the dam and the rescue effort, meanwhile, has proven so popular the photographer has turned the images into a commemorative book.

They say they want to help by spending their money here, which is such a moving gesture.”Ms Douglas-Mullett, a mother-of-two who has lived here for two years, had her parents visit from their native Dorset not long after the near collapse. “One of the first things my dad asked was to see the dam,” she says.Little Fika, itself, has doubled its takings in August compared to July – although it did lose nearly £500 of fresh food during the evacuation.Nearby at Jarva Gallery in Market Street, owner Lyndsey Selley doesn’t have sales figures but reckons footfall in her art and jewellery store is massively up over the past three weeks.Whaley Bridge residents allowed to return home after evacuationResidents ‘increasingly fed up’ as handful are allowed to return homeWhaley Bridge residents criticised for ‘putting lives at risk’Whaley Bridge residents refuse to evacuate despite flood riskWhaley Bridge villagers may not be allowed home for six more daysEngineers race against time to stop dam bursting over Whaley BridgeIt seems, I suggest, like a little disaster might be a good idea every summer?“I don’t think our nerves could stand it,” she laughs. “But, as a business community, the challenge now is to build on what’s happened and make sure we take advantage of the raised profile.”A meeting with just this end in mind took place last week between local traders, High Peak Borough Council, Derbyshire County Council and Marketing Peak District and Derbyshire.The decisions taken have been criticised as a little lightweight – an online video is to be made and, if funding can be found, new signs installed and old ones improved – but Lindsay Rae, deputy director of Marketing Peak District and Derbyshire, reckons the benefits can be long-term.“We now have to work hard to capitalise by making sure every visitor here leaves with the best possible impression so they go away and tell their friends, who then also visit,” she says. “There’s no reason this can’t be self-perpetuating.”Certainly, that’s also the hope of John Wakeham, owner of Springbank Guest House in Reservoir Road.He says he’s had cancellations from holiday-makers now apparently apprehensive about staying in a town which sits under a vast 19th century reservoir – but that such drop-outs have been matched by last-minute bookings from visitors who, it seems, do want to stay in exactly such a place.“It’s been a six and two-threes for us,“ he says. “No business wants cancellations, but they’ve mainly been evened out by the new guests. We can’t complain. I suppose the whole things has made Whaley unique.”Not everyone has benefited, it should be said.The week-long closure forced by the evacuation inevitably meant lost money, while house prices are understood to have fallen in the aftermath. Several sales have collapsed.There is some anger, too, at the Canal and River Trust, which manages the reservoir. Residents are asking why inspections did not reveal potential issues with the dam – a question currently being addressed, the trust says, in an independent inquiry.The reservoir itself, meanwhile, will stay shut for an estimated three years while the wall is fixed,\u0026nbspthe cost of which could run into tens of millions of pounds.But for now, back at Footsteps cafe, Cllr Thomas remains sure the long-term positives of the collapse will outweigh the negatives.“I’ve walked through the place the last few week and the shops are bursting at the seems, the sun is shining, the community is out spending money with each other,” he says. “It’s been wonderful to see. Whatever happens now, it’s been a summer no-one will forget.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Mr Marquez had led Farc’s negotiating team with Mr Santrich also at the table.Now, just three years on, they were dressed in green coveralls and armed with automatic rifles in what appeared to be a new jungle camp somewhere in the Amazon rainforest.The country’s peace process has already faced significant setbacks and is fiercely\u0026nbspopposed by many, but the declaration is perhaps its biggest test yet.Analysts say it could go one of two ways: provide a much-needed strengthening of a fragile peace process, or jeopardise it, sending the country hurtling back towards war.Marquez (holding a document) and fugitive rebel colleague, Jesus Santrich (in sunglasses),\u0026nbspannounce\u0026nbspthey are taking up arms again\u0026nbsp(AFPGetty)In the video, Mr\u0026nbspMarquez, flanked by 20\u0026nbsparmed men, snapped back into his former Marxist rhetoric as if he had never flirted with civilian life.“This is the continuation of the rebel fight in answer to the betrayal of the state of the Havana peace accords,” he said in a 32-minute video in which he blamed the government for not having kept its end of the peace deal.“We were never beaten or defeated ideologically, so the struggle continues.”International proxy war played out in concerts on Venezuela borderThe deal was internationally lauded for formally ending a 52-year war which killed over 260,000 and displaced 7 million as the Farc, paramilitaries and the national army fought each other bitterly for control of territory.But the agreement\u0026nbsphas been fraught with setbacks.Social leaders voicing their support of the accord are being killed at a shocking rate – 627 seven local activists since the deal was signed, according to local NGO Indepaz.The pledges the government made to develop neglected regions of the country remain little more than pledges, encouraging dissident rebels to abandon the process and return to warfare.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He wants to\u0026nbspcreate a new unit dedicated to pursuing them, and offered a reward of £725,000 for the head of each commander who appeared in the video.But although Duque reiterated support for the peace process,\u0026nbspthe majority of his party would like to see it torn up.This gifts them an opportune moment to return the country to war, said Sandra\u0026nbspBorda, political analyst and associate professor at Los Andes University in Bogotá.“This could be a strong wake-up call to the government… does it want its main achievement to be having ended the prospect of peace?” she said.“If they don’t commit to it, if they don’t realise the best response is committing to peace process, the potential that this becomes the beginning another conflict is very high.’’She added: “I am not optimistic at all.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

When Kamala Harris, an African American senator from California who is seeking the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination, cautiously voiced support for studying whether there ought to be reparations for slavery – “We had more than 200 years of slavery. We had Jim Crow for almost a century. We had legalised discrimination, segregation. We have to recognise that everybody did not start out on an equal footing” – she faced a major backlash.These conversations come at a fraught time for the nation. Donald Trump may\u0026nbspor may not be\u0026nbspmore racist than\u0026nbspsome of those who preceded him in the Oval Office, but he is more prepared to use racist language openly. The imprimatur of those words as commander-in-chief, allied to the massive power of social media, has emboldened many who share his views, but who may not previously have voiced then aloud.“In the past we had coded language. Now it is more direct,” says Cassandra Newby-Alexander, professor of history at Norfolk State University, located 50 miles from Jamestown, where the English warship White Lion unloaded its human cargo. “There is a step-by-step process to embolden this racism, but I think it may only work for one-third of people. There are more white people unhappy with this level of hate speech.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailA fundamental reason for America’s refusal to acknowledge its past – not alone among nations – says writer Rachel Swarns, is that it is “hard history”. Two hundred years of slavery was followed by the Civil War, an event that somehow inspired twisted racists such as the Charleston church killer Dylann Roof the intentional failure of reform during Reconstruction, and then the system of Jim Crow, in which black people were returned to being second-class citizens, lynched, murdered, refused the right to live in certain areas and even to vote.\u0026nbspToday, efforts to suppress the voting rights of minorities persist with vigour in states such as Georgia, while the criminal justice system is utterly discriminatory against people of colour. Three years ago, when the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI) announced plans to establish a museum to lynching victims, it estimated at least 4,000 African Americans were summarily murdered – their killings frequently watched by large crowds – between between 1877 and 1950.\u0026nbspWreckage of last ship used to bring slaves to America found in Alabama“It is hard history, and it’s particularly hard for Americans because it runs counter to the narrative we tell about ourselves – you know, freedom and justice for all,” says Swarns, whose work includes American Tapestry: The Story of the Black, White, and Multiracial Ancestors of Michelle Obama.“I think it is much easier to think about slavery as something that is very disconnected from us – long time ago, history book-slow, nothing to do with me today. We’re often known for not being big at looking in the rear view mirror.”She adds: “Coming to an understanding that slavery was as foundational as it was for a country that expounds these ideals\u0026nbspis profoundly difficult. That is on a macro level. At a personal level, I think it is just difficult for people.”Among Swarns’ revelations was that the founders of Georgetown University in Washington DC, which was established by Jesuits, owned slaves. Her 2017 report triggered reflection by a number of US universities where slavery had contributed to their wealth, as well as half-a-dozen in Britain, among them the universities of Oxford, Glasgow, Bristol and East London.Earlier this year, students at Georgetown voted to pay additional tuition fees to help establish a fund to benefit\u0026nbspthe descendants of the 272 slaves who were sold in 1838 to pay off the institution’s debts.Swarns, a contributing writer for the New York Times and associate professor of journalism at New York University, says such gestures give her hope, just as incidents such as the 2017 neo-Nazi march at Charlottesville, make her despair. She says this dichotomy, the shifting back and forth of progress, is also part of America’s story.Carol Anderson, professor of African American Studies at Emory University in Atlanta, has written about the backlash triggered among some white Americans following the election of Barack Obama, the country’s first and only African American president. The reemergence of Tea Party activists, and congressional obstruction, was part a pattern dating to the Civil War and the passage of the 13th Amendment that officially\u0026nbspended slavery.Each time African Americans have made advances, she says in her book White Rage: The Unspoken Truth of Our Racial Divide, white reaction has resulted in a deliberate roll back. The end of the Civil War and Reconstruction was greeted with the Jim Crow era, the Supreme Court’s Brown v Board of Education decision resulted in the shutting down of schools in the South, while the bloody opposition to the Voting Rights Act of 1965 led to a new, coded response – the so-called Southern Strategy and the “war on drugs”, that took the vote from millions of black people, while helping project Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan into the White House.Anderson tells The Independent the US is currently ided between those states wanting to expand access to the ballot box and make the electorate more inclusive, and those seeking to restrict access, in order to reduce the number of minority voters.Why won’t the UK even talk about reparations for slavery?Cory Booker gets 12 co-sponsors on slavery reparations billModern slavery victims ‘sent back to addresses where they were abused’Cambridge slavery inquiry will show we have plenty to feel guilty forSome Americans believe the events of 1619 should not be memorialised at all. When the New York Times magazine announced it was dedicating an issue to mark the arrival of the the first enslaved Africans and what that presaged, a number accused the newspaper of stoking racial tensions.Newt Gringrich, a former Republican speaker of the House and a close ally of Trump, tweeted: “The New York Times 1619 Project should make its slogan ‘All the propaganda we want to brainwash you with’.”Burr, the writer and academic from New Mexico who discovered her link to America’s third vice president, says the opposite. In her words, Americans cannot talk enough what happened, both then and now.“The reason people don’t want to talk about slavery is that they don’t want to dig up the past.

When there isn’t enough water, I can’t even make food on time or feed my children,” says Aherwal, 28, who became a Jal Saheli in her village of Agroutha in April.“This will help solve our water problem. Our village will be able to drink water. We will get to irrigate our crops again.”One of India’s biggest cities has almost run out of waterIn earlier times, Bundelkhand, blighted by 13 episodes of drought in the last two decades, received 52 days of rainfall a year. But the number of days has more than halved since 2014, according to Skymet Weather, a private weather forecasting agency.That has led to repeated and widespread crop failures in a region\u0026nbspthat is dependent on agriculture, prompting a growing tide\u0026nbspof farmers to migrate to nearby cities.Women and children often bear the brunt of water shortages – from domestic violence as tensions rise in water-short homes to missed\u0026nbspschool days and child marriage, according to local water conservation\u0026nbspexperts.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailIt is common to find veiled women, carrying up to four pots – some balanced on their heads – walking miles with their children\u0026nbspto fetch water several times a day.With their vision obstructed, there are times they trip and drop\u0026nbsptheir pots, forcing them to go back for refills.Bundelkhand region\u0026nbsp(AFPGetty)“We used to get so tired fetching water,” says Tara, a Saheli in Manpur village who goes by one name.“Sometimes we would say ‘Ok, we didn’t wash our clothes today, we will do it tomorrow’ or ‘I didn’t bathe today, maybe tomorrow’. That’s how bad it was.”But things have changed since 2016 after Tara and two other Sahelis talked about the need for water conservation in their village and gathered dozens of people to revive their community pond and wells, and install new hand pumps.We see ads on TV that show water flowing from taps, from showers and think ‘Wow, we should move to the city’. But that is a false dream, at least for people like us who have no money. So it is better to make changes hereNow washing dishes, cooking, mopping, doing the laundry, bathing, farming and taking care of livestock are much easier, says\u0026nbspGeeta, another Saheli who goes by one name.“If there is water, we have everything and if there is no water, we have nothing,” she says, gesturing to Manpur’s brimming pond where buffaloes wallow\u0026nbspto beat the heat.Rural Indian women make good managers and protectors of natural resources, says\u0026nbspReetu Sogani, a researcher on traditional knowledge, gender and climate change.“Because they interact so closely with their natural surroundings and they know what kind of problems they face in day-to-day life ... they come up with solutions and adaptation mechanisms based on their knowledge,” she says.For many women, it hasn’t been easy to become Jal Sahelis in a male-dominated, conservative region, where age-old customs dictate a woman’s life.“My husband got upset and asked ‘Why are you going out?’\u0026nbsp’Where are you roaming around?’ ... ‘You aren’t even getting paid, what is the point?’,” says Aherwal, who makes up to 6,000 rupees (£70) a month rolling traditional cigarettes at home.“I endured all his anger, his scoldings to join this group.”Several Sahelis say their husbands and in-laws eased up after noticing the water situation\u0026nbspimproving – and the women weren’t cutting corners at home.Dargai Khurd village (AFPGetty)After their chores and work at home, most women can carve out only two hours a day for their Saheli work, they say.That can involve creating a water conservation plan for their village, participating in local council talks, meeting government officials, and learning how to use tools to fix wells and hand pumps – a chore traditionally done by men.Sanjay Singh, the secretary of Parmarth Samaj Sevi Sansthan, a grassroots charity behind the Jal Saheli programme, says the women are now more involved in household and village decisions, leading to effective change in some places.“The index of happiness has increased (in the region),” he says.Everything you need to know about getting rupees and visas for IndiaKashmir on lockdown after India reimposes curfew and deploys troopsIndia orders schools to reopen, but Kashmiri parents keep kids at homeBindrawan Lodi, a 60-year-old farmer, agrees. He says without the Sahelis’ push to revive their community pond, his Chaukheda village would have been in “a lot of trouble”.“This place was bone dry. Now we have enough water to irrigate our crops. Drinking water is still a struggle ... but this is a start,” he says.Bundelkhand, once a region green with dense forests and fields, is increasingly barren with little groundwater.The area’s rocky terrain largely stops rainwater from percolating\u0026nbspinto aquifers, Singh says. Loss of forests also has hit\u0026nbsprainfall, and water reservoirs have sometimes been used wastefully, residents say.Although civil society and government agencies have ramped up water conservation efforts, Singh warns that\u0026nbspmuch more needs\u0026nbspto be done before the “dangerous” effects of climate change exacerbate problems of unemployment, malnutrition and migration.Two in five people in rural Bundelkhand have become urban migrants over the last decade, according to estimates by activists from the Bundelkhand Water Forum, a coalition of local organisations.Singh says more private investment, bigger government budgets, work restoring trees and other greenery and climate adaptation techniques, such as growing less water-intensive crops, could help stem the exodus.That is one of the reasons\u0026nbspthe Sahelis say\u0026nbspthey work so hard. They want to ensure their children can stay put and their daughters or daughters-in-law can live a life free of water worries.“We see ads on TV that show water flowing from taps, from showers and think ‘Wow, we should move to the city’. But that is a false dream, at least for people like us who have no money. So it is better to make changes here,” says Aherwal.“Our village will become beautiful in the next five years. All you will see is water everywhere.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

That might not be the case this time around. He’s very lucky that the Queen continues to stand by him. Andrew is always cited as her favourite child and Her Majesty accepts her son’s vehement denials when it comes to Epstein.He also has the full support of ex-we Sarah Ferguson, who knows all too well what it is like to be caught up in a scandal. She was apparently financially “assisted” by Epstein, something she now regrets.Sarah and Andrew have been lying low on holiday together, sparking rumours they are back together. But even this odd couple realised Andrew playing his usual rounds of golf in the Spanish sunshine looked callous.They are back for “crisis talks” and I don’t envy the royal advisers who have to try to spin this one. No one is saying Andrew has committed any sort of crime, but anything that has Epstein’s grubby fingerprints all over it inevitably reeks to high heaven.And the Prince has done his reputation irreparable harm by his association with such a contemptible sexual predator. We are light years away from the dashing young prince who won the respect and admiration of the British public for his role in the Falklands War.He has never reached the heady heights of that level of popularity since, and clearly he never will again. But he could redeem himself by at least being willing to answer questions from investigators in the States.Being a royal should not mean he is above helping law enforcement. It might be embarrassing and uncomfortable — butAndrew has done nothing wrong, he has nothing to worry about.NEVER mind the nights drawing in, you know our summer days are numbered when Strictly rears its sequinned head. This year has the potential to be a classic.I always look forward to seeing the celebs step into the spray tan booth, embrace the glitz and rhinestones and unleash their inner as. But my ones-to-watch this year have actually already found theirs.Michelle Visage from Ru Paul’s Drag Race and ex-Corrie star Catherine Tyldesley both have big personalities, raucous laughs and are women after my own heart.Michelle has been very open about her struggles with an eating disorder, and recently had her breast implants removed due to health concerns. She’s a fierce campaigner for more understanding about the side-effects of breast enhancement ops.Catherine has always wanted to be a dancer but said this week that being overweight as a youngster scuppered her chances of tripping the light fantastic.She famously lost st and promotes sensible eating and exercise as the only way to shed weight, which is something I’ve been banging on about forever. Both are at the top of their game and raring to go.They will burn up the dancefloor and provide us with some memorable moments . . .  but as they are both happily married, these will all thankfully be Strictly confined to the ballroom floor.WHAT in the name of Rule Britannia is going on with British Airways  They are lurching from crisis to crisis, with computer glitches and strikes almost becoming the norm.Last week I had to cancel a long-awaited trip to Orkney because of the proposed industrial action next month by BA pilots, after receiving an email to say my flight had been axed. With a heavy heart, I apologetically cancelled the glorious Foveran Hotel, our car hire and the babysitter for our dog son Angus.The next day another computer-generated email popped up telling me that actually the flight wasn’t cancelled after all. Oops, and all that. Now I’ve been trying to get some clarity from the BA hotline for days – with no joy.I’m reluctant to rebook everything in case it all goes t*ts-up again and they cancel the flights for a second time. It’s infuriating, stressful and upsetting. Behind every cancelled or delayed flight are heartbreaking stories of people missing weddings, hospital visits, funerals and job interviews.Can I stress emphatically that, in my experience, BA staff at the check-in coal face, who have to deal with distraught and angry passengers when flights are cancelled or delayed, deserve a blinking medal for their patience and forbearance in dealing with the recent avalanche of almighty management cock-ups.Likewise, those battling valiantly in customer service, and all of the stalwart cabin crew, especially those with years of experience who are unfailingly professional, caring and kind.They are being as badly let down as us passengers, and it’s depressing to see a once proud and noble British brand shooting itself in the foot.Those at the very top really don’t deserve their hardworking staff and they also have to stop taking us customers for granted.NORMALLY I view those “scientic studies” about the benefits or detriments of certain food and drink with folded arms and a very sceptical: “Aye, right.”It might, however, be worth paying attention to the very latest one which concludes that red wine really is good for you.We already knew about the benefits for your heart, but now it turns out red wine could improve digestion and protect you against issues with high cholesterol.I reckon the men and women in white lab coats have a point.Cheers!I’VE been lucky enough to have spent the past couple of weeks travelling around Rajasthan in India.I happily scoffed some form of curry three times a day for every meal and guzzled very impressive Indian wine.I’m now addicted to dosa with daal and spicy mint sauce for breakfast – followed throughout the day by chilli paneer and laal maas all washed down with endless cups of masala tea.Halfway through the trip, I rather naively posted a snap of myself, right, taken by the pool during our stay in Shahpura Bagh, on the way to Jodhpur. It showed that my excess holiday baggage had mainly landed around my tummy.Some people were very kind about my -year-old unfiltered, non- Photoshopped body, my make-up-free face and flyaway hair. Others not so much.All I wanted to do was show that you don’t have to be body perfect to wear a bikini and smile in the sunshine when you are on holiday.We shouldn’t feel embarrassed about a few lumps and bumps or scars and blemishes and we need to stop beating ourselves up all the time and learn to celebrate our so-called flaws. Le really is too short.SHAME on all of those chortling at little Prince George because he is taking ballet lessons.

They are mentally and physically fiercely strong.I can’t think of a better way for the future king to learn discipline, teamwork and how to push himself to the limit.

They want the rebels to think they can’t succeed unless they change the government. “The aim is to force a binary choice between Corbyn and our Brexit plan,” is how one of those at the heart of things explains it.Those close to Boris Johnson believe this is their best chance of getting things through. They calculate that, ultimately, the Commons will not be prepared to take the risk of making Jeremy Corbyn prime minister.This is a high-risk manoeuvre. But so far, the thought of putting Corbyn in No even temporarily has proved too much for all but a couple of the Tory rebels.At the same time, Boris is trying to reassure Tory MPs that he really is trying for a deal. I understand that next week, Amber Rudd — the Work and Pensions Secretary who campaigned for Remain in  — will join with him as part of an effort to persuade Tory MPs not to back the rebel legislation, and to give him time to secure a deal.I am told she was “disappointed” by his decision to prorogue but remains convinced he is genuine about getting a deal and that the EU will offer concessionsParliament backs the Government next week.The biggest problem with the extension the rebels want is they can’t say what it is for. The reason is they can’t agree on what its purpose should be: Many want to stop Brexit altogether, others just to block No Deal.An extension without a purpose would do nothing but prolong the uncertainty and keep this country in limbo. It is time to get on with it.Why, because No think most voters just want Brexit done, so they want to be talking about the public’s priorities.They think they win whenever Boris is seen on the news discussing these issues. The polls suggest the PM is having some success with this approach. One Secretary of State puts the current Tory poll lead down to BoJo being: “Very effective at giving them hope of a non-Brexit dominated world.”Of course, another reason why the PM wants to keep hammering home his domestic priorities is that we are going to end up having a general election in the next few months.l IN another sign that a general election is coming, I am informed that the Scottish Tories will not select their new leader until AFTER such a poll.The decision to stick with an interim leader following Ruth Davidson’s resignation suggests the  hierarchy north of the border doesn’t think there is  time to have a proper leadership contest before any general election.We will clearly all be heading to the polling station sooner, rather than later.ANY Tory MP who votes for the extension legislation next week will not be allowed to stand as a Tory candidate at the next election.I understand No have decided to treat next week’s votes as they would a confidence vote, with anyone not backing the Government being immediately disqualied from standing for the party again. They hope this will keep some Tory waverers in the Government lobby next week.It would mean thatformer Cabinet ministers such as Philip Hammond voted for the legislation, as they intend to, they would be barred from standing for the party again, ending their time as Tory MPs.  It is hard to think of a precedent for so many Tories going from being Cabinet ministers to being ineligible to stand for the party.This upping of the stakes will certainly have an effect on some Tory MPs. There will be those who are reluctant to end their careers in the party over this issue.There will undoubtedly be protests over this decision. Boris Johnson will be accused of purging the Tory party of those opposed to No Deal. But the tactics are not dissimilar to those used by John Major to get the Maastricht Treaty through in  in the face of opposition from his party’s Eurosceptics.This approach is not without risk, though. There is a danger  MPs will still rebel  then decide  they have nothing left to lose, increasing not only the chances of them voting down the Government in a no-confidence vote, but also backing an alternative prime minister.Currently, only about ten per cent of Home Office grants to charities go to those with an income of less than £million a year, compared to the sixty-odd per cent which goes to those with an income of £million plus a year.The new Home Secretary, Priti Patel, has been impressed by the efforts of charities such as OnSide, which work to keep kids off the street.One ally of the Home Secretary says that more police and greater stop and search powers are, “only one side of the coin”,  in terms of dealing with kne crime and that “there are lots of kids with nothing to do and that’s a big reason so many are falling in with the wrong crowd and getting into trouble.“There are some great small charities out there giving them a purpose beyond a le of crime, and they deserve more support.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It used to be that children could shut the front door on a day of school and leave it on the outside until morning. Now, though, there is -hour access.Another news story this week revealed that nine out of ten teens aren’t getting enough sleep or exercise. It doesn’t take a genius to link the two issues.Social media — and reality TV — also reveal a new emphasis on appearance that has changed so much in the past  years, for adults as well as children. It’s just that children are more susceptible to that pressure.Other things have changed too — not least our approach to parenting . We are much more child-focused, which isn’t a bad thing necessarily.But telling our kids they are the best, no matter what they do, risks them thinking they are the best without doing anything at all to be so.Yes, we can help boost our children’s self-esteem. But what we should really do is help them boost their own self-esteem by doing things that make them feel good about themselves.Obviously, more families now have two parents in the workplace. That is a good thing but perhaps some working parents feel the need to compensate for their absence in ways — such as too many screens and “treats” — that aren’t necessarily brilliant for their children’s mental health.I write as a mother of two who worked more or less throughout my children’s young lives.I’m proud to say we all made it through in one piece.Obviously, I am no parenting expert. And I’m not claiming to have the answer to the world’s ills.But over the years, I’ve identied three golden rules I believe build a foundation for happy kids.The first is sport. I passionately believe that being part of a team, having regular exercise, being out and about and maintaining a routine offers kids stability and boundaries.It helps children feel good about their bodies and their abilities, boosting their self-esteem.The second is friendship. I am talking about proper friendship — not Facebook “friends” you never meet. When kids leave their phones at home and develop real friendships, they find people they can talk to and have fun with.Never underestimate the importance of fun. The third golden rule is probably the most important. Keep talking.There are too many tragic examples recently of young people who felt it necessary to take their own lives. I believe a problem shared is a problem halved. No matter how bad something is, talking always helps.I don’t remember ever reading about suicide when I was younger — especially not suicide in young people. Now it is the biggest cause of death among people aged  to  and it affects three times more men than women. That is a scary statistic.The causes are complicated but we need to keep channels of communication open with our kids. That way,they are unhappy, we will know about it. Andwe know about it, we at least have the potential to help.Remember Alfie Patten  For a while, in , he was known as the nation’s youngest father at the age of just .Then he found out, later that year, that it was another boy who had made his -year-old girlfriend pregnant. So Alfie was off the hook.That should have left him with the feeling that he had dodged a bullet.It could have spurred him on towards getting a good education and a job, to building himself a future.The adults in his le should have encouraged him to do just that.Instead, this week he turned up at Lewes Crown Court to be sentenced after being convicted of criminal damage.The court heard he is now a jobless alcoholic who lives at home with his mother and has a history of criminal offences.He already had a -month suspended prison sentence hanging over his head after being convicted on June  of shoplting, theft and possession of an imitation firearm.This is a good reminder that suspended sentences do not work. Alfie Patten clearly needs a bigger wake-up call than a suspended sentence or he risks ending up dead from alcohol and drugs.I saw a bench in my local park the other day that said: “Die with memories . . .  not dreams.”So true. But this guy, who is creating all the wrong sorts of memories, is a nightmare.Well, I don’t know about you but I am filled with relief that the heatwave – and even summer – is over.The cooler weather is perfect timing for going back to school and back to work, so we can all concentrate again. Hot weather is great when you are lying around in swimwear next to a pool . . .  notyou are sitting in a classroom or office.I  loved the photos of Dame Joan Collins, , lined up with the other stars of the Charlotte Tilbury makeup campaign.What a lady. Joan, is classy, funny and damn stylish. Or as my nan would’ve said, well turned out.Another day, another story about taxpayers’ money being wasted in foreign aid.This week it emerged that classrooms in nearly  schools in Pakistan – paid for by us – have been closed because they were badly built and unsafe.The buildings were erected as part of a £million aid project and their closure has left , children taking lessons outdoors or in overcrowded rooms.So, presumably, back where they were in the first place. On the upside, this has prompted some MPs to call for an inquiry about how our annual foreign aid budget – around £billion – is spent.On the downside, this is an example of yet more foreign aid money that has fallen into the wrong hands and ended up being wasted.In the meantime, British schools are crying out for investment.So why are we spending money on Pakistani schools and not our own Meanwhile, in the UK, overseas patients have left the NHS with more than £million in unpaid bills for treatment, it emerged this week. That cash could pay for , nurses, , heart bypasses or nearly , junior doctors.Two London hospitals are owed £million each, including almost £, from one patient alone.Apparently staff are reluctant to chase payments, with doctors’ leaders saying their obligation to charge overseas patients is “racist” and deters vulnerable groups from seeking help.To me, that sounds completely bonkers.I don’t understand why you are not asked to produce your NHS number – we all have one – when you get to hospital.Every other country asks, so why not us It’s a national service, not an international one.Former Big Brother contestant Kate Lawler is campaigning to remove the taboo facing women who don’t want children.She said she considers her two dogs, Baxter and Shirley, as her family and she’s very content with that.She’s right, of course. Whether or not you want children comes down to personal choice and it should be fine for women not to want them.The only problem with her situation, though, is that her fiancé is “desperate” for children, which doesn’t sound so good.I think the most important thing when choosing whether or not to have kids with someone is the pair of you both being on the same page. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Only Allen in  was more powerful with mph winds.Bahamas Prime Minister Hubert Minnis begged residents of Abaco and Grand Bahamas to head for the main island to escape the devastating, dangerous storm.I want you to remember: homes, houses, structures can be replaced.

And higher winds than Matthew. And heavier rain than Matthew.The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale is based on a hurricanes sustained wind speed.Just be ready for that. We’re in a position where you’re talking three, four, five days in advance of what you have to be ready for.“The threat is real from the Treasure Coast throughout the Florida peninsula. The trend is somewhat favourable — though the danger is still high along the immediate coastline.”The devastation caused by Dorian could be made worse by exceptionally strong tides called King Tide -which makes coastal areas more vulnerable to flooding.The super-strength tide happens around the time as a full moon or new moon and this year the King Tides have already flooded neighbourhoods in Miami - and the most recent full moon was yesterday.The storms winds reached mph today - just mph shy of becoming a Category  hurricane.Winds are currently raging over the warm Atlantic waters and is inching towards the northwestern Bahamas, according to the US National Hurricane Center.The centre says the storms path is still unpredictable, but Georgia and the Carolinas are now at risk of strong winds and le-threatening storm surge.The hurricane has slowed down since Thursday as it was originally expected to make landfall by Sunday.The NHC still warned Florida residents to say on alert.They said: It should be noted that the new forecast track does not preclude Dorian making landfall on the Florida coast, as large portions of the coast remain in the track cone of uncertainty.Supermarket shelves have been left bare as residents scramble to prepare for the Category  storm.Floridians left supermarket shelves empty after grabbing water, bread and canned goods in the event power and water are cut off.At a Publix supermarket in Cocoa Beach, Ed Ciecirski of the customer service department said the pharmacy was extra busy with people rushing to fill prescriptions.Saturday: Dorian is expected to slow its forward motion and will likely begin to impact the northwestern Bahamas with tropical storm-force winds by Saturday night.Sunday: Dorians hurricane siege will begin in the northwest Bahamas as it continues to slow down. Tropical storm-force winds may begin to arrive in parts of Florida. Large swells should begin to arrive at the coast from North Carolina to Florida.Monday: Dorian may still be hammering the northwest Bahamas as it crawls slowly. Bands of rain, strong winds may affect parts of Florida. How strong the winds will be depends on how close the center of Dorian is to the Florida coast, which is uncertain at this time.Tuesday-Thursday: Dorian is expected to move north, then northeast near the coasts of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina. The exact track is very uncertain, ranging from a track far enough offshore to keep hurricane force winds away from land, to a landfall anywhere in this zone.Friday-Next Saturday: Dorian is then expected to race off the Northeast Seaboard, but could track close enough to bring rain and some wind to the Virginia Tidewater, Nantucket, Marthas Vineyard and Cape Cod, before it heads toward the Canadian Maritimes by next weekend.The grocery was rationing bottled water and had run out of dry ice.Homeowners and businesses rushed to cover their windows with plywood.Tfany Miranda of Miami Springs, Florida said: I feel helpless because the whole coast is threatened.What’s the use of going all the way to Georgiait can land there You never know with these hurricanes.

Mr Gove - who is in charge of planning for no-deal - promised today that everyone will have the food they need after October .The Cabinet Office minister added: No, there will be no shortages of fresh food. But Mr Goveaposs claims were blasted as categorically untrue by the British Retail Consortium, which represents more than , firms.A spokesman said: It is categorically untrue that the supply of fresh food will be unaffected under a no deal Brexit.The retail industry has been crystal clear in its communications with Government over the past  months that the availability of fresh foods will be impacted as a result of checks and delays at the border.Indeed, the Government’s own assessments showed that the flow of goods through the channel crossings could be reduced by -% from day , as would the “availability and choice” of some foods. The slapdown came after Mr Gove also admitted some food prices look set to rise in a no-deal Brexit.     Mr Gove admitted: There are a number of economic factors in play. Some prices may go up. Other prices will come down.” A leaked document from the governmentaposs Operation Yellowhammer predicted some supplies of fresh food will fallthe UK crashes out without a deal on Halloween . The document said while there would not be an overall shortage of food, there would be less availability and choice, affecting vulnerable groups. Meanwhile, the government has already publicly warned school leaders they could have to substitute ingredients in pupilsapos dinners. As a result, councils are bracing for school dinners to become more expensive, as well as the risk nutrition standards will be changed. Pressed by the BBC today on whether there would be shortages of fresh food in no-deal, Mr Gove at first refused to answer. Instead he said: Everyone will have the food they need. When asked for a second time by interviewer Andrew Marr, he said: No, there will be no shortages of fresh food. But the BRC spokesman said: The BRC’s own assessment has shown that soft fruits and vegetables, such as strawberries, tomatoes and lettuces, would likely see reduced availability as they are largely imported during the winter months.  “While retailers continue to work with their suppliers to maintain stocks of non-perishable goods and plan ahead for any disruption caused by a no deal Brexit, it is impossible to mitigate it fully as neither retailers nor consumers can stockpile fresh foods. The reality remains that a no deal Brexit in October would present the worst of all worlds for our high streets and those who shop there. Retailers will be preparing for Christmas, stretching already limited warehousing capacity, and the UK will be importing the majority of its fresh food from the EU, magnying the impact of border delays.” It comes amid reports Mr Gove is planning to publish a heavily watered-down version of the original Yellowhammer warnings.    The document was presented to Cabinet ministers on around August , yet the Sunday Times reports officials are now making extensive changes to it before making it public. A Westminster source told the newspaper: This document is currently being neutralised, with all emotive language being stripped out. Mr Gove today insisted the governmentaposs Yellowhammer documents were a worst case scenario and suggested Mr Marr was talking about project fear.

Before the fall of the Berlin Wall, promising kids as young as eight were pumped full of steroids in a win-at-all-costs quest for victory. It brought more than  summer and winter Olympic medals between  and  – but at a terrible price. The stars of yesterday suffered severe depression, heart conditions, degenerative bone disease and infertility. Some even changed sex because of the drugs. Many spiralled into drink and drug addictions, unable to find work. Olympic legend Coe, , now head of the athletics world governing body the IAAF, was called to account this week in the wake of the Russian doping scandal. He told MPs on the Culture, Media and Sport committee: “I have the support of the sport. Have there been failures  Yes. Will I fix them  Yes.”  Maybe he will. But the sport has failed for years to stamp out cheating. And for East German athletes, the vast majority duped into taking drugs, that has meant ruined lives. GDR weightlter Roland Schmidt was pumped so full of steroids, he grew DD breasts. He had to have them surgically removed as his body had stopped producing testosterone. Shot putter Heidi Krieger suffered the opposite effect. Testosterone took her femininity. She changed sex and now lives as a man, teaching youngsters the dangers of pumping steroids in a bid for sporting glory. About , GDR former athletes who were given little blue pills have just celebrated a £.million pay-out from the German Government. After more than  years of suffering, it amounts to little more than £, per athlete.  But they are jubilant at their agony finally being recognised. Heidi took so many steroids she is now Andreas. Drugs she was forced to take by coaches as a young girl changed her gender and left her with pain in her hips and legs from lting huge weights while under the influence of steroids. Nicknamed Hormone Heidi by rivals, she had a full sex-change operation in , completing the physical change. Read more: Doping agency declares Russia and four other countries non-compliant Happily married to Ute Krause, a swimmer who was also a victim of the GDR system, Andreas shocks young people with photos of when he was Heidi. “The big dference these days is that the Russian athletes have a choice,” says Andreas, . “They will pay a terrible price in future. We had no choice because we were under a dictatorship.  “They told us they were vitamins, and we believed them. They exploited my love of sport. “Now I give something back by teaching young people. I tell them about Athlete , a woman who was given pills every day by her coach. “By , she had so many medals due to doping, but by  she was broken. Then I say ‘OK, Heidi can speak to you about doping – because Athlete  is me.’” It has quite an impact. He adds: “I understand Heidi better than ever today. When I see photos, I accept that was me. That is the secret, the first step. I did not hide my past. It is not worth it. She is part of me still.”  Communist East Germany struggled to provide basics for its people, yet wanted to show the world its power through its athletes. It wrecked their lives. Secret police files revealed they had been given Oral-Turinabol, a steroid produced by pharmaceutical firm Jenapharm. It was approved for some illnesses, but not meant as a performance enhancer. Heidi’s records show that in , the year in which she became European champion, she was given , milligrams of Oral-Turinabol. Read more: London  bosses told during Games their drug-testing procedures were aposaposappallingaposapos That is roughly , milligrams more than the amount given to Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson, whose doping programme shocked the world when it was exposed in . Jenapharm argued it was not culpable, since the drug was legal but misused by trainers. Then a state-owned company, subservient to the wishes of the Communist regime during the s and s, it produced an estimated two million tablets per year given to GDR athletes. Lawyers say files from East Germany’s notorious secret police, the Stasi, show that company officials had discussed the doping programme with the government. But Isabelle Roth, the company’s then chief executive, insisted the firm was not the “driving force” behind the doping programme. She said: “The drug was misused. We cannot be held responsible.”  Former GDR hammer thrower Thomas Gotze, , now a state prosecutor in Germany, was given so many pills as a teenager that he would work out for up to six hours. “I only found out later they were steroids,” he says. “Russians should come here to see how they will end up – broken, sick, injured. In  years, they will be just like us.” Ines Geipel, , part of a s world-beating East German sprint team and now a college lecturer, set up the group for GDR victims. She is unsure about Coe’s ability to clean up athletics. But she has a stark message for President Vladimir Putin and the Russian athletes prepared to sacrice everything for sporting glory: You will pay the price.  She says: “Putin needs great sporting success just as the GDR did. “It is more than  years ago now and yet there are so many parallels with the Russian situation and ours. It is about a state-controlled abuse. “It carried on until . We are probably talking about  to , athletes in total. We saw kids as young as eight being doped. They were guinea pigs and we have seen the health impact down the generations, passed from grandfather to grandchild. “The bodies are broken, and so are the souls. Naturally there was great gynaecological damage because the women were taking men’s hormones. We have seen still births, infertility, disabled children born to former athletes.”  Ines says young athletes were often trapped in special training camps. Some mums revolted when daughters ed with deep voices, muscles, facial hair. “Some managed to get out,” she says. “But most were too scared. You cannot imagine now what it was like to live under state control then. Athletes were alone, we could not talk to each other out of fear of being found out and punished.” Ex-GDR sprinter Marita Koch still holds the world record for the m,  years after she ran, but has always denied doping. Her time of .secs was set at the IAAF World Cup in Canberra, the last of her  inidual outdoor world records.

Her face lit up like a Christmas tree when she had it fitted. It has taken no time whatsoever for her to get used to the arm. She was virtually off and running in under an hour. She was grabbing things and high-fiving her brother. Itaposs the simple things that we take for granted. I never thought we would be where we are today. Itaposs not just the physical side of it. It was mental torture for her not being able to do certain things. Itaposs a le-changing moment for her. Itaposs simple to put the arm on which she can do herself. I want to thank everyone who has helped us get to where we are. You have no idea what this means to us all. Rinae said: “It’s amazing, because the things that I couldn’t do before, I can do them now.” She collapsed at home in Eccles, Greater Manchester, after playing with friends in April  and saying she started to fell like her body was aching.    Naturally, single-father John, a bricklayer, believed this was down to the activity and Rinae went to bed as usual. However, the next morning she woke up with an extreme temperature and John spotted blood blisters appearing on her skin. Medics at Alder Hey Hospital in Liverpool said she had just  hours to live. She battled back but lost both legs, her left arm below the elbow and the digits on her right hand. Rinae, who has a twin brother Rico and older sister Cha, , was in intensive care for six months while she battled the condition and recovered from multiple le-saving surgeries.She was hooked up to three machines pumping fresh blood around her body while she made her incredible recovery.Rinae has since undergone years of physiotherapy on her aposstumpsapos to allow her to use prosthetic legs and was later given a aposplastic armapos by the NHS.   However, the NHS-provided plastic arm had no ality and was likened to a mannequinaposs limb by her father. The Hero Arm, which is controlled by sensors that detect muscle movements, was fitted at Dorset Orthopaedic in ­Staffordshire last week. Samantha Payne, Co-founder and COO of Bristol-based manufacturer, Open Bionics, said: Weaposre thrilled to see Rinae receive her Hero Arm. Rinae crowdfunded for the device and was fitted through private healthcare, and she is one of dozens of people with upper limb dferences in the UK fundraising for a Hero Arm. We very much hope the NHS sees how helpful these devices are and will begin offering them to the people who need them. Weaposve worked really hard to achieve a price point for the device that is acceptable for existing NHS budgets for prosthetic provision.

It is now almost  weeks since John disappeared and Gillian is still desperately waiting on news.John, , is a keen walker and an avid history fan. Gillian said: Every holiday we went on, John went walking as he was very fit, active and loved history.

Gillian said his grandchildren desperately miss him as do their two West Highland Terriers who sit at the door waiting to see him. She said: We are getting desperate now. It feels like to us, as a family, that he has been forgotten. It’s like we are at a dead end.We have got nowhere to turn now. My worry is the case will be closed down at the end of the season when the island closes down for the winter in October. She has asked South Wales Policeone of their officers can go to Greece to help with the investigation. But the Greek police are in charge of the case and it is understood that police officers from the UK would have to be invited by the country where the person went missing.

That is why the charlatans are terried of a fresh referendum, clinging instead to an ageing, squeaked result sneaked by lies and criminality in another Parliament, three PMs ago. MPs must unite this week to save Parliament and Britain by ruling out egomaniac Johnson’s Halloween Horror. Vowing to call an early General Election to block MPs and trigger October ’s Brexit fright night is just another miscalculation by a slippery premier who is too clever by half. Naming an election date isn’t in his gt under a Fixed Term Parliament Act requiring a two-thirds vote by MPs or Jeremy Corbyn securing two weeks to form an alternative administration after winning a no-confidence vote in Johnson.

A thousand miles away from the capital Nuuk, they have survived in this remote corner by following ancient ways of le, using kayaks and harpoons to hunt narwhal in the summer and travelling by ­dog sled in the winter. But this unique way of le now faces an unprecedented threat – global warming. I spent a week living in this community in August to understand their precarious existence.    Many have relatives in the Canadian Arctic, where the Inughuit ­originate. Previously it was possible to travel across the Smith Soundon dog sled, but it’s now impossible as the sea ice disappears. The only option is to fly to ­Copenhagen, almost ,km away, and then to cross the Atlantic to Montreal – a journey few can afford. Their transition to a consumer society has been extremely rapid and has left a plethora of social problems in its wake, including, among others, the well-documented rampant alcoholism.

Ice stations have scientists from every G nation. The island’s ice sheet covers % of the land, km thick in places, and holds % of the world’s entire fresh water. The Jakobshavn glacier near Ilulissat – believed to be responsible for the iceberg that sank the Titanic – is so colossal that it alone has raised global sea levels by mm. It conveys more meltwater into the Atlantic in a day than London and New York use in a year.

Within a year of the snap being taken she alleges disgraced Epstein had lent her out to sleep with the prince. The duke strenuously denies the allegation, which was thrown out by a Judge in Florida as “immaterial and impertinent”. Roberts says she was approached by Maxwell about giving massages to men after starting work at the club.

Nicole, from Manchester, decided to jump in after watching her boyfriend and other tourists jump in from the boat, but she landed on her back and fractured her T vertebrae in her spine.Nicole needed an emergency operation in Croatia and had six pins and two rods inserted into her spine, the Manchester Evening News reported.She can now barely stand or walk even with the support of a brace and physiotherapist.    Speaking of the horric accident, Nicole said after seeing others jump in she aposthought it would be fineapos. She said: We got to the last stop and people were jumping off into the sea, so I jumped off feet first but my feet ended up moving slightly forward and I ended up kind of on an angle.

I just felt a massive amount of pain in my back and came up from the water, I shouted to Lewis and was just screaming for help. I was trying to swim back to the boat but just couldnapost. My nose was bleeding and I split my eye open. When she got to hospital, X-rays revealed that part of the fracture had entered the spinal fluid, which is surrounded by vital nerves. At the hospital in Split, Nicole underwent an emergency operation to prevent the fracture causing further injuries and had the pins and rods inserted into her spine.    Nicoleaposs parents flew out to Croatia and the family was told that she wouldnapost be able to travel home on a plane - the only safe way would be in an air ambulance with doctors onboard. Before the holiday, Nicole had taken out travel insurance with Debenhams. Although it offered up to £ million in emergency medical expenses, it became void because her accident happened on an excursion. Nicoleaposs mum Suzanne said she wants to stress to other youngsters that their insurance doesnapost cover everything. She said she doesnapost want other families to go through what they have. We were absolutely terried, Suzanne said. We just want to stress to other young people when they go on holiday just to watch what they are doing.

Investigators who want to interview Frenchman Jean-Luc Brunel, , say he is a “ghost who has disappeared without trace”. It is understood enquires are being made in Brazil, the US and Europe. French prosecutors have opened their own inquiry into the crimes of American financier Epstein, . The convicted paedophile, a friend of Prince Andrew, committed suicide in jail on August  while awaiting trial on child sex trafficking charges. Brunel, who helped found the New York model agency MC and is credited with finding supermodels such as Christy Turlington, has strenuously denied any wrongdoing.    It was claimed Russian ex-model Svetlana Pozhidaeva, who was signed to MC, was pictured at Epstein’s New York mansion in . Ms Pozhidaeva, the daughter of a Lieutenant Colonel in the Red Army, has denied it is her in the photo. A day before it was taken, Prince Andrew was photographed standing in the doorway of Epstein’s home. One of Epstein’s victims, Virginia Roberts, has alleged she slept with the Duke of York three times, which he has strongly denied. He has also denied knowing anything about Epstein’s illegal activities.    Roberts also claimed to have slept with Brunel “many times” when she was aged  to . Many of the girls said to have been used by Epstein were allegedly “sourced” in Paris, where the American owned a £million apartment. Brunel, who also lived in the city, was known to be scouring Brazil for new talent until early this summer. French prosecutors this month opened a preliminary inquiry into whether Epstein sexually abused French minors. Authorities say it is “urgent” Brunel is interviewed.

The hate for Thatcher was pure and the depth of feeling surged through concerts and rallies.He says with a chuckle: “Them were the days.“We thought it was bad then, but everything can get worse, as we see now. It’s a case of careful what you wish for.“I don’t get involved in politics now, like I say when didn’t anyone complain about politicians “Can you point me to a golden era where# everybody liked being ruled  F***ing never!“But there are some real creeps nowadays. But then again I expect the worst from any politician.”So what can fans in Dundee expect when John rolls into town for his show at the city’s Gardyne Theatre on Saturday October  Without missing a beat he fires back: “A right f****** good night!“And they can expect more of the same#and then some. There will be a few classics and there will maybe be a few extra poems.“Then I will add a bit of fun and I can guarantee – solid, copper-plated guarantee – that everybody is going to leave with a smile on their face.”John has fond memories of Dundee and spoke of savouring the atmosphere of a waterfront hotel and added: “I love coming to Scotland and Dundee. I’ve been many times and the reaction of the crowd is great.“I was here last year and saw the VA which is fabulous. I know of DC Thomson and the Sunday Post, the Beano and the Dandy plus Oor Wullie.“Maybe I will buy one of those sculptures.”Posh hotels and venues seem a world away from the clubs and student venues of the s with smoke-filled rooms and plastic tumblers full of warm beer.He used to travel to the shows on public transport and chuckles at the memory.John said: “Yeah, long time ago now, mate. Now I have a driver and I am too old for public transport.“But I still love doing live gigs. It’s smashing. Anywhere where there’s people is greatI’m doing my stuff.“I am working on my book of poems right now.

There are clever lighting and curtain effects that make the area quite attractive.We were brought a bottle of water and the cocktails, wine and food menus.Our waitress explained they had  Brewing beers on tap though there were bottles available too. My husband enjoys the likes of Peroni or Coors, but these aren’t sold here. He took a bottle of Lagunitas IPA, on our server’s recommendation, and I knee-jerked into Bacardi and diet coke as I was unsure of what  they had and a request for Kahlua had met with a blank stare. It would be goodthey perhaps did a beer and spirits menu too. vw, px\"  The drinks came and we were told the soupswere langoustine chowder and one I didn’t order .Other starters included chicken and duck liver parfait with rhubarband hot smoked salmon with pickled egg yolk . Across the table the choice was for scallops, apples and alliumsan unusual combination, we thought, but he loves scallops. The mains choices range from the £ mark, with a few vegetarian options – spelt grain and barley risotto and a courgette lasagne being two.I struggled a little bit with the menu – a lot of the dishes contained elements I just don’t like, chicken with sweetcorn ragout, duck with spiced pear, sea trout with pea veloute. I’m not sophisticated enough for this!I was on the steak option – Campbell’s Gold ribeyeor steak frites, oz flat iron steak , I chose the latter as I hadn’t had it before. My other half chose the grilled whole sea bream with rocket, orange and pine nut salad . vw, px\"  My soup was served with a poppy seeded roll – I was a little disappointed that bread hadn’t put on the table to nibble on while we waited – but my roll and soup were very nice. The chowder had lots of finely chopped veg in it.The seafood was also served in a bowl and the four quite small scallops didn’t seem to merit the price tag. However, they were cooked to perfection and the mix with the apple and alliumwas fabulous. But another couple wouldn’t have gone amiss. vw, px\"  The mains came – my steak was medium rare as requested and served on a warmed marble plate with the chips in a separate dish.My husband agreed to having his fish filleted. The server used two spoons to cut off the head and tail and get the backbone etc out. She did warn there would still be bones in it and, unfortunately, there were quite a few. I’d have found this off-putting, but he coped manfully. vw, px\"  I shared my pile of chips and steak – the chips were to die for, crispy and tasty and the steak had a lovely flavour but was a little chewy in places. I’m not familiar with the cut, so perhaps that was due to how I had it cooked.The sea bream was tasty, but I’m not sure it is something we’d order again. vw, px\"  A fellow diner had a burger deliveredand I had a severe case of food envy. It looked wonderful.The desserts were fancy ice cream and sorbet and a bruleebut we decided to go for the Scottish and French cheeses .The plate came with six pieces of cheese, oatcakes, chutney and pickled grapes. It was very pleasant and I loved the chutney, though I wouldn’t rush to eat another pickled grape!I had an espresso martiniwhile my other half – who’d swapped his beer with me – ordered himself a second Bacardi.

with a close range effort.Ross County twice hit the woodwork, once from the penalty spot.Aberdeen made four changes to the side that stuttered to a dire - stalemate with Kilmarnock at Rugby Park last weekend.Two were enforced with Scott McKenna and Shaleum Logan both ruled out through injury.Centre-back McKenna is out for up to a month with a hamstring tear suffered on the articial surface at Rugby Park.Right-back Logan was ruled out having undergone a minor procedure on a groin problem.It meant Aberdeen boss Derek McInnes had only four fit defenders available # with no defensive back up on the bench.However they secured a clean sheet.Wingers Ryan Hedges and Niall McGinn both ed to the starting line-up with James Wilson and Jon Gallagher dropping to the bench.Aberdeen began with attacking intent and forced two corners inside the opening two minutes but both came to nothing.The Reds should have taken the lead in the ninth minute when Ryan Hedges played a quick free quick to release Niall McGinn on the right flank.McGinn#ss low cross was palmed out by keeper Ross Laidlaw as far as Sam Cosgrove who capitalized to shoot low from  yards only to have his shot cleared off the line by Keith Watson.Aberdeen spurned another glorious opportunity in the th minute when Greg Leigh broke down the left and squared a pass into the penalty area but with the goal beckoning McGinn lted it high over the bar from  yards.In the rd minute Ferguson curled a free kick from the left into the box which Mikey Devlin met but his  yard glancing header flew wide.The Dons two game Premiership goal drought ended in the th minute with a set piece straight off the training ground.Rather than fire a free kick  yards out directly into the penalty area McGinn slid it wide to the unmarked Hedges on the right who immediately whipped in a curling cross that found LEIGH.The left-back powered home a  yard header beyond keeper Laidlaw.Aberdeen doubled their advantage two minutes later when Ferguson was clumsily brought down in the box by keeper Laidlaw.Leading scorer COSGROVE comfortably converted to the keeper#s left hand side for his th goal of the season.Aberdeen made it # in the th minute when McGinn cut inside on the left and delivered a superb cross towards the back post and HEDGES raced from the right to slide it in from close range.A minute later Ross County were awarded a penalty by referee Nick Walsh when a powerful drive from Stewart hit Funso Ojo#s hand from close range.Ojo was booked. Staggies failed to capitalize as Billy McKay#s spot kick rattled Joe Leiws# right hand post.Aberdeen continued to threaten when McGinn shot over the bar then minutes later Cosgrove had an effort saved by keeper Laidlaw.In the th minute Stewart broke in on goal and unleashed a curling shot that cracked off the far post from  yards. It was the second time the Staggies were denied by the woodwork.It could have been - in the th minute when a low drive from Wright  yards out was blocked by keeper Laidlaw.ABERDEEN: Lewis, Vyner, Devlin, Considine, Leigh, Ojo, Ferguson, Bryson, McGinn, Hedges, Cosgrove.Subs: Wright , Gallagher ,  Anderson Subs not used: Cerny, McLennan,  Wilson, Main.ROSS COUNTY : Laidlaw, Fraser, Morris, Gardyne, McKay, Vigurs, Grivosti, Mullin, Watson, Foster, Stewart.Subs: Spittal , Graham , Power Subs not used: Ruddy, Chalmers, Paton, Reid.Referee: Nick Walsh"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.44988923-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.44988923-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.44988923-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.44988923-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"boss knows pressure is on for a win but says it always is with reds","story":"Aberdeen boss Derek McInnes accepts the pressure is on to win today – but insists it is the same scenario for every match.The Dons have won just once in the last five games in all competitions.That victory came in the League Cup at Championship Dundee and required a th-minute equaliser to force extra-time.Prior to that Aberdeen crashed out of the Europa League - on aggregate to Croatian side Rijeka.A - stalemate at Kilmarnock last weekend made it just four points from the opening three Premiership matches.McInnes knows the heat is on but said: “The pressure is never off Aberdeen.“There is always a pressure to win, especially at home.“I know more than most what is required here.“We need to remind folk we won the cup tie at Dundee off the back of a European tie.“Although - at Kilmarnock wasn’t good enough from my point of view and we still expect more, in isolation it isn’t the worst result in the world.”Aberdeen’s defence has been hit by three injury set-backs this week.Following scans on an injury sustained at Rugby Park it was confirmed Scotland international centre-back Scott McKenna will be out for up to a month with a hamstring tear.Centre-back Ash Taylor also suffered a setback in his rehabilitation from a hamstring tear that has sidelined the summer signing since the - Europa League draw with Chikhura Sachkhere in Georgia on July .Aberdeen are awaiting the results of a scan but it is feared Taylor will be ruled out for a number of weeks.The Reds will also give a late fitness test to Shaleum Logan after the right-back underwent a minor procedure on a groin problem.If Logan is unavailable McInnes will have just four defenders available for the clash with the Staggies – Andy Considine, Greg Leigh, Mikey Devlin and Zak Vyner.McInnes has challenged the Dons to go into the upcoming international break buoyed by a victory.He said: “We are looking forward to the challenge of winning three points and feeling a bit better about ourselves.“We want to look at the league table and be a bit happier with that.“It is important we just concentrate on our own performance and that we bring a strong team performance.“The players will be absolutely fine this season and it is important we try to get the three points.“We know the level of performance we are capable of so it is up to us to try to find that.”Ross County suffered a heavy - home defeat to Livingston last weekend but McInnes is full of praise for co-managers Stuart Kettlewell and Steven Ferguson.He said: “By and large Stuart and Steven have done a brilliant job.“In their first full season they won the Challenge Cup and also promotion.“They have been very impressive.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.44988923-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.44988923-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.44988923-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.44988923-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"archaeological dig on bennachie celebrates success","story":"A two-month archaeological dig on the lower slopes of Bennachie will finish this week after proving the area was lived in for hundreds of years.Bennachie Landscapes Group, a joint project between the Bailies of Bennachie and University of Aberdeen, has been excavating the area over the summer.The dig site is part of the Pittodrie House Hotel estate.Archaeologist Colin Shepherd, a member of the BLG, said they had established that people had lived on the land, with ious mounds in the landscape being manmade structures.Aden Country Park will hold a separate archaeological dig at the Medieval Tower House site on September  from am to pm and members of the public have been given the chance to take part.More information can be obained by contacting Aden skills development and events officer at justinetough@gmail"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.44988923-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.44988923-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.44988923-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.44988923-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"oil firms support for aberdeen charity","story":"An oil and gas operator has come out in support of an Aberdeen charity.Aberdeen-based firm Serica has partnered with CLAN Cancer Support for its upcoming fundraising walk and has become the headline sponsor after it donated £,.More than  members of the Serica team are taking part in the event at Crathes Castle on Sunday.Mike Killeen, Serica head of operations in Aberdeen, said: “CLAN is a hands-on charity bringing practical and emotional support to those affected by cancer.“That profile fits perfectly with our desire to make sure our charitable giving makes a genuine contribution at a local level, so we are delighted to support the walk.

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives.

It was fantastic to speak to so many of my constituents.It was also wonderful to see many local business stalls promoting Islay#s dynamic and booming economy.The show was well attended with lots of families, both local and visitors, having a fun day out and luckily the sun was shining most of the day.A huge thanks to all the organisers and everyone  who contributed to the event.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I have real concerns about the deteriorating condition of some Argyll cemeteries.Constituents from Islay recently joined Councillor Alastair Redman in highlighting the poor upkeep of cemeteries in the area he represents.Councillor Redman reported that there were also problems at other cemeteries in his ward, including the cemetery at Carradale in East Kintyre.I understand that Argyll and Bute Council confirmed that they now, at last, have plans in place to address the problems at Kilnaughton.It remains disappointing, however, that things are allowed to deteriorate to the extent that the maintenance of cemeteries has become a matter of public concern.Frankly, it is very surprising that a cemetery where interments are actually still taking place has been undermined in this way and there must surely be an obligation to ensure this doesn’t happen.My experience is that communities in the Highlands and Islands pay special regard to the final resting places of fellow members of their communities and will be perplexed to discover that they appear to be uncared-for.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSP"},{"url":null,"title":"lets get our mojo working","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStarting out in , Lost in Berlin is the creation of Ardrishaig-based wordsmith Russell Taylor.The name Lost in Berlin could be seen as an apt metaphor for society#s sometimes confused state.

The deadline was broken on  minutes when Lee MacLean broke from midfield and managed to beat the offside trap, his cross from the left channel was met by the in-form Stuart MacLean whose shot beat Martin to give Star the lead.Tarbert looked to commit bodies forward in a bid to get back into the game which made for a more open contest, however the Star defence of Coll McCallum, Ricky Reid and Kyle Selfridge coped well throughout.Red Star should have made the closing stages a lot more comfortable for themselves with Gregor Peacock going close with a couple of opportunities and Aaron Moore having a shot well blocked but in the end Stuart MacLean’s goal was enough for a hard-fought but deserved win.On Saturday August  Star welcome Dunoon to the joint campus for their final game of the group stage, where a victory for the Lochgilphead side will see them progress to the quarter-finals.The kick-off time will be announced on the club’s social media pages during the week."},{"url":null,"title":"easy like summer busking","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe music club designed for everyone continues its summer of busking on Wednesday August .Get along to Lochgilphead Resource Centre for an evening of music from the much-missed Danny Kennedy with bagpipes, percussion and plenty of chances to sing along to the music.The event starts at pm and is free other than donations.

These songs were associated with the Tlell River on Hai Gwaii in Canada. These tracks, with a selection of later collaborations, make up River to Sea from Tlell to Tiree. The title documents Sheila#s journey from the coast of Canada to Tiree, where the track All You Really Need is the Sea was written.This artist is probably best described as a folk blues singer. She has the sharply observing, descriptive eye of the classic singer songwriter troubadour and while her voice is given gravitas and character by time, she swings and has the timing of the blues singer.Wild Biscuit#s musical accompaniment gives Sheila#s characterful voice depth and presence. The menacing guitar on I#ve Waited a Long Time and the atmospheric double bass and keyboards on Where the Pebbles Grind and Scrape complement Cameron#s lyrics and singing.Remembering Mr Toast is an atmospheric and evocative, less bombastic or overblown Scottish Jim Morrison, finding real beauty in a melancholic memory. The delicate hesitant guitar and reflective lyrics continue on Don#t Sigh and Go on Then, beautul, bitter sweet country love songs. All You Really Need is the Sea and Deep and Real are spiritual songs, again moving between an intimate relationship to consider the huge landscape and the restorative natural world.Is it blues, country, easy listening, folk or poetry set to delicate sympathetic music  It doesn#t matter. Close your eyes, listen to Sheila#s rich voice, with its cadence and rhythm. Enjoy the flow of words and the pictures they conjure on this warm and captivating set of recordings."},{"url":null,"title":"macalister wins tarbert golf championship","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe delayed fourth and final round of the Tarbert Golf Club championship took place at Glenralloch on Saturday August  in glorious conditions.The greens were freshly cut with captain Smyth choosing some interesting pin positions to test the players# skills.Iain Macalister held a one shot lead over Bruce MacNab and a five shot lead over John MacNab heading into the final round.If there were any nerves at the start of play this was not evident as Iain started with four fours then followed that with an excellent -foot birdie putt at the fth and a chip-in birdie at the sixth.

Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream.

and supporters are expected to assemble.\"The workers in the roads department have been treated with contempt and the latest efforts by the council to draft in contracted workers to cover workers taking action is disgraceful.ldquoInstead of positively engaging with the workers and Unite, the council seem intent on escalating the dispute.\"Unite will explore every legal avenue to challenge this aggressive action.ldquoUnite also believes that there is a strong legal case that workers are being offered unlawful financial inducements to break the existing collective bargaining agreements.The reasoning behind the dispute has been refuted by the local authority chief executive Tracey Logan.She told us: \"Some of the allegations made by Unite about the planned strike by a small number of roads department staff on August  are absolutely unfounded and cannot be left unchallenged.ldquoThe council has not changed terms and conditions for this staff group, nor have we failed to consult the trade unions or the staff affected.ldquoIn fact, we discovered some months ago that a small number of staff in this section had been claiming a higher rate of overtime than they were entitled to under the agreed terms and conditions.ldquoThey were also claiming for time to travel to work when working weekend overtime, which again is not in line with the agreement in place.ldquoGiven that Unite agreed to these terms and conditions, I am surprised and disappointed that they now want some of their members to be given more favourable pay rates than others, and for this small group be able to claim additional allowances that their other members cannot.\"The strike is set to coincide with a meeting of Scottish Borders Council on Thursday morning between .am and

coincide with a full council meeting, and waved flags, shouted slogans and played lsquoMoney Money Moneyrsquo by ABBA on a PA system.Speaking at the demonstration, Willie Thomson, a regional industrial organiser for Unite, said that the dispute could risk the regionrsquos winter maintenance programme.He said: ldquoThe reason why the men are taking action is basically a refusal from Scottish Borders Council to respect the terms and conditions of their employment.ldquoThey have had changes imposed on them that will cost them poundrsquos, and they are not willing to have that done to them.ldquoThe reason they are striking is to send a strong message that the council needs to get back round the table and reach an agreement with the workers.ldquoThe people of the Scottish Borders need to be aware that the council is risking their winter maintenance service.ldquoDuring the winter maintenance service members do a lot of extra hours to keep up with the extra demand.ldquoWersquore now in a position where members will be withdrawing that programme.ldquoThat work is done a voluntary basis and the good will that is required to do that is in short supply.Currently, summer standby for Scottish Borders Councilrsquos road workers is voluntary, but council chiefs are trying to make this mandatory, in line with other sections of the council.Earlier this year, Scottish Borders Council notied the unions that not enforcing the same terms and conditions across the whole council could leave the local authority open to gender pay discrimination claims, as the mainly male roads section of the council is not required to be on standby over the summer, whereas the mainly female care home staff are.Summer standby payment for roads workers is currently pound., albeit it on a voluntary basis, and Scottish Borders Council is offering to up this to pound as long as it becomes mandatory.The two main unions which represent road workers at Scottish Borders Council, Unite and Unison, have been in discussion with the council ever since it informed employees that the terms and conditions would change.However, the talks with Unite broke down, and .% of the unionrsquos members

There was a lot of spirit and a feeling that a number of towns in Scotland which have been forgotten, like Campbeltown, will not be left behind after independence.#He put the turnout at more than , and added: #The fact that the march extended theof Longrow gives a fair indication of the numbers who were there.He also told the Courier this week that he remained the #legal indentity# of the All Under One Banner group, despite a bitter public row among the hierarchy which looks like splitting the group in two.It was the biggest rally held in the town in recent years with marchers coming from as far afield as Aberdeen and Alloa and as well as Oban, Glasgow and Islay, with many travelling on the weekend ferry from Ardrossan.#It really exceeded expectations and made a big splash in the town, Ron Wilson of Yes Kintyre told The National.#There was a real buzz as people came early and most of the hotels were booked up. The pubs and cafes were busy so it was good for local businesses. Campbeltown is a Yes town and it was brilliant to have all these people come here. Local people were coming off the pavements and joining the procession so it created a good, positive vibe.Pro-Unionists opponents held their own counter demonstation. However, the march went off without any incident and there were no arrests, with only one warning which was drug related.A spit of rain earlier in the day failed to develop into poor weather as the marchers would round the town to hear speakers and listen to musicians at the rally at Kinloch Green.Mr Wilson said he was particuarly pleased at the turnout as there had been some confusion over whether the march would go ahead due to internal sions within the hierachcy of All Under One Banner, which has organised independence marches across the country.Following Mr Singh#s sacking, founder Neil Mackay resigned from his position on its national executive pending an internal investigation.Pro-UK Unionist group A Force For Good met the march on the shore front and say they filmed and counted the marchers, as they have at previous events, and afterwards claimed the turnout was just .Director, Alistair McConnachie, said: #All Under One Banner is basically the marching wing of the SNP.

Ryan McConnachie opted to go straight down the middle and evaded the e of the Dunoon keeper.There was a moment of worry at the other end, though, when goalscorer Souden also committed a handball in the Pupils’ box, and referee Peter Laing pointed to the spot. Dunoon halved the Pupils’ advantage, making it -.Then, just  seconds later, the Pupils restored their two-goal lead through Donald McCallum, who met left-sided substitute Kenny Kerr’s low cross to squeeze a shot between the Dunoon defenders and the frame of the goal.Soon after, the Pupils made it -, when Kerr guided another delightful cross onto the head of John McCallum, who guided an effort past the keeper from six yards, but it was the goal creator Kerr who was rightly mobbed by his team-mates.Not content with four, the Feathers-sponsored Pupils scored again, with # stand by # Kerr making it three assists in one match.Played in by McConnachie after some strong play in midfield by fellow substitute Michael McKinlay, Kerr set up young winger Ross Brown, who gladly tucked home goal number five with a close-range finish.With the match drawing to a close, McConnachie sealed his brace # and the Pupils’ sixth goal # with an excellent inidual effort, surging past a defender before rounding the hosts’ keeper and slotting the ball low into an unguarded net, adding gloss to an already emphatic cup win.After a great team performance, the Pupils will be hoping for more of the same tomorrowwhen they welcome a Tarbert side # who last week also defeated Dunoon # in a Kintyre derby.The match is scheduled for a pm kick off at Kintyre Park."},{"url":null,"title":"third round of tarberts golf championship","story":"Former champion Bruce MacNab held a four-shot lead going into the third round but a horror start saw the lead wiped out at the very first hole when Iain Macalister birdied and Bruce had a seven.Iain went on to birdie the second hole as well and despite the windy conditions was very much in control of his game over the first nine holes to be out in .John MacNab was also playing his normal steady game also ing , enjoying birdies at the st and th holes.After nine holes Iain had turned a four-shot deficit into a four-shot lead over Bruce and six ahead of John.Over the next four holes both Iain and John dropped four shots allowing Bruce some breathing space to claw back some of the deficit.When play was complete and all scores checked the totals after round three were as follows: Iain Macalister , Bruce MacNab , John MacNab .In the John Reid Quaich the silverware again headed south to Largieside with Duncan Johnstone retaining the trophy, shooting  nett over the two rounds.

Work is expected to start at the end of the month and should be completed by the send of September.Councillor Frank T. Spears stated that the work would not involve any long-term closure of the main roadway.The #dry bridge#, owned by Lord Margadale, has been the subject of much discussion and minor rows for the past several months. Since Western Ferries Ltd. began their sea service, heavy articulated lorries carrying malt and grain to the island#s distilleries have been unable to go under the bridge. Matters came to a head three months ago when Argyll County Council re-imposed a weight limit on the Glen road # the ersion used by the transporters to avoid the bridge.The bridge owners came quickly to the rescue and allowed the heavy traffic to use their private road at Bridgend for a three-week period, but following local protests and legal consultations the transporters were again allowed to use the Glen road.Leboat saves three on rocksThe crew of a lobster fishing boat were marooned on a partially-submerged rock for more than two hours when their vessel foundered off the north-east coast of Islay on Thursday morning.The ft #May#, owned and skippered by -year-old Mr Lachlan Clark of Port Charlotte # the veteran of several sea-dramas # struck the rocks while they were lting lobster creels.The Islay leboat was called out to rescue the skipper and his crew # Alastair MacDonald, a -year-old fisherman, and Norman Gardiner, a -year-old Colonsay doctor#s son who was making his first trip and deputising for a sick crew member.Following the rescue, the crew # who were unhurt # were landed at Port Askaig.ONE-HUNDRED YEARS AGONational Health Insurance ActA number of contraventions of the National Health Insurance Act were the subject of prosecutions in Campbeltown Sherf Court on Thursday # Sherf MacMaster Campbell on the bench.The first case was that of a Clachan merchant who was charged with neglecting to stamp the card of a female servant.Mr M. Dick, solicitor, who appeared for accused, tendered a plea of guilty, and said the observations he was about to make would apply equally to all the cases subsequently to be heard. These were the first prosecutions of the kind in this court. The Act, as his Lordship knew, was a most voluminous and complicated measure.The sherf observed that some excellent and very lucid summaries had been circulated.Mr Dick, proceeding, asked his Lordship to examine the contribution card. He would find that the part which was the very kernel of the offence was embodied in the middle of Art.  in very inconspicuous type. The employer was there required to stamp the card #not later than the time at which wages are paid# but to read that one required to hold the card at about  degrees.The sherf askedhe was to understand that this was the first occasion on which a domestic servant had been employed by accused  If not, he must have been trained in the use of this wonderful document years ago.Mr Dick said his Lordship must consider this, that in cases of this kind there were two standards of clearness. What was clear to the judicial mind might be very far from clear to the lay mind.It was a matter of common knowledge that there was a very general belief in this part of the country thatinsurance cards were stamped at the time they were run out the Act would be complied with.The card, of course, bore that the stamps must be affixed #not later than the time wages are paid#. He asked his Lordship to consider the phraseology. These cards came into the hands of many rustic employers of labour. Why should it not be stated in bold characters on the card that the stamps must be affixed at the time wages are paid In the country wages were paid sometimes by the half-year, sometimes by the month, and sometimes at irregular periods suitable to the circumstances of the worker.The cards represented not the half-year of the feeing terms, but the calendar half-year. All these circumstances contributed to the confusion of the lay mind, and encouraged the widespread impression thatthe cards were stamped at the end of the period the duty of a citizen was thereby fulfilled."},{"url":null,"title":"leader august 23 2019","story":"The Courier is honoured to deliver news to the community # during the good times and the bad.This week we were delighted to share the news that Campbeltown now boasts the #whisky bar of the year#, according to judges at the Scottish Bar and Pub Awards , who bestowed the title to the Ardshiel Hotel.Since buying the hotel more than a decade ago, Flora Grant and Marion MacKinnon have more than tripled the number of whiskies on offer, turning the hotel into something of a tourist attraction in itself.However, we also revealed that nine jobs have been lost at Campbeltown Creamery.While it is still hoped that a take-over by local farmers is the future for the site, it is terrible for the iniduals who have lost their jobs, some after many, many years.We know there is a market for Campbeltown cheese, and while the number of farms supplying the creamery has fallen over the years, there are still almost .Here#s hoping the future is bright for both Campbeltown#s whiskies and cheeses."},{"url":null,"title":"fun in the sun at first mokfest","story":"India enjoyed herself at this year#s Up The Close event, which included children#s entertainer Funky Chicken and ious fair attractions, and was made all the better by the glorious sunshine.India was joined by her mum Lynsey Mcshannon, who was able to get into the spirit of things this year having been heavily pregnant last year, and her dad Gary Anderson.This year#s Up The Close was a particular hit, with the welcome , after nearly a decade, of indie rockers a new hope "},{"url":null,"title":"more music in store for the wee toon","story":"On Wednesday, September  at .pm, well-known folksinger, entertainer and broadcaster Alastair McDonald will be in concert in Campbeltown Free Church.This will not be Alastair’s first visit to the Wee Toon.

His missionary work took him all over Scotland, including the coastline of the Forth. It is said his arrival at this small natural harbour gave the place its name.Last weekend, artist Andrew Crummy, who lives in the village, organised three lsquosunset eveningsrsquo at the Boat Shore. Local musicians, singers, artists and actors gathered on the beach with an audience of fellow locals to share the sunset.I sadly couldnrsquot attend the first two but was able to make the last evening with some of my children. It was a wonderful mix of music and song, with a very funny short drama, and a setting sun as the backdrop.It was a poignant evening for myself, and I know for some others too a moment of reflection as well as coming together. I had planned to tell a tale about St Kenneth, but I changed my mind just before the event.Instead, I told a tale of a friendship between a tortoise and a butterfly and what sunsets meant to them. In story, anything is possible, and I made this tale to help ease someonersquos sadness in experiencing an ending.I was later askedI could share it, and so here is the story:There was once a tortoise who became friends with a butterfly. On the first day of their friendship, the tortoise invited the butterfly to sit with him on his favourite rock, to watch the sunset.However, Butterfly had no idea what a sunset was, and so when she saw the sun fall gradually from the sky she became concerned.ldquoWhatrsquos happening to the sun  she asked in a worried tone.ldquoItrsquos the sunset, said Tortoise, ldquoitrsquos when the sun goes down and ends the day.ldquoWhat, already! Thatrsquos it  asked Butterfly, horried. ldquoThis is just my first day being a butterfly and my days are over Tortoise smiled: ldquoNo my wee friend, itrsquos not all over. The sun will come back and there will be another day.But Butterfly remained anxious: ldquoHow can you be sure the sun will come back ldquoTrust me, I know. Irsquove seen many sunsets, said Tortoise. ldquoThe sun always comes back. Sometimes it takes longer than others, sometimes you canrsquot see the sun because of clouds, but it always s and makes another day.Butterfly was now reassured and so settled down to watch, as the sun dipped lower, painting the sky. She expected the sun to sizzle and the sea to steam when they touched each other, but of course that didnrsquot happen. The sun slid quietly below the horizon, leaving a trail of bright red and orange.ldquoThat was beautul, wasnrsquot it  Tortoise said.But Butterflyrsquos reply was unexpected: ldquoI think I donrsquot like sunsets very much.Tortoise curled up the wrinkles on his old face in surprise: ldquoWhy not, donrsquot you think it was spectacular, the way it painted the sky ldquoSuppose, but it was sad, really sad, said Butterfly.ldquoSad ldquoYes, because the sunset ends the day and thatrsquos sad. Endings are sad.Tortoise nodded in a way tortoises do when theyrsquore thinking: ldquoYes thatrsquos true, endings can be sad. But everything ends sooner or later. Nothing lasts forever.ldquoBut thatrsquos what I mean Tortoise, itrsquos so sad. I donrsquot want to sit and celebrate the end of something.Tortoise thought for a moment: ldquoAlthough endings can be sad, they also give meaning and value to our time. Without sunsets we would not treasure our days. Our le would become one long blah of sameness.ldquoA blah of sameness ldquoYes, my expression, smiled Tortoise proudly.ldquoBut thatrsquos easy for you to say, Tortoise, because you have more time than me, you will have more days.ldquoPerhaps, but that means your time is more precious than mine. And your sunsets are greater celebrations of your days.Butterfly thought about this. ldquoYou seem quite wise, Tortoise, she said, looking at her friend.ldquoYes, he replied immodestly, ldquoI do have that reputation. I suppose I have a lot of time to think, sitting on this rock.It began to get dark and colder.ldquoNow itrsquos time for our dreams. Soon there will be the sunrise, said Tortoise.ldquoSunrise  Is that when the sun s Tortoise nodded: ldquoYes, you see you donrsquot get a sunrise without a sunset. Although endings can be sad, they open the door to new beginnings. At the other side of a sunset there is a sunrise.Tortoise was indeed wise and Butterfly felt reassured by his wisdom.That summer, the two friends watched many sunsets together. They would share stories about their day as the sun went down. Then one evening, as flocks of geese were flying overhead, Butterfly spoke sadly.ldquoTortoise, I need to go. Itrsquos getting cold. Irsquom off to Africa. Do you think there are sunsets there ldquoIrsquom sure of it, replied Tortoise.ldquoI love sunsets now, said Butterfly. ldquoThey have shown me to treasure and celebrate my days. But I am sad this is our last one together.ldquoMe too, said Tortoise.The two friends sat together on their rock as the sunset commemorated their summer with a blaze of colour. Then they said goodbye.A new dawn now lay ahead for them both, for the end of one story is the beginning of another.And at the other side of a goodbye, there is a

One way we can fight back against ecological collapse is to have wilder, unmown, unsprayed spaces around us. Short grass and manicured parks may look neat but itrsquos vital to have flourishing wild spaces too.Rewilding East Lothian wants the council to commit to planting thousands more trees to help absorb the carbon dioxide emissions that are driving global warming.In addition, the council has been challenged to radically reduce mowing and weed-killing, since weeds provide homes for bees and other pollinators, and to mitigate the loss of green spaces to housing by proactively making dedicated areas for nature to flourish.A council spokeswoman said East Lothianrsquos reputation as the Garden County was ldquoappreciated by residents and visitors alike.

When the corn was eventually gathered in early September, it is said decaying corpses were discovered. They had lain in the fields since August , a day of barbaric infamy in Tranentrsquos history. The dead were victims of the Tranent Massacre, and one of the bodies may have been that of Jackie Crookston or Crookstone.I say lsquomayrsquo for there is ironically so little known about this well-known woman. A statue by David Annand of Jackie on Tranent High Street shows her beating her drum with a clenched fist, defiantly leading the protest against the Militia Act. The plaque by the statue calls her a ldquoresolute woman who joined the protest, and states she was one of those killed by the cavalry.Her heroic reputation is well established in local lore. The th-century historian John Martine called her ldquoa Tranent virago. This word describes a woman of brave, fearless qualities, but it has a sting in its tail. It can also be used to mean a woman who has overstepped her mark, broken cultural rules in relation to her role as defined by gender.And by leading the protest against the Militia Act she most certainly did this.Another th-century historian and collector of traditions, P. MrsquoNeill, was clear on her role: ldquoJackie indeed was the prime mover in the whole affair, he states.We have accounts of her beating her drum and leading the protest with chants of ldquonae militia. She is said to have threatened a captain of the cavalry and declared defiantly that ldquoshe didna care a pin though she were cut in halves, she wad hae nae militia. Another account has her telling a member of the yeomanry to leave or she would ldquothraw his neck, at which he duly rode off.If these accounts are true, she was indeed resolute on that day in defending her family, her neighbours and her community. Jackie was not the only woman on the streets that day, for women took a leading role in defending their families. But she was the most prominent, it seems.The Militia Act aimed to conscript young men into a militia by means of a ballot. It was resisted for a number of reasons, but for the poverty-stricken mining and farming communities of Tranent and the surrounding area, it was seen as an imposition which would take young men of working age away and potentially cripple their families economically.There is no space here to recount the details of the massacre, but much of what happened on that day remains hidden behind a mist of cover-up and official indference.And somewhere in the bloody carnage of August , , Jackie Crookston was killed, along with many others. Yet despite her leading role, her name was not included in the original list of people killed. Eleven deaths were recorded, but no mention of Jackie. ldquoHow her death escaped recording is dficult to explain, reflected P. MrsquoNeill in his book Tranent and its Surroundings.Perhaps an explanation can be found in an eyewitness account written immediately after the massacre. It was a letter from Archibald Roger to his we in Edinburgh.It begins: ldquoDear we, this comes to acquaint you that you need not weary for my ing home, for my sister is to be buried this afternoon at four orsquoclock, and I cannot come away till I see her decently interred. I am sorry to inform you of the cruelties that were committed here yesterday there were six persons shot dead on the spot, of which my sister was onehellip the number of wounded is not yet ascertained, but I am just now informed that  dead corpses were this morning found in the corn-fields and it is not known how many more may be found when the corn is cut.Was Jackie one of those lying undiscovered in a field  It seems so by some accounts. Is that why her death was not on the list  Sandy Mullay in his book The Tranent Massacre says she was shot in the streets, but there is also a tradition which states her body was found well away from Tranent much later in a field, with stab as well as gunshot wounds.Was she initially wounded and then a victim of later retribution  Was she hunted down in an unrecorded atrocity because of her role as ring leader, and a woman who didnrsquot know her place  She will have been easy to identy because of her prominence in the protest.Her death, just like her le, is unrecorded by history. Despite her leadership in the events, she was a woman and she was poor, and history lacks interest in such characters. A tax on the registration of births and deaths at this time meant many poor people lived and died unregistered even in parish records.So who was Jackie  We know she was born in Gladsmuir in June  and was a mother. Perhaps not all her children were registered because of the tax, but it seems she had at least four surviving at the time of the massacre. She was only  when she died, but how do we imagine her le  What was behind her passion in defending her community When I spoke of her to artist Mags Nisbet-Macfarlane, she was inspired to use art to search for the woman behind the historical glimpses.ldquoI felt connected to this woman I did not know, she told me, ldquoshe will have had a le that explains her defiance that day she had so little, but was protecting what was important to her. Magsrsquo image of Jackie tells a story without the need of words.The plaque by the statue in Tranent says there were  killed in the massacre, as Jackiersquos name has been added to the original . But in truth we will never know for sure how many were really killed and maimed that day.There was no prosecution of those responsible, no investigation and no interest by those in authority to allow the truth to be told."},{"url":null,"title":"new-dunbar-area-radio-station-hunt-volunteers","story":"Sescot Radio, previously known as Dunbar On Air, is looking to take to the airwaves and have the community at the heart of its programmes.Andrew Morris, who is behind the proposals, was keen to get people involved, whether that was on air or behind the scenes.He told the Courier: ldquoFirst of all, we are an internet radio station so our catchment area is all around the world.ldquoBut, from a common sense point of view, there is no physical radio covering from East Linton and Dunbar right down the coast to Burnmouth and along to Kelso wersquove got a triangle.ldquoIrsquom keen that these little places that have got two or three cottages are just as involved.ldquoWhat we are doing is covering Eyemouth, Dunbar and Kelso but we donrsquot want to preclude these folk either.ldquoWe want to involve everybody and preclude nobody.Already, the fledgling station has been out in the community and got involved with Dunbar Civic Week earlier this summer.Mr Morris was keen to see the radio station cater to as large an audience as possible.The -year-old was previously involved with both East Coast FM in Haddington and Tranent-based East Lothian FM, which is now Radio Saltire.He told the Courier that he had interviewed a number of East Lothian councillors on air but the focus was firmly away from politics and instead looked at a number of dferent topics.That was something he was keen to consider repeating, with other shows looking at ious genres of music, as well as cooking shows.As well as music, the station would promote local good causes and encourage involvement from schools, charities, clubs and other organisations.Now, Mr Morris, who lives on Dunbarrsquos John Muir Crescent, is calling on members of the public to come forward and offer a helping hand to get the station off the ground.A meeting takes place at Hallhill Sports Centre in Dunbar on Wednesday evening.Mr Morris said: ldquoWe are progressing but a lot slower than I hoped.ldquoWe have got ious applications out for grant money and have been awarded some but we need a lot more before we think about buying the gear that we need.ldquoWe are also anxious to find some suitable premises.In-house training will be provided at the station, which will be run entirely by volunteers.The station also intends to offer work experience opportunities for those looking to find their way into a career in the media.The meeting takes place at pm, when members of the public will be updated on the stationrsquos progress."},{"url":null,"title":"up-and-coming-band-go-first-scottish-tour","story":"Johnny Brown and the Devanties, made up of frontman Johnny Brown, , Erin Ritchie, , Andrew Dobie, , and Struan Blacklock, , will be heading to Aberdeen at the start of next month on the first gig of their headline tour.Johnny told the Courier: ldquoIrsquove been singing and writing music since I was about  years old.ldquoI knew the tour manager for The View so ended up playing a few gigs with them.ldquoIrsquove played the EH festival and once I had the chance to play with Republica.ldquoIn January I reconnected with a few people I went to school with through the music scene and we decided to form the band.ldquoWersquove released one single and our next one, Streetlights, will be released after the tour.Johnny of Edinburgh Road, Cockenzie, met his fellow bandmates while at Preston Lodge High School.He said: ldquoWe had to make sure that we were able to sell out shows before we knew we could tour.ldquoWe sold out about seven gigs in a row, so thatrsquos when we thought we should give it a go.The bandrsquos first single, Brooklyn, was released just after they were first formed in January and garnered good reviews, in particular from Discover Music, Scotlandrsquos Music Blog.As to the future, Johnny said: ldquoWersquore hoping our tour and our new single will do really well, hopefully itrsquoll help us break through.

This is an unpleasant fact of le and one that Prince Andrew is discovering belatedly to his cost.For some time now, speculation has been mounting after the publication of a photo showing the Prince walking in a New York park with his friend, the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who was recently found dead in a prison cell, where he awaited trial on charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy to engage in sex-trafficking.The headlines must have made the Palace shudder, their insinuations all too clear. After details of a US lawsuit mentioning him were released, a terse statement was issued distancing the Prince from historic accusations made against Epstein, and claiming that ldquoAny suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue.:Prince Andrew hosted Jeffrey Epstein at BalmoralClose observers of Buckingham Palace might have noticed a cloud of dust around the flagpole as the house was shaken to its foundations. When the Daily Mail published footage recently showing the Duke of York ushering a young woman out of Epsteinrsquos Manhattan apartment in , a further statement was issued. The Duke, it said, ldquodeplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent.Poor Prince Andrew. He is discovering what every child in the playground knows: that you are tarred and feathered with the same brush as those with whom you mix. If one of your gang throws a brick through a window, you are deemed guilty too, evenyou did nothing wrong.In the case of His Royal Highness, letrsquos put aside for a moment the suspicions his closeness to Epstein, following his release from prison, arouse. Bad enough that Andrewrsquos personal contacts are so dodgy they raise serious questions about his judgement, let alone his behaviour.If nothing , these images suggest one of two things: that the Prince was a loyal chum who stuck by Epstein, despite his ruined reputation and the risk it posed to his own. Or that, living as he did in a gilded cage, removed from real le and the consequences of any stupid decisions he made, he was utterly unconcerned about the effect their friendship might have on his prospects. When you are cocooned from birth in a cradle of privilege when you are feted, indulged, and pandered to by sycophants and liggers from the minute you can shake a rattle, it must be easy to believe you are above the normal rules and standards by which society works.Meeting in the park with Epstein was, at best, decidedly odd for someone in Prince Andrewrsquos position. Going to his apartment, however, where a stone satyr presides over the front door, was simply crazy. According to police who raided the property, they seized photos of underage girls. These and the fetishist decor would have led most ordinary visitors to make a swt exit.These images of the Duke of York date from the period when he was acting as British ldquoSpecial Representative for Trade and Investment. A bespoke role for an aimless aristocrat, it gave him licence to roam the globe, meeting fat cats in rich countries and opportunistic states in the hope that some of their wealth would find its way into Britainrsquos Treasury.:In Pictures: Commonwealth leaders gather for state dinnerDuring his deployment as an envoy, Prince Andrew made ious embarrassing ldquomissteps, among them some politically unwise associations. Nothing, however, could compare with being identied as one of Epsteinrsquos cronies, after which revelation he relinquished the post.As the grapevine quivers with anticipation over other high-profile names likely to be found in Epsteinrsquos fat address book, the Dukersquos predicament is increasingly grave. He can hide behind the Palace gates and hope the storm will pass, but this is a story that has been brewing for years. Until certain questions are satisfactorily answered, as far as hersquos concerned it is far from over.Doubtless, it will go against every royal instinct, but would he not be wiser to face the cameras, do an in-depth interview, and silence ndash perhaps even charm ndash his critics  In a situation like this, where unfettered gossip is fuelling supposition, Prince Andrew surely needs to explain his connection with Epstein and help suffocate the scandal. It would, of course, be a historic move. No member of the royal dynasty has ever voluntarily gone on record to put their side of a wildfire story, with the exception of Princess Diana. In her unforgettable, kohl-eyed interview with Martin Bashir, she was more focused on scoring points against Prince Charles than in illuminating her own often dubious actions.Sticklers for Palace protocol might feel sick at the thought of Prince Andrew going public. Even in the hands of the most measured journalist ndash Kirsty Wark, say, or Fiona Bruce ndash it would be viewed as stepping into the lionrsquos den, a suicidally reckless act. Added to which, the Windsors do not explain. They take a long view, recognising that the passage of time usually allows even the most unsavoury episodes to fade into oblivion.In this instance, however, that seems unlikely. So what is worse  Staying schtum, and waiting for more seedy revelations to be added to the blaze, or allowing the Duke to get ahead of the story, and give his version of events By remaining aloof, the Palacersquos response suggests it hopes to avoid further fallout. The implication of this is all too plain: royals might not be above the law, but its arm would have to be very long indeed to winkle one of them out of the front door and into a Black Maria. Inviting a Windsor to a police interview, let alone into a courtroom, would require Herculean effort, and a mountain of cast-iron evidence. By contrast,Andrew were willing to face, refute and defuse the rumours, it would be an act of bravery to restore family pride."},{"url":null,"title":"rock-stars-family-built-scotland-39-s-great-lighthouses","story":"For those in peril on the seas or simply trying to find their way home, the reassuring glow from the lighthouses they built offered a welcome beacon of hope in the dark, stormy night.And for those attempting to navigate Scotland by pony and trap, on horseback or hardy souls on foot, the bridges they designed offered a welcome solution to painful journeys that might otherwise have involved extra miles and even days of exhausting travel.Across theand breadth of the country, harbours, crossings, canals, river improvement works and, of course, scores of lighthouses rooted on rocky outcrops that have sent their warning light into the darkness for more than  years, are stamped with the name of a single pioneering engineering family.While one son, Robert Louis Stevenson, would spurn engineering to achieve fame for his literary achievements, other members of the Stevenson family were busy taming Scotlandrsquos wild coastline, building towering lighthouses that defied the elements.Many, even in this digital age of modern navigation equipment, still shine on through the harshest stormy night, albeit operated by remote control from the heart of Edinburgh.Now a guide to the intricate drawings and plans associated with countless engineering and construction projects carried out by the Stevenson family has been made available online, offering the opportunity to see their incredible craft in a fresh light.Around half of the National Library of Scotlandrsquos collection of more than  items documenting the Stevenson familyrsquos contribution to Scottish engineering history have so far been uploaded to a new online map which plots records of archive items onto their corresponding locations around the country.The map ndash which eventually will include the remaining  maps and documents - offers an insight into the extraordinary extent of the Edinburgh familyrsquos influence on Scottish le, from helping to keep those at sea a little safer, to opening river routes and harbour entrances to ease the passage of vessels, and canals and bridges.Indeed, points out Chris Fleet, Map Curator at the National Library of Scotland, while the Stevenson family may be best known for constructing every lighthouse in Scotland, the plans and designs show that element only made up around % of their work.ldquoBy far the greatest proportion of their work was far more mundane but important aspects of infrastructure like harbours, breakwaters, slipways and even railway and canal projects, he says.ldquoBut it was their initial work in early th century on the Bell Rock lighthouse that gave the family massive publicity.The long and dangerous reef lying  miles east of Dundee and on the route for vessels navigating to and from the Firths of Tay and Forth, had been a cause for concern for decades and was linked to the loss of up to six ships every winter ndash and as many as  during one particularly stormy season.However, it was the sinking of HMS York in  with the loss of all hands that sparked calls for a lighthouse to be erected on Bell Rock a daring proposal given the surface of the rock typically lies under ft of water, emerging only at low tide.Glasgow-born Robert Stevenson had already worked as an apprentice to his step-father Thomas Smith, a lamp-maker appointed by the new Northern Lighthouse Board to construct and manage four lighthouses.Aged , Stevenson had already left his stamp on the nationrsquos most treacherous stretches of coastline when he completed the erection of a lighthouse on Little Cumbrae in the Clyde.He was in his mid-s and had already crafted plans for a Bell Rock lighthouse when the HMS York disaster prompted calls for it to be adopted.In a remarkable feat of endeavour and bravery, workmen defied the crashing waves surrounding the rock to begin their excavation work in .It would take four years of construction before the towerrsquos first beam of light shone ndash alerting countless sailors down the years to the risk and saving innumerable lives in the process.The m tall white and black lighthouse remains the worldrsquos oldest surviving sea-washed lighthouse, although its keepers moved out in  and its light is now operated from the Northern Lighthouse Board offices at  George Street ndash a short distance from the New Town where the Stevenson family made their base.Robert Stevenson went on to serve for nearly  years as engineer to the Northern Lighthouse Board, overseeing the construction and improvements to lighthouses from Sumburgh Head in Shetland, to Barra Head at the southern entrance to The Minch and Scotlandrsquos southernmost point at the Mull of Galloway.His talent for civil engineering ran in the family: his sons, Alan, David and Thomas ndash father of Robert Louis Stevenson ndash would go on to follow in his footsteps.The brothersrsquo lighthouses stretch from the most northerly lighthouse in the British Isles at Muckle Flugga on the Island of Unst ndash  years old and still going strong - to the equally curiously named Chicken House lighthouse on an isolated rocky island at the southern tip of the Isle of Man.At the most isolated, Sule Skerry,  miles west of Orkney and designed to aid the passage of vessels through the Pentland Firth to and from the Iceland seas, keepers would spend a lonely month at a time with just seals, puffins and crashing waves for company.Perhaps the most challenging, however, was the construction of Skerryvore lighthouse. The graceful tower designed by Alan Stevenson is the tallest lighthouse in the country, measuring m of solid granite which were quarried on the Island of Mull throughout its six years of construction.Huge blocks of stone were ferried by tender to Hynish on Tiree to be dressed and shaped to ensure they fitted perfectly into place, before being taken to the site overlooking a reef of treacherous rocks around  miles south west of the island.The family firm was eventually passed to Davidrsquos sons, David Alan and Charles, in the s, and grandson, Charles.But while they continued to specialise in lighthouse design until the s ndash including lighthouses as far afield as New Zealand and Japan, the family also undertook a wide iety of work which helped transform travel and improve infrastructure.Mr Fleet points out that the maps and plans held by the Library show not only the remarkable attention to detail and vision of each designer, but in some cases the changing face of the locations such as harbours which were redesigned to make them safer and easier to navigate, rivers where work was carried out help improve the flow, and roads, bridges and canals which opened swathes of the nation to economic development.However, perhaps the biggest impact of their work is missing from the collection of maps, plans and documents: the countless lives their engineering skills saved.Mike Bullock, Chief Executive of the Northern Lighthouse Board said: ldquoFor over  years Robert Stevenson and his descendants designed and built the majority of Scotlandrsquos Lighthouses.ldquoThey constructed wonders of engineering that have withstood the test of time and the elements.ldquoYou only have to look at Robert Stevensonrsquos Bell Rock Lighthouse, which since  has been continuously safeguarding ships and the lives of their crews and passengers, to recognise their remarkable contribution to our nation."},{"url":null,"title":"ken-smith-bids-fond-farewell-herald-diary","story":"I, though, had had my fill of writing about politics, the death of Scottish industry, and murder trials. Goodness, I had even been a witness in one murder trial where I shared a witness room with enough Glasgow so-called Godfathers to fill a Mario Puzo novel. I was happy to sign up as goose killer.It was only when I mentioned it to colleagues later in The Press Bar and one of them asked about my pay rise that I realised I had not thought to ask for one. I raced back upstairs and collared managing editor Bob Jeffrey and mentioned I had taken a job without discussing money. He shook his head and said he would see what he could do. Editors shaking their heads has been a regular mot in my career.Dferent times, of course. I reckon I was the last Herald reporter to claim for a dinner suit on expenses as invitations to awards events at hotels such as the Albany, the Hilton and whatever The Thistle hotel was called that week, rained in on us. It was a younger mans game then. Drinks in the bar went on into the small hours. I was once walking home down Byres Road in my dinner suit at seven in the morning thinking it was an odd way to earn a living.But as I say, I wasnt always a dilettante. \"One of my boulediers\" as editor Arnold Kemp once described me, not unkindly I hoped. I had moved in my early twenties from weekly newspapers to the Evening Times newsroom where typewriters were still used, copy takers took your calls from the office radio car, and you were in deadly competition to file your story before the Evening Citizen. No mobile phones, of course, and in areas where phone boxes were merely stench-filled public toilets with broken handsets, you would knock on someones door, announce you were a member of Her Majestys Press, and a wee wey would graciously allow you to use her phone, planked on a table in the hall. If you were lucky she would even go away and make you a cup of tea while you were phoning. We had a better reputation back then.There was no internet to glean information. Instead you would chap doors, stop folk in the street, and quiz imbibers in local boozers. Back at the Albion Street office you would then take your break next door in The Press Bar. It was originally the Express Bar, but when the Express pulled out of Glasgow, owner Tom McEntee simply got a ladder out and unscrewed the E and the X. Not just a pub though. Cheques were cashed there in the days before ATMs, money was even borrowed, and advice was given by fellow journalists with much more experience. I once asked Des McEnteehe ever had to throw out a journalist for fighting. \"Just the one,\" he said. \"Magnus Magnusson.\" What  The mild-mannered gentleman of Mastermind fame  Yes indeed ndash but someone had insulted his we, a fellow journalist, and he had gamely thrown a punch before being guided out the door.I dont want to romanticise drinking ndash it took away too many colleagues at an early age ndash but many of the most colourful, outrageous, and yes regrettable, events in my le began with a drink in Toms as we then called it. I didnt get into a fight there but I do recall being sent to interview Billy Connolly before he caught the ferry to Rothesay to perform at a charity gig. Unbeknown to me, our Womens Editor had that day lambasted Billy in print for giving his daughters the odd names ndash well odd for Glasgow back then ndash of Scarlett and Daisy. When I introduced myself he blew up and threatened to throw me in the ClydeI followed him on the ferry. I scurried off and phoned my news editor who imperiously announced: \"The Evening Times will not be dictated to by a banjo player. Get on that ferry.\"Other stories were utterly bleak. I reported every day of the y Ice Cream Wars murder trial of TC Campbell and Joe Steele accused of killing six members of the Doyle family ndash a decent family targeted merely because a son drove an ice cream van. It was turning over the stone as the worst of Glasgow came crawling out.I then became an industrial reporter, met some of the most helpful, committed trade unionists around, but slowly realised I was overseeing the death of heavy industry in Scotland. It won me press awards as I went behind the employment numbers and reported on the human cost of jobs lost, families on poverty benefits, and workers left with little hope of working again.I once pursued the Caterpillar dispute shop stewards at a meeting off Clyde Street in Glasgow. I had to take them for a drink. Dark rum was the tipple. I eventually staggered out to sit slumped on a bench overlooking the Clyde, thinking I was about to throw up ndash dark rum is not a drink to be treated lightly. A passing jakie carrying a can of Special Brew was so concerned he stopped to askI was alright. Thats how glamorous it was at times. When the Ravenscraig workers marched to Downing Street my editor sent me with them, and of course I had to do my share of walking. I still have a statue of a foundry worker cast to mark the -day march on my desk. Lost a bit of weight mind you, which the hotel dinners later overcame.So I moved from the Evening Times to the then Glasgow Herald as I fancied the idea of using bigger words and longer sentences. I was mainly reporting still on industry but also on politics. There was a fresh-faced young leader of the SNP, an Alex Salmond, who talked of gaining power, but no one took him that seriously.And then came the move to the Diary to help Tom who eventually decided on his own move to other journalistic outlets. The paper had trundled from Albion Street to Cowcaddens, and using The Press Bar as a second office was no more. It was probably a good thing for my health. Fortunately David Belcher helped me with the Diary before he too left me to it.I was there on my own the day Sean Connery phoned from the Bahamas. He read the Diary online and he couldnt get the drt of one of the stories and could I please explain. The accent is so well-known I was looking around to seesomeone in the office was doing an impression. But no it was Sean. Didnt give me any stories though.And now it is my turn to leave and pass the Diary baton on. The dinner suit had its final journalistic outing at the Scottish Bar Awards at The Hilton last week. Fortunately I was tucked up at home well before seven in the morning. To Diary readers my heartfelt thanks in providing thousands of stories over the years. I didnt write the Diary, I was merely the conduit for the funny, observant and literate readers out there who took the time to fuel the column every day. I have a huge debt of gratitude.Before social media, readers expressed their criticism more in The Heralds letters pages. I still have the cutting when a reader wrote: \"Ken Smith in his Diary piece on Keir Hardie aims presumably at wit: what he achieves is smart-aleckry at its most crass.\" Thank you, dear readers, for putting up with my crass smart-aleckry over all these years, and play nice with the new boy.Kens last Diary will appear this Saturday. But never fear, Lorne Jackson, who has provided holiday cover for Ken, will be taking over.CAREER HIGHReceiving a press award from Princess Anne, although on reflection I think I went into a too detailed explanation of relative house prices when she simply asked meI had thought of moving to a London newspaper.CAREER LOWStanding in the falling snow outside a Springburn tenement on Christmas Day trying to interview a family about their son murdered on Christmas Eve while their menacing neighbour, quite rightly, threatened to batter me into the New YearI approached their door again.MOST IMPRESSIVE UNION OFFICIALJimmy Airlie, not Jimmy Reid, was actually the inspiring orator from the Clyde shipyard work-in days, and could hold a crowd in his hand with his powerful speeches, but Tommy Brennan, leader of the Ravenscraig workers, was a stand-out for his admirable integrity and ability to argue the steelworks case with quiet logic and determination.MOST IMPRESSIVE POLITICIANYou kidding  Well,pushed I would say John Smith: erudite, visionary and actually likeable.

It means job losses, it means medicine shortages and it means years of economic uncertainty. It is for those reasons, and more, that no deal simply cannot be allowed to happen.When I was elected to Parliament in , I vowed to do everything in my power to protect and serve the interests of those who put their trust in me ndash my constituents. Unlike the Prime Minister and his Etonian clique, they will not be protected from the fallout of a no-deal Brexit just as they have no protection from the Tory governmentrsquos heinous policies like Universal Credit or the two-child cap.The official slogan of the Leave campaign was Take Back Control. Nowhere did it say that ldquotaking back control meant shutting down Parliament and hoarding power at  Downing Street. Be in no doubt, this weekrsquos actions are those of a reckless, manipulative bully who is terried of scrutiny and terried of being exposed That is what we, as parliamentarians, must ensure we prevent. Because we live in a democracy, not an autocracy.Itrsquos likely we have one shot at stopping Boris Johnson from inflicting irreversible damage to this country. Thatrsquos exactly why Labour has convened meetings with all opposition parties to present a united front and to send a clear message to Johnson ndash no way to no deal.The archaic processes of the House of Commons mean that the Government tends to have free rein when it comes to the business of the house. However, in a time of national crisis, and in the wake of the decision by Boris Johnson to shut down Parliament, all MPs must be heard. So,the Prime Minister is so confident that he can shut down Parliament, why wonrsquot he agree to let MPs vote on that proposal If he wonrsquot agree to a simple vote on whether no deal should happen, a proposal that has been roundly defeated every single time it has been put to a vote in the House of Commons, then we will force his hand. That means enacting legislation that ensures he cannot shut down our democratic institutions in order to force through a no-deal Brexit. It also means leaving open the possibility of a Vote of No Confidence and removing him from power entirely. Whatever the mechanism used, the absolute imperative in Parliament next week is to stop us falling out of the EU without a deal and I, and the Labour Party, will do everything in our power to ensure that never happens.Lesley Laird is MP for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath, and Shadow Secretary of State for ScotlandLesley Laird is MP for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath, and Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"michael-gove-accused-39-contempt-democracy-39-refusing-say-govt-abide-mps-39-vote-block-no-deal","story":"The warning from Labour came after Michael Gove refused to confirm the UK Government would abide by legislation blocking a no-deal Brexitit were forced through by Tory rebels and the Opposition.Ahead of what promises to be an historic parliamentary showdown this week, the Cabinet Office Minister knocked back fears of food shortages in a no-deal outcome but admitted that some food prices would increasethe UK crashed out of the EU without a deal on October .Pressed repeatedly on whether the Government would abide by a successful bid by Commons opponents to pass legislation preventing a no-deal withdrawal at Hallowersquoen, Mr Gove told BBC Ones The Andrew Marr Show: \"Lets see what the legislation says.

Any move to ignore an act of Parliament would be a full-blown attack on our constitution.\"It is staggering that in the same interview, Michael Gove admitted that the no-deal Brexit the Government is attempting to ram through will hit peoplersquos living standards with increased food prices.ldquoThis is a price that Boris Johnson is willing to pay because it wonrsquot be him and his wealthy friends paying it but ordinary families already struggling after nine years of austerity.Mr Trickett added: \"It is the people, not an unelected prime minister in hock to the vested interests of the richest, who should determine our countryrsquos future.\"Pete Wishart for the SNP said: \"The Tories are jumping up the dictatorial scale at an alarming rate, bounding from plans to suspend Parliament and now refusing to saythey will abide by the law.

He replied: \"Everyone will have the food they need,\" and then added: \"No, there will be no shortages of fresh food.\"Askedfood prices would increase, the Scot replied: \"There are a number of economic factors in play. Some prices may go up. Other prices will come down.\"Elsewhere, Labourrsquos John McDonnell said Mr Johnson and his government were \"insulting the intelligence of the British people\" in their explanation for suspending Parliament for up to five weeks until mid-October.Describing the Tory leader as behaving like a ldquodictator, the Shadow Chancellor declared: \"Just because a Prime Minister is worried that theyll lose a vote in Parliament, to then use the tactic of closing down Parliament, in our parliamentary democracy, is unacceptable.\""},{"url":null,"title":"uk-government-launches-100m-39-get-ready-brexit-39-ad-campaign","story":"The campaign, estimated to cost pound million, will run across television, social media, billboards and other s.

After following its progress, they recently contracted Mr McColl.ldquoI think he nearly fell off his chair when he heard the similarities between our situations.Mr Davies, CEO at Davie, said a fixed price for the CalMac ferries was ldquoa complete fiction, given the rules governing such boats in the UK didnrsquot exist when the contract began.ldquoItrsquos not like a Ford Fiesta and you turn up and say I want the blue one, he said. ldquoYoursquore talking about a technology which is very new.

Itrsquos aspirational.Mr Vicefield said CMALrsquos attitude showed a basic misunderstanding of shipbuilding.ldquoTo be honest, no shipbuilding project is really fixed price because you will always have changes as you go through.ldquoItrsquos always easy to put the blame on the shipyard, but in fact the buyer of a ship is equally as important in ensuring a successful outcome for a shipbuilding programme.The pair are critical of CMALand the Government.ldquoIf they had built the ships in the biggest, most experienced, most established shipyard in the world, they would still have encountered these problems, said Mr Vicefield, adding he was impressed by the technical abilities at Fergusonrsquos.ldquoFrom our perspective, the nationalisation of a shipyard is a terrible idea and thatrsquos obviously the governmentrsquos fault. Butyou go back to looking at whorsquos actually to blame for this situation, you really have to look at CMAL.Mr Davies said the government should have taken a much longer view of the situation.ldquoWhen you restart a yard like Ferguson, any yard, it takes a while for the momentum and the throughput to reach stability.ldquoIf they brought McColl back in to run the operation, that could make it work.Mr Vicefield said: ldquoThe best the Scottish Government could do now is bring in some form of independent expert to assess the situation.ldquoAs for the future, they are pessimistic unless the government changes course.If any commercial buyer comes in, theyrsquore going to want exactly the same thing as McColl would want, which is for the client to pay its fair way.

All of this in addition to any extended news bulletins coming your way this week as the Commons s.Anyone would think British politics had turned into the hottest drama since the last series of Line of Duty.It is not dficult to see why the channels are rushing to schedule extra programmes ahead of what promises to be a momentous seven days.Channel rsquos Brexit Debate: A Very British Coup  will be hosted by Krishnan Guru-Murthy and will feature an as yet unannounced  and an audience of . Starting at .pm, it will knock  minutes off the usual Channel  News.: Gove accused on attitudetowards democracyIn summing up the thinking behind the programme, Louisa Compton, Channel  commissioning editor, spoke for her peers on other channels in saying: ldquoThe British public have clearly demonstrated their desire for involvement in these unprecedented political times. Our debate will capture a moment in history that has already seen public opinion split, impromptu marches and will put the electorate front and centre of the national conversation.In other words, we believe this is a big deal with viewers, and do not want to be seen to miss any of it.Asto signal its hostrsquos impatience to get back in the interviewerrsquos chair, The Andrew Marr Show ed yesterday to its old am slot. Not to be outdone, Ridge on Sunday went on air half an hour earlier.Marrrsquos opening monologue is always a good way to take the temperature of the political week to come. As so often in recent times, he was in the mood for drama. Citing the launch of Get Ready, a Government ad campaign to prepare people for Brexit, he said: ldquoItrsquos like being in a plane, assured by the pilot wersquore on course for a smooth landing while the cabin crew warn all the passengers to adopt the brace position. At least it made a change from Titanic and train wreck metaphors.Marr said his main guests, Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer, and Michael Gove, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and the minister in charge of preparations for exiting the EU, were two men ldquobetter placed than anyone  to answer the question of what happens now. One might have thought the Prime Minister, and his all-over-the-papers chief aide Dominic Cummings, fitted such a billing better, but Boris Johnsonrsquos only interview yesterday was with Tim Shipman of the Sunday Times.: Get ready for ad campaignLike Marr, Shipman asked the PM all the right questions. Getting the answers proved more dficult. Both journalists wanted to know what would happenopponents of a no deal Brexit succeeded in passing a bill extending the deadline beyond October . Would the Government abide by it  The PM avoided the answer in the print interview. Mr Gove executed a similar body swerve on Marr, saying: ldquoLetrsquos see what the legislation says.Surely the answer had to be yes, said Marr, it would be the law.ldquoYou are asking me about a pig in a poke and I will wait to see what legislation the opposition may try to bring forward, said the minister. Marr tried again, to no avail.The person who had spent the summer thinking about such legislation, Sir Keir Starmer, was being similarly tight-lipped. Declaring that this week was ldquoalmost certainly the last chance to defeat a no deal Brexit, the Labour MP was askedthe legislation he would table would require the PM to go to the EU and ask for an extension, and no more than that.While refusing to go into detail, his description of any opposition bill as short and simple hinted that it would be along such lines.Given the time frame, it will be dficult enough for any bill to pass before parliament is prorogued. Nor is it clear where opponents go next should the legislation route fail and Labour table a vote of no confidence in the Government. Interviewed on Ridge on Sunday, David Gauke, the former Justice Secretary, said he did not want to do anything that would facilitate a Jeremy Corbyn government.:Glasgow Brexit candidate praises Donald TrumpOn the same programme, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell was looking the very picture of relaxed contentment. It probably helped that he was at home rather than in a studio.The McDonnell sweater, like the couch, was a dusty pink number, and the curtains were chintz. He could only have appeared more reassuringly suburbanhe had been arranging flowers as he spoke.Stephen Dixon, filling in for Ridge, lobbed a Sunday newspaper poll at him putting Labour  points behind the Conservatives. ldquoYou donrsquot want a General Election, do you  he asked Mr McDonnell.ldquoBring it on, smiled the Labour veteran.The action now moves away from the McDonnell sofa to the green and red benches at Westminster.

I guess it makes a change from hunting seals.Much like the Orcas, the pelagic men are the big beasts of the fishing industry, catching and landing large volumes of high-value fish in vessels that they have invested scores of millions of pounds in to keep them safe in wild winter seas that have of the type that the history books tell us thcclaimed the lives of too many fishermen.But they know full well that, just as the Orca is no more important than the sand eel in the ecosystem, this does not make them better than the inshore fisherman who lives next door and makes his living from shellfish or jigging for cod or mackerel.Equally, the guys who go to sea to catch the white fish ndash cod, haddock, monkfish, megrim, hake ndash that you buy in your fishmonger feel neither superior nor inferior.That is because the industry has its own ecosystem, with all the parts dependent on each other toharmoniously.In Shetland, it is possible to witness this in action on a daily basis.From my office window in Lerwick Harbour I can see vans from a range of dferent marine and electrical engineering companies parked next to whitefish vessels while repairs and servicing work are carried out on board.Those same companies, which provide highly skilled employment of the sort that keeps young people in our community and lay the foundations for a strong future, support the pelagic and inshore fleets.Take away any of these fleets and our vibrant engineering sector would be unsustainable.Similarly, without all of these fleets operating, the supply chain ndash fish markets, buyers processors and haulage firms on one side and net-makers, gear providers and wholesalers on the other ndash would be gravely weakened. Jobs would go, people would move away to find work, and the community would shrivel. You can see how it works.Furthermore, the leline ferry and freight services that we are currently encouraging the Scottish Government to enhance to match the volume of seafood being exported, would look a great deal dferent.To put this volume in context, more fish is landed in Shetland every year than in England, Wales and Northern Ireland combined.Beyond that, therersquos the specialist training of fishermen and marine scientic research provided by the NAFC Marine Centre in Scalloway, which is part of the University of the Highlands and Islands, and the small-boat marinas and remote rural piers kept up by community organisations and the local authority.All are at risk from any upset to the delicate balance of the fisheries ecosystem.One of the more persistent and unhelpful myths about the fishing industry is that success in inshore fisheries ndash however measured ndash can come only at the expense of an offshore fleet.The many iants of this theme pitch ldquohaves against ldquohave-nots, ldquobig against ldquosmall and ldquolarge-scale or ldquoindustrial against ldquoartisanal.The main recommendation arising from this viewpoint is typically the reallocation of quota between dferent parts of the fishing fleet.This argument fails to acknowledge the complexity of the relationship between dferent fleet segments in places where inshore fisheries are successful, as I have outlined.Quota is only one factor behind the success or otherwise of inshore fisheries, and quotas already allocated to inshore fleets are often poorly utilised as it is.Some species cannot be caught economically, safely or in an environmentally responsible way except by large, modern boats capable of operating both close to shore and far offshore.Dividing the fishing industry into completely separate segments is not a helpful exercise.Our experience suggests that dferent classes of fishing vessels catching fish in dferent ways effectively combine to create a critical mass in onshore services, from engineering to sale, transport and marketing.This is particularly true of the more remote coastal and island fishing communities, where an inshore fleet of small boats may not be enough to sustain the onshore businesses crucial to successful operations.So, when we look at policy prescriptions to solve this or that ldquoproblem in the industry, we really need to see them in a much wider context, to understand the whole and not just the part or parts, and recognise that they are interdependent elements of an ecosystem that suffersradical surgery is carried out without consideration of the broader impact.Thatrsquos not another way of saying that the industry is resistant to change ndash in my experience the level of innovation, investment and re-investment in fisheries, often as a result of the need to adapt to new situations, whether enforced or naturally occurring, is remarkable.Rather, that when we consider how le in our coastal communities can be improved, we ought to reflect on how we can lt all boats and not just some.Simon Collins is Executive Officer of the Shetland Fishermenrsquos

ldquoinsanity and ldquoa slow motion car-crash for workers and taxpayers.The owners of Canadarsquos Davie yard said the ldquovery short-sighted decision could make it harder to find a buyer for Fergusonrsquos and deter investment in Scotland more generally.They also said thatministers thought Fergusonrsquos would get work on UK defence orders, such as the new Type e frigate, as a nationalised yard ldquothey are smoking crack.Finance Secretary Derek Mackay took Fergusonrsquos into public control last month after it was driven into insolvency by a poundm contract for two CalMac ferries.He said the move would safeguard  jobs and ensure completion of the ferries, which are substantially over-budget and behind schedule.If no commercial buyer is found within a fortnight, the yard will be nationalised.Around  expressions of interest have been received, with the asking price around poundm.Jim McColl, whose Clyde Blowers empire bought Fergusonrsquos in , has blamed CalMacrsquos public sector owner, Caledonian Maritime Assets Ltd , for the situation.He said repeated design changes on the innovative dual-fuel boats led to delays and rising costs, while CMAL insisted it would not pay above its ldquofixed price contract.Mr McColl offered the Government a stake in the yardthey absorbed half the overrun, but Mr Mackay refused, saying it would breach EU state aid rules.The Davie owners said a public sector contract for the same kind of ferries at their yard had uncanny parallels with CMAL and Fergusonrsquos.However, in Canada, an independent expert was used to assess and apportion costs, resolving the dispute and allowing the boats to be delivered.The Davie owners said the Scottish Government should have done the same, and taken a long view rather than nationalise Fergusonrsquos over its inaugural order under Mr McColl.Alex Vicefield, chair of CEO of the Inocea Group which owns Davie, said: ldquoI donrsquot know anyone in their right mind who would think that nationalising a shipyard in  in the western world is a good idea.ldquoIf a successful entrepreneur like Mr McColl canrsquot do it, I can assure you a government wonrsquot be able to do it. You only see government owned shipyards in banana republics.ldquoIt sets a pretty dangerous precedent. If I was a foreign company looking at investing in Scotland and doing business with the Scottish Government, Irsquod be pretty scared that my companyrsquos going to get appropriated like it would do in any other banana republic.James Davies, CEO and president of Davie, said: ldquoTo finish these ships [at Fergusonrsquos] you need somebody whorsquos capable of leading a high quality team to finish a very dficult project. What you donrsquot do is nationalise a shipyard and throw money at it.ldquoTo alienate McColl and those guys, it guarantees that that shipyard will ultimately falter.ldquoWhat signal does it send to private capital  You put your m into this business and then lsquoOh sorry, itrsquos not gone completely to plan and wersquore going to nationalise it.rsquo Good one.Scottish LibDem leader Willie Rennie said: ldquoThe case for an inquiry into events at Ferguson is compelling. The fact a similar project was handled in such a dferent way in Canada shows there are big questions to answer about the Scottish Governmentrsquos approach. We need to understandinvestors are being deterred because of the fear of nationalisation.Tory MSP Jamie Greene MSP said: ldquoNo one in their right mind thinks nationalisation is the answer to the Ferguson fiasco, and this damning indictment re-enforces that.ldquoIf SNP ministers think civil servants will run the yard better than a team of commercial shipbuilders then frankly theyrsquore wired to the moon. This madness must be stopped before the SNP welds the final rivet into the coffin of Scottish ship-building.A Government spokesperson said: ldquoThis action was about securing jobs and giving the yard a future - the alternative was to stand aside while the company went into administration.ldquoSuggestions we could simply have followed the steps taken in Canada, or other countries with vastly dferent rules and regulations on state aid, are ignorant and ill-informed.A CMAL spokesperson said: ldquoThe comments made by Davie shipyard are inaccurate, uninformed and demonstrate they have no knowledge of the situation.ldquoWe have always acted in line with our contractual obligations."},{"url":null,"title":"opinion-matrix-ruths-decision-resign","story":"Scotland on SundayDani Garavelli lamented that Davidsonrsquos resignation means there is now one less role model for women at the top of politics.ldquoThough never one for female solidarity, she was part of a bright, new political landscape in which women were, at last, to the fore, she wrote. ldquoLike Kezia Dugdale, she has been pushed out by the political manoeuvrings of a man less able than she is and is likely to be replaced by the same. And who knowsNicola Sturgeon will survive another year.ldquoAt the last Holyrood election, three of the five main parties were led by women by , it could be none.ldquoNo visible female role models at the top of politics will make it less likely women will come forward to stand as MPs, MSPs or councillors.However, she added: ldquoThere is the potential, though, for her resignation to drive change.ldquoLast week, it opened up a fresh conversation about work and family le about how women can be helped to stay in top jobsand how the cultural sht from lsquomotherhoodrsquo to lsquoparenthoodrsquo, currently little more than a hope, can become a widespread reality.The ObserverColumnist Gaby Hinslf argued that the decision to change career or stop working after having a child is up to each inidual woman.She wrote: ldquoThe inconvenient truth is that some women genuinely donrsquot feel the same about work after babies, while others canrsquot wait to get back. But for many, ambition doesnrsquot die so much as evolve. Work comes to feel in some senses more important, not less.ldquoIf yoursquore going to be away from the kids, then it had damn well better be worth it.Ms Hinslf added that the public ldquowould do well to accept that one womanrsquos choice is just that hers and hers alone, not the standard by which all must be judged.She went on: ldquoDavidson has been operating for months at the extremes of professional pressure and since suffering from depression in her teens she has learned to beware pushing herself over the edge again.ldquoIf she didnrsquot feel she could do this job and be the mother she wanted to be, thatrsquos not to say another woman couldnrsquot manage it perfectly well, merely that she has done what was right for her.Mail on SundayIn the Mail on Sunday, Davidson herself wrote that when she fell pregnant, she was determined toas leader and not ldquothrow women under a bus by suggesting that the mere fact of having a baby meant someone could no longer do their job.She added: ldquoThere was no way I was going to set the precedent ndash as the first UK political leader to give birth in office ndash that babies meant automatically giving up the job.ldquoAnd in April, it was a case of coming back with a bang. With a party conference in Aberdeen followed by the European elections, my first lsquoweekrsquo back was actually days straight before I had a day off.ldquoThat was followed by another -day lsquoweekrsquo. This is not an appeal for sympathy, itrsquos just the job. But, my word, it is hard on our families.She said that her ldquoconflict over Brexit and the ldquogenuine dread at the idea of two election campaigns in  months, prompting hundreds of hours on the road away from my young family eventually led to her decision to resign.The Sunday PostMeanwhile, commentator Chris Deerin questioned whether Davidson would have made the same decision had the Tory party voted for a dferent candidate to be Prime Minister.ldquoItrsquos dficult to avoid the suspicion that Davidson snfed the air, examined the odds, and came to the conclusion that the battle,not unwinnable, simply demanded more than she was able to give, he wrote.ldquoSure, she wants to spend more time with her baby son Finn and partner Jen. Like many women, she found theto work following maternity leave, and the strain of balancing home and work le, hugely dficult. The   demands and pressure on a political leader are particularly acute.ldquoBut had, say, Amber Rudd or Rory Stewart won the contest to be Prime Minister, would Davidson still have walked away  No-one knows but her.

A total of nearly  people have accessed the service.Launching a national advertising campaign to raise awareness of the Money Talk Team, Communities Secretary Aileen Campbell said:“The Money Talk Team is making a huge dference to the thousands of families that have already taken advantage of this free service.“The friendly, experienced advisers talk callers through the options available, letting them know exactly what they are entitled to and helping them save money.“But there are still too many families out there not getting what they should be.“If you’re a parent struggling to pay the bills at the end of the month, you’re not alone.

The aim is for all recycling centres to reach % by .Up to  new staff are due to be in place by mid-September and will provide advice and assistance to householders about what can be recycled. The additional roles are part of package of improvements agreed by councillors in January.However, a new permit scheme is also being introduced to move business waste away from recycling centres to create more space for new recyclable materials to improve services to householders.While most businesses pay the necessary fees to dispose of their waste and recycling responsibly, the current open access to recycling centres means some business waste is being presented as household waste so that it can be processed free of charge.To tackle this, a new permit scheme is one of the measures being introduced next year to prevent such abuse. Under the new scheme householders using commercial type vehicles - vans, pick-ups, minibuses or trailers - to take materials to recycling centres will require a permit to do so.The permits will be free of charge and can be used at any of the  recycling centres operated by the council.Households will be able to apply for the free permits in advance and a yearrsquos supplywill be issued at one time to minimise inconvenience.Permits can be applied for online or by post at any time of the year and will be valid for  months.Aberdeenshire Council does not expect the new scheme to have an impact on most householders as permits will not be required for cars, estate cars, people carriers, MPVs or xs, unless they tow a trailer or a horse box.Permits can be obtained for trailers up to  x  ft in size.Certain types of vehicle typically used by businesses will not be permitted at HRCs, specically those over . tonnes gross weight, tippers, tractors, large trailersand vehicles with twin wheels or more than four wheels.Aberdeenshire Councilrsquos Waste Manager, Ros Baxter, said: ldquoThe approval of the new permit system is very good news as it will allow us to make space for more recyclable materials at recycling centres and improve services for householders.ldquoMost households will not be affected by the permit system at all as cars, estate cars, people carriers, MPVs and xs will continue to have unlimited access to recycling centres.ldquoWe are keen to minimise inconvenience to those householders who use commercial type vehicles or trailers to take materials to recycling centres.\"Only one application is required to get a yearrsquos supply of permits and we have also increased the number of permits to  per year to make sure householders have enough permits to cover the grass cutting season.ldquoWe will be communicating the details of the new permit scheme over the coming months, so there will be plenty of time to apply for the permits before the new scheme starts.ldquoBusinesses will be provided an alternative service at waste transfer stations, and with a lower price for recycling, will be encouraged to segregate and recycle as much of their waste as possible.ldquoWe will be monitoring closely how the new schemes settle in and can tweak them in future based on feedback received.More information about the new recycling permit scheme is available on www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk recyclingcentrepermitsdata-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..!

The society now also delivers animal welfare educational programmes, reaching more than , children in .So it’s fair to say that it has come a long way in the last  years.But for all the successes, there are also new issues it has to face – not least thanks to the advent of the internet.Mike explained: “For years, we have looked after all of Scotland’s animals – wild, farm and domestic.“Farming has come on leaps and bounds in the last few decades and we now have very few problems in the industry.“When I was a kid growing up, you used to have pet shops selling cats, dogs, budgies and the like.“Now, thanks to the internet, people have far more exotic animals in their care which all of our inspectors need to know how to care for and handle – from bearded dragons to massive boa constrictors!“We also have to contend with puppy farmers plying their trade online and selling puppies from car boots.“Some of the puppies die within a few days of people buying them, having paid a lot of money for the animal and thousands on vet fees.“Sadly, we also still see things that I saw  years ago such as Dobermans with every rib on their body sticking out.“However, thanks to our education programme, we are reaching the children of today who will be the animal lovers of the future.“And the majority of people our inspectors visit are not harming animals for fun – it’s a case of ignorance and neglect. In those cases, we’re not just helping the animals, but humans too.“Only five to ten per cent of cases every year are intentional cruelty. So Scotland is still a nation which, in the main, loves and cares for its animals.”That care and concern shines through as the public helps fund the SSPCA’s £ million budget annually.That covers the cost of  employees, including  inspectors,  ambulance drivers and the -strong team based at its nine centres across Scotland and its widle sanctuary.The society receives no government funding and relies solely on the public to fund its work.Mike added: “We are really lucky that, from a population of five and a half million, only  people were prosecuted last year for animal cruelty.“We will never be out of a job but the vast majority of people in Scotland are law abiding and animal loving.“And we couldn’t do what we do without their support.”In December, the Society plans to launch celebrations to commemorate the th anniversary that will run throughout .Anyone with interesting anecdotes or memorabilia they’d like to share should get in touch via its website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.The SSPCA is the only animal charity in the UK able to report animal cruelty cases to the Crown, with reports sent to the Procurator Fiscal Service. The charity receives no government funding and relies on donations and grants to continue its work, which costs £ million each year.In , it found homes for  rescued animals, helped more than  wildle casualties and spoke to more than , children.For every pound it receives, p is spent on animal welfare, p on fundraising and promotion and p on administration.So you can rest assured that the bulk of any donation you make will make a huge dference to the animals in the SSPCA’s care.Last year, its animal helpline received almost a quarter of a million calls, the inspectorate attended more than , incidents and more than , animals were cared for across its nine rescue and rehoming centres and at the national wildle rescue centre.

The devices were first introduced in Tayside in June this year and they were subsequently introduced in the North East in July.The mobiles will provide apps enabling officers carry out checks and file crime reports. Officers will also be able to type statements directly to the device through the use of its digital notebookPronto which will obtain an electronic signature from victims and witnesses.Chief Superintendent George Macdonald, Highland and Islands isional commander, said: #The introduction of mobile technology is a major milestone which will positively enhance the operational policing approach in the Highland and Islands.#Over the last two years, we have seen a signicant investment and upgrade in our IT systems to enable us to take advantage of technology.#Given the geography of the area, officers do incur signicant travel time between calls and their stations, the mobile device will allow officers to be more visible in the community, spend more time on patrol and hopefully be more accessible within the areas they serve.#Members of the public will see police officers operating their mobile device in public areas. It is important they understand they are not using their personal telephone and that they are working, but be reassured they will always be available to offer help, advice or assistanceneeded.#Cabinet Secretary for Justice, Humza Yousaf  is pleased that the Scottish Government has been able to help Police Scotland invest in new mobile technology, which he believes will enable officers to work in the heart of Scotland’s communities, providing reassurance and increasing their visibility.“This technology is enabling officers to become even more agile and responsive, ensuring the service is better-equipped to meet the modern-day demands upon it,# he said.#Being able to access information at their fingertips will improve the ability of officers in the Highlands and Islands to react promptly to a range of issues they encounter, enhancing the amount of time available to spend in the heart of their communities and keeping people safe.”Susan Deacon, Chair of the Scottish Police Authorityfeels that this is an important and much needed step forward.#The introduction of mobile working will bring real benefits to the police and the public and will make the police service more responsive, visible and efficient,# she explained.#Continued investment in technology is vital to ensure that policing in Scotland keeps pace with changing needs and demands. Communities across Scotland will be better protected as a result of these changes.#The £million Mobile Working Project which was part funded by the Scottish Government’s capital budget allocation will see approximately , of Police Scotland’s unormed officers issued with mobile devices by spring .The devices will be further enhanced over time with the addition of future policing applications, including national systems as they become available.Last year, Police Scotland produced a business case for a major investment in digital, data and ICT over  years to modernise the service. The proposed investment would also generate savings and public service improvements for the wider criminal justice system justice system.David Wallace, BT’s public sector director in Scotland and chair of the BT board in Scotland, said: “We’re pleased to be leading this project, bringing in our EE mobile network – the largest G network in the UK – and our unrivalled resources to help Police Scotland transform the way they work.“By helping our customers take advantage of BT’s investments in innovations and networking, including our launch of G in Scotland, we’ll see opportunities we couldn’t imagine ten years ago come into our lives.”Norman Dixon, Motorola Solutions# Account Director for Scotland added: “The Pronto mobile application replaces the paper notebook and modernises police workflows by giving them access to databases and tools on their mobile device on the beat. It is a world-leading mobile solution for policing. It was developed here in Scotland in partnership with the police service, so it is fantastic to see that it will become available to , Police Scotland officers.“We look forward to working with Police Scotland and are proud to be part of this major milestone in mobile police technology.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Craig Clouston and Callan Jessiman were tasked with anchoring the midfield for Hotspurs, while Rovers lined up in a --, spearheaded by Steven Tulloch and Zack Singh.The opening stages were cagey, as the two teams felt each out. The big talking point of the opening half hour was an agricultural challenge by Scott Drever in the Rovers midfield. He went over the top of the ball on Jordan Low in the middle of the park, an offence referee Mike Cursiter saw fit to issue a caution to the midfielder, with Hotspurs looking for a red.Aiden Drever saw a free-kick go narrowly wide of Davy Leonard#s post after  minutes, while Tulloch might have done better with a half chance just before the half-time whistle. A driven ball from Graeme Horne on the left was nodded on by Singh, but the veteran Rovers striker couldn#t direct his header on target, with Hotspurs appealing for an offside flag.The match remained goalless at the break, with neither team having really got going.The match was soon to kick into le in the second half. After  minutes, Rovers ‘keeper Liam Valentine made a hash of a clearance, booting the ball against Spurs striker Jerry McBeth. With the goal gaping, the Hotspurs striker was just about to pull the trigger when he was tripped by Valentine.Cursiter awarded the free-kick, and after a long consultation with his linesman, deemed the challenge worthy of a yellow card only, despite the protestations of the away side. Joe Wilson#s effort from the set piece was tipped wide by the ‘keeper.Just before the hour mark, Rovers saw their best chance come and go. A long ball found Connan Rendall on the right, who controlled it wonderfully before shuffling inside to the edge of the box. His drilled effort looked every inch a goal until Leonard flung himself down to his left to tip it round the post.Moments later, the breakthrough was to come at the other end, as the match swung from end-to-end.Aiden Drever was penalised for a foul on Logan Peace wide on Hotspurs left. The free-kick was flighted in but cleared out to Joe Wilson. His cross back in found Hotspurs legend Wayne Monkman at the back post, whose header floated over the stranded Valentine for the opening goal. Could Monkman#s goal be the fairytale ending for the defender on his final Hotspurs appearance Rovers now needed to score twice in the last  minutes to win the title, but in truth they found a well-marshalled away defence dficult to break down. Hotspurs had the bit between their teeth, with a first ‘A’ League title since  now tantalisingly close.The hosts# task was made even more challenging when Aiden Drever was sent off for two bookings in quick succession with  minutes to go. From there, Hotspurs saw out the game relatively comfortably.In the th minute, Valentine got caught underneath a high ball into the box, dropping it at the feet of substitute Jack Paterson. As the sub tried to get a shot away, he was impeded by the Rovers goalie, who saw his second yellow card of the evening to ensure his side would finish with nine men.Seventeen-year-old midfielder Jessiman stepped up to coolly slot away the resultant penalty, ensuring Hotspurs would win the  ‘A’ League, and sparking scenes of delight amongst their support on the sidelines.OAFA president Colin MacLeod paid tribute to both sides for a hard-fought league campaign after the match, and invited up Hotspurs skipper Keith Harcus to receive the Brough Cup for his side.Harcus — standing in for the injured Owen Rendall — paid tribute to his centre-back partner Monkman who is set to bow out of domestic football as an ‘A’ League champion and urged his teammates not to go another  years before landing the biggest prize in domestic football.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In the midst of some of Scotland’s most breathtakingly beautul scenery, amongst communities who are closer geographically to Oslo than to London, I was in constant communication with colleagues about how we protect the very democratic process being played out around me.It seemed that even here there was no escape from the flag waving, nationalism which has plunged us into this mess.And I don’t just mean Boris Johnson and his brand of Brexiteers.One of the first things that hit me on my arrival were the flags.Everywhere.I’ve often been to the Northern Isles before and I know how proud the communities in both Orkney and Shetland rightly are of their inidual colours. But this was dferent. This was not the islanders.This was a political party wrapping itself in local symbolism for its own ends. It was on their cars, posters and leaflets.For me over the past week the attempted appropriation of the flag of Shetland by the SNP has yelled out as a metaphor for the nationalist introversion which is threatening to shut down our democracy.The currency of modern Scottish politics seems to be that you have to choose which flag in which to wrap yourself. Saltire or Union To which identity are you going to confine yourself Charles Kennedy, as in so much about our politics, had the answer.Whenever he was asked he insisted that he was a Highlander, a Scot, British and a European, and that each layer of that identity was equally valuable to him.They reinforce each other and make the inidual at their heart stronger. This week, on my phone in the centre of Lerwick, being brought up to date on the national crisis, surrounded by the paraphernalia of Scottish nationalism, I felt yet again, that the fabric of my interwoven identities was under threat.It has been constant since .But this time it’s not just my identity but our democratic traditions too.The liberalism, tolerance and adherence to constitutional precedent which we have lived by for centuries is being challenged at the centre.The announcement that parliament will be suspended, our democracy is being shut down to allow the UK Government to choose how and when we leave the EU, deal or no deal, without scrutiny shook me to the core.As a history and politics undergraduate at Glasgow University I often wondered how contemporary MPs reflected on their role in issues of their time like Suez, the Suffragettes or the miners’ strike.Now I am finding out for myself.Even as the tiniest cog in that vast machinery of  elected members that is the House of Commons, I am aware of my responsibility.I have spent much of this week talking to others, reaching out to dferent parties, supporting those trying to build a consensus.And just as we thought we were getting our heads around the implications of this authoritarian power grab, there was another surprise.Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, a woman who has taken her party from threatened obscurity to challenging for power at Holyrood is taking a step back.The loss of that one inidual’s input seems, right now, at this critical moment, huge.What will happen next to her party, and how her  MPs at Westminster will respond to their leader shutting down parliament, is for others to decide.For many people it must seems that it is yet more evidence of crumbling foundations.I am not one of them.This week has undoubtedly been one of the most tumultuous and tortuous in modern British political history.The next few weeks promise to bring even more drama, power plays and stress.But at the centre of it all the people on Shetland did the one thing which, in the final analysis, may provide that answer we are all looking for.They went out and voted in astonishing numbers to decide which person had the confidence of the greatest number of islanders to be their representative.While others argued about democratic rights, they exercised theirs.The majority turned their back on the flag-waving, populism and identity politics.They chose Beatrice Wishart of the Scottish Liberal Democrats. The flag of Shetland belongs to all the islanders in the same way as the Saltire represents each and every political expression in Scotland, every locality and every inidual.It is my flag and yours.But it is also not all that we are.It should unite us.

This would be completed over the next two or three months, he said.On the issue of smell, the two sources are from the -metre chimney and from the hatches of the fish meal boats.

Matt Aumlkerfeldt worked as Nikolaj Coster-Waldau’sstand in and body double from  to the show’s grand end this year. Caution - Contains spoilersyou haven’t watched the final season yet!Matt applied to be an extra on the show when it first came to Northern Ireland then ended up landing a full on role.“I did a few days of extra work and then got noticed by the casting staff as I bore a resemblance to Nikolaj, who played Jamie Lannister.“Most of my measurements were the same as him, down to even my hand size which was vital from season three as Jamie has his hand cut off. “I worked about  days a year on the show and then during season eight I was there pretty much every day!”In ‘real le’, Matt, who is , loves working in the Fairhill branch of Cafe Nero’s.  Born in Sweden, Matt moved to Northern Ireland when he was a child with his mum. He has adopted the Ballymena area as his home and says Game of Thrones helped keep him here. He explained: “I would get in before all the other cast and crew and have a rough idea of what scenes were going to be shot that day. I’d then go over them with the director and the camera guys plus the director of photography.“I’d be given some direction and then take part in crew rehearsals. After this would be the full rehearsal with all the extras, so by the time the main cast come on set I’ve probably gone through the scene about  times!“Nikolaj would then come on and get some short notes from the director before I’d also give him notes as I’ve already ran the scene. My face is never actually recorded on camera but I’ve been in every one of his scenes. “Working then as a body double was dferent. When doing this I dressed up in the character of Jamie and picked up the shots.“This even applied to the nude scenes, which I was comfortable with as I’m not really a shy person and don’t get nervous easily!”Although it would be practically impossible to tell the dference between Matt and Nikolaj on screen, Matt said: “I know all the scenes I did and,anything, it’s a bit illusion breaking as I also know what’s behind the scene!”So what was Matt’s favourite moment from the whole Game of Thrones season  His answer was the iconic trial of Jamie Lannister in Season .“All the main cast were together,” Matt explained.“On that day Nikolaj got wrapped early so when he’s not on screen all the actors are actually looking at me and I was delivering his lines to them. “I had this amazing line up of actors looking at me. It was a big moment in the whole series and I suppose I was relatively nervous!“When action is called, it’s like your le stops, you’re no longer in this world you feel you’re actually in Westeros. Then when cut is called everyone is back to normal. It’s amazingnot a little weird!”Being a body double meant that Matt wore the original costumes.“I wore Nikolaj’s costume alot, including the armour which is real.“I had to keep my body a certain shape so as to fit it plus I did have to keep pretty fit to carry it.“When we started working with the gold hand, my own arm was strapped behind my back, which was pretty uncomfortable, but the fake arm was amazing. It looked very real, down to the pours and hair on the skin.”It’s no secret that the last season of Game of Thrones was surrounded in secrecy! So how did Matt handle keeping the secret that almost  million people wanted to know He revealed: “I certainly didn’t tell too many people!“For nine years I kept all the secrets of the show and, especially in the last season it really was such a burden as there were so many consperies. It became hard to not talk about it and I really just wanted to tell someone about it.”Many of the ludicrous rumours about how the show would end were indeed , however Matt did confirm that scripts were destroyed after each scene was filmed.He said: “There were hundreds of people in the crew during the last season so it got to the point that sets were closed.“There was also misinformation circulated. One part of the crew would be told a certain detail about a scene or filming while another would be told something , all just to throw people off the scent of what was really going on.  “On one occasion Nikolaj went to Seville just so as people would think he was filming there when infact he wasn’t.”Final EpisodeThe final episode and season was met with much acclaim but it wasn’t without some negative reviews. Many people thought the ending wasn’t as dramatic as should have been, and some were left disappointed.To a certain extent, Matt agrees.“I think there was alot of character progression over the years that was forgotten about or pushed aside during the final season, and perhaps some characters could have had a more gloried end. “Perhaps the writers were concentrating on dferent projects. “My view was that this was the last season, we should have gone all out!”On Jamie’s last scene, where he died under a pile of rubble in the arms of his sister, Matt has his own philosophy.“In my head I’d like to think that Jamie was actually going to kill Cersei so as he could have a proper future with Brienne of Tarth.”Matt talks fondly of all the cast members, especially Nikolaj.He said: “I love Nikolaj. I obviously spent alot of time with him and I went to the wrap party which was great too.Gwendoline Christie, who played Brienne of Tarth was a lovely lady and I was friends with Jacob Anderson who played Greyworm. I got to know everyone well and generally everyone was really nice.” Le after Game of ThronesThe future is certainly bright for Matt as he aspires to get more recognised as an actor.“Currently I’m working at the Game of Thrones exhibition in Belfast and doing some photography work.“I’ve started a series of YouTube videos going round the Thrones locations in Northern Ireland and explaining them.“I recently did a video from Cushendun caves, which is special to me as it’s actually where Nikolaj and I had our last scene together.“From that I was noticed by a writer, currently writing a movie and was sent the script. So I potentially have the opportunity to be part of the main cast for that upcoming movie. “I don’t have an agent as I need a showreel of me infront of the camera, sothis movie works out I’ll get the showreel then hopefully an agent and we’ll see where it goes from there.“I also really want to keep my job in Nero’s as I love it there!”Looking back, Matt had such a great experience working on Thrones.“It was a great nine years! But when it all aired and all the secrets were out I felt really free. It was like a car had been lted off my shoulders as there was so much information I had to keep to myself!”Matt still hasn’t watched the final season on TV.“I still miss it as it was better than anything I’ve worked on before but I’ll watch it at some point, I know what happens at the end of the day!” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_2228521.jpg--.jpg?1567156924000\n","title":"j p corry site re opens","story":"Local builders’ merchants, JP Corry, officially reopened its’ Ballymenabranch on Monday th August following a devastating fire that closed the site just  weeks ago.

You couldn’t stand by and watch that. He needed help. He didn’t have a clue that his engine was on fire. If we hadn’t done anything he could have died.”Both Joshua and Sean play rugby at Banbridge RFC and are former students at Newbridge Integrated College. The boys will start Banbridge Tech next month.Sean’s mother Lisa commented: “They were very brave and I’m very proud of them, but it could’ve went terribly wrong just as quickly.New date set for  years cycle Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"“I’m a grateful mother that everyone is okay and safe.”"},{"url":null,"title":"people  ","story":"Daniel O#Donnell will be performing live at a Portadown family fun event on Saturday st September from pm.

However, he says that he hopes his run will raise awareness of mental health issues and suicide.“I’ve done several charitable runs in the past, but my main inspiration has been kids who have a certain condition and affliction and their parents seem quite helpless,” he explains.“I felt I couldn’t really help them in any way, so the only thing I could think of was to run to raise money for the charities that help them. I hate running, but it’s the only way I could help – I can’t do anything like a doctor would do or a counsellor would do.“Unfortunately depression, anxiety, suicide and mental health issues are getting worse in Northern Ireland, especially around West Belfast and North Belfast, which is really, really sad. For many people they don’t feel like they can talk to anyone or that they can speak up, because there’s still a lot of stigma attached to it, which is wrong. “We all go through issues, we all have problems – others might be better able to deal with them men in particular struggle to open up, but we all need to offload. If you have a toothache you’ll go to the dentist before it falls out,you have a sore leg you’ll go to the doctor before it breaks, but people ignore every sign from their minds that they need help. “It will help you in the long run and there is help available. There are charities that do it for free and they offer an amazing service. I myself have availed of it. I went to see a counsellor when I was having a tough time of it, and somebody took me aside and said ‘you need help’ and I’m glad I did, otherwise I might have been more unfortunate. “Depression is indiscriminate, whether you’re rich or poor, young or old, it can affect everyone. It’s important to be sympathetic to someone in that situation, because it could be you, your best friend or family member that needs that help. Hopefully, this run will be able to raise more awareness about these issues.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38453974.ece/4d97d/BINARY/819PM1%20-%200006%202.jpg","title":"air waves portrush","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

There is no country that wants a deal more than Ireland.“We want to get a deal that manages a sensible Brexit, that moves us into a transition period that gives us time and space to work out a future relationship.“But that deal has to be based on the Withdrawal Agreement and it has to be consistent with that, andthe UK wants to remove an element of the Withdrawal Agreement they have to acknowledge that that causes problems and they have to propose alternatives that can solve those problems, certainly in the case of the backstop.”On Boris Johnson’s suggestion of negotiations for two days a week, Mr Coveney said: “I’m surehe wanted five days of negotiations a week, the EU would be okay with that.“Michel Barnier is there as the chief negotiator for that purpose, he has a team that’s ready to go.“We all want to get a deal but at the moment nothing credible has come from the British Government in the context of an alternative to the backstop.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Mr Coveney said Michel Barnier and his team of Brexit negotiators are willing to dedicate their time to finding a deal “If that changes, great. We’ll look at it in Dublin but more importantly it can be the basis of a discussion in Brussels, but it’s got to be credible.“It can’t simply be this notion that ‘look we must have the backstop removed and we’ll solve this problem in the future negotiation, without any credible way of doing that’. That’s not going to fly and I think it’s important that we are all honest about that.“We have always saidthere are alternatives to the backstop that do the same job, then let’s hear them andwe can work out a deal on that basis, so be it.“But what we will not do in Ireland, and I believe there is strong solidarity across the EU on this, we will not allow a really important element of the Withdrawal Agreement to be removed – i.e. the backstop, which solves a dficult problem, albeit on a temporary basis – and for that to be replaced with something that doesn’t stand up to scrutiny and is simply a promise that we’ll do our best to solve the problem, but not explain how.“That is not an approach that either Ireland or the EU will support.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38456621.ece/bfb58/BINARY/V-10%20Bronco%201%202.jpg","title":"legendary mighty jug gives powerful performance for air waves portrush finale","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

Mr Allister claims that each application may have cost the taxpayer tens of thousands of pounds. He is seeking from Peter May, the permanent secretary in the Department of Justice, a list of the occasions on which Mr McCord has been granted civil legal aid, the subject of inidual proceedings, and the annual amount of legal aid spent on each.Currently, the annual cost of legal aid in Northern Ireland is more than £.m, and some £.m of this is spent on civil cases such as Mr McCords applications.There is no doubting his record as a campaigner. Acting almost single-handedly, he exposed the UVF terrorist gang in north Belfast that murdered his son Raymond jnr in .However, his current reinvention of himself as a legal champion of the Good Friday Agreement, and anything which challenges it, risks confusing the properly separate roles of the legislative branch and the judiciary.Indubitably, politicians decisions must always be reviewable by the courts. However, it should be a general principle that political decisions are taken by politicians, and that the courts become involved only as a last resort, when some fundamental principle becomes involved.Lord Sumption, a former Supreme Court Justice, underlined this in his BBC Reith lectures this year during which he claimed that the law - and especially the expanding human rights law - was filling the public space which was formerly the preserve of politicians. He argued that judges, and particularly those in the European Court of Human Rights, were exceeding their power by expanding the interpretation of human rights laws. He described this colourfully as \"mission creep\".Should politicians ultimately be answerable to the law  Absolutely. Are arguably frivolous applications, whose costs rise in inverse proportion to their likely success, the best way to do this  Absolutely not.Surely there is a more direct way to \"put manners\" on our political classes - it is called an election.We may get the opportunity to make known our displeasure with politicians sooner than we think -we have the courage to do so."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38453830.ece/d419d/AUTOCROP/w620h342/mock_brexit_border_002.jpg","title":"nodeal brexit game plan to turn blind eye at border","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He also said the impact of price rises will be felt much more in Northern Ireland than in the rest of the UK.He said: \"The retail industry has been crystal clear in its communications with Government over the past  months that the availability of fresh foods will be impacted as a result of checks and delays at the border.\"Indeed, the Government’s own assessments showed that the flow of goods through the channel crossings could be reduced by -% from day one, as would the availability and choice of some foods.\"The NIRC’s own assessment has shown that soft fruits and vegetables, such as strawberries, tomatoes and lettuces, would likely see reduced availability as they are largely imported during the winter months.\"What [Mr Gove] said this morning bears no relationship to what our members and suppliers are telling us.\"Pressed on whether there would be shortages of fresh food as a result of a no-deal Brexit, Mr Gove said: “Everyone will have the food they need.”Askedfood prices would increase, Mr Gove said: “I think that there are a number of economic factors in play.“Some prices may go up. Other prices will come down.”Mr Connolly continued: \"While retailers continue to work with their suppliers to maintain stocks of non-perishable goods and plan ahead for any disruption caused by a no deal Brexit, it is impossible to mitigate it fully as neither retailers nor consumers can stockpile fresh foods.\"The reality remains that a no deal Brexit in October would present the worst of all worlds for our high streets and those who shop there. Retailers will be preparing for Christmas, stretching already limited warehousing capacity, and the UK will be importing the majority of its fresh food from the EU, magnying the impact of border delays.\"With households in Northern Ireland having half of the discretionary income of Great British households not only will availability be an issue but we will feel the cost rises first and hardest.”"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland constitutional position none of our business barnier sets record straight on backstop","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He said its aim was to manage the \"unique\" risks the UKs departure created for Northern Ireland.Mr Barnier also said it would be a surprise to himmany people in the UK thought blame lay with the EUthe UK crashed out without a deal. He repeated that should the UK crash out without a deal, the same obstacles would remain and the EU would be forced to protect its interests.He wrote: \"It is not about changing the constitutional status of Northern Ireland. That is none of the EU’s business, as it is the Good Friday Agreement – an agreement between the British and Irish governments and political parties in Northern Ireland – that settles how Northern Ireland should be governed.\"The backstop provides Northern Ireland with the economic benefits of the single market for goods.He said the backstop \"fully respects the carefully negotiated balance found in that agreement between the competing political views and dferent identities in Northern Ireland\".\"Its objective is simply to have an insurance policy in place that guarantees that the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland remains fully open, and that the status quo of cross-border exchanges on the island of Ireland is maintained.\"At the UK’s request, we agreed to have a UK-wide customs dimension to that backstop.\"Mr Barnier said intense discussions among the  EU member states were had on maintaining the integrity of the single market while allowing for an open border on the island or Ireland. He said the backstop offered the \"maximum flexibility\" to a non EU member.\"The backstop provides Northern Ireland with the economic benefits of the single market for goods, which the EU is exceptionally willing to offer due to the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland. I believe that the people of Northern Ireland recognise and appreciate this offer more than Westminster does for now.\"Alliance welcomed the comments. Deputy leader Stephen Farry said those thinking the EU would change their position at the th hour were \"deluding themselves\".He said: \"Dangerous decisions are taken by those who believe their own propaganda. The room for negotiation lies around the Political Declaration or reverting from the UK-wide backstop to a Northern Ireland-only mechanism.“The backstop is much more than just avoiding aof a hard border – a point seemingly lost on those seeking to devise alternative arrangements.“As the grandstanding and dishonesty of the current Johnson administration deepens, the case for the backstop is reinforced. It would be much more dficult to take any assurances from this UK Government on trust.”Read MoreBarnier not optimistic as Johnson speaks of ‘signs of progress’ in Brexit talksGove refuses to sayGovernment would abide by legislation blocking no dealBrexit: Westminster set to be scene of high drama in week aheadMr Barnier said that the EU was committed and ready to explore all alternatives in working with the UK during the transition period should the UK leave with a deal.Those alternatives, he said, would have to provided the same objectives of the backstop - namely maintaining an open border and protecting the integrity of the EUs single market.He conceded though he was not optimistic over avoiding a no-deal Brexit.\"Uncertainty has festered for far too long in the UK, in particular in Northern Ireland, as well as in Ireland and all other EU countries, for that matter.\"Mr Barnier saidthere was a no-deal Brexit the EUs only option was to protect its interests and there would be no \"mini deals\" which have been raised by Brexiteers including the DUP. He said the outstanding matters of the Irish border, citizens rights and the financial settlement would still need to be addressed.\"The EU cannot prevent the UK from choosing a no-deal’ scenario. I would fail to understand the logic of that choice though, as we would still need to solve the same problems  after October .\"Many people in the UK understand that and I would be surprisedthey succumb to the idea that the EU is to blame for a dficult political situation in the UK.\"Boris Johnson meanwhile has spoken of “signs of progress” in Brexit discussions.The prime minister restated his case for a harder Brexit, telling The Sunday Times the country needed to “come out of the incarceration of the backstop”.He added: “Everybody understands what is wrong with the current withdrawal agreement: it keeps the UK locked into the EU. It means they can boss us around on trade policy or on how we legislate forever.”The interventions from both sides come ahead of another pivotal week in the Commons and an expected clash on the green benches when opponents of no deal look set to try to seize control of the parliamentary agenda to push through legislation delaying Brexit beyond October ."},{"url":null,"title":"what the papers say september","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Amongst the pupils at the house which was called Tanus, was a young Samuel Beckett who attended there between the age of five and nine.The school was located on the Leopardstown Road between Foxrock and Stillorgan and in his later years literally giant still recalled that the place had a big lawn where, between classes, he and his brother Frank would play with the other children.Also, whilst they were attending the school, the Beckett’s father acted as a surveyor for a new building that the Elsner’s had constructed at the end of their garden to act as a gymnasium.Having obviously inherited her father’s undoubted musical talent, Alex attended the Royal College of Music in London where she honed her contralto voice and on herto Ireland in  and took part in concerts with many of Dublin’s musical societies and remained an extremely popular choice for private recitals in the fashionable houses of the capital.Later in the s Alexandrina Elsner was travelling north to sing in Belfast and the North West as well. Amongst her first memorable appearances in Derry was a performance as a soloist at a St Columb’s Choral Union concert in February  and at another concert in October  at the city’s new Opera House on Carlisle Road.The stature of the appearance of Miss Elsner at Derry’s Opera House, which had opened in , should not be underestimated since there were very few venues of this stature in Ireland at the time that attracted only the top acts of the time. In fact, the Derry newspapers - the Standard, Derry Journal and Londonderry Sentinel lauded her as one of the most favoured performers of the local audiences.Renowned Italian opera companies regularly visited Derry to perform and such was the popularity of the city’s Opera House that late night train services for audiences were often laid on from Inishowen and in the city late evening tram services allowed audiences to travel more easily to the shows.When she married Abraham Stewart on June ,  Alex Elsner moved to Derry where she wasted no time in throwing herself into the cultural le of a city esteemed for not only for its love of music but its wealth of talent as well.Just two years after her arrival in her new home, Alexandrina had established the Londonderry Philharmonic Society and Londonderry Feis. The Feis, beginning as a single day event on April ,  eventually bloomed into a week-long festival of music and singing by the s and she herself took lead roles in the bi-annual performances of the Philharmonic Society.The budding impresario wisely took counsel from the organisers of the Feis Ceoilin her native city of Dublin and invited a representative to Derry to advise on how to establish a local version. As a result, Derry became the second place in Ireland to establish such a festival, beating Sligoand Belfastto the punch.Initially, there were just a few competitions – for church choirs, factory choirs, school choirs, drum and flute bands, brass bands and for solo singers as well as special medals for songs sung in Gaelic awarded by the Derry branch of the Gaelic League. The interest of budding competitors was immediately taken as the workers of the famed city shirt factories quickly scrambled to form choirs specically for the Feis.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshIn advance of the first year of competition, by February of  three of the factories established four choirs. Welch Margetson  Co and Hogg  Mitchell both entered a choir each, whilst the much larger workforce at Tillie  Henderson entered two choral groups.With the passing decades the Feis gained more and more competitors and its repertoire of competitions expanded as a result not just from all over Ireland but from Scotland and England as well. As its prestige also increased, many of Derry’s businesses were glad to be associated with its success and donated beautul gold and silver cups and medals. Bursary schemes for those intent in pursuing a professional le in music and singing also began.In , just a year after partition, another woman Mrs Edward HenryO’Doherty founded Feis Doire Colmcille along with Fr Joseph McGettigan. The Derry Feis centred more upon Irish music, dancing and singing but despite the obvious cultural dferences, competitors from the Catholic and Protestant communities competed in both feiseanna without exception.Alexandrina Stewarts devotion to the Londonderry Philharmonic Society was equal to her commitment to the feis. Apart from featuring her own distinguished performances, the concerts also featured many distinguished musical names from both London and Dublin.In an era long before manufactured television vehicles, the twice-yearly Derry concerts also attracted talent scouts from far and near seeking bookings for their concert halls and opera houses.And, a major talent was spotted as the result of the Philharmonic Society’s concert in Derry on March , . James Johnston, a native of Belfast was well-known as an amateur singer in his younger days but was practically untrained at the highest level. Instead he concentrated as a career in butchery in his father’s shop and supplemented his income as a semi-professional singer at venues around Ireland.It was after his performance in Derry that he was snapped up by the Dublin Grand Opera Society and so began a huge career as an opera singer. It was after highly memorable performances in Rigoletto in Ireland’s capital in , the globally renowned theatrical director Tyrone Guthrie offered him a contract at Sadler’s Wells where he became principal tenor for well in excess of a decade.During his career Johnston played a wide range of roles which included his Covent Garden debut in La Traviata in  and also appeared with Maria Callas and Joan Sutherland. Johnston retired at the height of his fame in  and simply ed to working in the family butcher’s business in Belfast’s Sandy Row where he lived out the remainder of his le until he died aged  in .Johnston’s success however was entirely based on being spotted in Derry and to the efforts of Alex Stewart’s in establishing the city’s Philharmonic Society. It too sprang from relatively humble beginnings, with having just over  in the chorus and nineteen strong orchestra in . By the s the society accounted for  voices and a  strong orchestra that drew its membership from all classes across Derry.The pinnacle of Alex’s own musical career had perhaps come in March  when she was soloist for the celebrated Halle Orchestra at St Columb’s Hall. The orchestra had been founded in  in Manchester by Sir Charles Halle to perform at the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition in January . The orchestra exists to this day and has been in residence at the Bridgewater Hall in Manchester since .Abraham Stewart died suddenly in  and as a result, Alexandrina ed home to her family in Dublin, but ed to Derry every year without fail during feis week. The Feis Committee awarded her the honorary title of administrator and offered to pay the fare for herjourney for le.On May ,  Alex McCausland Elsner Stewart died at a nursing home in Dublin and her remains were brought to Derry and buried beside those of her husband in the city cemetery. The couple had two sons and a daughter. Her daughter, also called Alexandrina, had been killed just a few weeks previously whilst on active service in Burma during World War II.Abraham and Alexandrina had lived at the prestigious Crawford Square in Derry and it was there on April ,  that the Ulster History Circle unveiled a blue plaque marking her le and contribution to the cultural le of her adopted city.Commenting on the unveiling of the blue plaque, Chris Spurr from the Ulster History Circle said: “When Alexandrina Stewart embraced Ireland’s city of music, the result was a harmonious partnership founding the first Londonderry Philharmonic Society and the Derry Feis Ceoil.”CAPTION: The Londonderry Philharmonic Society on stage at the Guildhall."},{"url":null,"title":"nerve visual gallery close doors ebrington","story":"The Nerve Visual Gallery at Ebrington is set to close at the beginning of next month, the Derry News has learned.The announcement will come as a great disappointment to art lovers in the city who have frequented the gallery over the past number of years and will be a loss to the Ebrington site.When it first opened in  it was lauded as a “major new venue for visual arts in the Northern Ireland”.However, at the weekend a spokesperson for The Executive Officeconfirmed: “The Nerve Centre has operated a gallery in a section of the Creative Hub Building   on the Ebrington Site for three years and gave notice that they intend to close the gallery on  September .“The Executive Office is currently considering options for the section occupied by Nerve Gallery.”Located in the former army barracks at Ebrington, the Nerve Centre developed a series of major visual arts commissions with partners including - Now, National Museums NI, The Fondation Gilles Caron, Gallery of Photography Dublin, Ultra Lab Madrid and Matts Gallery London.Exhibitions have shone a light on pivotal moments in Northern Ireland’s history such as the Civil Rights movement and the Troubles.The Lost Moment exhibition looked anew at the Civil Rights movement fty years on from the marches and peaceful protests that immediately preceded the Troubles.

Work to widen Fountain Street to provide on-street parking and traffic calming measures has already been completed, while a pound, project at Collinsrsquo Corner is currently underway.Roads officials have previously suggested the introduction of a one-way system but little or nor progress appears to have been made on this particular scheme.While pleased with the work in Fountain Street and Collinsrsquo Corner, Cllr Curran believes they will not have a positive impact on town centre congestion, prompting his call to meet with senior roads engineers. He is also concerned that no progress is being made to tackle a congestion and road safety issue at Edward Street in the town.His call for talks to discuss solutions to town centre congestion came ahead of a special meeting between councillors and roads officials last night when the Department of Infrastructure presented its annual report which details work that has already been completed on ious schemes and what projects are in the pipeline.Cllr Curran said the annual report contained no ldquoconcrete proposals for addressing town centre congestion, prompting his call to meet with engineers.ldquoA proposed road between Irish Street and St Patrickrsquos Avenue has been shelved due to the cost involved and the minimal impact it would have on tackling congestion, he said. ldquoThat is why we need to get round the table and look at all options moving forward.ldquoCan lessons be learned from other towns which experienced similar problems or what about changing the sequencing of traffic lights  he asked.ldquoIt has been said many times that there is no quick fix solution to Downpatrickrsquos congestion problem and while the layout of the town may pose problems for engineers, surely it is time for some innovative thinking ldquoAll the key players need to get together as years of inaction has exacerbated the congestion nightmare faced by residents, businesses and visitors.Cllr Curran says the time has come to ldquograsp the congestion nettle with the onus on roads officials to finally deliver by taking a critical look at the problems.ldquoWe need to take a critical look at the problem and come up with ideas on the way forward. I suspect that the congestion issue that we have in Downpatrick would not be allowed to go unaddressed in any other major town in the country. We have had numerous reports on the way forward but what people, in particular those in the business community what to see, is action, he continued.ldquoDownpatrick councillors need to join forces and sit down with roads engineers to look at what can be done. Apart from the development of the Saul Way link road, there has been no major traffic development in Downpatrick town centre for decades.ldquoThe congestion problem is getting worse andthe ambitious plans to redevelop the former Irish Street police station base and adjoining buildings are to be a success and attract new commercial and private development, we need to solve the traffic problem.Cllr Curran added: ldquoThe congestion is driving shoppers out of the town and we need to arrest this decline. To achieve this, I believe that we need a brainstorming sessions to come up with a new blueprint on the way forward.

A video has been circulated on social media of part of the incident and praise has been heaped on Sean and Joshua for their brave actions.Joshua commented: “It happened so quickly, natural instincts took over. You couldn’t stand by and watch that. He needed help. He didn’t have a clue that his engine was on fire. If we hadn’t done anything he could have died.”Both Joshua and Sean play rugby at Banbridge RFC and are former students at Newbridge Integrated College. The boys will start Banbridge Tech next month.Sean’s mother Lisa commented: “They were very brave and I’m very proud of them, but it could’ve went terribly wrong just as quickly.The Mid Sussex streets

dead by the New IRA as she observed rioting in Londonderry.Mrs Corner stressed the need to reclaim the word “unity” from the dissident extremists responsible for the shooting.“What really fires up my imagination is the potential, the potential of what we can achievewe continue to demonstrate our inherent inclusive nature, just as we did in the aftermath of Lyra’s murder,” she said.“There are forces outside of this room that seek to draw our attention away from what unites us, ironically using the word unity as their banner - and we can’t let that happen.“We must not let those who seek to separate us succeed, we must liberate ourselves once and for all from their threat and the threats of others like them to our peace.“We must reclaim the word unity for its rightful purpose.“Some people have lost sight of the true meaning, they don’t really understand what it means, because for me unity goes way beyond land, it goes way beyond nationalities and it goes beyond labels — to me unity is a feeling.“It’s a feeling that leads to the outpouring of love that we saw in the aftermath of Lyra’s murder.”Sir Knights on parade for the annual ‘Last Saturday’ demonstrations Coremetrics

“dismay, disappointment and great sadness at the recent passing of the amendments to the NI Executive Formation Bill paving the way to force through legislation which compromises the sanctity of marriage and endangers the lives of unborn children”.The chaplains said that the Royal Black Institution “passionately believes in the right of the unborn child,” and that “being a Bible-based

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

One showed floodwaters rushing through the streets of an unidentied town at nearly the height of a car roof.In some parts of Abaco, ldquoyou cannot tell the dference as to the beginning of the street versus where the ocean begins, said Prime Minister Hubert Minnis.According to the Nassau , he called it ldquoprobably the most sad and worst day of my le to address the Bahamian people.Earlier, Mr Minnis had warned that anyone who did not evacuate was ldquoin extreme danger and can expect a catastrophic consequence.The government opened  shelters across the Bahamas. Dozens ignored evacuation orders, officials said.After the Bahamas, the slow-crawling storm was forecast to turn sharply and skirt toward the US coast, staying just off Florida and Georgia on Tuesday and Wednesday and then buffeting South Carolina and North Carolina on Thursday. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Beds are set up at an evacuation shelter for people with special needs in Florida  --The National Hurricane Centre issued a hurricane watch for Floridarsquos East Coast from Deerfield Beach north to the Volusia and Bred county line. The same area was put under a storm surge watch. Lake Okeechobee was under a tropical storm watch.Florida governor Ron DeSantis warned the statersquos densely populated Atlantic coast: ldquoWersquore not out of the woods yet.He noted that some forecast models still bring Dorian close to or even onto the Florida peninsula.ldquoThat could produce le-threatening storm surge and hurricane force winds, he said. ldquoThat cone of uncertainty still includes a lot of areas on the east coast of Florida and even into central and north Florida, so we are staying prepared and remaining vigilant.Mandatory evacuation orders for low-lying and flood-prone areas and mobile homes were in effect starting either Sunday or Monday from Palm Beach County north to at least the Daytona Beach area, and some counties to the north issued voluntary evacuation notices. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Women sit on cots inside a church now serving as a shelter in Freeport on Grand Bahama  --On Tuesday and Wednesday, Dorian is forecast to be  to  miles off Florida with hurricane-force wind speeds extending about  miles to the west.National Hurricane Centre director Ken Graham urged residents not to bet on safety just because the specic forecast track has the storm just a bit offshore.Complicating matters is that with every new forecast, ldquowe keep nudginga little bit to the left which is closer to the Florida coast, he said.Dorian is a powerful but small storm with hurricane force winds on Sunday only extending  miles to the west, but they are expected to grow a bit. That makes forecasting its path delicate and dficult..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Dorian strikes Bahamas with record winds as evacuations ordered in US article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--Promoted Stories       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Now in its st year, the region’s longest established listing of company performance provides insight on the accomplishments of Northern Ireland based companies, either Northern Ireland registered or where a signicant proportion of their business is transacted in the province. The  edition of the Top  incorporates analysis of figures filed at each companies year end and posted at Companies House and primarily relate to financial periods ending in late ,  and . SUMMARY Sales have grown to £.bn from £.bnwhich is a growth of .%. While extremely encouraging this result needs to be tempered with the fact that profits for the top companies decreased by nearly % to £.m. Shareholder value for the Top  companies increased by .%. Revenue sales Sales revenue is the income received by a company from its sales of goods or the provision of services. The performance of the Top  showing a .% sales growth to £.bn is exceptional in what is a dficult trading environment and period of uncertainty for the provinces businesses. The Brexit question came to the fore on June ,  so all the financial figures shown in the listing have come post the referendum and in essence since the suspension of the Assembly in January . Moy Park continues to hold sway with the highest turnover, currently £.bn, up from £.bn previously – snapping close at their heels is WR Barnett Ltd . Next in the listing are a number of high fliers, LCC Group Ltd and John Graham Holdings Ltd. John Graham Holdings Ltd, which trades as Graham, is another privately owned company based in Hillsborough and specialising in building and civil engineering projects – Graham posted annual sales of £.m in its latest financial accounts up from £.m – an increase of some .% year on year. One of the perennial high performers of the Top  showed a signicant decrease in sales dropping it from a position last year of  to a position this year of . Fane Valley Co-Operative‘s sales decreased from £m to £.m – this is a result of their change in ownership of Linden Foods. Linden Foods is now a joint venture and has entered the list at number  with sales of £.m. Another indicator of strong performance within the listing is that turnover figure required to gain access to the Ulster Business Top  is at its highest ever, with Heron Bros Ltd posting year end sales results for    of £.m. Last year’s number  was Cranswick Country Foodswith sales of £.m. This represents a rise in sales required of .%, to make the Top . Cranswick Country Foodshas risen to  in the listing posting impressive sales growth of %. Profitability Since the Ulster Business Top ’s inception in , we have identied the top companies by measuring turnover, while also accepting that both profitability and tangible shareholder value are also key measures of performance. This year has seen a drop in profit margin for the Top  companies from a margin of .% to .% with total profits now sitting at £.m compared to £.bn for the corresponding companies in their prior year. Northern Ireland Water Ltd has retained its position as the most profitable business within the listing, posting pre tax profits of £.m on a turnover of £.m a margin of .%. Northern Ireland Electricity Networks Ltd is second most profitable with pre tax figures of £m against a turnover of £.m . While the reduction in profitability of the Top  is disappointing this can be tempered by the fact that a number of the companies made signicant losses during the last filed figures recorded for the compilation of the listing. Short Bros PLC after currency adjustments filed losses of £.m, CaterpillarLtd posted losses of £.m, Northern Ireland Transport Holding Companyfiled losses of £.m, EP Kilroot Power losses of £m and Dunnes Stores Bangor Ltd losses of £m. The level of losses across the Top  listing is unprecedented with the  companies that posted losses amounting to £.m. Tangible net worth Tangible net worth is most commonly a calculation of the net worth of a company that excludes any value derived from intangible assets such as s, patents, goodwill and intellectual property. Tangible net worth is a simple calculation of a company’s total tangible assets minus the company’s total liabilities. A business’s tangible net worth provides a snapshot of your financial situation at this point in time. The current tangible net worth of the Ulster Business Top  currently sits at £.bn – as the Top  listing is fluid with companies entering and leaving the list any comparison with previous listing can be distorted, however compared to the  listing tangible net worth has increased by £m. Six of the companies within the Top  have liabilities that outweigh their assets. Increasing the tangible net worth shareholder value is of prime importance for the management of a company. So the management must have the interests of shareholders in mind while making decisions. The higher the shareholder value, the better it is for the company and management. The shareholdersfor the Ulster Business Top  equates to profit tangible net worth and as a percentage sits at % The sales to equity ratio defined as turnover tangible net worth provides an indicator of how much money are generated by the business with each pound invested, for the current Top  this amounts to .. Employees A total of , people are employed by Northern Ireland’s Top  Companies, a decrease from , employed by the companies in the  listing. Moy Park Ltd , Almac Group , Short Brothers PLC , Queen’s University , and Northern Ireland Transport Holding Companymake up the top five employers within the listing. Each employee within the Top  accounted for £, turnover – sales employee and accounted for £, profit – profit employee. Location Since the inception of the Top  we have periodically looked at the geographic location of the companies within Northern Ireland – historically the east of the province has held sway over the west – however, we are beginning to see a sht with currently  businesses based in Belfast, Co Antrim and Co Down, with Co Tyrone being a major recipient of Top  activity. Breaking down the sectors As would be expected when looking at the line of business activity of the Top , both the wholesale retail and manufacturing sectors dominate, accounting for some  of the companies.

We speak to founder Daniel Crawford and his team about the journey so far A spark in the mind of Daniel Crawford as he studied for his masters degree in Glasgow just a few years ago has grown into a business at the sharp end of technology. axialD is tasked with turning the complicated and laborious process of converting D medical scans into D models – and producing them for use by surgeons and medical professionals. It’s an ever-growing business, spun out of Ulster University, which is expanding its reach across the UK, Ireland and now into the US where it’s targeting a burgeoning fresh marketplace. The company has been involved with Catalyst since , been directly involved with a host of its programmes, and is participating in the EU INTERREG funded North West Centre for Advanced Manufacturing , managed by the Special European Union Programmes Body . Catalyst is Northern Ireland’s leading technology hub, home to  companies and around , staff. Daniel has a strong team around him – growing to  staff based in Belfast city centre, including Niall Haslam, chief technology officer, Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships and Cathy Coomber as operations manager. While studying medical visualisation and human anatomy in Glasgow, Daniel was exposed to the raft of imaging available – including CT, MRI and ultrasound, and began examining how the crucial data could be better used. The biomedical physics undergraduate grew the idea into his thesis – looking at converting D data sets and converting them into fully D printable files. “That allows us to turn images into D models to allow surgeons or registrars, to understand digital pathologies, before going in to theatre,” he said. “But we discovered it wasn’t just good for that and surgeons also wanted to get their hands on the D models.” That gave Daniel greater scope for developing the concept. In one early case, a surgeon was able to use one of the D prints to identy small fractures in a patient who had suffered a motorcycle crash, that weren’t initially apparent using more traditional methods. The company was thrust into Catalyst’s Springboard programme in  – a  week scheme which allowed a would-be entrepreneur, fresh out of university, access to business training and development, which included working with PathXL’s Stuart Harvey. From there, it was into the Halo programme – bringing axialD together with angel investors in order to get the start-up off the ground. It landed £, through Techstart and private investors, which allowed the company to get the ball rolling. Through Catalyst, Daniel also got the opportunity to visit MIT and the entrepreneurial development programme, Way to Scale, bringing axialD to Massachusetts and the Boston area – the global heart of the health technology sector. Niall Haslam is axialD’s chief technical officer. He said a Belfast and Boston partnership has helped strengthen the links between the cities, bringing firms from Northern Ireland to the US for both networking and scoping out the potential for setting up shop across the Atlantic. “The Way to Scale program brings entrepreneurs together. It’s a great networking opportunity,” Niall says. axialD is now a partner in the EU INTERREG-funded NW CAM, which brings together a network of research institutes, universities and enterprises to carry out research in advanced manufacturing. It is working with Ulster University on a number of projects, including looking at developing custom designed jigs for hospitals to produce D models. Cathy Coomber has been with axialD for three years. “What we have done in that time is looking at standardising the processes,” she says. “Biomedical engineers from Ulster University and those across the UK are producing data, manually segmenting thousands of medical images in order to help them develop an algorithm. “That allows us to massively improve our standardised process and reduce the time involved in producing those files.” That could mean reducing the time down from up to five hours, to as little as an hour. “When the company started, Daniel was able to get those early users excited in Glasgow, and then setting up in Belfast there were key surgeons which helped set the pace,” Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships said. The company has since been involved with NHS frameworks as a means to help remove as many bottlenecks as possible. This involves developing and marketing the products to the NHS and HSC in the Republic – helping them to learn about the product, the process and what area of specialism it can be used in. “In the last  months with the development of the algorithms, we are moving in to the US,” Katie said. “We’re seeing a lot of growth in the US.” And the axialD team is also growing fast. “We have  staff at the moment but are looking to expand in  months,” Daniel said. “That includes new staff in the US to help grow and manage that market as we further expand our software team back home.” The success of axialD mirrors the overall success of Catalyst, since its inception  years ago. It’s an independent not-for-profit organisation across its four sites – including its largest base at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast, alongside its Londonderry hub, Ballymena, along with the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub at Danske Bank in Belfast city centre.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
