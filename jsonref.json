Outgoing North America editor Sopel is thought to have nearly doubled his BBC pay of up to £234,999.Newsnight presenter Maitlis is believed to have got a pay rise from her salary band of up to £329,999.

Photograph Nick Bradshaw Delays at Dublin Airport will only get worse leading up to Easter if additional staff are not hired “urgently” to meet demand, travel agents have said.Over the weekend, members of the public experienced lengthy delays at the airport, with some passengers saying they missed their flight as a result of queuing two hours for security.DAA, which operates the airport, attributed the queues to staff shortages following the collapse of international travel during the Covid-19 pandemic.As well as losing one third of around 3,000 employees to voluntary redundancy because of the pandemic, Dublin Airport has experienced short term staffing issues due to the upsurge in Covid infections that has hit all sectors of society.The airport has “apologised unreservedly” for the delays, and said a taskforce has been set up to ensure measures can be put in place as fast as possible to ensure delays are kept to a minimum as what looks certain to be the busiest summer since 2019 approaches.Among the emergency measures under consideration by DAA are the opening of security on a 24-hour basis to allow for overnight screenings as well as a modified “modular” training regime for new recruits to allow them perform certain tasks while still learning others.Dublin Airport – like most international airports - experiences the biggest surge in passenger traffic between 6am and 9am and by opening security overnight it would allow passengers to come through the airport over an extended period. “It is not as busy as it was last weekend every day or every even every hour of the day and we are trying to see if there are innovative solutions we can put in place quickly to get us back to where the public want us to be but it will take a number of weeks,” DAA spokesman Kevin Cullinane said.The airport had been trying to recruit sufficient staff to handle the increase in passenger numbers since the end of last year, he said, but a diminished pool of available labour as well as enhanced background checks and longer security screenings had hindered its efforts. “Last weekend was the start of the traditional summer schedules and with the shortages as a result of the voluntary redundancies as well as people out sick with Covid and enhanced security screening for new staff we ended up with the perfect storm.” Pat Dawson, chief executive of the Irish Travel Agents’ Association (ITAA), said there are concerns as they move into the busy season, because it is “not a problem that can be solved overnight”.“There is a big period coming up now, the Easter period, that’s when you have a lot of families going out. And then you go into the summer season, when you have family holidays. Every flight is more less full over the Easter period, so the numbers will be even bigger,” he said.“This time of the year, it’s not in full flow because most of the capacity will commence in April. If it stays status quo, people are going to experience the issue on a much bigger scale.”In a statement, Ryanair advised passengers to arrive at least 3½ hours before their scheduled departure time.“Check-in desks, kiosks and baggage drop will be open 3.5 hours before departure. We apologise to our customers for these unfortunate security delays, which are entirely out of our control,” the statement said.DAA said it continues to advise all passengers to be at the airport a minimum of two hours before boarding a short-haul flight and three hours prior to boarding a long-haul flight although at peak times people should consider arriving ahead of that, particularly at peak times and at weekends.

Photograph: John D KellyWhen word came through earlier this month, says Louise Tobin, there was “excitement and amazement” in the school corridors.St Joseph’s Primary School – along with four other primary schools in Tipperary town had finally secured long-awaited resources under the Deis (Delivering Equality in Schools) programme.“It was a battle, there’s no doubt about that, but we got the right result after six years of campaigning,” she said.“In September we’ll at last have the extra resources to enable our pupils and all those in the town to access a good primary education with all the extra resources and supports needed to bridge the gaps . . . We’re looking forward to a brighter future for our young children.”Over at Scoil Íosagáin Infant National School in Mallow, Co Cork, the reaction was very different.“Honestly, I cried for about half an hour,” principal Linda Dennehy said, after learning that her school had failed to secure Deis status.“It was that upsetting for a school like ours. We put so much work into contacting TDs, having questions raised in the Dáil, and highlighting the needs of our children.”She says it meant the schools would not get access to training programmes for early literacy or numeracy programmes, or smaller class sizes. The needs are acute, she says, given that it has two special classes and enrols children from the local direct provision centre.“It was a shock not to be on the list . . . Our needs are very real, but it seems some areas are more favoured than others.”Reactions These contrasting reactions were shared across many schools when the Minister for Education announced an expansion of the Deis programme.In all, some 310 schools’ students will benefit from additional supports – such as additional teaching posts, free schoolbooks and home supports for students – under the programmes.The €32 million expansion of the scheme means almost 1,200 schools attended by one in four students will have Deis status from September 2022.“This is the single biggest investment in educational disadvantage in the history of the State,” said Minister for Education Norma Foley, at the announcement.“Equality of opportunity in education must be a primary objective. Since becoming Minister, I have been very keen to ensure to the absolute maximum that we make available to our students that very opportunity.”The Department of Education says schools were identified through a deprivation index based on the census which captures a greater breadth and severity of disadvantage.However, the announcement has also sparked a wider debate about the Deis programme itself.While it has been in operation since 2005, and while it has been the subject of a number of evaluations, some critics argue that no fundamental review and restructuring of the scheme has taken place.So, is it fit for purpose? Does it ensure all schools who need support get it? Is the gap being narrowed sufficiently? And should the lingering effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and school closures prompt a rethink of how we tackle social inequality in education?Gap Studies by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) show that students in Deis schools had lower average scores in reading, maths and science compared with non-Deis schools in 2018. However, the gap has narrowed in some key areas such as reading (See panel). Foley said recently that the impact of the programme is attracting international attention.However, Prof Judith Harford and Dr Brian Fleming of UCD’s School of Education argue that while the evidence suggests some progress has been made, it seems fairly clear that such progress has been limited, despite the scheme ning over 16 years,“Our research indicates that the Deis scheme is grossly under-funded relative to the challenges faced by school communities in endeavouring to meet the needs of their students,” they say.“The scheme is also poorly structured in that it fails to address the particular organisational needs of schools in the scheme in any meaningful way.”Prof Selina McCoy and Eamonn Farrell, a postdoctoral research fellow, of the ESRI also argue that key metrics – such as the gap in school completion rates between Deis and non-Deis school – have remained stubbornly persistent and, in fact, increased in recent years.They point to recent ERC analysis which compared home and school learning environments, wellbeing, attitudes, and aspirations of 15-year-olds in schools.Students in schools in areas of socio-economic disadvantage were more likely to lose out on learning because of using alcohol and drugs, missing school without authorisation, and not being attentive in class.They also had fewer educational resources in their homes and were less likely to aspire to go to higher education.Identified A key argument is whether schools that need support are being identified – and whether the system is sophisticated enough to respond to inidual needs.The late researcher Trutz Haase, who helped devise the deprivation index which is used to identify schools in need, argued that a sliding scale of support for schools was the best way to respond to educational need rather than a simple “in-out” scheme.Harford and Fleming also point out that, for schools in the programme, Deis operates at three levels or bands reflecting the scale of disadvantage evident in a school. No such system exists in Deis schools at post-primary level.“The notion that all post-primary schools serving disadvantaged areas are the same has always been absurd. The recent announcement doesn’t make clear whether this approach is being reformed or not. If the latter, it is extremely disappointing, given that the more detailed figures now available would facilitate such a move,” they say.Complex Educational disadvantage, however, is complex and intractable. Most agree that the Deis scheme cannot do the heavy-lifting on its own.McCoy and Farrell say that the difficulties of the Covid-19 period have shown that educational inequality cannot be solved by the education system alone.The pandemic highlighted the gap in students’ home learning environments which were more likely than the school learning environment to reproduce social inequalities.While almost all students will suffer some delay or loss of learning as a result, they say the level and impact of this delay or loss will generally be higher among those experiencing difficulties.As well as greater challenges in comprehending material without properly differentiated instruction, the lack of the non-academic features of the classroom impacts more on those struggling with the academic material.Deis schools, in particular, are on the front line in dealing with students’ issues in physical and mental health, housing, and poverty, but these issues cannot be solved by teachers or school leaders.What happens in the classroom is unlikely to overcome what happens outside it when a child is waiting months or years for access to therapeutic supports, access to child and adolescent mental health services or suitable accommodation.“As a society, we must ask ourselves whether this is the level of funding we are willing to commit to tackling educational disadvantage in schools and, by extension, whether this is the level of inequality we are willing to tolerate,” McCoy and Farrell wrote, in a recent article for Education Matters Yearbook.“As we return to ‘business as usual’, it is vital that we repair the damage done by two years of unprecedented disruption. Yet we cannot simply accept the restoration of pre-pandemic levels of inequality either. Educational inequality is a systemic phenomenon and must be addressed structurally and not just in the classroom, be it physical or virtual.”Is the gap closing? Deis versus the rest The Educational Research Centre has produced a series of reports over recent years examining the performance of Deis versus non-Deis schools. These are some of the findings:"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 coalition under pressure to look again at restrictions as ba 2 subvariant proliferates","story":"Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly: ‘Extremely restrictive’ measures would be needed to contain highly transmissible BA.2 subvariant. Photograph: Nick Bradshaw The number of Covid-19 patients in hospital could top 2,200 within the next 10 days, Ministers believe, amid increasing pressure on the Government to re-examine restrictions.The Coalition is reluctant to reimpose any measures and currently intends to allow emergency Covid-19 public health laws lapse on Thursday.Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said the extra transmissibility of the BA.2 subvariant means “quite extreme measures” would be needed to contain it.He told an online meeting of Fianna Fáil members on Monday night that there were likely several hundred thousand cases of Covid every week, with daily numbers several times higher than those being tracked by PCR and antigen tests.However, a stakeholders’ taskforce has written to Mr Donnelly seeking fresh public advice amid concern about rising case numbers.The Emergency Department (ED) Taskforce, which monitors overcrowding in hospitals, urged Mr Donnelly to convene “the necessary public health resources and advisors to consider any and all measures that may now be appropriate in order to provide an increased level of protection to health and social care service provision”.ModellingUpdated Covid-19 modelling has been sought by Government, but a senior source said that, based on an analysis of recent data, there could be a peak of 2,000-2,200 Covid-19 hospitalisations in the next seven to 10 days, and the figure would then “fall fast”.The ED Taskforce, which is co-chaired by the HSE’s chief operating officer, Anne O’Connor, and the general secretary of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, Phil Ní Sheaghdha, met on Monday.There were 1,624 people in hospital with coronavirus on Monday, of whom 54 were in intensive care units.Mr Donnelly said the transmissibility of the BA.2 subvariant meant that extremely restrictive measures would be needed to contain it, and said that he was told by chief medical officer Tony Holohan that extra restrictions of this level were not currently advised.Sources said he told the Fianna Fáil meeting that about half the 54 people in critical care units who had Covid were there because of the virus, and that about the same number were not fully vaccinated.On masks, he told the meeting that while the legal requirement to wear masks had been disposed of, the public health advice to do so had been retained.‘Well into April’HSE chief Paul Reid said on Monday the experience of other countries in Europe was that the current variant waned after a while, so that meant Ireland was likely to be dealing with the current wave of the virus “well into April”.He was speaking as the Department of Health announced that 39,561 cases of Covid-19 had been recorded in the last three days.While hospitals are dealing with the most severe effects from the latest Covid wave, it has had a knock-on effect on other sectors including aviation, with Dublin Airport experiencing long delays due to staff shortages.Its operator, DAA, said it had set up a taskforce to consider emergency measures including the possible opening of security desks on a 24-hour basis and speeding up the placement of new recruits.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 containing ba 2 variant would need extreme measures donnelly says","story":"The Minister for Health has said the extra transmissibility of the BA.2 variant means “quite extreme measures” would be needed to contain it.

Sources indicated that Mr Donnelly told the meeting said that the current transmissibility of the variant meant that extremely restrictive measures would be needed, and said that he is told by the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) that extra restrictions of this level are not currently advised. This is due to the fact that despite the massive pressure coming onto the hospital system arising from the enormous levels of infection, associated staff absenteeism, and infection prevention and control measures. He told the meeting that around half the 53 people in critical care units who have Covid are there because of it, and that around the same number are not fully vaccinated. Saying the number of people in critical care who are fully vaccinated is probably in the high teens, he said this was a relatively low figure at a national level, and will hopefully remain low. On masks, he told the meeting that while the legal requirement to wear masks had been disposed of, the public health advice to do so had been retained, and that he would do so going into anywhere that distancing was not possible or on public transport, he would wear one.He told the members of his party that there was an ongoing scaling back of testing and tracing underway, and the same was true for mass vaccination centres, which are becoming less central to the vaccination effort. However, he said his Department and the HSE are working on a medium term plan - and an emergency plan to scale up testing, tracing and vaccination if a serious variant of concern arrives. Emergency departmentsSeparately an emergency department taskforce is to write to Mr Donnelly seeking fresh public advice amid concern about rising Covid-19 cases.The taskforce, which is co-chaired by the HSE’s chief operating officer Anne O’Connor and the general secretary of the INMO Phil Ni Sheaghdha, met on Monday.A source on the taskforce said the meeting heard concerns about the impact of the current wave on hospitals as well as concerns about high levels of sickness amongst staff.It was agreed that a letter would be sent on Monday evening calling on the Minister to re-assess the current public health advice around restrictions and seek expert advice, potentially from the chief medical officer Tony Holohan. “The message here was, Heuston, we have a problem. We want the Minister to make reasonable recommendations around how can practically deal with this situation. This is a matter of urgency as patient’s lives are at stake,” a source said.In the letter, seen by the , the group calls on the Minister to urgently convene “the necessary public health resources and advisors to consider any and all measures that may now be appropriate in order to provide an increased level of protection to health and social care service provision.”“Thankfully in both January and now, the level of acuity is such that the demand for ICU is not proportionately impacted by the case levels of Covid-19. However a key difference is that there are now little if any public health restrictions in place and there is a consequent higher demand for unscheduled care in our hospitals. This is combined with an increase in the level of Covid-19 related absence amongst staff across all services, acute and community with over 5,200 absent in the most recent figures collated.“The overcrowding in our emergency departments as a result of the combination of all of the above is considered by the ED Taskforce members to be presenting a level of risk to patients and staff that is unsustainable.”It is understood there were misgivings expressed during the meeting from officials that the taskforce did not have the authority to issue such a letter to the Minister but it was agreed that it would be sent.The taskforce will reconvene next week to consider the responses from Government. Also on the taskforce are unions, officials from the Department of Health and patient advocate groups.Earlier on Monday HSE chief executive Paul Reid said the number of patients with Covid-19 in hospital is causing “huge stress” on the system, at more than 1,600 .MasksMr Reid has renewed calls for the public to wear masks “appropriately”, as he said there are no indications of a downward trend in prevalence.As of 8am on Monday, there were 1,624 people with Covid-19 in hospitals, up from 1,569 on Saturday.There were 157 new admissions over the past 24 hours, with 59 discharges, according to data from the Government’s Covid hub.However, the number of patients in ICU has remained relatively stable, at 54.The Department of Health has released the weekend’s Covid-19 case numbers. On Saturday 7,754 PCR-confirmed cases were recorded, with 5,432 people registering a positive antigen test through the HSE’s online portal. On Sunday, 6,940 PCR-confirmed cases were recorded, with 6,466 people registering a positive antigen test. On Monday, the Health Protection Surveillance Centre has been notified of 5,263 PCR-confirmed cases.The number of hospitalised Covid patients has been increasing steadily in recent weeks, as the highly transmissible BA.2 variant of the virus became dominant, now accounting for almost 95 per cent of cases.Mr Reid said the number of Covid-positive patients in hospital “is causing huge stress on the healthcare system”.Mr Reid said the high level of cases make it “feel like we’re entering rather than leaving something”.Residential care systems were also affected by the latest surge, with 67 per cent experiencing outbreaks, making it difficult to discharge patients from acute hospitals.PressureDr Fergal Hickey, spokesman for the Irish Association of Emergency Medicine, said the elastic band has snapped with regard to the pressure on emergency departments.The situation is the “probably the worst I’ve ever seen in my career”, he said, adding that hospitals are “teeming” with Covid.In Sligo General Hospital, where Dr Hickey works, there are currently six wards with Covid patients.Virologist Gerald Barry expressed support to reintroduce protective measures, such as mask-wearing, ventilation and good air quality.“These new waves are reality,” he told RTÉ’s Radio One, saying it was not a situation where society could “just sit back” and allow repeated waves of the virus to “wash over us”.Dr Barry said the BA.2 variant was the most infectious virus he had ever seen and the easing of restrictions had created an environment that allowed it to spread.Speaking on RTÉ Radio’s Today with Claire Byrne on Monday, Minister for Justice Helen McEntee said any move to return to mandatory mask wearing would require engagement between the Government and public health officials.The vast majority of people were wearing masks even though they were not mandatory, she said, adding that she has noticed more people wearing face coverings while out shopping.While mask wearing was not mandatory at present “that’s not to say that the situation won’t change”, she said.Members of Government and chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan have previously indicated there is no need to reintroduce public health restrictions.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"one third of naval service fleet to be decommissioned","story":"LÉ Orla: The age of it, LÉ Eithne  and LÉ Ciara means the department may opt to sell them for scrap although all three are believed to be seaworthy.The Government has decided to formally decommission three Naval Service vessels – one-third of the fleet – in the months ahead.The vessels, the LÉ Orla, LÉ Ciara and the Naval Service flagship LÉ Eithne, have been tied up for several years due to the lack of sailors to crew them.Various options are being considered by officials for the disposal of the vessels, which are between 34 and 38 years old. One option under consideration is gifting them free of charge to a friendly nation. Another is to sell them.Both options carry potential political pitfalls. In 2015, the Naval Service offshore patrol vessel, the LÉ Aoife, was donated to the Armed Forces of Malta, despite concerns expressed by Maltese sailors about its condition. It remains in service there.In 2016, the 42-year-old LÉ Aisling was decommissioned and sold to a Dutch company for €110,000. The company sold it on a year later for €473,000 to a company in the United Arab Emirates, which almost immediately sold it to a company in Libya for €1.3 million.It was then transferred to one of the participants in the civil war in Libya, in breach of a UN arms embargo, where it was rearmed and renamed Al-Karama.The Department of Defence later said it had no “trailing obligations” in relation to the vessel.Refurbishment neededThe age of the Eithne, Orla and Ciara means the department may opt to simply sell them for scrap, military sources said, although all three are believed to be seaworthy, or could be made seaworthy with a reasonable amount of refurbishment.The decommissioning of the Eithne, Orla and Ciara will represent the biggest single change to the Naval Service fleet for many years.A date has yet to be set for the decommissioning. A department spokeswoman said the three vessels “are now at end of life”.She said Minister for Defence Simon Coveney “has made a decision to dispose of these three vessels. The process to dispose of Naval Service vessels is the subject of ongoing deliberations.”The decommissioning is likely to mean the Naval Service will become, for a time at least, a six-ship navy. The Government has agreed to purchase two decommissioned inshore patrol vessels from the New Zealand navy for €26 million.The vessels, which require far fewer sailors compared to the outgoing ones, will be used for fisheries patrols in the Irish Sea. However, they are not due for delivery until 2023.Before they can be transferred to Ireland, they require a significant refit by the New Zealand navy costing between €10 and €12 million.Staff shortageA replacement is also planned for the Eithne in the form of a multipurpose vessel costing up to €200 million. The Government has said the process will take between four and six years to complete.The Naval Service is currently severely understaffed, resulting in the cancellation of multiple maritime patrols in recent years.The Representative Association for Commissioned Officers (Raco) said the outgoing ships “have given excellent service and have exceeded their service life” but that in the last two years have proved to be “little more than a drain on scarce maintenance and security resources”.Sec Gen Comdt Conor King said it was now time “to dispose of these vessels to free up resources to better support the remaining ships and to prepare for the entry into service of the new vessels.“In the meantime, there is a huge amount of work to be done to retain our naval personnel, and build on our depleted strength with fresh blood if the Navy is ever to be in a position to crew its fleet.”The recent Commission on the Defence Forces report recommended a significant expansion and modernisation of the Naval Service, which it said should be renamed the Irish Navy.

He will argue unions have a central part to play in negotiating this new normal for workers.“The pandemic has prompted a profound reassessment of how we work, where we work, even why we work, all of which has to come out of negotiation and in the design of which there must be a lead role for trade unions and their membership,” he will say.“Covid-19 has demonstrated the effectiveness of remote working in appropriate circumstances and . . . survey after survey indicates that a blended form of remote and office-based working is the preference for the majority of workers as we emerge from the pandemic,” he will tell the conference.Environmental benefitsThe President will cite the environmental benefits that can accrue to society as a whole, with much-reduced commuting and the related potential for financial benefits to workers themselves.The financial threat currently posed by rising prices, particularly in relation to fuel, was one of the key elements of Siptu general secretary Joe Cunningham’s speech on the opening day of the conference on Monday.He said current rates of inflation amounted to “a test of social solidarity” but told delegates Siptu would fight for its members, particularly the most vulnerable, with the number of workers already enduring low pay a “social obscenity”.“We need to work together if we are to see out this crisis. But we are making this clear: we will pursue wage claims to assist workers and their families to meet this crisis. We will be particularly mindful of low- and average-income earners as inflation hits them harder.”Mr Cunningham called on the Government to engage with unions on how to address the problems caused by rising inflation “as a matter of urgency”.He suggested the economic lessons learned over the past two years should feed into a reshaped system of social protections, and insisted the union would firmly oppose any attempt to press ahead with the raising of the pension age.There are “political forces” that still favour the measure, he said, but “we will continue to campaign until we bury the unfair and unwanted proposal”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"brandon lewis plays down prospect of triggering article 16","story":"Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis: ‘I have not seen the sort of flexibility from the EU that I would have expected to see. I have not seen the sort of pragmatism and flexibility that would allow us to agree a deal.’  Photograph: James ManningPA Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis has played down the prospect of triggering article 16 and acknowledged Britain is legally obliged to carry out checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea. He told the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee at Westminster the checks demanded by the Northern Ireland protocol are “legal requirements” and it was right they were continuing despite threats by DUP Ministers to halt them. “Of course, even taking those away doesn’t necessarily in and of itself even solve some of the issues that businesses are having,” he said. He said the reason Britain did not trigger article 16 was because the government was committed to reaching an agreement with the European Commission, adding that “Article 16 doesn’t scrap the protocol.” Mr Lewis is not directly involved in the protocol negotiations which are led by foreign secretary Liz Truss and European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic. He said he believed Mr Sefcovic was eager to reach a deal but that he was hamstrung by negotiating red lines set out by EU leaders. “I think he is someone who is pragmatic, he would like to try to find a way through this. But he is trying to work within a mandate and I think there is a real issue that the mandate from his point of view may not give him the flexibility to find a way through this so far,” he said. ‘Pragmatism and flexibility’“I have not seen the sort of flexibility from the EU that I would have expected to see. I have not seen the sort of pragmatism and flexibility that would allow us to agree a deal. Otherwise we would have agreed one by now.” Describing the protocol as unsustainable, Mr Lewis said it was not working for business and 200 companies in Great Britain were no longer shipping goods to Northern Ireland. The committee’s chairman, Simon Hoare, pointed out that trade from Great Britain to Northern Ireland had increased since the protocol came into force. Mr Lewis defended his government’s decision to renege on the protocol it had itself negotiated, which he said was undermining the Belfast Agreement. Trade declineIn a separate committee hearing at Westminster on Monday, chancellor of the exchequer Rishi Sunak admitted Brexit was causing problems for British businesses which trade with Europe. The Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR), an independent fiscal watchdog, said last week that trade as a share of the economy had fallen in Britain by 2½ times more than any other major industrialised country. “It was always inevitable that there would be a change in our trade intensity with Europe as a result of the change in trading relationship,” Mr Sunak said. “Without a doubt we are changing out trading relationship with the EU and that means a different set of controls and things that people will have to do. Obviously that will have an impact and I’m sure that’s a big part of the reason this is happening. It may just be a bit early to be definitive about which bits are doing what.” "},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics a disappointing patrick s day for the taoiseach covid s resurgence","story":"Hugh catches up with Pat Leahy, fresh from his trip to Washington for Micheál Martin’s ill-fated St Patrick’s Day visit.

A white paper published yesterday contains a set of ambitions that can hardly be considered contentious. It wants “strong schools with great teachers” and “standards that will improve children’s education, deliver the right support if they fall behind and give them the tools to lead a happy, fulfilled and successful life”.It is hard to imagine any strategy that would not cleave to such aspirations. The issue, as it always has been, is how to make them a reality.The vehicle for meeting them is an expansion of so-called multi-academy trusts (Mats), with all English schools expected to be in one or have plans to join or form one within eight years. Each trust will have about 10 schools and 7,500 pupils and there will be protections for selective schools, though no removal of the ban on new grammar schools.One point about academies was to remove schools from local authority control and yet councils will be able to set up their own Mats. Areas of the country where the main barrier to improvement has been the council are unlikely to benefit.The white paper envisages schools providing a minimum of 32.5 hours of schooling a week (inevitably opposed by the unions) when arguably it should be longer to help the Covid generation catch up. There is much in the strategy to show parents the Government is intent on pushing up standards. Whether it is ambitious enough to repair the damage caused by the pandemic lockdowns is another matter.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Officials arrive in Turkey for peace talksMiddle-aged health woes start five years earlier if you have type 2 diabetesHenry III’s ‘flushing’ lavatory to open to visitors for first time in four centuriesNew heatwave thresholds to be introduced as temperatures riseCommon drugs ‘do not work properly’ in up to 70pc of casesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"6 key details tory schools","story":" key details in Tory schools plan - from longer school weeks to higher targetsEducation Secretary Nadhim Zahawi unveiled the new schools white paper setting out his vision over the next decade - but critics warned it was failing to get the basics rightThe local Muslim community has called on the school to explain how the incident could have happened Image: Getty ImagesByLizzy BuchanDeputy Online Political EditorAletha AduPolitical Correspondent:,  Mar Updated:,  Mar |commentsSchools will be told to remain open longer and improve reading, writing and numeracy skills as part of a long-awaited education blueprint.Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi published the new schools white paper on Monday which sets out his vision for primary and secondary education in England over the next  years.On a visit to a school in east London, he said: Each day, each week, each month that goes by with children not getting the education they they deserve... the more le chances are dashed. This is what keeps me awake at night. But he was accused of failing to get the basics right with the new plans, which critics said lacked ambition - and funding - to deliver for children. Shadow Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said parents would be surprised to hear that a focus on helping every child develop good reading, writing and maths skills is a new discovery for the Education Secretary.  Ministers have also been accused of failing to address the educational disadvantage gap between rich and poor students - which has been heightened by repeated Covid lockdowns. Government-commissioned research from the Education Policy Institute, published today, found secondary pupils fell further behind over the autumn school term, with some now . months behind their expected reading level. Primary pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds were . months behind their wealthier peers in reading, while the gap rose to . months for secondary pupils. Hereaposs what you need to know. Longer school weeksSchools will be told to offer at least . hours per week by September  - the equivalent of .am to .pm each day.Teachers are able to decide how the day is structured, so this could be extra time for English and Maths or sport and art activities. Mr Zahawi said he wanted to address the discrepancy of time spent in school, adding: It is unfair that a child who receives  minutes per day less of teaching time loses out on around  weeks of schooling a year.  The white paper says schools will be encouraged to go beyond the .-hour targetpossible. They will also be told to publish their hours online. But ministers were accused of missing the point by setting a target that most schools hit anyway. Former catch-up tsar Kevan Collins estimated around , schools were below the .-hour mark. There will also be no extra funding for schools to cover the longer hours. It wonapost apply to specialist schools and it is not a statutory requirement. Parents told when children falling behind The white paper includes Parent Pledge to provide extra support for pupils falling behind in class on reading, writing and maths. Parents will be told when their children need help to catch up and extra support will be given to these kids through tutoring.  But Geoff Barton, General Secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, descried the idea as a gimmick and said schools already had systems to help pupils. The union boss warned the idea might create expectations of on-demand support which would be dficult for schools to meet. Parents are usually already told how their children are doing through parents evenings and other channels. Boosting targets for Maths and English Higher targets for English and Maths will be introduced as part of efforts to boost standards following the pandemic. By , % of children leaving primary school to reach the expected standard in reading, writing and maths – up from the % who did in . At GCSE level, the government wants the national mean average of all grades to rise from . to  - a strong pass between the former B and C grades.  But critics have said the plan had little detail on how this would be achieved - and warned the document failed to provide a plan to close the growing disadvantage gap. NEU chief Dr Mary Bousted said: Expecting % of -year-olds to meet an arbitrary ‘expected standard’ in Maths and English at Key Stage  without giving any indication of the support that will be needed to achieve this target will immediately raise the temperature in the educational hothouse that schools have become. All schools to be inspected by Ofsted by  All schools will be inspected before pupils head off for their summer holidays in , the Government has said. Schools watchdog Ofsted had received £million to speed up its school visits so education chiefs can understand how well schools are recovering from the pandemic. Outstanding schools will be inspected for the first time this term. They were previously exempt.  Mr Zahawi believes the inspects will give parents an “up-to-date picture” and swter recognition of the hard work of leaders and teachers. The proportion of schools rated Good or Outstanding by Ofsted has increased by  percentage points, from % in  to % in  Councils can set up academy trusts Plans are being redrawn to allow councils to establish their own academy trusts and ask their schools to join them by . Schools will be able to join existing academy groups or councils will be able to set them uparea lacks high-performing multi-academy trusts. Academies are state-funded schools but they are independent from local authorities, which gives them power over their curriculum, resources and governance. The last schools white paper in  set out an ambition to turn all schools into academies by  but this was dropped after a backlash.  New national register to stop pupils falling through the cracks The Government aims to change how pupil attendance is recorded after concerns over “ghost children” who failed to come back to class after lockdowns. Some experts estimate that as many as , pupils who have gone missing from school rolls during the pandemic.New laws would be introduced to modernise how attendance is recorded, with a national data solution used to track attendance and provide a safety net for vulnerable pupils at risk of disappearing from school rolls.Last year, former Children’s Commissioner Anne Longfield said between , and , kids did notto school last September. “These are kids whowe don’t get them back to school will have diminished le chances and job opportunities,” she said.

The Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank branded the minister a fiscal illusionist after experts calculated that last weekaposs Spring Statement was set to raise taxes on Brits to the highest since Clement Attlee. Speaking to MPs on the Commonsapos Treasury Select Committee, Mr Sunak accepted poorer households would face the pinch and he may have to intervene to stop them being clobbered by higher energy bills again in October. He was also forced to admit he does not live up to his reputation as a tax-cutting Chancellor. Iaposve not actually said that, he said. What Iaposve said is that Iaposm a Chancellor who has had to deal with a pandemic. He insisted that by the end of this Parliament, I want taxes to be going down not up. Households are braced for the biggest fall in living standards since the s as Covid, the Russia-Ukraine war and spiralling inflation take their toll.Labouraposs Siobhain McDonagh took the Chancellor to task over tax hikes and his decision to delay a p income tax cut to  has been branded as a general election gimmick.I wondered why this particular date was decided andyou believe itaposs good economic management for a Chancellor to determine his fiscal policy decisions around the general election cycle or do you think it just makes people more cynical about politicians , she asked. He said the timing was chosen to signal the direction of travel, adding itaposs not until uncommon for Chancellors both on the business tax and on the personal tax side to announce things a year or more in advance. Do you think people are stupid , Ms McDonagh replied. Do you not think people will see through that  The government has refused to row back on plans to hike National Insurance and drag more people into higher income tax bands. Letaposs do the maths though, when you add up all the proposed tax increases and subtract your future to income tax and National Insurance threshold pledges, said Ms McDonagh. The net result is a .% rise in the tax to GDP ratio between   and  . Is that really a cause for celebration   Mr Sunak said the tax rises were a reflection of the fact that spending on public services was rising.He said: So, as public spending rises as a share of the economy. unsurprisingly, related to that the tax burden is rising to pay for that public spending. Thataposs whataposs happening. and the reason thataposs happening is because we have stuck with ambitious investments in public services at a time when the economy is suffering from the effects of Coronavirus, and therefore, rather than cut public spending, weaposre raising the taxes to pay for it.He also claimed to drive an ageing VW Golf, after he was ridiculed for posing for pictures at a petrol station using a Sainsbury workeraposs Kia Rio. Asked what car his family used, he replied we have a golf before adding the Kia Rio he used for the publicity shot actually was an employeeaposs at Sainsburyaposs. He also faced anger for not doing enough to help low income households cope with rising energy bills. The Resolution Foundation found that the Spring Statement will leave . million Brits, including , children, facing absolute poverty this year. The think tank also calculated that a typical working-age household will see their real income fall % next year - a loss of £,, the Resolution Foundation think tank said. The Resolution Foundation also warned the Tory Chancelloraposs £bn in cuts to National Insurance and fuel duty will also mostly benefit people in work. Mr Sunak said the Government cannot compensate everyone for the squeeze on living standards and claimed it would have been “irresponsible” to have increased borrowing more. The committee chairman Mel Stride said the Chancellor had done “very little” for those who were out of work and relying on benefits. Mr Sunak said: “If someone’s view is Government can or should make everybody whole for inflation – particularly inflation at these levels caused by global supply factors – then that’s something that I don’t think is doable.” He said that raising benefits by the current rate of inflation rather than what it was last September would have added £ billion to Government borrowing in the period up to -. He said that “irresponsible” borrowing levels risked stoking inflation even further adding to the pressure on living standards. “We are already forecast to borrow in this coming year about % more as a percentage of GDP than our post-war average, % more as a percentage of GDP than we were forecast to borrow in October, so it is already a signicant amount of borrowing,” he said. “My view is an excessive amount of borrowing now is not the responsible thing to do.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Spring StatementSiobhain McDonaghLiving standards\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He said: “With rates of Covid rising and many concerned they may pass this virus to their vulnerable loved ones, the Government’s decision to scrap free Covid tests is reckless. “Not only will this put people at risk, it will also hit families in the pocket just as taxes are being hiked and energy bills are skyrocketing. “The end to free testing is a tax on those who visit loved ones in care homes – it is a tax on caring. “Instead of helping families that are struggling to get by, Boris Johnson is scrapping free testing in a short-sighted move that will increase the cost of day-to-day le for millions of people.The Chancellor must execute a U-turn on his behalf.” The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening.

Eligibility criteria apply. aposWe had loads of jobs but not enough people to fill themapos Screenprinting business Paul Bristow Associates is just one of the employers who’ve worked with Jobcentre Plus to fill vacancies. The family-run firm, based in Wrexham, produces textiles including T-shirts and printed bags – and they’ve been keen to attract younger people to roles. “One of the issues we have is the perception of manufacturing as being something we used to do in the Victorian age but no longer,” says director Ben Bristow. “Of course that’s not the case – but it made it hard to attract young people. Working with Jobcentre Plus gave us the ability to get more young people into the business and provide them with a good grounding in print and textiles.  “Our staff collaborated really well with the team at Jobcentre Plus, who gave excellent support and deserve high praise indeed.” HR manager Lee Dixon, , agrees: “The people who work there have done a fantastic job. It’s not been easy through Covid and the fact they’ve managed to help people into work is great. “It’s also massively helpful to us as an employer, given there are loads of jobs but not enough people to fill them. Through working with the team at Jobcentre Plus we’ve built up a great rapport. They’ve been first-class. “Our recruits have been a massive help in bringing in valuable skills to our business,” says Lee. “We’ve had them working in packing, admin, sewing and sales. Another guy has got a position in sustainability after he joined us from university. We’ve also had people with additional learning needs and disabilities.”apos My team made me feel very welcome and supported me apos “When I left college in January  I didn’t finish my A levels because I wanted a change, but then obviously the pandemic happened. I didn’t particularly know what I wanted to do, but I knew I would be good in a computer-based job because it’s something that I’ve gravitated towards. “Then I saw JD Sports was advertising opportunities and I thought I’d go for it because it was an administration role in a big company. It was actually the first that I applied for and everything went through really quickly – and I got the job. “My team at JD were great from day one. They made me feel very welcome and supported me. Day to day I’d look after anything from HR queries and issuing contracts to payroll and pension questions. It gave me pretty much a whole picture of what it’s like to work in HR and I’ve been doing it ever since. “I’d always had an interest in HR, but after working for six months I realised it was what I wanted to do. “There was the option to stay on and I’m now doing an apprenticeship with JD and CIPD Level  in HR support. It was another perfect step for me and I’ve now been there for a year and I’m really enjoying it. Starting work was quite tough, but I’ve got so much support from my team. It’s a lot more friendly than I expected it to be.“Now I’m learning about dferent parts of HR, building on what I was doing before. I was struggling to find any job with noexperience, but now I’ll just keep going.”Peter Cowgill, executive chairman of JD Sports, on how the company has forged links with Jobcentre Plus. “We are proud to have worked with Jobcentre Plus to provide much-needed employment and learning and development opportunities at a time when competition for job positions has been at an all-time high. Social inequality has only been exacerbated during the pandemic, so it has never been more vital to give young people a chance to succeed. “Our relationship with the DWP now covers all three nations across the UK and gives our stores, head office and distribution centres access to new talent pipelines and initiatives, which not only facilitates our future recruitment needs, but also allows us to support candidates facing social barriers, an area we are hugely passionate about.” “When I was developing my start-up in the renewable energy sector, working with Jobcentre Plus allowed me to recruit new graduates. “We’re part of the Edinburgh Business School incubator, where we get office space, mentoring and support. Since the graduates joined, we’ve moved to the stage of building a prototype.“If it wasn’t for the scheme, recruitment would have been years away –and having a few more minds to work on the concept has given us a competitive edge.“The candidates knew when they joined that they wouldn’t just be working on their own tasks and would be learning something every single day. If you’re looking for experience, it’s a great way to get it.”apos It’s important to personalise our service apos “Our service helps employers and our customers meet each other face to face, which is crucial. Employer advisers speak to both employers and the Work Coaches, who’ll send customers over who are ready for work. “We can also help employers st through CVs and hold training events to get people work-ready and match them up with the role they’ve got available. “I’ve been working closely with Lee at Paul Bristow Associates, who came along to events at the jobcentre where groups of young people could come and speak to him about what roles they had available. “A lot of employers weren’t aware of all the great services we offer, but the feedback we’ve been getting has all been really positive. Every employer’s needs are slightly dferent, so personalising our service is really important. “There are lots of sectors that are struggling to fill places, so we can help companies find a pool of candidates. We have large manufacturing areas in North Wales that are struggling to recruit people. There are also plenty of roles in the hospitality and care sectors.”Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Department for Work and PensionsJD SportsLee DixonJobs CentreMost ReadRecommended"},{"url":null,"title":"man 46 who tied up","story":"Man, , who tied up and ‘tortured’ friend for stealing chicken curry jailedStuart Paul McPhee, , of Knutsford, Cheshire, cut pal Daniel Edwards with a kne and poured bleach in the wound after he stole a tin of curry from his flatStuart Paul McPhee, , of Knutsford, Cheshire, was jailed for  monthsByChris RichesLaura SharmanNews Reporter:,  Mar |commentsA spicy food fan has been jailed after parading a friend through the streets, tying him up and torturing him for stealing his tin of chicken curry. Stuart Paul McPhee, , was furious when close friend Daniel Edwards admitted swiping a tin of curry from his flat and eating it in February last year.Chester Crown Court heard McPhee lured him to his flat, tied his arms with duct tape and paraded him round his estate shouting weaposve got a thief here.He then ly imprisoned Mr Edwards at his flat, beat him with a stick, cut him with a kne and poured bleach into the wound, which a judge said was akin to torture.McPhee, of Knutsford, Cheshire, has been jailed for  months for  imprisonment and given a -year restraining order so he cannot approach the victim.Judge Michael Leeming told McPhee he was sure the intention was to humiliate Mr Edwards as well as punish him.  He added: He was given a beating, although I accept the injuries he suffered werenapost serious. The use of bleach was akin to torture. The incident arose due to a stolen tin of curry, meaning it was completely out of all proportion. You took the law into your own hands. Prosecutor Matthew Dunford said the incident came about after Mr Edwards admitted stealing and eating a tin of chicken curry that belonged to McPhee.McPhee lured his victim to his flat on the pretext of bringing bottles of cider, and once there, locked the door and the ordeal began. Mr Dunford said: He tied his hands with duct tape, before taking him outside. He paraded him around the estate saying aposweaposve got a thief hereapos. He then took him back inside and began beating him with bamboo sticks before he cut him with a kne and poured bleach into the wound. He covered his mouth with duct tape and the ordeal lasted for around two and a half hours.

Jenner Baker, , was jailed after Kane Aitchison, , was abducted and held hostage in her property in Manchester for  hours. Kane was beaten and stripped by eight men before boiling hot water was poured over his torso and genitals, Manchester Crown Court heard.He was told he would only be released once a £, ransom had been paid but when he said he had no money he was tied to a chair and had his hands and feet bound with a jumper wrapped around his neck. The kidnappers threatened to inject the victim with heroin in a bid to aposaposturn him into a junkieaposapos before they force-fed him tablets he believed to be rat poison.They also put him in fear of being raped before locking him inside a wardrobe. Kane escaped the next morning after biting through his bindings and sneaking past a sleeping guard who was armed with a hammer. He fled the property and was later treated in hospital for burns. Police investigating the attack found Baker had allowed the property to be used infor drugs.As the victim was being tortured she was heard asking the gangthey had any narcotics to give her. At Manchester Crown Court she admitted assisting an offender and was jailed for  months. Kane was bundled into a car outside his home by two men in November  and taken to Bakeraposs house against his will. Alaric Bassano, prosecuting, said: aposaposAt this house, he was imprisoned and assaulted over a number of hours. Demands were made that unless he handed over a six-figure quantity of cash, he would be gravely injurednot killed.  aposaposHe was assaulted in the kitchen and living room. He was punched in the face, dragged around rooms downstairs, kicked, stamped on, struck with a chair and had his head struck against a wall. aposaposHe was tied to a chair in the kitchen, his hands were bound with the cord from a set of hair clippers, his feet were bound with rope and a jumper wrapped around his neck whilst his face was covered with a sheet. He continued: aposWhen Mr Aitchison did not relent, the boiling water was poured over his torso and his genitals. A sock was inserted in his mouth and fixed in place with Sellotape which caused him to struggle for his breath. He feared he was going to suffocate.  The victim was taken upstairs, tied up and locked in a wardrobe. The following morning, after  hours of imprisonment, he bit through his bindings, forced open the wardrobe door and tried to escape through the bedroom window. When that failed he ran out of the house, avoiding a hammer-wielding gaoler and sought help from passers-by. He suffered signicant injuries, including burns.aposapos Mr Bassano added: aposaposaposWhether or not Baker was herself an offender, she was being recruited or used in a way which exploited her own addiction to drugs. She was the occupant of the premises and was present whilst the underlying offence was being committed and the use of her premises was vital to the commission of that offence. aposaposBut on the other hand, she had not intended or planned for this to happen, she was being exploited by others who imposed themselves on her and she was fearful.aposapos Baker who has since moved to Bolton was initially charged with blackmail, kidnap,  imprisonment and causing grievous bodily harm with intent but her not guilty pleas to those charges were accepted. Five men are due to be sentenced later over the kidnap.  In mitigation for Bakeraposs defence, Ian Metcalfe called for his client to be jailed saying it would provide an opportunity for her to get herself clean. He added: aposaposIf this house was not available then they would have found another house in which someone  would have been preyed upon. She was targeted by others because of her obvious weaknesses and vulnerability and she was exploited by very dangerous iniduals. aposaposShe should have said aposnoapos but that was never going to be accepted and she was not up to the task to say aposnoapos in any event. She has never prospered and has had a most wretched le.aposapos  Sentencing Judge Elizabeth Nicholls said: aposaposThis group of men used your house to imprison Kane Aitchison, torture him and subject him to degrading violent treatment. It is right to note that you were to a degree as much a victim as he was. The people who came to your address undoubtedly used you as they knew you would put up no resistance when they arrived at your door. aposaposIt is not asyou invited them to your house but you simply had little choice in the matter. You had no part in the violence but of course, you were present when you heard some of the violence being inflicted. I hope when you are released you will be drug-free and that this time in custody will give you the support you need to turn your le around.aposapos Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON HospitalsCourt caseCrown courtCrimePrescriptionsTorture\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

If a person is supervising a driver who is learning, they could be hit with £, fine - as well as a massive six points on their licence. Current rules under the Highway Code make texting or calling while driving illegal. But new rules brought in on Friday means many grey areas have been tightened, making more actions illegal. In , it was ruled in the High Court that an offence was committed when a mobile was used for an interactive communication .  This included calling or texting, but now using a phone for any purpose, is seen as reckless and dangerous. Now drivers can no longer touch their device, take photos or videos, access playlists or use other apps while they drive. Phone use at traffic lights or in motorway queues will also be seen as illegal under new Highway Code rules. Anyone using a device while driving faces a £ fixed fine plus six points added to their driving licence. Motorists are, however, permitted to use their phones to pay at a drive-thru restaurant or a road or bridge toll. The Department of Transport : There will be an exemption to the new law for drivers making a contactless payment using their mobile phone while stationary to ensure the law keeps pace with technology.This exemption will cover, for example, places like a drive-through restaurant or a road toll, and will only apply when payment is being made with a card reader.

CVS employee Mariah took to TikTok and revealed that she has seen customers printing off their private snaps at nine in the morning on the storeaposs printing facilities. Unfortunately, it means that she and the storeaposs other employees have to see the full brunt of the clienteleaposs private lives, the Daily Star reports.This is even worsean order is placed online, as Mariah has to sort through the pictures and make sure the right ones get printed out. She told her TikTok followers of her dilemma, donning her red unorm and yellow lanyard for the video.Where do you print your pictures  Let us know in the comment section  Mariah, from New York City told viewers: I donapost know how many times I have to say this. Donapost print your nudes at CVS.I do, in fact, see every single one. The -year-old worker joked about calling out one of her customers in particular, commenting: Please it’s am Lauren I can’t do this. Some viewers were shocked to find out about the shopaposs printing service, with one commenting: So CVS saw my daughteraposs entire birth.I left my sister in charge of pictures with a disposable camera. I had no idea until I went to pick them up at CVS and saw all the workers face. Others said they prefer to use online printing services and have the photos delivered to home to avoid face-to-face embarrassment. I will just use Shutterfly, easy, a viewer said.

Palace aides have been working with organisers of the event, due to start at .am today at Westminster Abbey, to work out a way the -year-old monarch can attend in the most comfort. She is “determined” to be accompanied by other members of her family including Prince Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.  Some of the queen’s older great-grandchildren could also attend although not confirmed. The Queen has been actively involved in the plans for the service, having recently recovered from Covid and moved permanently to Windsor Castle this month, with many elements being “deeply personal” decisions, a source said. There will be no tribute or eulogy with royal sources suggesting the event has been designed to maximise the opportunity for Her Majesty to attend in comfort. Philip’s lasting legacy, The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award, which he founded in , will feature prominently in the service.The Duke, the longest British consort in history, will be remembered as a “man of rare ability and distinction” at the poignant memorial service featuring elements he planned for his own funeral which were forbidden due to Covid- restrictions.Controversially, Prince Harry has decided to stay away from the service of thanksgiving for his grandfather, after saying he felt it was “too dangerous” toto London following a decision by the Home Office to take away his taxpayer funded security.Fresh from making a huge £million settlement with his sex abuse accuser, Virginia Giuffre, Prince Andrew will also appear in public with his family for the first time since his father’s death last year. In a statement ahead Buckingham Palace said: “The Service will give thanks for The Duke of Edinburgh’s dedication to family, Nation and Commonwealth and recognise the importance of his legacy in creating opportunities for young people, promoting environmental stewardship and conservation, and supporting the Armed Forces. “The Service will in particular pay tribute to The Duke of Edinburgh’s contribution to public le and steadfast support for the over  charitable organisations with which His Royal Highness was associated throughout his le.” Missing gestures from Philip’s pre-pandemic arrangements will see young Gold Duke of Edinburgh’s Award holders and members of the youth UK Cadet Force associations line the steps of Westminster Abbey as guests arrive. The duke’s express wishes for the congregation to join and sing the rousing hymn Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer, and for the clergy from Windsor, Sandringham and Balmoral to play a special part will finally be granted. Prayers will be said for the duke’s “gts of character for his humour and resilience his fortitude and devotion to duty” by the Chapels Royal’s Sub-Dean, while “his energy and spirit of adventure” and “strength and constancy” will be heralded by royal estates’ clergy - known as the Queen’s domestic chaplains. A royal source said: “Great thought and planning has gone into every detail of the service so it is a fitting tribute to the Duke of Edinburgh. “The Queen has had a tremendous involvement and is hopeful of attending, but will make a decision on the day. “Whatever the situation, the event is sure to make a lasting impression.”  Around  foreign royals will attend, including Prince Albert of Monaco, Denmark’s Queen Margrethe, King Harald and Queen Sonja of Norway, and Spain’s King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia, who would have originally been on the pre-pandemic guest list. The duke’s wider family and friends will also be there, along with  representatives from his patronages and charities. Other notable attendees are set to include Sir David Attenborough, Dame Floella Benjamin, Baroness Grey-Thompson, as well as members of the military who were involved in the funeral, including Pipe Major Colour Sergeant Peter Grant and the Grenadier Guards Bearer Party. Philip, who worked on his own funeral details - codenamed Forth Bridge - for many years, had asked for the choir to sing Te Deum in C by Benjamin Britten, and this will be part of the proceedings. The Dean of Westminster, The Very Reverend David Hoyle, will describe Philip in the bidding as “a man of rare ability and distinction, rightly honoured and celebrated, he ever directed our attention away from himself”.  “Working at pace, with so many claims on his attention, he encouraged us to focus, as he was focussed, on the things that matter,” he will say. “His was a discipline and character that seized opportunity and overcame obstruction and dficulty. “We recall, with affection and respect, the sustained offering of a long le lived fully.”The Dean of Windsor, The Right Reverend David Conner will deliver a seven-minute address during the service which will be televised live on BBC One.A special tribute will be read by -year-old Doyin Sonibare, from London, who holds her Bronze, Silver and Gold Duke of Edinburgh Awards, about the legacy and impact of the youth scheme Philip set up in .Before the Service begins, The Band of Her Majesty’s Royal Marines Portsmouth , directed by Lieutenant Colonel Jason Burcham RM, Principal Director of Music, will play as the Congregation arrives. The Duke of Edinburgh was Captain General of the Royal Marines for more than six decades. The service will be sung by the Choirs of Westminster Abbey, and Her Majesty’s Chapel Royal, St James’s Palace, directed by James O’Donnell, Organist and Master of the Choristers, Westminster Abbey. It emerged on Sunday how plans are being drawn up for the Prince of Wales to read the Queen’s Speech at the state opening of parliament next month, in case the Queen is forced to miss the event due to ill health. Prince Charles, , who has been stepping up his duties in recent months, could stand in for his mother on May .  The Queen has missed only two state openings during her -year reign, when she was pregnant with Prince Andrew in  and shortly before Prince Edward’s birth in . In each case her speech was read by the lord chancellor.Palace and government officials are discussing a contingency plan for Prince Charles or Dominic Raab, the deputy prime minister and lord chancellor, to read the speech on her behalf.The prince and the Duchess of Cornwall have joined the Queen at the state opening in recent years.

But, while the couple have since opened up about a number of factors which caused them to step back as senior royals, it turns out a aposwell-worn mantraapos from the Queen Mother couldaposve played a huge role in making le harder for the former actor. During her time in the UK, Meghan faced intense scrutiny, including a number of negative allegations of her treating staff poorly and having to be taken to the side for a quiet word from the Queen. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. In her previous le, the Duchess of Sussex probably wouldaposve responded to the claims, either directly - via her social media or blog - or through a publicist, but as we all know, thataposs not something which is ever done in the royal family - largely down to the Queen Mother. Speaking back in , royal expert Victoria Arbiter, claimed the Queen Motheraposs well-worn mantra couldaposve be causing Meghan a few problems.  Speaking to Nine News Australia, she said: I think really she [Meghan] is doing incredibly well. Itaposs very dficult when you come from a celebrity background where a publicist can stand up for you or come out and say aposno, that report is categorically untrue.apos But, generally speaking, members of the public follow the Queen Motheraposs well-worn mantra: aposNever complain, never explain.apos And so you have to sit back while the worldaposs media and social media just comment. Of course, both Meghan and Harry have since had their say on the problems Meghan experienced in the Firm in their bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey. During the interview, Meghan took the time to clear up one report which claimed she had made sister-in-law Kate cry over a dispute about bridesmaid dresses, however the Duchess insisted it was actually Kate who made her cry.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

The scene was caught on camera by a passer-by and heavily-bleeped footage was shown in court. Prosecutor Ashley Petchey said three protesters were sitting across the road and queues of traffic had built up behind them.  Speid got out of her vehicle and remonstrated with the demonstrators, the court heard. A woman is seen telling the protesters they must move out of the way now and my son needs to go to school and I need to go to work. She also says: My son is  and he needs to go to school. Of the dangerous driving count, Mr Petchey said: It is not an excessive speed as the driver was using the brakes quite heavily. This is done on two occasions.  The Range Rover stops very close to the female protester. Mr Petchey said the dangerous driving meant that injury could have been caused. He said: Clearly this was an incident where there was a risk, evenno injury was caused. An assault charge against Speid, in which it was alleged that protester Bethany Mogie had been beaten, was dismissed after the prosecution said it would produce no evidence.The prosecution said it would ask for £ in costs and a pre-sentence report was ordered. Peter Hoche, chairman of the bench, unconditionally bailed Speid to next appear at Basildon Magistratesapos Court on May  for sentencing. He also banned Speid from driving by issuing her with an interim driving disqualication. At the height of the Insulate Britain road-blocking protests, Speid attempted to move the activists with her Range Rover.  “What they’re doing is wrong, she said afterwards. They’re not peaceful, they’re obstructive and they’re rude, she continued. I’m upset I lost my temper and maybe I could’ve gone about it in a dferent way but I will always stand up for what I believe in — that people should be entitled to live their normal lives. She said at the time that she was standing up for other mums who needed to take their children to school in the mornings. Insulate Britain has demanded that the government invest money in making Britainaposs homes less leaky and cold, in a bid to save energy and therefore protect the environment.

The Maritime and Coastguard Agencyhas said after undertaking a safety inspection it was in the process of holding The Pride of Kent on Monday.The firm sparked outrage with protests at ports around the country after getting rid of  seafarers without giving notice on March .PO boss Peter Hebblethwaite will appear before a Scottish Parliament committee on Tuesday, after he was heavily criticised over the job cuts.Now a spokesperson for the MCA confirmed that the Pride of Kent was being held.  They said: Our surveyors are in the process of detaining the Pride of Kent. We are awaiting confirmation of all the detainable items.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps confirmed the news in a tweet, adding that the ship was being held following an inspection and that safety will not be compromised.It follows the detention of another PO vessel which was held in the Northern Ireland port of Larne on Friday due to failures on crew familiarisation, vessel documentation and crew training. The Rail, Maritime and Transport union said it believed the MCA acted because of multiple safety and operational breaches, including the wearing of breathing apparatus. The union repeated its demand that the Government seize POaposs entire fleet and take action to get them back in service with the sacked crew reinstated.  General secretary Mick Lynch said: The seizing of the Pride of Kent by the MCA this evening should be adequate evidence for the Government that the gangster capitalist outfit PO are not fit and proper to run a safe service after the jobs massacre. Itaposs rare enough for the MCA to impound a ferry but PO have now had two in a week after the jobs carve up which speaks volumes about the dire state of their operation. Itaposs now high time for these important vessels to be taken over under public control with the sacked crews reinstated as the only way to get these crucial ferry routes back running safely. The MCA said another of the firmaposs vessels, European Causeway, remains under detention in Larne. Shapps wrote to Mr Hebblethwaite earlier on Monday threatening to bring a package of measures to Parliament to block the company from paying below minimum wage. Through that package, I intend to block the outcome that PO Ferries has pursued, including paying workers less than the minimum wage, he said.  The measures could be unveiled on Wednesday. The minimum wage in the UK for people aged  and above is £. per hour. Mr Hebblethwaite, whose basic annual salary is £,, told MPs on March  the average pay of the agency crew is £. per hour. He will face the Net Zero, Energy and Transport Committee on Tuesday after he appeared before a Westminster committee last week. Irish Ferries began operating on the Dover to Calais route in June  in competition with PO Ferries. A PO Ferries spokesman reportedly said: We fully welcome the Governmentaposs commitment to increasing the minimum wage for all seafarers working in British waters. From the outset, we have called for a level playing field when it comes to pay and conditions on British ferry routes. Our announcement is not about reducing seafareraposs wages, it is to enable us to have a fully flexible crewing model that allows us to meet the demands of our customers. The predicted savings we announced are not solely coming from the reduction in wages, but from removing job duplication and the benefits we will see from increased flexibility.

With the Omicron iant giving rise to sub-iants like stealth Omicron and Deltacron, and ious symptoms becoming linked to the dferent iants of the virus, it can be hard to tellyouaposre suffering from Covid or just a cold.Knowingyou have Covid or a cold has become particularly dficult because the Omicron iant has symptoms that y from the classic three signs of Covid and instead overlap with symptoms of a cold. However, experts have identied two early signs that points towards you having Covid. What two symptoms are early signs of Omicron   Two early signs of Omicron, that are dferent to the main symptoms identied by the NHS, have been identied as fatigue and dizziness or fainting.Fatigue is not just feeling tired. It can be accompanied by other symptoms like headaches as well as body pain due to weak or sore muscles. Sometimes it even leads to blurred vision and loss of appetite.Dr Angelique Coetzee, who was the doctor to first raise the alarm on Omicron in South Africa - where the iant was first discovered in November  - also highlighted fatigues as one of the main signs of Omicron.  The second early symptom of Omicron is dizziness, which could potentially lead to fainting. This connection between fainting spells and Covid was first noted by a German newspaper Arztezeitung. The possibility of fainting being a Covid symptom was first discovered by doctors in Berlin, who found that Covid was triggering recurrent fainting spells in a -year-old hospital patient. What are the common symptoms of Omicron  According to the NHS, the main symptoms of Covid are still a high temperature, a new continuous cough and a loss of taste smell. However, the signs of Omicron have been found to be vastly dferent from the classic three signs of Covid established previously. A study in the infectious disease and epidemiology journal, Eurosurveillance, identied eight key symptoms of the Omicron iant. These included cough, runny nose, sore throat, headache, muscle pain, fever and sneezing. Of these the first three symptoms were found to be the most common.What to doyou have Covid   According to government advice, you are no longer by law required to self isolateyou test positive for Covid.However, the NHS still recommends you stay at home and avoid contact with othersyou have symptoms. The advice currently states: While you’re no longer legally required to self-isolateyou have Covid-, you should try to stay at home and away from others to avoid passing on the virus.The NHS recommends you stay away and avoid contactyou have any of the main symptoms of Covid- or have tested positive for Covid-. It is recommended you take rapid lateral flow tests from five days after your symptoms start, and the next day. If both your tests are negative and you donapost have a fever youaposre less likely to pass on Covid to others.

Maps from WXCharts show temperatures getting colder as the week goes on and spreading further south. It could get as low as -C in central Scotland while it could also be -C on the south coast of England. There are likely to be widespread snow flurries on Thursday morning, with it sticking in the South East, according to the maps, and again on Saturday where there could be up to six or seven centimetres of snow in North Wales and northern England.  Met Office forecaster Aidan McGivern said: “Much colder weather is on the way and in places there will be snow by the middle of the week.”He continued: “Another area of rain pushing south across the Northern Isles, that is a cold front and it is going to be an important feature over the next few days as it sweeps south across the country. Shetland already in the Arctic air.” It is set to be a cloudy and grey start to Tuesday morning for the east of England and rain in the north and south.  “This area across Scotland mixing with cold air could bring some sleet and snow over the high grounds but that again is a fairly weak feature, said Mr McGivern. To the north of it though much colder air arrives, C to C in the far north of Scotland while temperatures stay above average further south although not as high as they have been with a lot more cloud cover than we have been used to recently. It will get a lot colder, though going into Wednesday. Here’s the cold front by Tuesday night it has become an increasingly important feature as it potentially reactivates with the cold air to bring some snow fall to places by Wednesday and Thursday, said Mr McGivern.  For the start of Tuesday night we are going to see a lot of cloud cover, some cloud, mist and fog in place and here’s the cold front, you can see some snow on it over the Pennines, rain mainly at lower levels. It is slowly sinking south but it’s iding the country in two with a frosty start for Scotland, in parts of the far north of England behind the front, and milder further south albeit with a cloud cover and a few bits of showery rain in places. UK forecast for the next  days Turning much colder and also more unsettled this week. Today: Occasional rain across southern England clearing slowly. Fog and low cloud in central areas retreating to eastern coasts, sunny intervals and scattered showers inland. Rain moving southwards into Scotland, followed by colder weather with wintry showers in the far north. Tonight: Rain and hill snow sinking further south, followed by snow and hail showers in north and east Scotland, with a risk of ice. Further south mostly dry and cloudy. Wednesday: Rain and hill snow continuing southwards bright but distinctly cold to the north, with heavy hail and snow showers. Parts of Wales and southern England seeing sunny intervals and showers. Outlook for Thursday to Saturday: Cold for all parts with rain, sleet and snow clearing south on Thursday morning. Further wintry showers for many parts through Thursday and Friday.

The hunter-inspired decor is certainly not for everyone, with a shotgun mounted above the living room fireplace making the current homeowneraposs apparent passion for blood sports clear.The exact same room boasts two foxes, two hares, a badger, an owl, two ducks, and what would appear to be a bird of prey. The dead animals are showcased on walls and shelves around the room, while a fur-like white rug has been placed in the middle of the floor.

Other rooms in the house, which is situated in Gloucester, Gloucestershire, have been similarly decorated, with yet more stag heads, birds of prey, and pheasants on display where in the property. Some house hunters were left particularly disturbed by the ious chandeliers hanging from ceilings throughout the residence, which appear to have been made from deer antlers. A commenter named Eliza Bennet joked: “Honestly I have not seen this many dead animals outside the Natural History Museum.”  Eliza added: “Itaposs the antler chandeliers that get me. Theyaposre in at least three separate rooms. Others have also been left a little creeped out by the listing, with the current decorations not exactly appealing to those without a keen interest in hunting. Another woman, Susanna Till, added: “I come over all of a shudder. I wonder where they do the stuffing ” Meanwhile, a third, Sylvia Milne wrote: “Imagine sleeping in one of their guest bedrooms with glass eyes glaring at you.”  However, estate agents Perry Bishop believes thereaposs plenty to love about this property, regardless of the buyeraposs personal views on fox hunting. According to the listing: “Located in a private location and surrounded by open farmland stands this immaculately presented detached four-bedroom family home offering plenty of parking, a good size garage, and outside stores along with a generous garden. The house features an entrance hall with a cloakroom, a wood burner fireplace, an open plan kitchen with an island, a utility room, and a “purpose-built gazebo” where the prospective homeowner can throw summer parties in the garden.Do you have a property-related story to share  We pay for stories.

Washing machines quite obviously have the purpose of washing our clothes, but have you ever thought about the fact your washing machine needs to be washed too  No, I hadnapost really, either, until cleaning queen Faith Earle shared a hack on Facebook for cleaning the little drawer where the detergent goes. As someone who officially fits into the category of people who hate cleaning, it had never occurred to me that the drawerwould need to be cleaned, let alone how I would do it. However, Faithaposs recent post revealed something that lots of us didnapost know - you can actually remove the entire drawer to clean it properly, and have a good scrub around behind it. Taking to the Facebook group Cleaning tips and tricks with before and after pictures of her drawer, Faith wrote: How on earth did I not know this drawer came out !Iaposm now officially an adult and love cleaning haha! Thank you everyone for your cleaning tips and tricks. So, I decided to take a look at my own washing machine drawer, and letaposs just say the results were slightly horrying. Just like Faith said, it turned out there was a little button that allowed me to pull the drawer out completely, and what was hidden behind was an awful lot of mould and filth. I decided to soak the drawer itself in hot, soapy water, before giving it a good old scrub - but washing compartment where the drawer had been was a lot harder. To be perfectly honest, as someone who doesnapost really subscribe to the whole Mrs Hinch lestyle, I wasnapost really sure how to tackle it, but some boiling water, washing up liquid and a toothbrush made it a lot more presentable for now. Itaposs quite grim to think about all the mould that was sitting in a machine which is supposed to leave things cleaner - not more dirty - but until someone invents a self-cleaning washing machine, letaposs spread the word on keeping that pesky drawer clean.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

But one man on Reddit has been left fuming with his mum because she wonapost stop getting involved in the wedding planning even though heaposs told her that he and his fiancée donapost need her help. The man explained he and his partner are getting married on Halloween nightthis year and are having a moody, autumnal wedding.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. And while the couple already has large parts of the ceremony planned - including the dress the bride is going to wear - the groom-to-beaposs mum is determined to make them change their minds.In his post, the man said: At lunch with my parents, the wedding conversation came up again. My fiancé and I are getting married on Halloween night this year. We both love Halloween and everything about it. However, we are not having a costume wedding or anything like that.Our wedding is moody, autumnal, and sort of bohemian. We’ve made it very clear that we aren’t trying to dress in costumes or anything like that. Every time the wedding conversation is brought up, people tell us how they would do it. aposYou should do a Victorian weddingapos, aposyou should have a vampire-themed weddingapos etc.  Those opinions were fine and all, but my fiancée has finally purchased a dress that she loves. Frankly, it annoys me to constantly hear people tell my fiancée what she should have picked. My mother is the greatest offender of this. At lunch, she blatantly said, aposyou know the dress I would have picked.apos I paused for a moment and took a deep breath before saying, aposLook, I love you to death, but I’m so sick of hearing what other people would do, and what she should do. She already bought her dress, and nobody has said anything except how they’d do it better.apos The man had hoped his comments would make his mum stop commenting on his upcoming wedding, but instead, she accused him of being ungrateful - and said she would no longer be taking any interest in the event.  His mum even claimed he is the reason conflict happens because he was unwilling to just move on. He added: I thought that was reasonable, but apparently it was not. My mother told me, aposokay, but don’t expect me to show any interest anymoreapos, which baffled me and caused me to react a bit aggressively. I left the lunch annoyed and went home. My mum then FaceTimed me later that night to tell me how badly I hurt her feelings and how ungrateful I sounded, and how badly I owe her an apology. I did not apologise and instead told her that her ultimatum was childish, petty, and immature. I told heranyone needed to apologise it was her. She kept telling me that I need to just nod my head and move on when someone annoys me and that I am the reason conflict happens. I’m so annoyed that nobody, especially my mum, has said one good thing about my fiancée’s dress and instead uses it as an opportunity to tell her how they would do it. Commenters on the Reddit post backed the manaposs decision to confront his mum, with many saying no one has the right to comment on his wedding except for him and his fiancée. One said: Who cares what dress your mother would have picked  Itaposs not her wedding. I would have told her thatsheaposs not happy with the decisions, she could just not come to the wedding. While another added: Good for you for standing up for your fiancée. It’s totally fine for her to have opinions and offer suggestions but once your fiancée picked a dress it was time to keep them to herself. It’s just hurtful to continue at this point.Do you have a story to sell  Get in touch with us at yourmirror@trinitymirror .Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON MarriageWeddings\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

What do you think about the response  Let us know in the comments...In the video, Samantha, who uploads as @samantha_jane_, said: Of course, in recruitment, you have to occasionally tell candidates they weren’t successful in getting the job. This one candidate, who Hannah had done a round of interviews with, she didn’t get the job so Hannah emailed her and told her she hadn’t been successful. And instead of replying and being like, ‘OK, yeah, thanks for letting me know’ or whatever, this girl sends Hannah a meme, which is the most Gen Z thing Iaposve seen.

However, she knew she couldn’t justy spending so much on a vase, so set about thinking up a creative - and very thrty - solution.NHS nurse Teresa, from Essex, decided to try making her own vase using something of a similar shape that she already had knocking about the house – a normal bottle of Lenor Outdoorable Fabric Softener.The end result, which set Teresa back a snippy £, looked as on-trend as anything you might find in the shops, saving her £ when compared to the pricey one sheaposd seen online.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Teresa began by removing both the label and lid from the empty bottle, before using spray paint to give it the exact colour she wanted. She then wrapped string around the bottle top so as to hide the tell-tale grooves, before leaving it to dry. Guests would probably have no idea as to the cheap and cheerful origin of Teresaaposs fashionable, patterned vase unless she told them so herself, with her creation perfectly complimenting her stylish home decor.Teresa said: “I knew exactly which bottle I would use – I just love the pattern on them. [...] “I already had the empty bottle but they are usually about £ in the local supermarkets.“I picked up a £ can of  Natural Hessian chalk spray paint from Poundland. The string I already had, but you can usually pick that up for £. By making my own vase I saved myself £. She continued: “I absolutely love it. The string on the neck and the Natural Hessian colour gives it that rustic look, while the pattern effect on the stylish column silhouette adds elegance.Shared photos of the finished look via a Facebook post, Teresa wrote: “I love the patterns on these Lenor Outdoorable fabric softener Bottles from @joyofclean so I thought, why not get out the spray paint, some string and make myself a nice decorative vase.“Obviously it may not be to everyone’s taste but I love the patterns on it and I really like how dferent it looks from a normal vase. I’m going to try it with other shaped bottles that we throw away and see how they turn out. Facebook friends admired her inventiveness and were wowed by the very professional-looking end result. One person commented, “Absolutely gorgeous!!! I often wondered what you could use these bottles for. Brilliant idea, while another wrote, “I love this, it came out so beautully. A third said: “That’s lovely! I must try this thank you, I would love to try the stone effect spray paint on it too.Do you have a money-saving hack to share  We pay for stories.

It comes after reports the Cha FC owner has been flying between Moscow and Kyiv to relay messages between Putin and Zelensky. After relaying a message to Putin about potential terms of a peace agreement, Putin reportedly told Abramovich apostell him I will thrash themapos.Last week, the Kremlin has confirmed outgoing Cha owner was involved in early peace talks following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, reports the Mail Online.President Vladimir Putin ordered his troops into the neighbouring country in late February, starting a bloody conflict which has been condemned by the vast majority of countries around the world.The war in Ukraine led to heightened scrutiny of Russians living in the United Kingdom on so-called aposGolden Visasapos. Abramovich was one such oligarch with assets worth billions in the UK, so claims he was playing a part in initial peace negotiations were met with surprise.Those reports were not backed up by Russian government officials at the time but a Kremlin spokesperson has now confirmed the -year-old was involved. He did take part at the initial stage, Dmitry Peskov, Putinaposs press secretary, said of Abramovich on Thursday. Now the negotiations are between the two teams, the Russians and Ukrainians.Abramovichaposs mother, Irina, was born in Ukraine and his daughter, Sofia, has posted on social media to declare it is only Putin who wants a war with Ukraine.A spokesperson for the Cha owner - who bought the club in  and is now selling up - released a statement four days after Putinaposs invasion which said: I can confirm that Roman Abramovich was contacted by the Ukrainian side for support in achieving a peaceful resolution, and that he has been trying to help ever since.Considering what is at stake, we would ask for your understanding as to why we have not commented on neither the situation as such nor his involvement. Thank you.Abramovichaposs role in the early peace talks was also confirmed by Ukrainian film director and producer Alexander Rodnyansky, who said: I can confirm that the Ukrainian side have been trying to find someone in Russia willing to help them in finding a peaceful resolutionThey are connected to Roman Abramovich through the Jewish community and reached out to him for help. Roman Abramovich has been trying to mobilise support for a peaceful resolution ever since.  Although Roman Abramovichaposs influence is limited, he is the only one who responded and taken it upon himself to try. If this will have an impact or not, I donapost know, but I am in contact with Zelenskyaposs staff myself, and know that they are grateful for his genuine efforts.Russian officials have also hit back at Joe Biden ’s jibe that “butcher” Vladimir Putin “cannot stay in power” by branding the US leader “weak, sick and deluded”.Moscow deployed its loyal attack dogs on Kremlin-controlled TV to claim the US leader should undergo a “medical examination” because he is incapable of “soberly” assessing reality. Putin’s own spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: We donapost know what President Biden meant, we know what he said.  “And what he said in general in his speech suggests that he is a victim of numerous delusions.”Speaker of the Russian parliament Vyacheslav Volodin branded Biden a “weak and sick man”, guilty of “hysteria” by branding Putin a “butcher” for the bloodshed in Ukraine.He said: The US president’s behaviour might be “professionally explained by psychiatrists” but “from a male point of view, the weak behave this way. “US citizens should be ashamed of their president. “Perhaps, he is sick. It would be right for Biden to undergo a medical examination.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Vyacheslav VolodinDmitry PeskovRoman AbramovichJoe BidenVladimir PutinPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It’s value before the recent slump due to the war and sanctions was around £. million. Luiza, a student, is the daughter of cleaner-turned-multimillionaire Svetlana Krivonogikh, , now part-owner of a major Russian bank, one of the countryaposs wealthiest women with an estimated £ million financial and property fortune. She has not commented on claims that her daughter was fathered by the Kremlin president, and nor has Luiza, also known as Elizaveta, although the teenager told Russian GQ that she “probably” looks “similar” to a young Putin.The suspicion that she was Putin’s secret daughter from an extra-marital affair was first aired by an independent media outlet in Russia which was later blocked by the authorities. The , square feet apartment in the sumptuous gated Fontanka  block is one of St Petersburg’s most sought after addresses in the city’s “Golden Triangle”. It is described as a “club house” with an array of “elite apartments” with construction by German company Engel  Voelkers, with “high-end” designer finishes and furnishings by Roberto Molon in an elegant and light art deco style”. Plumbing and kitchen appliances are from leading German and Italian manufacturers”.  In the prestigious development “everything is thought out to create maximum comfort, convenience and a fabulous atmosphere of beauty, comfort and coziness. “It has its own wellness centre with a swimming pool, and luxury service.” It offers “palace luxury in the spirit of modernity from Italian designers”. Reports say that Oleg Yemelyanov - linked to jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny - analysed hacked Yandex Food records which became publicly available.  These showed an unknown apartment linked to Krivonogikh at Fontanka embankment number , he said. “Wow, Putin’s [ex-]mistress Svetlana Krivonogikh has a flat with total area of nearly  square metres on the River Fontanka embankment,” said Yemelyanov. “Thanks for the tip to Luiza Vladimirovna [Rozova] who has been ordering food to that address.” The propertyaposs value has sunk to £. million in the past month. Luiza has closed her Instagram after she was hit by a wave of extreme trolling over Russia’s war in Ukraine.One comment said: “Are U sitting in the bunker   Like a rat ” Luiza - who had , subscribers - stopped publicly posting six months ago, triggering the suspicion that Putin had gagged her, but her account remained open. Now a message says in Russian: “User not found.”  One post on the -year-old’s Instagram alleged she was the “daughter of a murderer, war criminal, psychopath and drug addict”. Many posts included the Ukrainian blue-and-yellow flag and one carried the message: “The Russian nation must rise against this dictator. You donapost want to have anything to do with him.” But commenters also staunchly defended her, with one saying: “Donapost judge her...is not her fault.” Another wrote: “She cannot do anything for having a crazy father”. One more said: “Come on guys, she is just a person. She is not guilty.”  But a commenter called Martina hit back: “Yes, she is guilty of passive complicity. It is the same as most of the Germans in the Nazi period.” Another posted: “Call him -he loves you ... maybe you can convince him not to kill.” One complained: Stop writing [that] sheaposs an innocent. “She is the daughter of that devil! “She could at least show that she does not agree with what her father is doing, somehow influence him. “Putin doesnapost give a s*** for ordinary people, but maybe his daughters still mean something to him. “She stays quiet because she knowsshe says one bad word to Daddy, she will be cut off from big money, apartments and expensive things.  “Unfortunately, there are important things - and more important things. “Apparently, purses and villas are more important to her than human le.” Putin has two daughters by his ex-we Lyudmila, the former Kremlin first lady. Likewise, neither of them - Dr Maria Vorontsova, , a geneticist, and Katerina Tikhonova, , a high-kicking ‘rock’n’roll’ dancer-turned-mathematician, have commented on the war. There are reports that Putin has hidden some family members in a chalet in neutral Switzerland - while another version is that they are in a five-star hi-tech nuclear bunker in Siberia. There is speculation he has up to four children with Olympic Gold-medal winning rhythmic gymnast Alina Kabaeva, , now high-earning a media mogul in Moscow who is rarely seen in public. This would make the Kremlin strongman a father of seven. Luiza has had a higher online public profile, and was hit by a backlash over Ukraine.  One comment said: “How are you in the bunker ” A troll suspecting she may be in her mother’s Mediterranean bolthole said: “While you’re fluffing around in Monaco, people of your generation are dying in Ukraine because of your father. “Your destiny will be that of Marija Milosevic when your dad gets sent to The Hague. “SHOW YOUR FACE YOU COWARD!” She was told: “Young Russian soldiers are being sent to Ukraine without any knowledge about where they are, who they fight and what they do. “The Russian economy is collapsing, reaching absolute zero. “Soon,not already, you wonapost be able to use Netflix, Spoty, social media apps, pay with Google and Apple Pay, all popular brands and boycotting and exiting Russia.”Luiza was also told: “Many Ukrainians have forgotten about what sleep is, and even more so in bed. “After all, falling asleep, many of us run the risk of not waking up. “People spend the night in basements like rats because bombs are falling from the sky and rockets are coming. “All you need is not to be silent, not to stand aside. “ Tell people the truth about what is happening in Ukraine! “We want to live in peace and sleep peacefully in our beds, to know that in the morning our relatives and friends will be alive.” Luiza earlier showed her le at cafes, on trips to Paris, and running her own Russian fashion label. A video shows her at the Louvre museum during the pandemic. She was also seen working as an in-demand DJ.

Moscow has also lost  warplanes and  helicoptersUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia is deliberately targeting civilians Image: UKRAINIAN PRESIDENTIAL PRESS SERVICE HANDOUT EPA-EFE REX ShutterstockByChris Hughes in Ivano Frankivsk, Ukraine:,  Mar Updated:,  Mar |comments Russian troops are murdering officials in cities throughout Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said today.Speaking from Kyiv, the Ukrainian leader accused Moscow’s forces of kidnapping Mayors and then leaving them dead or missing. He said: “They are kidnapping the mayors of our cities. They killed some of them. We can’t find some of them. “We have already found some of them and they are dead.” Zelensky’s shocking claim comes amid fears Russian troops are compensating for their disastrous invasion by resorting to deliberately targeting civilians and executing officials.Ahead of peace talks the Ukrainian leader said his country could declare neutrality and offer security guarantees to Russia to secure peace “without delay”. Whilst claiming only a face-to-face meeting with Putin would end war Zelensky added: “Security guarantees and neutrality, non-nuclear status of our state - we are ready to go for it.”Talking before the latest round of peace talks, which are to be held in Turkey tomorrow, Zelensky stressed Ukraine ’s priority is ensuring its sovereignty and its “territorial integrity.”He said: “We must come to an agreement with the president of the Russian Federation, and in order to reach an agreement, he needs to get out of there on his own feet - and come to meet me.” Today it emerged , Russian troops have been killed in the invasion and  tanks blown up in ferocious fighting. Moscow has also lost  warplanes and  helicopters to Ukraine’s ground defence systems. The mayor of Irpin, near Kyiv, said Ukrainian forces had seized back full control of the town which has been one of the main hotspots of bitter fighting with Russian troops near the capital.  Mayor Oleksandr Markushyn said: “We have good news today - Irpin has been liberated. “We understand that there will be more attacks on our town and we will defend it courageously.” Ukrainian forces are on the offensive, pushing Russian troops back in areas around Kyiv, the northeast and the southwest. Russia has meanwhile kept up pressure in the southeast near separatist areas, including its devastating siege of Mariupol, razed while tens of thousands of civilians remain trapped inside. Mayor Vadym Boichenko, who has escaped the city and was speaking from an undisclosed location, said  buses were waiting to evacuate some of the , trapped civilians but Russia was denying safe passage.  He said: “The situation in the city remains dficult. People are beyond the line of humanitarian catastrophe. “We need to completely evacuate Mariupol.” Ukrainian children have suffered enormously with  killed so far and  injured - even though many more deaths among the young are suspected. Hundreds of children have been rescued by a heroic underground movement dedicated to snatching them from beneath Putin’s tanks as they hide in basements. Today it emerged  had been plucked to safety and smuggled all the way to Ivano Frankivsk in the Carpathian foothills, where they will be safer. Aid agencies say ten million Ukrainians have been displaced in just over a month since the invasion started.  And Ukraine has lost  billion from the Russian invasion, according to Kyiv Economy Minister Yulia Svyridenko. She said: “This is the sum of the only one-time losses that Ukraine has suffered since the Russian invasion.” She added that the biggest damage is the loss of infrastructure - , miles of roads, dozens of railway stations and airports worth £ billion were destroyed and damaged. With Russia’s offensive stalled its troops have resorted to pummelling Ukrainian towns and cities with rockets and artillery in a grinding war of attrition. Fierce fighting has raged on the outskirts of Kyiv, but Russian troops remain miles from the city centre, their aim of quickly encircling the capital faltering In Stoyanka village near Kyiv, Ukrainian soldier Serhiy Udod said Russian troops had taken up defensive positions and suffered heavy losses.  He said “probably they thought it would be like Crimea”, which Russia annexed quickly and almost without a shot fired in . He added: “But, here it’s not like in Crimea. We are not happy to see them. Here they suffer and get killed.” A fiercer than expected Ukrainian resistance, bolstered by weapons from the UK and other Western allies, has bogged Russian forces down. Meanwhile, Ukraine has banned reporting on troop and equipment movements not announced or approved by the military. Journalists breaking the law, eventhey are foreign, could face three to eight years in prison. Today it emerged that orders to blitz the stricken city of Kharkiv were given by a Russian general born in that city.  The unnamed general’s details are kept by Ukraine’s Office of the Prosecutor General which has a list of  “war criminals”. Prosecutor General Irina Venediktova said his identity was tracked down after her office fingered a Russian serviceman who took part in the bombing. She added: “Thanks to him we went to another suspected Russian Federation general, who gave the orders to bomb Kharkiv. “The most cynical thing is that this general was born in the Kharkiv region.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON SoldiersRussia Ukraine warRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyDaily Mirror,callToAction:ltpgtGet weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emaillt pgt,buttonText:,contentId:,newsletterImage:https:i-prod.mirror article.ece ALTERNATES sd _AlisonHeaderFinal.png,endpointUrl:https:response.pure interface list.php,profile:Reach_Mirror,isPureNewsLetter:true,pureMailingListId:Mirror - Alisons Newsletter,isDoubleOptIn:,newsletterSiteName:Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emailInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

From Knapdale, they headed up the west coast, sailing to Lewis and Harris before arriving at their final destination, Iona.Covering almost , miles in the series, they visit places of worship, from pagan stones to an early Christian cave and a contemporary mosque and Sikh temple. The journey tests the pilgrims not just spiritually, but physically too.TV celeb and comedian Scarlett Moffatt, , said: #At school, I spent a lot of time just reading books and on my own and so that’s how I got into faith really. It just felt calming. There’s almost a stigma attached to sort of being religious.#Whenever I would tell my friends, they’d laugh and I’d be like, #why is that funny # I believe in God, there has to be something that started all this.#I would describe myself as Christian, but not a strict Christian. I don’t go to church, but I definitely believe and religion to me is security.#She added: #In my head somebody on a pilgrimage is in a loin cloth and they have really long hair#and they look a bit dehydrated like they need a good moisturiser mask.#I’m doing the pilgrimage as I want to know what my religion is. I want to be able to answer that question with confidence.#TV personality and interior designer Laurence Lewellyn-Bowen describes himself as a #non-conforming pagan#. The -year-old explained: #I think pilgrimage is about clearing out your mental closet by physical exertion and by spiritual conversation with yourself or,you believe it, then conversation with your God.#I know I come across as all sort of flouncy and floppy and rather cavalier, but I am capable of existing in the real world.#However, I don’t think I’ve walked so far not wearing Cuban heels.#Pilgrimage: The Road to the Scottish Isles will be screened on BBC Two and iPlayer in the spring with three one-hour-long episodes, and is a CTVC production."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week march 11 2022","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Who am I  What am I  Where am I  How am I  – questions of identity and some of the questions I was left asking when I left a recent meeting.That meeting was part of a world-wide movement – a movement that calls the peoples of the world to pray.Similar questions of identity were raised when I was asked to write ‘a piece’ for this newspaper.

victory over the Aberdour seconds across in Fe.Taking advantage of the wind at Silversands, Kilmory pushed ahead with two well-taken quickfire goals from Alex Cunningham on  and  minutes to take an interval lead.There was no more scoring in the second half with both teams struggling a bit on the  sticky pitch.With Inveraray seniors# Mowi National Division match against Skye called off due to heavy rain # after the Aray lads had reached Fort William # Inveraray juniors had the option of a strong bench for their Mowi South Division Two match versus newly-formed Strachur-Dunoon.The match was reversed from the Winterton to Dunoon Stadium with the more experienced Inveraray side running out - winners.Experience aside, the Inveraray side still contained five players under  and one -year-old.A competitive and hard-fought game started at a good pace with Strachur-Dunoon showing good hitting and a willingness to chase down balls.Inveraray struggled for cohesion and had to wait until the th minute to find the breakthrough, Allan MacDonald scoring with a shot from distance.This settled the visitors and in the nd minute after some hard work by Ryan Pugh, the ball broke to Ewan Donnan, who struck from the angle to find the net.No sooner had the dust settled than Inveraray found themselves three ahead when Craig Taylor found space to put the ball past Dunoon keeper Nathan Ross.The second half was a closely-fought affair with both teams playing good, clean shinty.Inveraray had to step up a few gears to keep Strachur-Dunoon at bay, bringing on Colin Campbell, John MacKenzie and Allan Cameron to ensure composure throughout the team.Good second-half performances from all the Inveraray youngsters ensured the game was safe before Inveraray#s Allan Cameron finished the scoring in the th minute.This was the first competitive match for Strachur-Dunoon, and with a number of players missing # others having not met before the game # they showed plenty of determination, which bodes well for the future.Kyles Athletic#s away tie with Kilmallie in the Mowi Premiership was a Saturday morning postponement.The Kilmallie squad had already planned to attend the funeral of club chieftain Hugh #Shep# MacIntyre ahead of the game as the club paid their respects to one of their stalwarts.In Mowi South Division One, Kyles Athletic juniors drew -

They work well in a sunny or partially shaded area in fertile well-drained soil.Climbing jasmine can be highly scented, with ieties that flower in summer and winter. All produce pretty flowers and are fairly easy to grow against walls or up trellis.There are some fun options for kids to plant such as sunflowers, snapdragons and the four o#clock flower.If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o#clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock # so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.You will need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot. Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types # bush and cordon. Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall, supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom. Expect the inevitable April showers but with sunny days too, when you can turn your attention to the lawn.It#s an exciting month, with indoor-sown seeds well into growth, and it#s also time to start sowing outdoors. Just watch out for frosts.Top three jobs this month:"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll boosts oban ahead of slockavullin final","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowA group of five young Mid Argyll rugby players were in action last weekend as part of Oban Lorne under-s in the semi final of the West Youth Shield.The result of the match on Sunday March  didn#t go their way, as opponents East Kilbride ran out  #  winners, but it was a good contest and close game until Oban players sustained a few injuries and East Kilbride scored a couple of breakaway tries.Oban Lorne and the Mid Argyll contingent # Rhys Coffield, Murray MacDonald, Vinnie Buckley, James Campbell and Sorley Self # have had a great season, winning their West under- development league, so there is plenty for the lads to be proud of.If anyone would like to enjoy some rugby this weekend, Mid Argyll under- boys will be playing on Saturday March  in the final of the West Youth Chairman#s Trophy against Kilmarnock RFC at Slockavullin.

Much of the chamber music that Mozart composed was music for friends to perform and this trio is just one of these.Originally composed for clarinet, viola and piano, the viola part can be performed on cello as Harriet ably demonstrated. Very typically Mozart # easy to listen to and thoroughly enjoyable.On to the Craftsbury Trio, written by the American Gwyneth Walker. This trio has four movements, each depicting the small town of Craftsbury, Vermont.Up Country Toccata, The Lark in the Morning, You Can Buy It at the General Store, to the final movement Craftsbury Common depicting the green with a white picket fence.The movements are as descriptive as their titles and show many dferent skills on all instruments # fluttering sounds, jazz harmonies, numerous glissandos, syncopation, decorations and finishing with gentle rhythmic tapping.There is even a hint of Rhapsody in Blue in the third movement. If you only listen to one piece again this is the one and should be seen live,possible, and not just listened to.Rachmaninov’s Prelude in B minor for solo piano was Claire’s choice for the programme.This prelude, The Bell was Rachmaninov’s own favourite and was the one that he would often perform. The audience was delighted to be introduced to it by Claire.Brahms composed four chamber works which featured the clarinet later in le after a period when he wasn’t writing anything at all.This was the third trio of the evening and was again very dferent in style allowing Jenner , Harrietand Claireto demonstrate their considerable skills as a trio to a very appreciative audience.An arrangement of Consolation No. by Liszt for Trio Ecossaise was their encore.This was the second visit by Trio, and it is only a matter of time before they are welcomed back.There are two MAAA concerts planned for April # The Willow Trioand the Ugly Bug Ragtime Three.

We ran a local action plan to deal with this, resulting in a number of youths being taken home, tobacco and alcohol being confiscated and fixed penalty notices being issued.#In the coming months new CCTV systems are due to be installed in both Hermitage Park and Churchill Square which should act as a deterrent in these two sometimes problematic locations.#Road crime and road safety continues to be the focus of a large part of our operational activity.

Also standing by was the steamer Brora, which was bund for Belfast.The conditions were so bad from the point of view of visibility that the leboat had to receive bearings from the Brora and other ships by means of the Aldis signal lamps while ships’ searchlights assisted them in getting into position. For a time the ships could only see each other on the radar screen.Coxswain Duncan Newlands, who knows this dreaded part of the estuary like the back of his hand, edged his leboat in astern of the coaster and proceeded to begin operations, but at .am came this dramatic message over the leboat’s radio: ‘Arrived alongside casualty at .hours got rope aboard and commenced towing at . hours.‘Rope now parted. Returning alongside St Kentigern for further instructions.’There was a lull in the activities while the leboat resumed its operations. They tried again- without success.Then came the news at . hours – ‘St Kentigern Refloated.’The leboat has succeeded in its third attempt, against odds.The St Kentigern then proceeded to Campbeltown under her own power, while the leboat escorted her, but first it took in tow the coaster’s own leboat, which it had earlier lowered over the port side in case of an emergency.The Ardchattern also accompanied the Saint Kentigern to Campbeltown.Meantime, the two remaining ships, Lairdsdale and Brora, seeing their attendance was no longer required, sent a parting signal of good-luck to the coaster and continued on their respective passages to towards the Irish Coast."},{"url":null,"title":"leader march 11 2022 2","story":"So the Scottish Government remains adamant in its decision to ban creelers from the Clyde for the next two months or so.We#re not talking North Sea trawlers here that can go where in the interim.

Baby young cod are not caught in prawn creels. The scientists at the Rural Affairs Committee meeting on March  said that there was zero evidence for creels to be included in the ban, and that the previous evidence cited on the Scottish Government website had now been removed.Our MSP represented to the creel fishermen in Campbeltown that she would:.    Seek a relaxation of the ban to enable the creel fishermen to continue to work as per the scientic evidence advice..    Seek compensation for the creel fishermen for almost three months loss of income.However, in the event she VOTED.    To keep the ban in place.    Against compensation.This is absolutely duplicitous.

I had slowly started to think that it was a once-in-a-letime opportunity until fortune smiled upon me one more time.About two weeks ago, I had a busy day at work. To recharge my batteries, I decided to go on a quick walk with the camera.Short-eared owl. Image: Zan BlaszczykAs soon as I left the house, the weather changed its course and the sky was shortly covered by nimbus clouds. Normally I wouldhome and grab my raincoat, but I did not want to waste time.When I arrived at the local reserve, the first rain droplets fell on the ground and the place became deserted. I took a wander and soon spotted a familiar flight pattern above the marshes. Upon checking through my camera, I confirmed it was a short-eared owl.The bird was flying low and patrolling the ground for voles. It even managed to catch one but it was tricky to get a good-quality photo due to the distance between us. The bird flew past me on a couple of occasions but the weather was getting worse with every minute so I headed back home. The word about the owl must have spread, as when I ed two days later, I met other fellow photographers looking for the stunning bird.I ed to the same spot as previously and sat on a rock and waited patiently. Shortly afterwards, a graceful owl with a wingspan of around cm appeared on the horizon. Without changing my position, I started following the bird with the camera. Imagine my surprise when the owl flew over me and looked straight at the camera! I silently shouted to myself: “Wow!”As soon as the owl flew behind me, I slowly turned back and spotted the second bird. Both owls were flying towards each other and, as they met halfway, they started their ‘sky dance’.The male began to rise in the sky whilst performing a combination of dynamic wing beats and gliding down, then rising again. He also made several squeaky calls accompanied by dynamic wing claps at high speeds! After repeating the whole sequence a few times, he started falling from the sky. The female joined in and they started going at each other: the birds were e-bombing one another and attacking with their talons. That aerial display lasted for about  minutes until the birds separated. What a scene it was!Courtship behaviour is spectacular for this species: often, two birds will lock their talons and, whilst holding onto each other, they will start tumbling nearly to the ground before letting go.I encourage everyone who has a chance to observe this behaviour, as this is a ‘must’ in the birding world. It is worth remembering, though, that this species is sensitive to disturbance and their numbers are considered declining during the past two decades. It is crucial not to approach the owls or their nesting site. For your observation, I would recommend choosing one spot and remaining there. This way, you have a chance to show them that you are no threat to them and hopefully the owls will get used to your presence. I prefer this technique rather than hiding as, considering owls’ excellent eyesight, it is almost impossible to stay unnoticed. By waiting at the same position, we can also eliminate another factor, which is chasing off their prey: as we walk, the ground shakes under our feet and small mammals, such as mice or voles which the owls feed on, will disappear. Short-eared owls like marshy and boggy places, so it is important not to walk over the rich habitat but use paths.www.zanslenswww.facebook zanslenswww zans_lensIf you have owls living in your backyard or would like me to photograph and feature wildle from your area, please get in touch!"},{"url":null,"title":"brunton-musselburgh-children-star-bugsy-malone","story":"Youth acting group Drama Mill auditioned  children for the show, and now has a cast of  children from North Berwick, Aberlady, Gullane, Cockenzie and Haddington, aged from eight to .Linda Kearsley Ross, Drama Mill director, said that the performance – the group’s first foray into musical theatre – was “ambitious” but that the children had loved taking on the roles of s New York gangsters.County children to star in Bugsy MaloneShe added: “Bugsy Malone was our first choice of play.“Drama facilitators Claudia Overton and Stephanie Wynne and I have all taken part in productions when we were at school and have fond memories of performing this play.“It’s ambitious to do it with such a young castbut our fabulous talented group have risen to the task.“This is the first time we have performed at The Brunton and we are so excited to give our youngsters the opportunity to perform on a professional stage.”The cast will perform the famous musical numbers accompanied by a live nine-piece band, whose members are all volunteering their time and talent.Drama faclitator Stephanie Wynne coaches the young Bugsy Malone castAnd the production will emulate the original  film, starring Jodie Foster, by using splurge guns and foam pies.Linda said: “There is something really fun about playing gangsters and molls, and using splurge to take people down rather than bullets.“Some people criticised that the ending is really abrupt, i.e. that they all become friends and sing a song, but I don’t think children question the ending – they believe bad people can become good people and that, as the words say, ‘ you give a little love then it all comes back to you’.”Tickets can be bought via    or thebrunton en-GB shows bugsy%malone events -

With more than a decade of experience creating scents for other cult brands, the Edinburgh-based firm has doubled sales for three consecutive years with annual revenues now approaching £,.Founded by Fe-born master perfumer Euan McCall, who was later joined by partner Chloe Mullen, the business began trading in  as Jorum Laboratories after Mr McCall was asked to create some scented products to compliment the beverages of a large multinational drinks company.“I grabbed that opportunity with both hands and decided from that point onwards that this needed to be taken advantage of, and the business snowballed from there,” he said.With family interests in the extraction of aromatic oils, Mr McCall was exposed to the industry at a very young age and “fell in love and down the rabbit hole with it”. Rather than going the standard university route, he studied under a iety of professionals in a journey that took him to locations such as Barcelona, Paris and Dubai to absorb dferent cultural styles.: Scottish circular fashion specialist seals luxury technology tie-up“You can go to university and study chemical engineering but I went through a more traditional route where I studied with master perfumers and trained specically in perfumery rather than chemistry to ensure I would become a perfumer at the end of it,” he said.“A lot of people study chemistry and chemical engineering and then go to work for a fragrance company, but they might not end up being perfumers, they might be scientists in some other part of the RD chain.”Ms Mullen joined Jorum in  from another fragrance company and focuses on sales and marketing while Mr McCall oversees formulation and manufacturing. The two have a near-equal stake in the business, with the balance tipped slightly in favour of Mr McCall at %, and no external investors.They have nearly  formulation clients, most of whom are based internationally and can’t be named because of non-disclosure agreements. They also undertake work on behalf of other luxury retailers, such as big-name whisky groups, who want candles or other scented products to sell alongside their main brands.: Scottish lingerie maker LoveRose seeks to capture Dragons financial heartThe pair re-launched as Jorum Studio in  with six of their own-brand fragrances, selling direct to consumers and via distributors supplying independent speciality beauty stores in ious international markets.The own-brand range has now expanded to  perfumes, led by the most popular Trimerous and Nectary scents, with three more to launch in the coming month or two. Thereafter Jorum plans to introduce its own line of scented candles and body products.The company also continues with its BB services: “We did initially think it would have to be a case of one or the other,” Mr McCall said, “butanything both sides have accelerated.”Progress has not, however, come without signicant dficulties.“We entered international wholesaling the week before the pandemic struck us proper, so our first major retailer had just received our products as we all went into lockdown,” Mr McCall said.“We had spent a lot of time and energy speaking to a whole host of other stores which initially we had lined up to sell to, and then they got a little bit of cold feet which was understandable because they were having to close all their stores, so [developing the wholesale business] took a little bit longer than we had hoped or expected.”: Edinburgh sour beer brewery creating jobs to support growthPrices for glass, paper and natural raw materials also increased, though the biggest issue in the early part of the pandemic was securing ethanol alcohol. With nearly all supplies going into hand sanitisers, prices rose by as much as %, and even at that ethanol was at times simply unavailable.As dficult as that was, Mr McCall said Brexit continues to be a “nightmare”. Sales of Jorum’s own scents have fallen from % of direct sales revenue to almost zero as European buyers are faced with the uncertainty of import taxes on their purchases.Fortunately, the lipstick effect has driven demand where, with the US and Australia now accounting for the majority of direct sales. Europe continues to account for about half of wholesale revenues.Jorum is now looking to open additional stores to add to its current boutique in Edinburgh’s St Stephen Street. Though online growth was strong throughout lockdown, Mc McCall believes the future for perfume – which people prefer to try before they buy – depends on physical retailing.“The who’s who of the beauty and retail industry are all focusing on perfume as a ‘golden item’ within their stores,” he said. “John Lewis is doubling down and investing heavily in perfume, and Harrod’s are opening stand-alone beauty stores because they know the category is experiencing dynamic growth.“We are taking the temperature from these bigger operators. The outlook in that sense is very positive, we just have to be in a position to roll that out.”"},{"url":null,"title":"eight-glasgow-statues-individuals-linked-slave-trade","story":"It added gts from those linked to the trade amounted to more than £million in today’s valuation and it said that while other cities and institutions around the UK have apologised for their connections to the slave trade, the city lags behind in civic recognition.It noted there was also a muted response in Glasgow in contrast with other Atlantic ports in  the bicentennial of the ‘Abolition of the Slave Trade Act’ was marked.Council leader Susan Aitken said the city needs to respond adding: \"we should apologise, fully and unreservedly, to the descendants of enslaved people.\"Read more: Glasgow School of Art: Reinstating its diminished reputation is key, says architect bidding to be chairmanCommissioned by Glasgow City Council, the purpose of the Glasgow Slavery Audit was to determine the historic connections and modern legacies derived from the Atlantic slave trade.The study, led by Dr Stephen Mullen, academic historian at the University of Glasgow, focused on iniduals, who were residents of Glasgow and where, involved with Atlantic slavery between  and .  Some of these iniduals shaped todays city, whilst others are memorialised in civic space, including eight statues which were erected around the city.Eight statues of Colin Campbell, William Gladstone, John Moore, David Livingstone, James Oswald, Robert Peel Jnr, James Watt and King William are all highlighted in the report.Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken said the report provides an incontrovertible evidence base of the extent of Glasgow’s complicity in chattel slavery and the actions that supported it.She added: \"This issue now is how we respond as a city. A working group with a remit to propose and take forward recommendations from the report will reconvene following May’s local elections.“This would include matters from street names, monuments and buildings with direct or associated connections to Atlantic slavery, Lord Provosts of Glasgow who were involved in the slave economy through to how Glasgow should permanently acknowledge the city’s historic role in slavery and memorialise its victims. All recommendations will be subjected to consultation, particularly with groups representing BAME citizens.“And we should apologise, fully and unreservedly, to the descendants of enslaved people and to the nations they came from for the city’s signicant role in Atlantic slavery.”Among the key findings are that between  and ,  inidual Lord Provosts were nominated to Glasgow Town Council with  having some connection to Atlantic slavery, and some sat in office whilst owning enslaved people.It found Glasgow Town Council invested £,, around £m today in the Company of Scotland in .

Others inherited slavery-derived wealth and promoted the interests of enslavers in the British Parliament. MPs William Ewart Gladstone and James Oswald inherited wealth from forebears with major connections to the Atlantic slavery economy.In dferent ways, Gladstone and Oswald, as well as Robert Peel junior, supported the interests of enslavers in Parliament, although Oswald nominally supported the end of the Apprenticeship scheme, by signing a public petition in .John Moore and Colin Campbell, whose statues are both found in George Square, were in the British army, with identiable roles in upholding the system of chattel slavery in colonies of the British West Indies.Missionary and explorer David Livingstone was employed in Blantyre Mill, owned by Henry Monteith, who was in a partnership with two Glasgow-West India merchants in the s. Blantyre Mill paid relatively high wages to its workforce including Livingstone from  and especially after  when he was promoted to a cotton-spinner which funded his education.  Although outside the scope of this study, one street in Glasgow commemorates an abolitionist. Fox Street was named after Whig politician Charles James Fox , a parliamentary campaigner who supported abolition in the s.Fox was a close ally of William Wilberforce and was widely recognised for his parliamentary efforts. At a meeting on  April , the ‘London Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade’ thanked William Wilberforce, William Pitt and Charles James Fox for their parliamentary contributions - although abolition was not enacted until .The report also highlighted street names, and found that  Glasgow streets and locations have a ‘direct’ or ‘associational’ connections to Atlantic slavery.These include Buchanan Street, named after Andrew Buchanan junior, Glassford Street, after tobacco lord John Glassford, and Monteith Row, named after Henry Monteith.  The report refers to cities across the UK and beyond which have apologised for slave trade connections, it added: “The paradox is that whilst historical research focused on Glasgow and slavery related themes is now relatively well known - and its political leadership and citizenry are in an informed position - the city lags behind in civic recognition.”It said of all Britain’s Atlantic outports, Glasgow has arguably the most well-developed body of historical writing that explains the implications of the colonial era from the city’s early th century sugar ees mid-th century slaving voyages the eras of the ‘tobacco lords’ - and ‘sugar aristocracy’ -.The report added: “Whilst historians have addressed key aspects of Liverpool and Bristol’s history, notably in the Africa trafficking, there are multiple perspectives of Glasgow and its citizens’ connections with Atlantic slavery.”The report is due to be delievered to members of Glasgow City Council later this week.Glasgow City Council was contacted for comment."},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-apps-drive-huge-rise-takeaway-consumption","story":"Research by Obesity Action Scotland found that halfof young adults aged  to  were eating takeaways at least once a week in , up from % in .Even among over-s, the proportion consuming takeaways at least once a week tripled from % to % between  and .It comes as separate research by Food Standards Scotlandshowed that demand for takeaways and home deliveries of fast food such as pizzas and curries had already increased substantially in  as a result of lockdown and restrictions on restaurant trading.Source: Food Standards ScotlandIn , FSS found that takeaway trips doubled in Scotland by around  million compared to , with the increase mainly driven by orders placed through restaurant apps -

The identity of a person could undoubtedly be forged by the place of their birth and the community of that place, particularly at a time in the past when populations were less mobile.The traits of a person’s parents manest in their physical appearance their spirit, likes and dislikes, and sometimes even interests or inclinations might appear hereditary – not just from mother and father but perhaps from an ancestor remembered only by name and special characteristic, like poesy or craft skill..The failure by clan chiefs and other landed gentry to recognise this customary right held by the people since time immemorial underpins the Clearances, while demands for its recognition echo through much of the collective action undertaken against this violence, trauma, and dispossession. as far back in history as I can.The world and society these people lived in was so dferent to ours today, making context crucial to understanding the words being used and the philosophy from which they derive.Aside from the multitude which are in still in use today, there are published proverb collections as well as countless sound recordings, many digitized and made easily accessible by Tobar an Dualchais.By their nature proverbs cut across boundaries of class and gender, their survival relying upon oral transmission, on being commonly known in a community and thus reflecting its values.

The Trust has announced that funding applications for delivery partners have opened for . One of those ‘outside the box’ ideas was the creation of the Northern Ireland Hospitality School, which allowed three local hoteliers to come together under the umbrella of a not-for-profit organisation to create courses and programmes for the Ballymena hospitality sector.The Northern Ireland Hospitality School, as a delivery partner, was launched last year in conjunction with Northern Regional College . The Trust, over the next three years, has committed almost pound,, offering students a chance to expand their skills and gain guaranteed employment with one of three local hotels – the Tullyglass House Hotel, the Adair Arms and the Galgorm Golf Resort and Spa. Since its launch, a total of  students have completed the Level  Professional Bartending course and have gone on to secure full-time employment. Joel Johnston, a former student of the Northern Ireland Hospitality School, who now works at Gillies Grill as part of the Galgorm Golf Resort and Spa in Ballymena, has been reflecting on his experience.“I’m really glad that the Northern Ireland Hospitality School was able to become a delivery partner with The Gallaher Trust,” Joel said. “Completing the Level  Professional Bartending course has made such a positive impact on my le I was able to develop my skills and now I’m working in a field that I’m truly passionate about.“I have always wanted to work within the hospitality industry and when I saw that a Hospitality School had been launched in Ballymena, I couldn’t wait to apply. “The Professional Bartending course has given me a great launchpad into my career. Working within hospitality can be tough, but the course has equipped me with all the skills necessary to thrive.“I am an employee at Gillies Grill and I’m really enjoying it. The Hospitality School has made such a dference to my le and I’m not sureI would be in this position without it. Any eligible organisation that requires funding and support should definitely apply to become a delivery partner with The Gallaher Trust. Their support helps to get projects off the ground which can make a big impact on the people of Ballymena – just like the Hospitality School.”Elsewhere, Ian Paisley MP, Chairman of The Gallaher Trust says he’s delighted with the success of the Hospitality School thus far and is speaking out to encourage other eligible organisations to apply for funding.“On behalf of The Gallaher Trust, we are so proud that the Hospitality School is achieving its purpose of developing skills and creating jobs for adults within the Ballymena community,” Ian commented.“Our mission at the Trust is to work alongside delivery partners that are aiming to make a real dference in peoples’ lives by creating jobs, developing skills and helping disadvantaged adults.“Delivery partner applications are now open and to be eligible, you must be a charity, a not-for-profit based organisation or a social enterprise, that can make an impact on the greater Ballymena area.“I would strongly urge any organisation that is eligible, to apply for funding today. We have seen from the likes of the Hospitality School, that it could make a massive dference to your project and ultimately the people of Ballymena, which is our clear purpose.”For more information about becoming a delivery partner, visit the Contact Us section of The Gallaher Trust’s website: https:thegallahertrust.org contact-us .

This resulted in shows losing the opportunity to raise vital funds that would help prepare for the  season. “Shows play a vital role in showcasing our excellent agri-food produce and supporting our rural communities, as well as boosting our economy and the additional tourism opportunities. These shows are predominately run by many volunteers who give of their free time and I would like to extend my thanks to them for all of their hard work. “Pre-pandemic agricultural shows attracted more than , visitors. It is essential therefore that NI shows have the opportunity to run a full schedule this year to promote and facilitate future economic growth for agri-food businesses and I am pleased that I can support their efforts through the provision of the pound, bounce back support scheme I’ve announced today, which will allow each show to claim up to a maximum of poundk for new or increased costs. “Departmental officials will contact shows directly in the next few weeks to assist them in availing of my support scheme.” Looking to the future, Mr Poots has announced plans for an independent review of local agricultural shows, which will explore the potential for longer term support options and help shows remain sustainable in the years ahead. He added: “Although I am providing support to our local shows this year, I am of the view that Government departments and local councils should consider options for longer term support. “I am therefore announcing plans for an independent review to commence in the next month or two which will aim to explore future support options and guide future policy, in addition to identying new and innovative methods which would be utilised by local shows to help safeguard their future.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1635169051553.jpg--hargey_tackles_digital_exclusion_through_provision_of_free_broadband.jpg?1635169051000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220327newshargey tackles digital exclusion through provision of free broadband","story":"Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey has announced the provision of free broadband for those facing digital exclusion as a barrier to work.

The Fund can provide a non-repayable grant of up to pound,, in a  month period, to remove barriers to employment. The Minister continued: “The success of the Adviser Discretion Fund in helping remove barriers to employment has already been seen throughout the year, particularly in the uptake of upfront childcare

Latvia stands for us. Estonia stands for us. Poland stands for us. France — Emanuel, I really believe that you will stand for us. Slovenia stands for us. Slovakia stands for us.“The Czech Republic stands for us. Romania knows what dignity is, so it will stand for us at the crucial moment. Bulgaria stands for us. Greece, I believe, stands with us.“Germany... A little later. Portugal — well, almost... Croatia stands for us. Sweden — yellow and blue should always stand together. Finland — I know you are with us. The Netherlands stands for the rational, so we’ll find common ground. Malta — I believe we will succeed. Denmark — I believe we will succeed. Luxembourg — we understand each other. Cyprus — I really believe you are with us.“Italy — thank you for your support! Spain — we’ll find common ground. Belgium — we will find arguments. Austria, together with Ukrainians, it is an opportunity for you. I’m sure of it. Ireland — well, almost.”The Ukrainian leader offered no further reasons for his comment.While fully backing the Ukrainian push for EU membership, Ireland has not abandoned its position of military neutrality in the face of the Russian assault.EU leaders have so far resisted the call to accelerate the accession of Ukraine to the bloc.Taoiseach Micheal Martin has since played down Zelensky’s comments, claiming the Ukrainian leader was talking in terms of the ‘European perspective’.Related topicsSinn FéinUkraineLucidTalk pollMore On Sinn Féin PremiumSam McBrideOpinionDUP gains ground, but overall support drops for ided unionismBelfast man in court accused of threat to kill MP John Finucane PremiumBill WhiteOpinionDUP running out of time to catch Sinn Fein but vote-shares don’t always translate to Assembly seatsBelfast City Council to host ‘Day of Reflection’ to acknowledge pain and hurt caused by the Troubles PremiumSuzanne BreenOpinionWith five weeks to go until Northern Ireland election, Sinn Fein remain in pole positionMost ReadTwo arrested and murder investigation launched after man’s death in NewtownabbeyLucidTalk opinion poll: Sinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill nudges closer to top Stormont post as DUP lags behindWatch: Paul Gascoigne caught on camera tripping up child before Rangers challenge matchLoyalist paramilitaries to target Irish government buildings as  weapons could be used in campaign against NI protocolOscar delight for Kenneth Branagh as he scoops best original screenplay gong for BelfastTop VideosPlayWatch: Ken Branagh emotional over #very meaningful# Oscar win for Belfast\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news  .ece AUTOCROP wh babebedadbaecccae.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news  .ece AUTOCROP wh babebedadbaecccae.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayVideo: Two arrested in Rathcoole following body discovery at Carrickfergus reservoirPlayAnalysis: Sinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill nudges closer to top Stormont postLatest Northern IrelandSir Kenneth Branagh’s Oscar triumph a massive win for city of Belfast as well, Lord Mayor Kate Nicholl declaresWill Smith slap: NI alopecia advocate criticises Chris Rock’s hair loss joke that sparked astonishing bust-upCoda’s Oscar success ‘will highlight issues’ for the deaf community, says Northern Ireland charityRevealed: One in seven people in Northern Ireland willing to host refugees escaping the war in UkraineSecond PO ferry detained after safety inspection, coastguard agency saysLatestSir Kenneth Branagh’s Oscar triumph a massive win for city of Belfast as well, Lord Mayor Kate Nicholl declaresWill Smith slap: NI alopecia advocate criticises Chris Rock’s hair loss joke that sparked astonishing bust-upCoda’s Oscar success ‘will highlight issues’ for the deaf community, says Northern Ireland charityRevealed: One in seven people in Northern Ireland willing to host refugees escaping the war in UkraineWhat the papers say – March ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Pic: Jonathan McCambridge PA WireMarch   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThe results are in from our Spring  NI ‘Tracker’ poll, and we see that Sinn Fein are still comfortably in the lead as Northern Ireland’s largest party on a projected % vote share - up a % point from our Winter poll in January.Sinn Fein have now been the lead party in all polls for some time, and so they must be really hoping that they can achieve top spot in the May  election.The DUP are up two points in second place on %, and are seven points behind Sinn Fein.The other two unionist parties have dropped a bit, with the UUP on % - down a point since our January poll, and the TUV on % . Even so, this % score is still three times more than the TUV achieved in the last NI Assembly election in .So the trend is good for the DUP with perhaps some of their regular voters who moved to the TUV ing to the fold as the Assembly election approaches.However they still have a big gap to make upthey are to catch Sinn Fein, and there’s not much time left.The SDLP are at least consistent in the polls, coming in this time at % - no change from our Winter poll in January.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up  Read MoreLucidTalk opinion poll: Sinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill nudges closer to top Stormont post as DUP lags behindThe SDLP has been showing around the %-% vote-share mark for a long time, with no real up or down movement either way. Alliance are at %, up  points, perhaps benefiting from the UUP’s small drop.About this UUP drop, it’s noteworthy that Doug Beattie’s personal ‘leader rating’ in this poll was down  points from his January poll score, which is a hefty drop.Perhaps the Twitter posts controversy has been a factor here, and interestinglythis seems to have had more of a negative impact with female voters than males.Boris Johnson had the biggest increase in our ‘leader ratings’ - up  points from his January poll-score. This reflects the national UK-wide polls with the PM benefiting from a ‘Ukraine war bounce’. However, he still remains Northern Ireland’s lowest rated political leader at minus !Now the science of opinion polling applies to modelling and forecasting NI-wide public opinion, ie projecting vote-shares – that’s what polls do, and they usually do this pretty accurately.Read MoreSuzanne Breen:OpinionWith five weeks to go until Northern Ireland election, Sinn Fein remain in pole positionJon Tonge:OpinionAlliance on course to be third biggest party in the NI ExecutiveBut, of course, what people really want to knowis how all these vote-shares would translate into seats at the Assembly election.As the political commentators will tell you, vote-shares don’t always translate neatly into NI Assembly seats.Indeed, it’s perfectly possible for the TUV to get a %-% NI-Wide vote-share in this election, and for Jim Allister to still be the only TUV MLA – although, with that NI vote-share, they would have to be a bit unlucky for that to happen. It’s all down to where, and in what constituencies, the votes come from.So for our last pre-NI Assembly election pollwe will be running  separate NI constituency polls with the named candidates and parties for each constituency, presented to each poll respondent.Basically the poll-participants will be presented with actual ballot they will see in each of their respective constituencies on election day. Then, like we do with all our polls, we will combine all this data into NI-wide political-party vote-share projections.This approach brings in some of the reality of the election, as there’s always a brand and loyalty factor with some named candidates. We used this approach in our very last pre- UK general election poll, and we believe it was one of the factors that allowed us to forecast that election to within %. We will seeit works as well again – we hope it does!Bill White is managing director of Belfast polling and market research company LucidTalkRelated topicsNorthern Ireland AssemblySinn FéinUlster Unionist PartyAlliance PartyTraditional Unionist VoiceSDLPLucidTalk pollMore On Northern Ireland AssemblySDLP’s Colum Eastwood leaves opposition ‘on the table’ depending on negotiations following Stormont Assembly Election PremiumSam McBrideOpinionWhy we all may be paying more for electricity thanks to Stormont failures and a little-known monopoly company PremiumLindy McDowellOpinionHow do you say ‘farcical waste of money’ in Irish and or Ulster Scots  PremiumAlex KaneOpinionUnionism remains as ided in  as it was in , now it might be too late to do things dferentlyStormont department criticised for building Derry park-and-ride which breaches planning rulesMost ReadTwo arrested and murder investigation launched after man’s death in NewtownabbeyLucidTalk opinion poll: Sinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill nudges closer to top Stormont post as DUP lags behindWatch: Paul Gascoigne caught on camera tripping up child before Rangers challenge matchLoyalist paramilitaries to target Irish government buildings as  weapons could be used in campaign against NI protocolOscar delight for Kenneth Branagh as he scoops best original screenplay gong for BelfastTop VideosPlayWatch: Ken Branagh emotional over #very meaningful# Oscar win for Belfast\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news  .ece AUTOCROP wh babebedadbaecccae.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news  .ece AUTOCROP wh babebedadbaecccae.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayVideo: Two arrested in Rathcoole following body discovery at Carrickfergus reservoirPlayAnalysis: Sinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill nudges closer to top Stormont postLatest Northern Ireland Assembly elections Sam McBrideOpinionDUP gains ground, but overall support drops for ided unionismJon TongeOpinionAlliance on course to be third biggest party in the NI ExecutiveUnionists more worried about NI Protocol than living costs, reveals LucidTalk pollSuzanne BreenOpinionWith five weeks to go until Northern Ireland election, Sinn Fein remain in pole positionLucidTalk opinion poll: Sinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill nudges closer to top Stormont post as DUP lags behindLatestCoda’s Oscar success ‘will highlight issues’ for the deaf community, says Northern Ireland charityNI cook Niall McLean says ‘dream come true’ to appear on MasterChefSir Kenneth Branagh’s Oscar triumph a massive win for city of Belfast as well, Lord Mayor Kate Nicholl declaresRevealed: One in seven people in Northern Ireland willing to host refugees escaping the war in UkraineWill Smith slap: NI alopecia advocate criticises Chris Rock’s hair loss joke that sparked astonishing bust-up,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: NCA PARobin SchillerMarch   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThe -year jail term handed down to the Kinahan cartel’s “main man in the UK” marks a signicant victory in the fight against the international drugs gang.Thomas ‘Bomber’ Kavanaghoperated a lucrative network which saw more than €m worth of drugs hidden inside industrial machinery being smuggled into the UK in a single year.However, the high-ranking associate will be out of circulation until he is well into his s, when he is released on licence from the longest jail term he has received in a criminal career spanning over five decades.Born on September , , Kavanagh grew up in south central Dublin and was on the garda radar by the time he turned .In April  he picked up his first criminal conviction, and over the next  years was regularly in the dock for offences involving firearms, burglary, making threats to kill and assault.By the turn of the century, he was considered a serious player in organised crime and came into the sights of the recently formed Criminal Assets Bureau .The Bureau later secured an order for more than £, in unpaid taxes from the proceeds of his criminality.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up As a result of the increasing garda pressure, Kavanagh moved his family to the English Midlands in the early s, eventually settling in Tamworth, near Birmingham.He set up TK Motors in  which bought cars at auction before exporting them for profit to Ireland. Investigators believe he made “quite considerable” s from this enterprise which included trading cars across Europe and even in Dubai. However, they suspect he relied mainly on crime to fund his lestyle.While in the UK, gardaí suspect ‘Bomber’ was also linked to major drug shipments imported into Ireland through his contacts across continental Europe.By  his wealth was growing and that year he used fake documents to re-mortgage his £, home, a fraud for which he later received a fully suspended -month sentence. The house was lavishly refurbished, while a state-of-the-art security system, fortied gates, reinforced doors and bullet proof glass were also installed.His influence had also expanded across the Midlands and the National Crime Agencyassessed that his rise led to him becoming the Kinahans’ “figurehead” and “top man” in the UK. While his Europe-wide empire grew, garda intelligence in late  indicated that Kavanagh was rarely,ever, sighted in Ireland. That changed after February , , when his brother-in-law David Byrne was shot dead at the Regency Hotel in Drumcondra. Byrne was considered a close associate of the Kinahan gang in Dublin along with his older brother Liam. The murder would lead to a spate of gun murders, with  people killed in Ireland and Spain.He was a prominent mourner at the funeral  days later where he was joined by associates including feud killer Freddie Thompson and the Kinahan brothers Daniel and Christy Jnr. Also at the funeral service was an unknown middle-aged man, who garda inquiries would later determine was Declan Brady.Gardaí immediately began investigating the unassuming haulier who became known as ‘Mr Nobody’ and would turn out to be Kavanagh’s man in Ireland.The following January, Irish detectives raided a business in Dublin’s Greenogue industrial estate where they found ‘Mr Nobody’ along with two other men and an arsenal of high-powered weapons. More than €m worth of drugs were also seized in a later search.Financial documents led back to a logistics firm in the Midlands linked to Dublin brothers-in-law Gary Vickeryand Daniel Canning .As part of Operation Hornstay, a search at Dover Port in October  led to drugs worth €m hidden inside industrial machinery being seized, and the two men were arrested.Examinations of their devices showed they were receiving instructions from a man referred to as ‘The Gaffer’.Investigators also had to decipher the codewords used “Paper” was money, “Phones” were blocks of cocaine, “Sister’ was the machinery”, “Jelly” referred to Vickery while “Smiley” was Canning.In one email a week before the Dover bust ‘The Gaffer’ told his subordinates: “Ta put safe in sister and jelly b on in couple hours did not want to get him up tis morning from beauty sleep :”.The NCA established that this man was Thomas Kavanagh, who also used the alias Paul Christopher Harvey.The father of six was arrested at Birmingham airport on January , , while ing from a family holiday in Mexico.An encrypted BQ Aquaris device was found in his suitcase, indicating the cartel associate conducted business while on holiday.His luxury home was searched, and cash totalling £,, expensive watches, jewellery and luxury clothing seized. Weapons were also found, including knives, bats, and a pink stun gun disguised as a torch — for which he received a three-year jail term.More trouble was to come when he was charged along with Vickery and Canning in relation to the drugs importation conspiracy.The NCA suspects they imported €m worth of drugs into the UK between September  and October .​​​Judge Martyn Levett jailed him for  years at Ipswich Crown Court yesterday. Vickery and Canning were given prison terms of  and -and-a-half years respectively for their roles in the syndicate.All three will serve half of their sentences out on licence.After the hearing, NCA deputy director Matt Horne described Kavanagh as a “high-ranking member of the Kinahan cartel” and “their main man in the UK”.They will now go after The Gaffer’s assets, including his Tamworth home and any items bought with the proceeds of crime.Most ReadTwo arrested and murder investigation launched after man’s death in NewtownabbeyLucidTalk opinion poll: Sinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill nudges closer to top Stormont post as DUP lags behindWatch: Paul Gascoigne caught on camera tripping up child before Rangers challenge matchLoyalist paramilitaries to target Irish government buildings as  weapons could be used in campaign against NI protocolOscar delight for Kenneth Branagh as he scoops best original screenplay gong for BelfastTop VideosPlayWatch: Ken Branagh emotional over #very meaningful# Oscar win for Belfast\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news  .ece AUTOCROP wh babebedadbaecccae.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news  .ece AUTOCROP wh babebedadbaecccae.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayVideo: Two arrested in Rathcoole following body discovery at Carrickfergus reservoirPlayAnalysis: Sinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill nudges closer to top Stormont postLatest Republic of IrelandSecond PO ferry detained after safety inspection, coastguard agency saysCall to renew public health measures amid Covid ‘chaos’ in hospitalsTravel pass scheme for Irish border will not damage NI tourism, vows Donaldson‘Disappointment’ over change to wait time for gay men to donate bloodUUP chief concedes he will lose votes after pulling out of anti-protocol ralliesLatestSir Kenneth Branagh’s Oscar triumph a massive win for city of Belfast as well, Lord Mayor Kate Nicholl declaresWill Smith slap: NI alopecia advocate criticises Chris Rock’s hair loss joke that sparked astonishing bust-upCoda’s Oscar success ‘will highlight issues’ for the deaf community, says Northern Ireland charityRevealed: One in seven people in Northern Ireland willing to host refugees escaping the war in UkraineNI cook Niall McLean says ‘dream come true’ to appear on MasterChef,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Ballynahinch scheme represents excellent value for money and should have been prioritised during the past two years.Mr Hazzard said more than poundbn of capital resources has been spent by the roads minister and her department during the letime of the current Assembly.ldquoIt is hugely disappointing that a small, yet strategically important scheme, such as the Ballynahinch bypass has been left on the shelf. In light of the economic impact of Covid- and the ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the commencement of this scheme would have been a welcome step towards improving both our local economy and the wellbeing of the local community, said the MP.Mr Hazzard added: ldquoWe can only hope now that when the Executive is restored after Mayrsquos election, that the local community can have a minister in place who recognises the value of the Ballynahinch bypass and finally begins construction.Mr Casement said the bypass could help kick-start the economic regeneration of the town and provide the wider South Down tourism economy with a signicant boost. He said it was vital a start date for construction work is confirmed as soon as possible.A key member of Ballynahinchrsquos Regeneration Committee for many years alongside the late Vincent Fullam, Mr Casement has never given up the battle to secure a bypass, which was first mooted in the late s.ldquoThe bypass is included in a list of strategic projects and is effectively ready to proceed. There should be no more delays. The scheme should have been delivered years ago, he declared.ldquoWhile the primary focus of the bypass is on easing traffic congestion, there are many other benefits, including reduced town centre pollution.Mr Casement added: ldquoThe new road scheme will also dissuade drivers from using built-up housing areas and rural roads as unofficial bypasses and, most importantly, help kick-start the economic regeneration of Ballynahinch town centre. We need to see work starting on the scheme now.A Department for Infrastructure spokesman said it was committed to delivering the bypass as part of a plan to aid economic recovery and community transformation, while addressing regional imbalance.He said that ldquofar from being left on the shelf, the scheme was being actively progressed much further by Ms Mallon than any other minister, with development work now substantively complete and statutory approvals finalised in July last year.ldquoThe next stage would involve commencing the procurement of a contractor but progression to procurement and construction is dependent upon the level of funding made available to the Department in future budgets, he explained.ldquoThe Departmentrsquos bid for the - budget included funds to deliver this scheme, however, the absence of an Executive means there is no agreed budget which means that delivery timescales remain uncertain.The spokesman added: ldquoThis is a priority for our Minister who remains frustrated that once again the absence of an Executive is negatively affecting both the people of Northern Ireland and our infrastructure..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Carryduff landowner helps the environment with trees  ","story":"CARRYDUFF landowner Rosanna Ballentine and her son Iain have received  trees to plant on their farm to help them enhance bioersity and create a habitat for wildle.The trees have been supplied from a partnership between Trees on the Land ndash a charity and not-for-profit project from the Green Economy Foundation ndash and SuperValu and Centra, part of the Musgrave Group.The project is part of a sustainability initiative from the retail brands which recently announced they will plant , trees across Northern Ireland over ten years.Mrs Ballentine welcomed the initiative and the assistance of SuperValu and Centra staff, along with central colleagues from Musgrave NI, who pulled on their wellies and visited the farm to help plant a mix of hawthorn, oak, birch, rowan and hazel trees.She said: ldquoWe are planting a new native hedgerow and a line of trees along the edge of an existing woodland to ide it from an adjoining agricultural grassland.

crowned Bobby Dalzell Cup champions after defeating local rivals Ardglass in the deciding penalty shoot-out at Meadowvale last Thursday.A goal on the stroke of half-time from Ardglass midfielder Stephen Deegan was cancelled out on  minutes by the close range effort of Celtic striker Jordan McCoubrey.The teams refused to be split in extra-time and following the shoot-out mdash which went well into the sudden death stages mdash Blaine Connolly converted the all-important spot kick to gt his Hoopsrsquo side the victory.A large crowd turned out in Drumaness for the St Patrickrsquos Day showpiece between the current first and second-placed sides in the Newcastle Leaguersquos Premier Division.Adding to the pressure of the occasion was the alternating weather conditions, with the teams contesting the final in periods of sunshine as well as wind and rain.Nevertheless, Celtic kicked off the affair with the blustery conditions heavily in favour of their opponents.It didnrsquot take long for the tone of the match to be set as Ardglass defender Caolain OrsquoShea launched a very physical tackle on Hoops striker Jay Gibney.Ardglass enjoyed early momentum with experienced defender Neil Teggart seeing his wind-assisted free kick from his own half trouble Celtic custodian Nathan Curran less than ten minutes in.Celtic remained calm and soon strung their passes together through clever one touch football with eventual man of the match winner Conor Doherty in the thick of these sequences.However, Ardglass remained a threat and came close when Teggart clipped a cross into the danger area, although striker Michael Magee glanced his header wide.Stand-in Celtic captain Shaun Megahey attempted to play a through ball to team-mate Gibney, but on this occasion the Ardglass defence timed the offside trap perfectly.Celtic did come close when Barry Treacyrsquos corner kick was fumbled by Ardglass lsquokeeper, Mark Armstrong, although Hoops defender Paul Brady couldnrsquot dispatch the ball quickly enough before the danger was cleared.OrsquoShea continued his earlier eagerness and picked up a yellow card for a mistimed tackle before his team-mate, Magee, was unfairly clattered at the other end of the pitch, although Teggartrsquos effort flew past the wrong side of the post.Teggart continued to be a problem from set pieces as his free-kick delivery whisked past the head of striker Magee and out of bounds.Moments later, Mageersquos misfortune continued when he was shown a yellow card for expressing his disagreement with referee, Barry Mullan.After initially allowing the match to flow freely, referee Mullan clamped down on his decisions with less than ten minutes to the end of the opening half.Celtic defender Gary Carberry was the latest to enter the book for a late challenge on Ardglass marksman Magee.Despite this hiccup, Celticrsquos Carberry kept himself in contention for the man of the match accolade after he proved pivotal in stopping potential goalscoring chances from the Ardglass opposition on numerous occasions.As the half-time whistle approached, Celtic arms were raised as they appealed for the red card to be shown to Ardglassrsquos OrsquoShea, who may have considered himself lucky to escape an early bath after he was second to the ball.Ardglass launched another attack and it looked asMagee would have a free route to goal. However, Celtic veteran Brady recovered valiantly to prove he still has plenty of miles left in his tank.With the last attack of the half, Ardglass were awarded a corner and they took full advantage of their opportunity. Midfielder, Stephen Deegan, climbed high above the rest to head his effort beyond the outstretched hand of Celtic lsquokeeper Curran to open the scoring.As the second half kicked off it was evident that both sides would refrain from going for broke. A lot of the following ten minutes contained attacks, although both sides lacked a killer instinct and the match was heavily contested in the middle of the pitch.This is where Conor Doherty earned his post-match award for his performance, as he often won the midfield battle.Goal-scorer Deegan picked up a yellow as the weather took yet another turn for the worse.Celtic joint-managers Jason Galbraith and Matthew McKenna made the first of their substitutions as the clock struck the hour mark with Sean McMahon entering the fray in place of Conaill Kerr.Ardglass opted to put  men behind the ball in order to frustrate the opposition and waited patiently for their opportunity to counter-attack.Ardglass made changes of their own in the form of Jordan Finnegan before Celtic made a second substitute with the talented Sean Ferris making his way onto the pitch.Ferris made an immediate impact, adding another string to Celticrsquos bow by spreading inviting passes into his forward line.With just  minutes left of the , these Celtic substitutions came to fruition after the ball found its way to McMahon, who lofted an inviting ball into the Ardglass box which was steered home by the boot of striker McCoubrey.Celtic continued to mix things up as Corey McCartan made his way onto the pitch and gave a good account of himself with his tireless work rate.Despite this period of succession for the Hoops, the remaining minutes of the  played out finely balanced.Ardglass never let their headsand should be commended for their effort as they cancelled out any further attack whilst continuously seeking the crucial next goal.As tempers flared, the final whistle sounded and both teams prepared for extra-time.The highlights of the first half of extra-time came in the form of Celticrsquos Treacy picking up a yellow card before team-mate Ferris crashed his left-footed effort off the crossbar.During the next interval, both of Ardglassrsquo Magee and Celticrsquos Ferris threatened but they couldnrsquot do enough to get the ball over the line and it would be penalties that would decide the final outcome.Amongst the numerous penalties which took place, both Celtic and Ardglass players were ordered to retake their spot kicks.Firstly, Celtic striker McCoubrey saw his effort denied by Armstrong before referee Mullan blew his whistle after adjudging the Ardglass custodian to be off his line as the penalty was taken.McCoubrey fired in the retake and it wouldnrsquot be long before Ardglass substitute Finnegan would go through a similar course of events after he missed his initial penalty but converted at the second time of asking.Eventually, as the penalties progressed well into sudden death, Celticrsquos Blaine Connolly remained calm and converted the deciding spot kick to send the Hoopsrsquo support into delirium as his side were crowned champions.Following the conclusion, man of the match Conor Doherty gave his thoughts on his sidersquos victory.ldquoI thought we were the better team in the first half but then they snuck a goal before half-time, he said.ldquoBut, even with the wind we started to press on, it was a long  minutes.ldquoIt was a hard hitting game but Irsquom just glad we got on the winning side of it.He added: ldquoAll the penalties were top class, it was a really good shootout.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey , B Connolly, P Brady, G Carberry, C

After his death the Ulster Society for the Preservation of the Countryside erected a memorial in his honour at Trassey car park in the Mournes.Photographs taken by him which are now in the Down County Museum collection reflect both his work and passion for the Mournes. An outstanding feature of Cecilrsquos photographs is that they were accompanied by date and Ordnance Survey map grid reference mdash what curator could ask for more The importance of these two photographic collections is that they complement each other, in covering the same geographical area, but taken for dferent purposes and at dferent times.The number of images represented is smaller than the DJ McNeill archive so it was possible for the museumrsquos curatorial staff to catalogue them all and the Museum Photographer to digitise them.What remains to be done is adding the images and full information to the Museumrsquos database and more to the website. There are always more jobs to be carried out on the collection.However, using the images effectively, and in the way the Hudson and Newman families, and indeed all other donors, wished, requires wide knowledge of all the collections by experienced and qualied professional staff working with them on a daily basis.The photographic archive is recognised as one of the most important in Ireland and contains a wide range of images, including daguerrotypes, glass negative plates, lantern slides, black and white and colour film, transparencies as well as digital images.Understanding of all the processes involved in their making is essential to how they are cared for and used.Lesley Simpson is secretary of the Friends of Down County Museum and former Keeper of Collections at the museum..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Success at Downpatrick  ","story":"PRIOR to Sundayrsquos Randox Ulster National Handicap Chase meeting at Downpatrick Racecourse, manager Richard Lyttle stated that he was looking forward to welcoming racegoers back to the track for the first time in three years.They certainly turned up with car parks filled to capacity, packed enclosures and long tailbacks on the Ballydugan Road prior to the first race.The Randox Ulster National has been the local tracks major race of the year now for many years and the maximum  runners faced the starter for the three mile four furlong race that sees prize money paid right down to the first six past the post.A bit like the big Aintree race, there was plenty of fallers with two coming down at the very first fence and Envoi Pierji then unseating Donegal jockey Conor Orr, who had ridden Screaming Colours to success for Bill Durkan in the Midlands National at Uttoxeter the previous day.Later in the race there was more fallers at the regulation fence.With two fences to be taken the race involved four runners with the  winner Amaulino travelling like the winner under David McGrath.But this combination then faded, eventually finishing fourth for Co Armagh trainer Keith Watson.The eventual winner in the famous J P McManus Silks proved to be Spades Are Trumps, ridden by Cheltenham winning jockey Mark McDonagh, a lb claimer.Finishing second was Agent Born, ridden by Darragh OrsquoKeefe with Peaches and Cream third.Co Meath trainer Gavin Cromwell, who also had success at Cheltenham, saddled the winner and also the third past the post.

He got his chance to DJ on his own for the first time due to a double booking.He then began to DJ regularly at the Central Park nightclub in his early s, later securing a residency in The Groovy Train at the M Club in Belfast in .Paulrsquos break into radio came in  when he became a presenter with FM in Newry, part of the Q Radio Network, later becoming a breakfast presenter and eventually operations manager.He left in  and worked freelance for three years with Downtown Radio before joining U presenting the Sunday afternoon show in .In , he took on the overnight programme from midnight until am, Monday to Thursday.Paul also was a multi-award winning wedding DJ and played regularly as the recommended DJ for the Hastings Hotel Group.OrsquoHares in Newcastle paid its condolences on social media to Paulrsquos family and friends:: lsquoDJ PK was a resident here for many years and was heavily involved in the success of Central Park and Coast nightclub entertaining generations of party goers here.rsquoAfter a service at Our Lady Of The Assumption Church in Newcastle, Paulrsquos remains left for cremation in Dardistown Crematorium in Dublin..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Washed up munitions a reminder of Murlough’s military history  ","story":"THE news of a controlled explosion on Murlough beach last Thursday might sound shocking.But it isnrsquot the first time that Army bomb disposal experts have detonated a suspected WWII mortar found in County Downrsquos sands.Such ordnance washes up relatively frequently, assumed to have escaped the Beaufort Dyke trench in the Irish Sea, where massive amounts of munitions were dumped after the war mdash including  tons of four-inch mortars.But stray munitions have also been found before in Murloughrsquos sand dunes, reflecting the arearsquos rich wartime history.In fact, Murlough Nature Reserve mdash formerly known as the Dundrum Sandhills mdash has interesting history that extends far beyond WWII.The name itself comes from the old Irish word lsquoMuirbolcrsquo, meaning lsquosea-bagrsquo , and evidence of human activity in the -acre reserve extends back to around  BC.Archaeological digs in the s unearthed multiple signs of burning, hundreds of pottery shards, worked flints and even carbonised hazelnut shells that confirm Neolithic and Bronze Age activity.Much later, Murloughrsquos dunes were important for the Normans. They were used as a commercial rabbit warren when John De Courcy arrived and built Dundrum Castle in .The lucrative trade in rabbit pelts continued for centuries afterwards. Rabbits are still common today, although the population was decimated by the myxomatosis disease in the s.The s was also when the National Trust began managing the habitat on behalf of its owners, the Hill family mdash commonly known as the Marquises of Downshire.The Hill family came to the area in the late th century but had lived in Ireland since the late s, when a young army officer named Moyses Hill, originally from Devon, was posted to Carrickfergus garrison in  to command forces sent by Elizabeth I to subdue the rebellious OrsquoNeill clan and colonise Ireland.Moyses ended up staying in Ireland and marrying the sister of a local clan chief. In , he was granted land at Cromlyn, an area which later took his surname and became known as Hillsborough. His descendants then acquired Murlough in  and began using Murlough Farm as their summer residence.They built Murlough House in , which still stands today at the end of Keel Point mdash at the northern end of the beach. While built to have a spectacular sea view, stormy weather kept breaking the windows, so trees were planted around the house in , and the woodland remains to this day.In , the th Marquis of Downshire, Arthur Hill, sold the surrounding land to the National Trust and then sold the house in . The area became Irelandrsquos first nature reserve in  and remains the most extensive dune heath in Ireland .But prior to being sold to the National Trust, Murlough House and the dunes were a hotbed of military activity ndash particularly during WWII. The house was a base for the US Armyrsquos st Armoured Division and the th Tank Destroyer Battalion.They built several firing ranges in the dunes, including, allegedly, a mortar range. Spare bombers and fighters were also hidden there as Murlough Farm had its own landing strip, called lsquo Satellite Landing Groundrsquo .Murlough beach itself was dotted with anti-aircraft and anti-invasion posts mdash whose rotting remnants are still visible today. They were dug-in when a full-scale German invasion was a threat in the early s.They were part of a counter-invasion strategy that centred on slowing or stopping the enemy at certain locations until other forces could be mustered and deployed. This involved constructing a so-called lsquocoastal crustrsquo along beaches and inland lsquostop-linesrsquo along rivers, canals and high ground.With Northern Ireland being prime invasion territory, a coastal crust was set up from Magilligan in the north-west to Newcastle in the south-east, alongside an inland stop-line along the route of the River Bann. Anti-aircraft landing posts, like those at Murlough, were important in preventing aircraft or boats from landing, but another type of defence was the centrepiece of this strategy: pillboxes.When events at Dunkirk in  sparked invasion panic, the Directorate of Fortications and Works at the War Office was created to construct defensive systems around the UKrsquos beaches. The Royal Engineers and civilian contractors erected over , pillboxes by in a matter of days ndash including on eight of Northern Irelandrsquos beaches.Such structures can still be seen at Magilligan, Portrush and Portstewart. County Down also has intact examples in Bangor, Donaghadee and on the Strangford shore between Comber and Newtownards. Beaches at Minerstown and Tyrella also had multiple pillboxes, as did Murlough. They were spaced to have interlocking arcs of fire, so invaders had little unchallenged space in which to land.One of these pillboxes is still visible in Newcastle, on the beach just below the outdoor swimming pool. The remnants of the other are still visible at the northern end of Murlough, next to the inlet that feeds Dundrum Bay. Yet all that is left are large slabs of reinforced concrete as this pillbox was supposedly destroyed in the early days of the Troubles to prevent it being used to attack the nearby Ballykinlar Army Camp.But these remains are now also under attack from erosion. They are gradually being absorbed by the sea. With this stretch of coastline losing five to ten metres of coastline a year, the remnants of the pillbox, originally built at an elevated height in the dunes, is even starting to be submerged at high tide.What was once a reflection of an indominable spirit is now an unassuming pile of rubble used only as a seat for resting walkers ndash most of whom are unaware of its history. Soon, it will be completely forgotten and the only reminder of this stretch of coastlinersquos rich military history will be the occasional washed-up ordnance.Ben Acheson spent seven years deployed to Afghanistan, including stints as Director of NATOrsquos political team and as Political Adviser to the EU Special Representative.

But with even Australia, for example, having considered jettisoning this link over the decades, it is hardly surprisingcountries that once experienced slavery and codied, racially segregated rule do so too.The Duke of Cambridge realises that local populations will not take lectures on their future status from British leaders, least of all a young royal. Yet this tour, as royal tours typically do, showed that there is still a deep affection for that same monarchy in much of the world.Longer term, it is the future of the Commonwealth of Nations that matters more than the retention of the Queenas head of state in places that might sever that arrangement regardless. The association is a reflection of the huge soft power that the UK has — its cultural reach, and the links to countries around the globe.Even states that have bruising memories of empire usually recognise the upsides of the former British presence, in terms of aspects of government such as parliamentary democracy and civil administration.It was sad to learn recently of a poll that showed,anything, a diminishing appetite in the Republic of Ireland to join the Commonwealth.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

We are awaiting confirmation of all the detainable items.”Transport Secretary Grant Shapps confirmed the news in a tweet, adding that the ship was being held following an inspection and that “safety will not be compromised”.UPDATE ⚠️ The @MCA_media have informed me tonight that they have carried out an inspection on a ship belonging to PO Ferries.As a result, the #PrideOfKent ship has now been detained.Safety will not be compromised  further checks will continue.— Rt Hon Grant Shapps MPMarch , It follows the detention of another PO vessel which was held in the Northern Ireland port of Larne on Friday due to “failures on crew familiarisation, vessel documentation and crew training”.The Rail, Maritime and Transport union said it believed the MCA acted because of “multiple safety and operational breaches”, including the wearing of breathing apparatus.The union repeated its demand that the Government seize PO’s entire fleet and take action to get them back in service with the sacked crew reinstated.General secretary Mick Lynch said: “The seizing of the Pride of Kent by the MCA this evening should be adequate evidence for the Government that the gangster capitalist outfit PO are not fit and proper to run a safe service after the jobs massacre.“It’s rare enough for the MCA to impound a ferry but PO have now had two in a week after the jobs carve up which speaks volumes about the dire state of their operation..remove“It’s now high time for these important vessels to be taken over under public control with the sacked crews reinstated as the only way to get these crucial ferry routes back running safely.”The MCA said another of the firm’s vessels, European Causeway, remains under detention in Larne.Mr Shapps wrote to Mr Hebblethwaite earlier on Monday threatening to bring a “package of measures” to Parliament to block the company from paying below minimum wage.“Through that package, I intend to block the outcome that PO Ferries has pursued, including paying workers less than the minimum wage,” he said.The measures could be unveiled on Wednesday.The minimum wage in the UK for people aged  and above is £. per hour.Mr Hebblethwaite, whose basic annual salary is £,, told MPs on March  the average pay of the agency crew is £. per hour.He will face the Net Zero, Energy and Transport Committee on Tuesday after he appeared before a Westminster committee last week. vw,vw,px, px\"Peter Hebblethwaite, Chief Executive, PO Ferries – whose basic annual salary is £, – told MPs on March  the average pay of the agency crew is £. per hour Irish Ferries began operating on the Dover to Calais route in June  in competition with PO Ferries.Irish Ferries did not immediately respond to a request for a comment on Monday.A PO Ferries spokesman said: “We fully welcome the Government’s commitment to increasing the minimum wage for all seafarers working in British waters.“From the outset, we have called for a level playing field when it comes to pay and conditions on British ferry routes.“Our announcement is not about reducing seafarer’s wages, it is to enable us to have a fully flexible crewing model that allows us to meet the demands of our customers.“The predicted savings we announced are not solely coming from the reduction in wages, but from removing job duplication and the benefits we will see from increased flexibility.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Second PO ferry detained after safety inspection, coastguard agency says article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

It is essential therefore that NI shows have the opportunity to run a full schedule this year to promote and facilitate future economic growth for agri-food businesses and I am pleased that I can support their efforts through the provision of the pound, bounce back support scheme I’ve announced today, which will allow each show to claim up to a maximum of poundk for new or increased costs. “Departmental officials will contact shows directly in the next few weeks to assist them in availing of my support scheme.” Looking to the future, Mr Poots has announced plans for an independent review of local agricultural shows, which will explore the potential for longer term support options and help shows remain sustainable in the years ahead. He added: “Although I am providing support to our local shows this year, I am of the view that Government departments and local councils should consider options for longer term support. “I am therefore announcing plans for an independent review to commence in the next month or two which will aim to explore future support options and guide future policy, in addition to identying new and innovative methods which would be utilised by local shows to help safeguard their future.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_afcfdbafbed   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dceefaadcffedafa   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1635169051553.jpg--hargey_tackles_digital_exclusion_through_provision_of_free_broadband.jpg?163516905100","title":"hargey tackles digital exclusion through provision of free broadband ","story":"Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey has announced the provision of free broadband for those facing digital exclusion as a barrier to work.

The Fund can provide a non-repayable grant of up to pound,, in a  month period, to remove barriers to employment. The Minister continued: “The success of the Adviser Discretion Fund in helping remove barriers to employment has already been seen throughout the year, particularly in the uptake of upfront childcare costs, which I made available last October. “I am delighted that we have already helped around  parents with average upfront childcare costs of approximately pound. “This additional scheme will help remove similar barriers to employment for those facing digital exclusion due to a lack of broadband service.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_acebdeaffb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_acadecdeadd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
