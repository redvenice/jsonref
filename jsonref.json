All the while, she said she continued asking her son for the time.‘So we had a minute-by-minute history of the time frame and the yelling went on from 5 after 11 until 11.25 and then it stopped,’ Wayne recalled.Wood\u0027s husband Robert Wagner, who was on board his yacht Splendour along with his wife\u0027s former co-star Christopher Walken, has always maintained that the 43-year-old star of West Side Story accidentally slipped and drowned as she tried to tie up a dinghy against the boat after a tumultuous night of heavy drinking.

South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, a close McCain friend, says he called Trump aides to intervene on the flag matter.Asked if he had missed a chance to unite the country, Trump told Bloomberg reporters: \u0027No, I don\u0027t think I did at all. I\u0027ve done everything that they requested and no, I don\u0027t think I have at all.\u0027In a week of solemn events marking McCain\u0027s passing, Trump has been and will be absent, a reflection of the animosity between the two men that lingered even after the Arizona senator\u0027s death on Saturday from brain cancer.    President Donald Trump flies Friday to North Carolina for an event and fundraiserTrump will also miss Saturday\u0027s service at the Washington National Cathedral, where former President Barack Obama, the Democrat who defeated McCain in 2008, and Republican President George W. Bush will pay tribute to McCain.Traditionally, sitting American presidents \u0027serve as a source of solace and comfort\u0027 for the country at times of loss and tragedy, said Princeton University historian Julian Zelizer.The Trump-McCain relationship left little room for that.    Vietnam War veteran John McCain died from aggressive brain cancer last Saturday aged 81          Trump refused to answer reporter\u0027s questions about McCain\u0027s death on at least four occasions during a White House briefing          Vice President Mike Pence  will speak at a Capitol ceremony honoring McCainIn 2015, not long after Trump kicked off his presidential campaign, McCain condemned his hard-line rhetoric on illegal immigration, accusing Trump of \u0027firing up the crazies.\u0027Trump hit back, saying of McCain\u0027s 5-12 years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam: \u0027He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren´t captured.\u0027 Trump received five deferments that got him out of military service.More recently, McCain accused Trump of kowtowing to Russian President Vladimir Putin at a July summit in Helsinki. It was, McCain said, \u0027one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory.\u0027Trump in turn delayed issuing any statement after McCain\u0027s death. At one point, the U.S. flag atop the White House that had been at half-staff was raised back up, then lowered again after Trump drew fire from Congress and veterans.\u0027The president\u0027s actions in the first day of (McCain\u0027s) death were so petty,\u0027 Zelizer said.More broadly, Zelizer noted that many Republicans, including some in Arizona, had grown frustrated with McCain\u0027s moderate stances on some issues, reflecting the changing nature of the Republican Party that Trump has seized upon.Despite these tensions, most leaders from both parties in coming days will show they can rise above the political fray to recognize the passing of a respected colleague.McCain was involved in planning the events around his funeral. He made it clear to family and friends that he wanted Democratic former Vice President Joe Biden, Bush and Obama to speak, but that Trump was not welcome.The public will file through the Rotunda for six hours to pay their respects to McCain by filing past his coffin.The pallbearers at Saturday\u0027s cathedral service will include Biden and liberal actor and activist Warren Beatty, alongside former Senator Phil Gramm and ex-Defense Secretary William Cohen, both Republicans.Throughout U.S. history, only 32 times have people \u0027lain in state\u0027 or \u0027lain in honor\u0027 under the soaring Capitol Rotunda, including 11 presidents and unknown soldiers from World War I to Vietnam."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/31/16/4F91154300000578-6118121-image-m-47_1535727943982.jpg","title":"US mother sold twins British couple tries hijack high school graduation","story":"    Tranda Wecker (pictured this week) hijacked her twin daughters\u0027 high school graduation 17 years after trying to sell them online          Ready for university: The twins, pictured together at graduation, want nothing to do with their birth mother after the hurt she caused them\u0027Tranda recently came up to attend the girls\u0027 high school graduation in May but they knew what she was doing,\u0027 their adoptive mother told the Mirror.\u0027She wanted that picture with them to share in their success.

But this was 1961, and things were different.U-turn on Muslim cemetery plan following outcry in Texas...Share this articleWorld War II had led to the deaths and destruction of tens of thousands of animals worldwide, and every zoo was keen to replenish its stock and continue to push the boundaries of scientific discovery. But as it happened, our plans hit a setback almost immediately.‘I am sorry,’ said Monsieur Paulin, director of Madagascar’s scientific institute, ‘but I must ask you not to catch any lemurs whatsoever. It is forbidden by law even to keep one as a pet. I ask you as a naturalist not to hinder our attempts to conserve these rare animals.’What could we do but agree?          Back in time: The two-hour flight we had just made, we had, in effect, travelled back through 50 million years of evolutionary time and were now entering one of Nature’s lumber rooms — a place where antique, outmoded forms of life that have long since disappeared from the rest of the world still survive, among them the beautiful lemur in its many guises‘Film them, by all means,’ continued M. Paulin. ‘Such records will be extremely valuable, as very few people have done so. I will give you permits to collect other animals that are in no danger of extinction, and arrange a guide and an interpreter.’ He was as good as his word.Within a few days he had provided a Land Rover, the promised permits and a young scientist named Georges Randrianasolo. His eyes sparkled when we told him our plans. Like us, he could hardly wait to get started.The gentle landscape changed dramatically the further south we drove. On either side of the road rose rank upon rank of slim, unbranched vegetable pillars 30ft high, each heavily armoured with spines.This was the didiera tree, and Georges was confident that amid the surreal foliage we would find the first of the creatures we were most eager to see: the strangely named, most monkey-like lemur, the sifaka.Standing just under 2ft tall and named after the strange sneezing noise it makes, this lovely animal is covered with silky, snowy-white fur except for a russet brown patch on its head, and a jet-black face. It is renowned as a phenomenal jumper, and carries with it an almost mystical aura.          We set out early in the morning on our hunt for sifakas (lemurs). The forests were unpleasant places in which to work, with the spines of the didiera and the thorns that grow between them catching at our clothes and tearing our fleshWe set out early in the morning on our hunt for sifakas. The forests were unpleasant places in which to work, with the spines of the didiera and the thorns that grow between them catching at our clothes and tearing our flesh.For an hour we picked our way through the dense, vicious forest. Ahead, I saw a clearing and made gratefully towards it.I was about to step into the sunshine when I saw in the clearing, standing beside a low, flowering bush, three small, white figures.They were busy plucking the petals from the bush with both hands cramming them into their mouths. I stood frozen, and for half a minute the animals continued feeding. Then Georges, coming up behind me, trod on a twig, startling them.Immediately they were off, leaping along the ground with their long hind legs together and their short arms held in front of them, for all the world like three people competing in a sack race.It was the start of a wonderful episode in our travels.Day after day we filmed these marvellous creatures.          Standing just under 2ft tall and named after the strange sneezing noise it makes, this lovely animal - a sifaka - is covered with silky, snowy-white fur except for a russet brown patch on its head, and a jet-black face. It is renowned as a phenomenal jumper, and carries with it an almost mystical auraEvery afternoon at about four o’clock a family of five came down to the village to feed on the fruits of the tamarind tree. For an hour or so they would sit munching contentedly above us before returning to the safety of the didiera trees.But one evening two of them, a pair, lingered behind. The female seated herself on a horizontal branch, swinging her legs and combing her fur with her teeth. We saw the male approach her from behind. She appeared not to notice he was there.Suddenly he sprang at her, almost knocking her from the branch, and expertly put a half-nelson on her. She rolled over, slipped out of his grip and caught his head in the elbow of her left arm. He wriggled round, wrapped his arms round her waist and squeezed her. I could have sworn she was laughing.For five minutes they tussled, but although they sometimes closed their jaws on one another, this was not a proper fight. Amazingly, they were playing.It’s common to see younger animals doing this, practising the skills they will need as an adult. But examples of full-grown animals playing for enjoyment in the wild are extremely rare. There is seldom time for recreation in the merciless world of nature.                             There could be no doubt they were pieces of a gigantic egg                        But our sifakas did not seem to have to face the problems that harass most other animals. They had no need to search for food — mangoes, tamarind, flower petals and green shoots were plentiful. Neither were they perpetually haunted by fear or the need to hide, as they have no natural enemies.Most significantly of all, they lived in families, not troops.If you watch a troop of monkeys there is a strict hierarchy. Each monkey is aware of its position, cringing to its superiors and mercilessly bullying those beneath it.But there was none of this with the sifakas.Their family life seemed to be based purely on affection. During the many hours we watched them, we never saw them squabble, and many times, as now, we saw them playing or caressing one another.It was an enchanting sight which I felt greatly privileged to have been able to witness.From the weird forests of didiera, we drove west into an environment even more parched. Often the wheels of our car were a foot deep in sand.          From the weird forests of didiera, we drove west into an environment even more parched. Often the wheels of our car were a foot deep in sand (pictured 2018)We had come to this inhospitable desert for one reason only: to search for the largest eggs in the world — those belonging to the now- extinct Aepyornis.Arab folk tales are full of references to this gigantic creature.‘It is so strong that it will seize an elephant in its talons and carry him high into the air and drop him so that he is smashed to pieces,’ wrote the 13th-century explorer Marco Polo. ‘Having so killed him, the bird swoops down on him and eats him at leisure.’The truth of the matter was eventually established only in the 19th century, when a cluster of enormous bird bones was recovered from a swamp in central Madagascar. From them it was clear the local giant had been ostrich-like and flightless.It had stood nearly 10ft tall and weighed a staggering 70 stone. It is probable these magnificent creatures have been extinct for more than 1,000 years — enormous though Madagascar is, no part of it is so little known that it could still conceal a creature the size of an Aepyornis.Yet there are still gigantic eggs to be found, and I hoped that we might discover, if not an entire one, then at least a small fragment in the sands around the dry Linta riverbed.          We had come to this inhospitable desert for one reason only: to search for the largest eggs in the world — those belonging to the now- extinct Aepyornis. Arab folk tales are full of references to this gigantic creature (pictured 2017)The sun blazed ferociously from the cloudless sky, roasting the dunes as Geoff and I began our search. Hour after hour we plodded on, the sand yielding with each step so that walking was doubly exhausting.More than half a day had elapsed before I at last found something: three small objects the size of a ten-penny piece and twice as thick. On one side they were dull, on the other pale yellow and with a distinct grain.There could be no doubt they were pieces of a gigantic egg.Despite all the difficulty and discomfort, I was ecstatic.While Geoff and I sat excitedly examining our finds, a small mop-headed boy, dusty and naked except for a necklace of blue beads and a loincloth, came towards us driving a herd of goats.I called him over and showed him our treasure.‘I look for big egg,’ I said in my halting French. ‘These small pieces no good. I look for big pieces.’          The complete egg was of astonishing size — a foot long and with a mighty circumference of 32 inches. For me, the tangible reality of the Aeporynis was as strange and exciting as any myth or folk tale could ever be (pictured 2015)He stared at me completely nonplussed. ‘Oeuf,’ I said earnestly. ‘Grand oeuf.’ But no flicker of expression passed over his impassive young face.I tried once more, waving my hands to indicate the shape and size of the object I was seeking. But it was no use. The boy looked past me, noticed his goats were straying and ran off.Back at camp, I showed the fragments to Georges with considerable pride.Although for modesty’s sake I did not put it into words, I hoped that I was able to suggest that I had been remarkably sharp-eyed to have discovered these tiny pieces in the vast desert wasteland.When I awoke the next morning, a tall, gaunt woman was standing in front of the tent staring at me through the mosquito netting. On her head she carried a large basket.I struggled out of my sleeping bag, trying to gather my wits to tackle the inevitable French conversation. But I need not have worried. The woman had no need for words. She simply took the basket from her head and poured on to the ground a cascade of egg fragments. I looked at them, flabbergasted.Not only was it clear the little herd boy had understood exactly what I’d said and spread the news, but it was equally evident that far from being sharp-eyed in finding my three fragments, I had been completely the opposite. This woman had collected at least 500 in just a few hours.          The largest lemur of all, standing 3ft tall, is the only one without a long tail. Local legend had it that if you threw a spear at it, it could catch the weapon and hurl it back at you with great force and unfailing accuracy (pictured 2017)From that point we were unable to stop the flood of shells that poured into the camp as one villager after another arrived with more and more egg fragments. By the end of the day the pile was over a foot high.It was while we were contemplating this that the herd boy reappeared carrying something wrapped in a grubby scrap of cloth. He put it down on the ground and untied the knots.Inside lay about 20 pieces, some quite tiny, but others the size of small plates, and twice as big as any we had seen.We spread out the pieces on the sand, and stared at them in awe. Were there enough to make a reasonably complete whole? It was like a jigsaw — only far more difficult and exciting. After a few minutes of trial and error I spotted two sections whose angular edges echoed one another. They fitted together, and I fastened them with adhesive tape.Then I saw another pair, and a fifth piece that fitted on to the first two. At the end of an hour we had two cups. I held one in each hand and carefully brought them together. They matched perfectly — only a few small sections were missing.The complete egg was of astonishing size — a foot long and with a mighty circumference of 32 inches. For me, the tangible reality of the Aeporynis was as strange and exciting as any myth or folk tale could ever be.As I held that glorious egg in my hand, I had no difficulty in imagining the time when the bed of the Linta river was filled with a brown, eddying flood and gigantic birds, nearly 10ft tall, waded magnificently through the swamps.Madagascar is the ancestral home of the chameleon family. It was here that these strange reptiles first evolved, and from here that they spread throughout Africa and into the continents beyond.                             We had been extraordinarily fortunate to be able to spend so much time with the beautiful and engaging sifaka                        Even today, the island still contains more different species than occur in the world outside its shores, and among them are the largest (over two feet in length) and the smallest (no more than one and a half inches), the most vividly coloured, and the most bizarre of all the many members of this varied family.Georges was emphatic that several spectacular species were abundant in the forest around the hut where we had made our camp. Perhaps they were, but they were very hard to find — not so much because of their celebrated ability to change the colour of their skin to match their surroundings, but because of their habit of remaining completely motionless among the tangled branches.After a day or so of searching, however, we became rather skilled at spotting them, and soon we had assembled a collection of over a dozen — so many, in fact, that they were outnumbering the makeshift cages we’d constructed.Not to mention the fact that it was taking us hours each day searching for enough insects to feed them all.I devised a method which I thought would neatly solve both difficulties at a stroke.Dragging an old galvanised iron bath from the hut, I set up a tall, dry, twiggy branch in the middle, on to which I tied one or two pieces of raw meat. Then I filled the tub with water.‘The two factors we have to bear in mind,’ I said explaining the cunning ingenuity of it all to Geoff, ‘are first, that chameleons live on flies and second, that they cannot swim. Put them on this branch and, as the only way of escape is through the water, they will have to stay there.‘Furthermore, the thought of escaping will not occur to them, for this is a chameleon’s paradise. The raw meat will attract hordes of flies, thereby providing a constant source of food for them and relieving us of the business of searching every morning for crickets and grasshoppers.’Geoff expressed suitable admiration, and together we took out the chameleons from their cages and put them on the branch. There they clung, goggling angrily at one another as we sat proudly to watch them explore their new amenities. One or two walked down the branch, inspected the water and retreated, exactly as I had anticipated.But then the entire group assembled at the top of the branch and began marching in a line along a stout twig that projected more than two feet beyond the bath.                             Would our luck hold, and lead us to their even more intriguing and mysterious cousins?                        One by one they leapt off the end like ers leaving the crowded high board of a swimming pool.I was astonished. Never before had I seen a chameleon show any sign of being able to jump. We fielded them one by one, but it was quite clear my elegant construction was a total failure.Nor was it any more effective in providing them with food. Not one single fly came near the raw meat, even when I covered it with honey.We put the chameleons back in their cages and set about the laborious business of finding them their evening meal. We were often watched in our endeavours in utter horror by the locals. They were appalled at our foolishness in having anything to do with the chameleons. These creatures were not only poisonous, they said, but extremely evil.To touch one was madness. Nothing would convince them otherwise.We were, however, able to turn this view to our advantage when our car was broken into during a visit to a small town in the centre of the island.Fortunately, the thieves had ignored all the cameras, films and recording apparatus and had stolen only our food and an exceedingly disreputable pair of suede shoes.But they had smashed a window to get in, so it was impossible thereafter to make the car secure.The solution was simple. We took out each evening the largest and most virulently coloured of all our chameleons and sat him on one of our camera cases in the middle of the mound of luggage that filled the back of the car.There we left him, glowering furiously and revolving his eyes. Nobody ever interfered with our car again. Time was now pressing — we had been in Madagascar several weeks without seeing the animal I was most keen to film: the so-called ‘dog-headed man’ of Madagascar, correctly known as the indri.This is the largest lemur of all, standing 3ft tall, and the only one without a long tail. Local legend had it that if you threw a spear at it, it could catch the weapon and hurl it back at you with great force and unfailing accuracy.Seeing one would be the highlight of our trip. We had been extraordinarily fortunate to be able to spend so much time with the beautiful and engaging sifakas. Would our luck hold, and lead us to their even more intriguing and mysterious cousins?Adapted from Journeys To The Other Side Of The World: Further Adventures Of A Young Naturalist by Sir David Attenborough, published by Two Roads on September 6 at £25. © David Attenborough 2018.

It looks like a rehearsal shot, because Eric isn’t wearing a tie.Ernie, as always, not only has a tie, but cufflinks, gold watch and a breast pocket handkerchief.

Above all, they never took themselves too seriously.See Eric as Sooty the bear, with puppeteer Harry Corbett, and the real Sooty perched on his shoulder. All he has to do is assume an air of hurt dignity, and it’s hilarious — Harry and Ern are both sporting broad grins. That costume must have been hot, though: Eric’s face is glistening with sweat. Anyone can see what fun they’re having. It’s one of the reasons celebrity guests clamoured to be on their shows.In the Cossack hats, there’s American singer Diane Solomon, while Australian Keith Michell is the actor joining the duo for a Foreign Legion adventure in the Sahara sands, complete with deckchair and inflatable duck.Of all these glorious images, it’s the one of them sunbathing in shorts that sums them up best. For a start, you know Ern has been subjected to constant teasing about his ‘short, fat, hairy legs’.Then there’s the hoops in the hems of Eric’s shorts, designed for waggling. The finishing touch is his footwear: office shoes polished to a high shine, and long socks hauled high by his sock suspenders.Who wears sock suspenders these days? Come to that, who else could make you laugh out loud, with nothing more than their bare knees?As Eric would say, there’s no answer to that.

Denise van Outen is back in Chicago 17 years...Share this articleBut that was then. Fast forward to this week, and many ordinary Britons would regard Damelin as the polar opposite of a messiah.To blame is the collapse of his most notorious creation, the aforementioned Wonga. It fell into administration on Thursday, paying the ultimate price for toxic business practices that saw it become a byword for greed, exploitation and spivvery on his watch.The once-booming credit firm lost more than £140 million in its last two financial years, thanks to a surge in compensation claims from tens of thousands of disgruntled former customers.Many were mis-sold loans at extortionate interest rates when Damelin was boss.Wonga had, in truth, been on the ropes since 2014, when it was forced by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to write off a staggering £220 million of loans issued to 330,000 often-vulnerable borrowers ‘without taking adequate steps to assess customers’ ability to meet repayments’.          Wonga had, in truth, been on the ropes since 2014, when it was forced by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to write off a staggering £220 million of loans issued to 330,000 often-vulnerable borrowers ‘without taking adequate steps to assess customers’ ability to meet repayments’It then emerged that Damelin’s reign had also seen the firm harass thousands of customers who fell behind with loan repayments by sending them highly-threatening letters from fake law firms.Having been found to have engaged in ‘thuggish’ behaviour by the FCA — one recipient of the sinister scam letters was a woman in hospital recovering from a miscarriage — Wonga was told to pay £2.6 million in compensation.For a time, the episode was the subject of a police investigation, though it was decided there was insufficient evidence to take things further. They weren’t the only ugly crises that jollified Damelin’s reign. Several of Wonga’s TV adverts were banned, for misleading customers, while children as young as 12 were mistakenly sent letters offering loans.Wonga employees set up fake Twitter accounts calling a female MP who campaigned against the firm mentally unstable, and edited the firm’s Wikipedia page to remove references to its various sharp practices. Wonga was also forced to apologise for ‘unintentional system errors’ which saw thousands of loan balances miscalculated.Four years of fallout from these and other scandals, combined with the effect of new laws designed to protect consumers, have now effectively driven the firm out of business. As of this week, it’s no longer issuing new loans.          Wonga at one time issued payday loans at an extortionate 5,853 per cent APRThough few will mourn its passing, hundreds of employees, not to mention investors — who ploughed an extra £10 million of emergency cash into Wonga last month — face an uncertain future.More scandalously, so are tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of Britons exploited by Damelin’s morally bankrupt former company over the 12 years it existed.Compensation claims against the firm are now rising exponentially. It received 20,000 last year, according to the FCA, with 2,347 being escalated to the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) in the six months to last December. That’s a year-on-year increase of 250 per cent.Many come from vulnerable people given unaffordable loans, which ought never to have been offered to them, or hit with extortionate late payment charges. Often, their lives were seriously damaged as a result.At present, 53 per cent of FOS complaints against Wonga are being resolved in favour of consumers (the industry average is 34 per cent) with the Ombudsman finding against the company in 178 of the 219 most serious claims which went to adjudication in the past year.In most of these cases, the firm is being instructed to pay compensation. This is one of the main reasons its coffers are now empty. Now it’s in administration, successful claimants will be forced to join a long queue of creditors.          Founded in 2006 by Damelin, a former investment banker, and software developer Jonty Hurwitz (who left in 2013), the company styled itself as a trendy tech start-up, targeting web-savvy borrowers neglected by traditional banksIn theory, these exploited citizens could end up receiving pennies for every pound they are rightly owed. And should Wonga fall into bankruptcy, it would cease to be regulated, making it impossible for new compensation claims to be made against it.Hundreds of thousands of other innocent victims of the company’s sharp practices (many regard mis-sold payday loans as the next PPI, a scandal costing financial institutions £32 billion so far) would therefore be left out of pocket.All told, it is a disgraceful state of affairs. But, as so often, in the morally vacuous world of 21st-century cowboy capitalism, the man bearing much of the responsibility appears to have simultaneously banked a tidy profit.Not only did Damelin earn millions from his salary — in his final year alone, his package was some £970,000 including £700,000 for ‘loss of office’ — he also managed to extract a whopping £17 million by selling a portion of his stake as his reign unravelled.The cash was raised in November 2013, shortly after Damelin quit as chief executive (he stayed on as chairman for several months afterwards), when he sold 4.5 million shares in the company for £3.75 each. Damelin’s stock was held via a corporate entity based in the tax haven of the British Virgin Islands.For reasons never properly explained, it was purchased by a trust set up by Wonga to pay bonuses to company employees. The shares, of course, will now be virtually worthless.          It rented offices next to Regent’s Park, in a period house owned by the Queen, offering employees what one reporter described as ‘glass-walled meeting rooms, luxury Nespresso coffee machines and even sessions in callisthenics, a workout with no gym gear’Unsurprisingly, Damelin has since been reluctant to discuss his £17 million tax-efficient payday, just as he’s never properly explained — let alone apologised for — his running of the firm and its treatment of many customers.And thus far, there’s been no expression of contrition, from him regarding Wonga’s collapse.It wasn’t always so: in the past he was only too keen to wax lyrical about the firm’s supposed success.Founded in 2006 by Damelin, a former investment banker, and software developer Jonty Hurwitz (who left in 2013), the company styled itself as a trendy tech start-up, targeting web-savvy borrowers neglected by traditional banks.It rented offices next to Regent’s Park, in a period house owned by the Queen, offering employees what one reporter described as ‘glass-walled meeting rooms, luxury Nespresso coffee machines and even sessions in callisthenics, a workout with no gym gear’.Customers were targeted by highly-aggressive ad campaigns, offering fast cash, via a number of extremely accessible mediums, including an iPhone app which was at one point being downloaded by 1,000 people a day.Funds — typically a few hundred pounds — would then usually be wired to their bank accounts within 15 minutes, day or night.In interviews, Damelin claimed he was an ‘ethical disruptor’ who was democratising the consumer credit market by providing cash to switched-on people who received an unexpected bill, or who needed to pay at short notice for minor luxuries such as a weekend away, or tickets to Glastonbury.He said the firm was ‘not a job but a mission’ and branded customers the ‘Facebook generation’ who used loans as a sensible short-term fix to avoid unauthorised bank overdraft charges.Wonga’s ‘secret sauce’, he added, was software which allowed it to analyse 6,000-8,000 ‘data points’ about a prospective client in a matter of minutes before deciding whether to offer them a loan. ‘This is not about people being desperate,’ he insisted, saying he had ‘very few customers on benefits’.The pitch seemed to work. In 2009, Wonga issued 100,000 loans. By 2011, the figure had risen to 2.5 million with profits of £48.5 million on revenues of £185 million. The following year, Damelin was named ‘entrepreneur of the year’ by the Left-wing Guardian newspaper.Soon, Wonga began to push into South Africa, Poland, Spain and Canada. It talked grandly of being the next Amazon or Google-style tech giant, and told some of its 500 employees the firm could eventually be valued at £15 billion, making Damelin’s stake worth some £1.17 billion. A stock market flotation was widely mooted.At the same time, Wonga launched ubiquitous TV adverts featuring a range of cuddly OAP puppets: Betty, Earl and Joyce.Yet behind the scenes, things weren’t so cuddly. For the price customers paid for this convenience was, of course, sky-high interest rates.At a time when official rates were 0.5 per cent, Wonga’s clients were taking out short-term loans (the usual terms were up to 60 days) at rates that, on an annual basis, were equivalent to between 4,217 and 5,853 per cent.If they missed payment deadlines, further charges were exorbitant — and Wonga’s technology allowed it to suck cash directly from their bank accounts.Soon, Wonga was the subject of heated controversy. The Archbishop of Canterbury branded it ‘morally wrong’. Trade union Unite accused it of ‘vulture capitalism’, and MPs said it was guilty of ‘legal loan sharking’.Newcastle United fans were outraged when a sponsorship deal was signed for the Wonga logo to be worn on club strips.Critics accused Damelin’s firm of targeting the poorest in society with predatory interest rates, and then sending threatening letters and hitting them with erroneous charges when, inevitably, they were unable to pay up.Damelin vigorously denied his firm was responsible for exploitative lending and hired swanky PR advisers for meetings with numerous MPs. But a series of scandals began to suggest otherwise.In late 2012, Wonga was forced to apologise for claiming in marketing material that its loans ‘do wonders’ for credit ratings. In fact, the presence of a payday loan on a customer’s file could convince a bank to refuse to offer credit.It also removed a page of its website suggesting that its products might provide an alternative for student loans (an unlikely claim given the student loan rate was at the time around 1.5 per cent).Shortly afterwards, a Wonga employee was found to have set up multiple Twitter accounts to label Labour MP Stella Creasy — who was then campaigning against Wonga — as ‘crazy’, ‘nuts’ and a ‘self-serving egomaniac’.Then it emerged that computers in the firm’s offices were being used to delete references to ‘usury’ (the practice of lending money at unreasonably high interest rates) and the Newcastle United controversy from its Wikipedia page.In 2013, the firm was found to have written to children as young as 12 to offer them loans, saying ‘next time you want a small amount of cash, perhaps there’s an alternative’. Wonga said the letters had been issued in error.Then, in April 2014, an advert featuring the Wonga puppets discussing a loan and arguing that sky-high annual interest rates were ‘irrelevant’, because most loans were short-term, was banned.The FCA began looking at Wonga and quickly discovered a major scandal — between 2008 and 2010 the firm had sent clients who fell behind with repayments letters from a pair of non-existent law firms, ‘Chainey, D’Amato \u0026amp Shannon’ and ‘Barker and Lowe Legal Recoveries’.These fake missives threatened ‘adverse consequences’ if cash was not forthcoming — and Wonga had shamelessly decided to bill customers £9-a-pop for sending them!The Law Society and MPs promptly demanded a criminal investigation (it’s an offence to impersonate a solicitor), but police eventually concluded that the case lacked ‘sufficient evidence’.Wonga was, however, forced to repay customers whom the sham lawyers had hoodwinked into handing over £400,000 — albeit at eight per cent interest, rather than its own preferred figure of 5,853.Then came the FCA’s discovery that Damelin’s firm was extending huge numbers of loans to swathes of people who should never have received them.The firm was instructed to write off a whopping £220 million to 330,000 such clients. Another 45,000 were let off interest and charges.Around the same time, Damelin orced wife Julie Blane, the mother of his three children. Then he departed Wonga, taking his £17 million with him and leaving the company with a legacy that would eventually cripple it.His Twitter profile, via which he passes occasional comment on world events, now makes no reference to his time at the notorious company, choosing instead to highlight his involvement with trendy start-ups such as Purple Bricks, an online estate agent.It’s possible recent events have proved a distraction: records reveal that in June 2016 Damelin was taken to County Court for failing to pay a £1,635 bill.The sum was eventually stumped up five months later. And unlike so many of his old firm’s customers, who seem increasingly likely to be left out of pocket, he probably didn’t need to take out a crippling payday loan in order to afford it. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/31/13/4F8F3EF400000578-0-image-m-29_1535718355147.jpg","title":"Britain adopt European plans scrap daylight savings time","story":"    Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the Commission, said millions ‘believe that in future, summer time should be year-round, and that’s what will happen’In the public consultation, 84 per cent of 4.6million respondents called for ending the practice.Last night, British campaigners endorsed the Commission’s decision to put the proposals forward to the European Parliament.The Commission’s proposal will require support from the 28 national governments and MEPs to become law.In the EU, clocks switch between winter and summer under daylight-saving time.A European Parliament resolution says it is ‘crucial to maintain a unified EU time regime’, although the Commission has not yet drafted details of the change.Raab insists a Brexit deal is \u0027within our reach\u0027 after new...Joy for Alfie Evans\u0027 parents as they give birth to a little...Share this articleIn a consultation paper it said one option would be to let each member state decide whether to go for permanent summer or winter time.

We would welcome any change that helps people remain safe and active.’However, critics pointed out it could lead to Northern Ireland effectively being on a different time zone and ahead of the rest of the UK by an hour during winter months.The proposed directive would come into force after Brexit and, under current EU plans for Northern Ireland to continue operating under single market rules, Belfast would not be on the same time as London in winter.By far the biggest survey response came from Germany and Austria, where 3.79 per cent and 2.94 per cent of their populations respectively responded.The UK’s response was the lowest – 0.02 per cent. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/30/13/4F8613A100000578-0-image-m-48_1535631487396.jpg","title":"Private school pupils nearly five times grades new GCSEs winning formula","story":"    Pupils at private schools are more likely to achieve top grades when taking GCSE exams new research has shownEd Elliott, headteacher at The Perse School, a fee-paying school in Cambridge, said: ‘There is no single ingredient for a grade 9, but historically independent schools have developed a winning formula that stretches all pupils and allows the brightest to achieve the best.‘This includes highly-qualified staff teaching in ways that maximise each child’s achievement, extra-curricular and character education, a culture of high aspirations and positive peer groups in which it is cool to work hard and succeed.’Students and parents blast college which scraps A-level...\u0027An 8 is a midway point between 9 and 7\u0027: Conservative MP...State headteachers expel thousands of troubled GCSE students...\u0027My grades weren\u0027t as bad as that CV!\u0027: Teenager, 16, whose...Share this articleUnder the biggest shake-up of exams in a generation, GCSEs in England have been toughened up and a new 9-1 grading system has been introduced, replacing A*-G grades.

It belongs to Andrei Goncharenko, a manager at a subsidiary of the Russian gas giant Gazprom, who bought a string of properties in the capital between 2011 and 2014.          At the top of this modernist block, built as a joint venture between its developers, the Candy Brothers, and a firm belonging to Qatar’s former prime minister, is a penthouse. In 2010, it sold for £140 million — making it at the time the most expensive flat in the world          The development is owned offshore, beyond the reach of Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs or other British authorities, as are most of the flats within. It is hard to say exactly how much living here would cost or who the inhabitants areGoncharenko’s temptingly empty mansion was just one of 86 properties on Eaton Square alone that is held via the kind of anonymous financial constructs that prevent anyone, including the taxman, from finding out who the true owners are.Any one of these properties could be owned by a crook, but it’s impossible to say which ones. One apartment stretches across a single floor of two adjoining buildings, and cost £13m: it is owned by Cane Garden Services Ltd, a British Virgin Islands company that is registered in London at a betting shop on the Caledonian Road — a part of North London where you’d be more likely to find takeaways.Is this a red flag? Perhaps, or perhaps not. When you start looking for red flags, you see them everywhere.Two houses, Nos. 85 and 102, are both owned by companies registered in Hong Kong.

Or is this a double bluff?Faceless companies based in the British Virgin Islands in the Caribbean own some 30 of these properties. Thirteen more are in Guernsey, 16 in Jersey. Others are in Panama, Liechtenstein, the Isle of Man, Delaware, the Cayman Islands, Liberia, the Seychelles, Mauritius and St Vincent and the Grenadines. Goncharenko himself preferred Gibraltar as home for his company MCA Shipping.And Eaton Square is just one example. Just as many properties in the adjoining streets are owned offshore, all intermeshed in a great web of confusion and deceit that extends as far as Britain does and then much further. The rich businessmen, corrupt politicians, larcenous public officials and drug traffickers hiding in the web are able to pick and choose what laws they obey.          Across central and west London, our guides point out properties owned by ex-Soviet oligarchs, the scions of Middle Eastern political dynasties, Nigerian regional governors and all the other people who are hiding fortunesBritish law requires people to publicly declare their company ownership. The law in Mauritius does not. Those who can afford to base their companies offshore are granted a privacy that is denied to everyone else.The rich have set up a new global nation, an invisible country that I call Moneyland. It has no geographical borders, and its financial regulations are as flexible as smoke.It exists solely to enable the wealthy and corrupt to hide money and avoid taxes. By some estimates, a fifth of all the world’s cash is currently secreted in Moneyland, where governments cannot see it, let alone levy taxes on it.Borders are for the little people. Moneyland is a place where passports of many nations are for sale. And yet British laws can be made to apply, when convenient: our libel laws can be invoked to silence reporters, for example. In Moneyland, you really can pick and choose the rules.          The offshore model is too lucrative to be ignored. Any autonomous island, such as Jersey in the Channel Islands, can take advantage of its natural offshore status to alter its laws and attract the Moneyland wealthThe offshore model is too lucrative to be ignored. Any autonomous island, such as Jersey in the Channel Islands, can take advantage of its natural offshore status to alter its laws and attract the Moneyland wealth.Jersey, now a financial centre in its own right, began helping Britons to hide their money in the Sixties. Its speciality is the trust, a tool that allowed families to pass down property through the generations without paying tax on it.You might live in a Mayfair penthouse, for example, worth millions –— but if it was owned by a trust based in Jersey, with a legal arrangement to pass it to your grandchildren on your death, you could sidestep death duties.Jersey is a very wealthy community, thanks to the offshore business. Not everywhere fares so well. The Caribbean island of Nevis, where there is no corporate tax levied on companies registered there, is the legal base of 18,000 companies.Far fewer people actually live on the island — and many of those who do earn subsistence wages as cooks and cleaners for those operating the international businesses.Billions of dollars from Russia alone have been funnelled through Nevis. Who controlled them, and who profits, cannot be said: the island has a strict policy of secrecy around all business matters. All questions are met with a wall of silence. Moneyland is a recent invention. Once upon a time, if a corrupt official stole millions, there wasn’t much he could do with it.He could buy himself a nice car or build himself a new house, or give it to friends and relatives, but his appetites were limited by the fact that the local market could not absorb endless sums of embezzled money. The banknotes would just pile up in his house until they were eaten by mice.Two things changed the economics of illegal cash: the arrival of offshore finance, and shell companies. Some people call shell companies ‘getaway cars for dodgy money’ but, when combined with electronic financial systems, they are more like magical teleporter boxes: stash your stolen funds in a shell company, press a button and it is spirited away out of your country to any destination you choose.The best way to think of a shell company is like a bag for dog’s mess. The embezzled money or untaxed income is the dirty stuff that no one wants to touch.Once it’s inside a bag, it’s easier to handle. Pop that bag into another bag, and slip that bag inside another, and now nobody can even tell that the mess in the middle ever existed.Shell companies are just empty bags. It’s almost impossible to tell who owns them, since they’re typically set up in one country — for example, the Bahamas — and then wrapped in another bag or company, set up somewhere else entirely — for instance, the Isle of Man. Repeat this process until not even an army of forensic accountants could unwrap all the bags and find the dirty money.That’s the sleight of hand that makes Moneyland so impenetrable to tax collectors and banking regulators. Because it doesn’t exist on any map, no government can declare war on Moneyland and send in an army, implement sanctions or despatch diplomats for talks. But there are physical doorways into Moneyland, like rabbitholes, if you know where to look.One of these is No. 29 Harley Street, on the tree-lined road running north from Oxford Street, the home of private healthcare.No. 29 is a stone-fronted terrace house, barely five minutes walk from the Royal Society of Medicine, with a dark-stained wooden front door. As of April 2016, it was the legal address of 2,159 shell companies.One, Blythe (Europe) Ltd, was registered on Harley Street but owned by P\u0026ampA Corporate Services Trust Reg, of Vaduz, Liechtenstein — a central European micro-principality which has mysteriously survived into the modern age, and which does not reveal who owns its companies.Blythe owned an Austrian company, which owned a Ukrainian company called Tantalit, and that owned a five-storey luxury log-built palace outside Kiev called Mezhyhirya. In 2014 it was seized by Ukrainian rebels, who overthrew the country’s deeply corrupt president, Viktor Yanukovich.At a time when the economy of Ukraine was stagnant and its people were destitute, President Yanukovich had amassed a fortune of hundreds of millions of dollars. His obscene wealth was no secret, but when rebels burst into the palace grounds they were staggered by what they discovered.An ostrich collection inhabited a private zoo, amid water gardens, a golf course, a nouveau-Grecian temple, a marble horse and an enclosure for shooting wild boar. Inside the cabin were waterfalls, fountains and statues. It was a cathedral of kitsch — which also featured an oriental temple carved from elephants’ tusks, a Picasso vase, antique rifles and swords, corridors lined with portraits of the president, and a flayed crocodile pinned to a wall.All this, remember, was owned not by Yanukovich but by Blythe (Europe) Ltd, which was to be found in the highly respectable confines of No. 29 Harley Street. It’s like discovering that the New Jersey mob was operating out of a Quaker meeting house.The appeal of No. 29 to a greed-drunk thug like Yanukovich is obvious: it gave a respectable gloss to what was essentially an act of identity fraud.Of course Blythe had no physical presence in Harley Street — like the 2,158 other companies registered there, it had no need of filing cabinets or conference rooms. They just needed the address, a sort of posh postbox. The real tenant, since 2001, has been a company called Formations House: its role is to create new companies. A standard limited company costs just £95.According to the website of Formations House, more than 10 million companies have been conjured into existence at the address in the past 16 years. For a monthly fee, these businesses can pretend that No. 29 Harley Street is their physical home. Receptionists will answer the phone in any company’s name, and forward mail, thus conferring glamour and respectability.It isn’t only money that can be laundered. Reputations can be cleaned up in Moneyland too. There is an established pathway for rich foreigners to enhance their respectability, by using the UK’s libel laws to their advantage.They hire a PR agency to put them in touch with useful parliamentarians, either MPs or lords, who agree to act as patrons of the billionaire’s charitable foundation. This generous institution launches amid much razzamatazz in London, promising to educate children or promote sport for the disabled.The billionaire hosts conferences with minor royals and former politicians among the speakers. He invites ministers for working holidays aboard his yacht. Now he has a media profile and a reputation as a philanthropist to protect. If any journalist, anywhere in the world, makes hints or accusations about the shady sources of his billions, he can sue for defamation — in the British courts.The claims don’t even have to appear in British publications: it’s enough that the billionaire’s lawyers can prove that, because of the internet, the allegations spread to the UK. Libel cases in this country can end in multi-million pound settlements — enough to bankrupt just about any journalist.London has been at the heart of Moneyland since the beginning. After World War II, Allied economists drew up worldwide financial safeguards, such as the International Monetary Fund, to prevent dictators from manipulating the money supply and stoking wars by ruining their neighbours.To prevent speculators from trying to attack this system of fixed currencies, cross-border money flow was severely constrained. That was why, as recently as the late Seventies, strict limits were imposed on how much cash British tourists could take when holidaying abroad. The system started to come apart at the seams in the Sixties, with the invention by bankers of so called ‘eurobonds’ — pieces of paper that represented cash held in Swiss banks and other hidden places.When the bonds reached their maturity date, they paid out with interest, to whoever was holding them. There was no signature required, no log-book, no deed of ownership, and because they stemmed from offshore funds — beyond the British and every other major government’s reach — they attracted no tax.Eurobonds were developed by banker Siegmund Warburg, and the bond issue was led by one of his most brilliant fixers, a Scottish war hero-turned-journalist turned banker called Ian Fraser.To avoid paying British taxes on the bonds, Fraser formally issued them at Schiphol airport in the Netherlands and arranged for interest to be paid in Luxembourg where it attracted negligibletax. Despite these contortions, he persuaded the London Stock Exchange to list the bonds.Bingo: a highly convenient bond that paid good interest, attracted no tax and could be turned into cash anywhere in the world. Unsurprisingly, eurobonds were very attractive to military dictators in Africa and South America, looking for some means of stashing away loot quickly. This was a lot more practical than a mansion full of banknotes.But warlords and corrupt politicians made up only 20 per cent of the investors: four-fifths of eurobonds were bought by ordinary, law-abiding people, wealthy upper-middle class Europeans who disliked giving so much of their hard-earned salaries to the national treasury — ‘Belgian dentists’, in banking parlance.This is the tip of Moneyland’s most powerful secret. It does not exist only for the organised criminals, the drug dealers and industrial-scale embezzlers.Anyone with cash to hide from the government can take advantage of its systems, and that means Moneyland is protected by the complicity of huge numbers of wealthy people. Just because most of Moneyland’s wealth does not stem directly from corruption and crime, that doesn’t make it harmless. The damage goes far deeper than Belgian dentists avoiding tax.When such practices become more accepted among certain wealthy groups, the attitude spread downwards, until it affected much more of society. That’s why Moneyland brings double standards — and sometimes corruption — right to our doorstep.We cannot ignore it, yet there’s a prevalent attitude in the UK that, as long as this dirty money is flowing into our economy and not out, we can afford to turn a blind eye. Britain is a friendly place for Moneylanders: there’s a reason why so many Russian oligarchs have homes in London, and it’s not the weather.But violence and lawlessness is only the push of a button on a bank’s computer screen away from here now.The misery in distant countries will become our misery, too, if we don’t act to stop it.Adapted from Moneyland: Why Thieves And Crooks Now Rule The World And How To Take It Back by Oliver Bullough, published by Profile on September 6 at £20. © Oliver Bullough 2018. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/01/01/4F954C1900000578-6120669-Earl_Griffith-a-70_1535763228134.jpg","title":"EXTRAORDINARY LIVES child star friend Ken Dodd","story":"    Joan Laurie was a star of the stage and screen who was good friends with the late the late Sir Ken Dodd The stage manager took a dim view of it, but Joan had the showbiz bug. By the age of nine, she was appearing in sketches and song-and-dance numbers.During the war, the family toured the country entertaining the troops, sometimes to packed houses, sometimes less so. Joan told me the smallest audience they played to was two, when they were taken to a lighthouse and performed to the lighthouse keeper and his assistant!After the war, the family toured variety theatres for years billed as Gladys Morgan and Company — the company being Gladys’s husband Frank, Joan and, eventually, Joan’s husband Bert Hollman.In 1961, the family appeared with their friend, singer Frankie Vaughan, for a season at the London Palladium. They headlined at Butlin’s for three years and toured South Africa.Joan later appeared in cabaret at the Dorchester Hotel in Mayfair in variety in Scotland and toured Australia with The Black \u0026amp White Minstrel Show as principal comedienne.I first met Joan in 2001 when, as the editor of a music hall magazine, I was researching an article on her mother. We became good friends because, quite simply, she was a joy to be around — a tiny lady, but big on the glamour and laughs. It was a shame she never achieved the fame her mother did, because in some ways she was more talented. But she never wanted to be a big star.In 1958, the family moved to Worthing and struck up an unlikely friendship with playwright Harold Pinter. He’d just bought a property in the town. Gladys and Joan met him in the street, and he invited them to his house-warming party.In the late Seventies and Eighties, Joan put her career on hold as she nursed first Gladys, who died in 1983, and then husband Bert, who died in 1988. #]Joan was now alone and wondering what to do with her life. It was the late Sir Ken Dodd who came to her rescue, arranging for her to appear in panto in Stockport.Soon Joan was working full pelt again. I always laugh when I think of her last show, in cabaret, before she retired in 2001. The owner of the venue in Eastbourne had run out of money, so instead of payment Joan took home the chandeliers.She remained independent, living in the family flat in Worthing until last summer when two falls resulted in a long stay in hospital and finally a short stay in a nursing home.She was always immensely proud of her mother, so it was a highlight of her life when, in 2012, aged 88, she unveiled a blue plaque to Gladys at the flat in Worthing. Her friend, the comedian Roy Hudd, came along on the day.When Joan was asked by a BBC reporter what her mother would make of the plaque if she were still around, she replied: ‘She’d sell the flat and move opposite, so she could look at the plaque every day!’Joan never got her own blue plaque, or perhaps the recognition she deserved, but she was a true star until the end.Her funeral is on Wednesday at Worthing Crematorium, and we are going to play a duet of We’ll Meet Again recorded by Joan and her mum. It will be lovely to hear them singing together one last time.Joan Laurie, born January 26, 1924, died August 16, 2018 aged 94.  Champion soap seller charmed Miss World My father Earl by Gareth GriffithMy Dad didn’t talk about his job much, but one day when I was 12 or 13 he came home and said, quite matter-of-factly: ‘I was out with Miss World today. She’s a nice girl.’Dad worked for Lever Brothers, the famous ‘Sunlight’ soap manufacturers who sponsored Miss World at the time, and he’d been charged with taking her on a promotional tour around all the department stores in Leeds and Manchester. You can imagine how impressed I was.Dad was a legend among soap salesmen, and rose to become Lever Brothers’ national sales manager. He was quite modest about it, but once he told us how much soap he’d sold that day: ‘Loaded on to lorries, it would stretch into town,’ he said. He was talking miles!            Earl Griffith, born in Buckley in North Wales and was a legend among soap salesmen Dad was born in Buckley in North Wales in 1930 and his father worked in the Birkenhead shipyards. When, on his deathbed, he apologised to Dad for his ‘poor’ childhood, Dad objected — to him, there’d been nothing poor about it.His mother kept a box of ‘treasures’ recording his successes, so all the evidence is there head boy, distinctions in all his exams, and Grade 8 on the piano.There is a glowing reference from his headmaster when he left school, and cuttings from the Liverpool Echo detailing his days playing for Tranmere Rovers. Dad went on to do his national service as a PT instructor with the RAF, and would hitch lifts in the back of Lancaster bombers to get home on leave.Dad was multi-talented: we always joked that he could control a football as well as Wayne Rooney, play the piano like Liberace, and sold more soap in a lifetime than any man living or dead.He was also skilled with his hands, creating magical presents for us — a garage for me, a dolls’ house for my three sisters.Even so, I’m not sure we appreciated his talents as we grew up. He used to come in and switch off the TV and start banging away on the piano. We just thought everyone played as well as that.Later in life, when he’d made a bob or two, he bought himself a Steinway Grand.There was a fair bit of musical talent in the extended family. One of the photographs in the family album is of me at my Auntie Marjorie’s wedding, standing in front of a man who was introduced to me as ‘your Uncle John’. I was told that ‘he’s in a group and they made a record’.We laugh about it now, because that was John Lennon. His first wife Cynthia was Auntie Marjorie’s sister-in-law.My mother Gwyneth idolised my Dad. ‘He’s been a good provider and he’s always been faithful,’ she’d say, forgiving even the time he returned from a sales trip, gave her a box of Black Magic, then disappeared for a game of snooker with his mate George.Dad always insisted all four of his children were ‘mistakes . . . but the best mistakes he’d ever made’.He gave us the greatest start in life — not by handing out money, but through his support and encouragement.Dad was always dressed immaculately. I never heard him swear, never saw him the worse for drink. He was a true gentleman and a one-off.Earl Griffith, born June 30, 1930, died July 7, 2016, aged 86.  Sun-kissed East Ender fell for me at first sight My husband Alan by Maureen BlakeWe met in January 1961 at the Ilford Palais. Alan’s tan and sun-bleached hair — the result of eight months in Cyprus with the RAF — stood out among the winter pallor of the Essex boys.Of course I accepted his offer of an escort home. It was a bitterly cold evening, and as we waited at the bus stop Alan offered me his overcoat. So began our story — a family life that blossomed under the warmth and security of his all-encompassing coat.We both knew instantly that this was special. We had only five days before he had to return to Cyprus, but even in that time we were talking of engagement and marriage. On the last evening we lingered outside my front door until he finally kissed my hand and said: ‘I’ve got to go now, but I’ll be back in August.’          Maureen and Alan met in 1961 at the Ilford Palais were talking of marriage within five days withing meeting each other When he returned, we were engaged within eight weeks, and saving for the deposit for the house we lived in for 40 years in Hullbridge. We married in May 1963.Alan was a kind man of great integrity. Born in East London, he was the seventh of nine children and he knew tragedy. He lost his mother, to whom he was devoted, when he was 17. I always felt that when we met, four years later, he transferred that love and devotion to me, then to our two sons.          Talent: Joan Laurie (pictured right) with Gladys Morgan and her mother\u0027s troupe  Very much a family man, Alan worked long hours in insurance, then in stockbroking, to give us a good and secure life.We went on to have five grandchildren, and he was immensely proud of them all. In his final year, I remember him saying to me: ‘Maureen, if we wrote a list of everything we wanted from our sons, we couldn’t add anything to it, could we?’Our retirement was spent in Norfolk. It wasn’t always idyllic. In 2008, he battled illness and was the victor. Then he nursed me with great patience through my own health problems. But early in 2017 he was diagnosed with cancer for a second time, and it couldn’t be beaten.His last hours were peaceful. Towards the end he took my hand and kissed it and said — just as he had all those years before — ‘I have to go now’. We both knew this time he wouldn’t be back in August.Alan David Blake, born March 14, 1939, died January 6, 2018, aged 78.  Just three years together, but the happiest of our lives My husband Paul by Veronica GibbyPaul came into my life just five years ago. I’d never met a man like him before and know I never will again.We met through a friendship club that puts people in touch with each other.I was 74, living with MS and just been through a second cancer scare (I’d previously had a double mastectomy). In 2013, I’d emerged from a turbulent 48-year marriage. None of this put him off.          Veronica met Paul five years ago and married. But Sadly, six weeks after the wedding, Paul had a severe stroke and was paralysed down his right sideThe two of us (pictured) arranged to meet for the first time at Harlow station in Essex and he gave me such a big bear hug I knew I wanted to spend the rest of my life with him. We married on my birthday, April 24, 2014.He treated me like a princess, saying: ‘I don’t see your sticks and wheelchair — I just see a beautiful caring lady.’Everyone loved Paul — my children, nine grandchildren and seven great grandchildren. They said it was a precious second chance at happiness. He’d been married, to Jean for 28 years, before her death in 2008.Paul was born in Pembroke Dock, South Wales. He joined the Navy at 17 and spent the next decade sailing the world. A telecommunications specialist, he later worked on oil rigs in Bahrain and for a construction company in London.But he never forgot his beloved Wales. He became events organiser at the London Welsh Rugby Club as well as running five London Marathons and 40 half marathons to raise money for children’s charities.Sadly, six weeks after our wedding, Paul had a severe stroke and was paralysed down his right side. He couldn’t walk and lost some of his speech. Unbeaten, he launched himself into his physiotherapy, saying: ‘I’m doing this for Veronica!’We’d always thought it would be him looking after me, not the other way round. But I helped him with his speech therapy and we joined the ‘Stroke Club’ in Haverfordwest and never looked back.They loved him there. He’d tell his silly jokes, compile quizzes and when the Stroke Association’s ‘Step out for Stroke’ mile walks started, he was the first to sign up. When he finished his last, at Pembroke Castle in June 2017, we dared to start planning our future — a cruise, weekends away, even a trip to Australia.But in July last year, Paul started getting terrible stomach pains and was diagnosed with cancer of the colon.The world has lost a great man with a golden heart and I’ve lost the love of my life. We had just three-and-a-half years as husband and wife, but they were the happiest years of my life.Paul John Gibby, born July 2, 1946, and died October 14, 2017, aged 71.  Is there someone who’s died recently whose life you would like to celebrate?Email: lives@dailymail.co.uk or write to: Extraordinary Lives, Daily Mail, 2 Derry Street, London W8 5TT"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/01/01/4F95244600000578-0-image-a-17_1535762849151.jpg","title":"Bubble Absolutely Fabulous ditches father children married star","story":"    Actress of stage and screen Jane Horrocks hits the west end of London with fellow actor Danny WebbIn a further plot twist, Webb, who has appeared in TV\u0027s Sherlock, Poirot and Endeavour, is married to casting director Leila Bertrand, with whom he has two grown-up daughters.Horrocks is said to have now left the family home in Twickenham she shared with Ted And Alice sitcom writer Nick and their two children Dylan, 21, and Molly, 19.\u0027Living with a man is quite different from dating a man,\u0027 she once said when asked why they never married. Still on her bike!

South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, a close McCain friend, says he called Trump aides to intervene on the flag matter.Asked if he had missed a chance to unite the country, Trump told Bloomberg reporters: \u0027No, I don\u0027t think I did at all. I\u0027ve done everything that they requested and no, I don\u0027t think I have at all.\u0027In a week of solemn events marking McCain\u0027s passing, Trump has been and will be absent, a reflection of the animosity between the two men that lingered even after the Arizona senator\u0027s death on Saturday from brain cancer.    President Donald Trump flies Friday to North Carolina for an event and fundraiserTrump will also miss Saturday\u0027s service at the Washington National Cathedral, where former President Barack Obama, the Democrat who defeated McCain in 2008, and Republican President George W. Bush will pay tribute to McCain.Traditionally, sitting American presidents \u0027serve as a source of solace and comfort\u0027 for the country at times of loss and tragedy, said Princeton University historian Julian Zelizer.The Trump-McCain relationship left little room for that.    Vietnam War veteran John McCain died from aggressive brain cancer last Saturday aged 81          Trump refused to answer reporter\u0027s questions about McCain\u0027s death on at least four occasions during a White House briefing          Vice President Mike Pence  will speak at a Capitol ceremony honoring McCainIn 2015, not long after Trump kicked off his presidential campaign, McCain condemned his hard-line rhetoric on illegal immigration, accusing Trump of \u0027firing up the crazies.\u0027Trump hit back, saying of McCain\u0027s 5-12 years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam: \u0027He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren´t captured.\u0027 Trump received five deferments that got him out of military service.More recently, McCain accused Trump of kowtowing to Russian President Vladimir Putin at a July summit in Helsinki. It was, McCain said, \u0027one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory.\u0027Trump in turn delayed issuing any statement after McCain\u0027s death. At one point, the U.S. flag atop the White House that had been at half-staff was raised back up, then lowered again after Trump drew fire from Congress and veterans.\u0027The president\u0027s actions in the first day of (McCain\u0027s) death were so petty,\u0027 Zelizer said.More broadly, Zelizer noted that many Republicans, including some in Arizona, had grown frustrated with McCain\u0027s moderate stances on some issues, reflecting the changing nature of the Republican Party that Trump has seized upon.Despite these tensions, most leaders from both parties in coming days will show they can rise above the political fray to recognize the passing of a respected colleague.McCain was involved in planning the events around his funeral. He made it clear to family and friends that he wanted Democratic former Vice President Joe Biden, Bush and Obama to speak, but that Trump was not welcome.The public will file through the Rotunda for six hours to pay their respects to McCain by filing past his coffin.The pallbearers at Saturday\u0027s cathedral service will include Biden and liberal actor and activist Warren Beatty, alongside former Senator Phil Gramm and ex-Defense Secretary William Cohen, both Republicans.Throughout U.S. history, only 32 times have people \u0027lain in state\u0027 or \u0027lain in honor\u0027 under the soaring Capitol Rotunda, including 11 presidents and unknown soldiers from World War I to Vietnam."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/31/19/4F91748B00000578-6119031-image-a-3_1535738908851.jpg","title":"Is Homebase closing Map reveals 42 stores set close ditch deal","story":"    Struggling DIY chain Homebase have announced they will be closing 42 stores across the country in a last-ditch deal to save the High Street store          Homebase have 241 shops across the UK and 11,000 employees but many jobs will now go \u0027I¿m not crossrail...

More than the silliness of their antics, it’s the sheer innocence of their humour that shines through. Pictured: Eric in top hat, tails, black shorts and black tights          These publicity stills of Eric Morecambe and Ernie Wise, released by the BBC to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the duo’s move from commercial TV to Broadcasting House, are a glowing reminder of what comedy used to be — warm, friendly and infectious          The pictures are a delightful keepsake of the rich friendship between two ridiculously talented performers, who had loyally stuck beside each other since their teens during World War II          Always in tune: Many a famous face appeared on their much-loved show, with Elton John (pictured) performing in 1976  Never shy: Eric showed off in a kilt to Derek Nimmo in this amusing still, left, while right shows the pair on set Look at the boys’ faces in that snapshot of highwayman Dick Turpin and a damsel in distress. Later in the scene, Eric is mugging astride an elaborate prop, with his leather boots sticking out at impossible right angles from his collapsed horse.But the simple joke works best: Eric has got his spectacles on over his eyemask.

How about that unposed moment with the trumpet, both of them on the brink of helpless laughter? It looks like a rehearsal shot, because Eric isn’t wearing a tie.Ernie, as always, not only has a tie, but cufflinks, gold watch and a breast pocket handkerchief. Eric was no trumpeter, so the instrument is a prop.And his look of triumphant happiness, mouth wide open, tells us he has just delivered a perfect ad lib, a gag that wasn’t in the script.

Above all, they never took themselves too seriously.See Eric as Sooty the bear, with puppeteer Harry Corbett, and the real Sooty perched on his shoulder. All he has to do is assume an air of hurt dignity, and it’s hilarious — Harry and Ern are both sporting broad grins. That costume must have been hot, though: Eric’s face is glistening with sweat. Anyone can see what fun they’re having. It’s one of the reasons celebrity guests clamoured to be on their shows.In the Cossack hats, there’s American singer Diane Solomon, while Australian Keith Michell is the actor joining the duo for a Foreign Legion adventure in the Sahara sands, complete with deckchair and inflatable duck.Of all these glorious images, it’s the one of them sunbathing in shorts that sums them up best. For a start, you know Ern has been subjected to constant teasing about his ‘short, fat, hairy legs’.Then there’s the hoops in the hems of Eric’s shorts, designed for waggling. The finishing touch is his footwear: office shoes polished to a high shine, and long socks hauled high by his sock suspenders.Who wears sock suspenders these days? Come to that, who else could make you laugh out loud, with nothing more than their bare knees?As Eric would say, there’s no answer to that.

By the age of nine, she was appearing in sketches and song-and-dance numbers.During the war, the family toured the country entertaining the troops, sometimes to packed houses, sometimes less so. Joan told me the smallest audience they played to was two, when they were taken to a lighthouse and performed to the lighthouse keeper and his assistant!After the war, the family toured variety theatres for years billed as Gladys Morgan and Company — the company being Gladys’s husband Frank, Joan and, eventually, Joan’s husband Bert Hollman.In 1961, the family appeared with their friend, singer Frankie Vaughan, for a season at the London Palladium. They headlined at Butlin’s for three years and toured South Africa.Joan later appeared in cabaret at the Dorchester Hotel in Mayfair in variety in Scotland and toured Australia with The Black \u0026amp White Minstrel Show as principal comedienne.I first met Joan in 2001 when, as the editor of a music hall magazine, I was researching an article on her mother. We became good friends because, quite simply, she was a joy to be around — a tiny lady, but big on the glamour and laughs. It was a shame she never achieved the fame her mother did, because in some ways she was more talented. But she never wanted to be a big star.In 1958, the family moved to Worthing and struck up an unlikely friendship with playwright Harold Pinter. He’d just bought a property in the town. Gladys and Joan met him in the street, and he invited them to his house-warming party.In the late Seventies and Eighties, Joan put her career on hold as she nursed first Gladys, who died in 1983, and then husband Bert, who died in 1988. #]Joan was now alone and wondering what to do with her life. It was the late Sir Ken Dodd who came to her rescue, arranging for her to appear in panto in Stockport.Soon Joan was working full pelt again. I always laugh when I think of her last show, in cabaret, before she retired in 2001. The owner of the venue in Eastbourne had run out of money, so instead of payment Joan took home the chandeliers.She remained independent, living in the family flat in Worthing until last summer when two falls resulted in a long stay in hospital and finally a short stay in a nursing home.She was always immensely proud of her mother, so it was a highlight of her life when, in 2012, aged 88, she unveiled a blue plaque to Gladys at the flat in Worthing. Her friend, the comedian Roy Hudd, came along on the day.When Joan was asked by a BBC reporter what her mother would make of the plaque if she were still around, she replied: ‘She’d sell the flat and move opposite, so she could look at the plaque every day!’Joan never got her own blue plaque, or perhaps the recognition she deserved, but she was a true star until the end.Her funeral is on Wednesday at Worthing Crematorium, and we are going to play a duet of We’ll Meet Again recorded by Joan and her mum. It will be lovely to hear them singing together one last time.Joan Laurie, born January 26, 1924, died August 16, 2018 aged 94.  Champion soap seller charmed Miss World My father Earl by Gareth GriffithMy Dad didn’t talk about his job much, but one day when I was 12 or 13 he came home and said, quite matter-of-factly: ‘I was out with Miss World today. She’s a nice girl.’Dad worked for Lever Brothers, the famous ‘Sunlight’ soap manufacturers who sponsored Miss World at the time, and he’d been charged with taking her on a promotional tour around all the department stores in Leeds and Manchester. You can imagine how impressed I was.Dad was a legend among soap salesmen, and rose to become Lever Brothers’ national sales manager. He was quite modest about it, but once he told us how much soap he’d sold that day: ‘Loaded on to lorries, it would stretch into town,’ he said. He was talking miles!            Earl Griffith, born in Buckley in North Wales and was a legend among soap salesmen Dad was born in Buckley in North Wales in 1930 and his father worked in the Birkenhead shipyards. When, on his deathbed, he apologised to Dad for his ‘poor’ childhood, Dad objected — to him, there’d been nothing poor about it.His mother kept a box of ‘treasures’ recording his successes, so all the evidence is there head boy, distinctions in all his exams, and Grade 8 on the piano.There is a glowing reference from his headmaster when he left school, and cuttings from the Liverpool Echo detailing his days playing for Tranmere Rovers. Dad went on to do his national service as a PT instructor with the RAF, and would hitch lifts in the back of Lancaster bombers to get home on leave.Dad was multi-talented: we always joked that he could control a football as well as Wayne Rooney, play the piano like Liberace, and sold more soap in a lifetime than any man living or dead.He was also skilled with his hands, creating magical presents for us — a garage for me, a dolls’ house for my three sisters.Even so, I’m not sure we appreciated his talents as we grew up. He used to come in and switch off the TV and start banging away on the piano. We just thought everyone played as well as that.Later in life, when he’d made a bob or two, he bought himself a Steinway Grand.There was a fair bit of musical talent in the extended family. One of the photographs in the family album is of me at my Auntie Marjorie’s wedding, standing in front of a man who was introduced to me as ‘your Uncle John’. I was told that ‘he’s in a group and they made a record’.We laugh about it now, because that was John Lennon. His first wife Cynthia was Auntie Marjorie’s sister-in-law.My mother Gwyneth idolised my Dad. ‘He’s been a good provider and he’s always been faithful,’ she’d say, forgiving even the time he returned from a sales trip, gave her a box of Black Magic, then disappeared for a game of snooker with his mate George.Dad always insisted all four of his children were ‘mistakes . . . but the best mistakes he’d ever made’.He gave us the greatest start in life — not by handing out money, but through his support and encouragement.Dad was always dressed immaculately. I never heard him swear, never saw him the worse for drink. He was a true gentleman and a one-off.Earl Griffith, born June 30, 1930, died July 7, 2016, aged 86.  Sun-kissed East Ender fell for me at first sight My husband Alan by Maureen BlakeWe met in January 1961 at the Ilford Palais. Alan’s tan and sun-bleached hair — the result of eight months in Cyprus with the RAF — stood out among the winter pallor of the Essex boys.Of course I accepted his offer of an escort home. It was a bitterly cold evening, and as we waited at the bus stop Alan offered me his overcoat. So began our story — a family life that blossomed under the warmth and security of his all-encompassing coat.We both knew instantly that this was special. We had only five days before he had to return to Cyprus, but even in that time we were talking of engagement and marriage. On the last evening we lingered outside my front door until he finally kissed my hand and said: ‘I’ve got to go now, but I’ll be back in August.’          Maureen and Alan met in 1961 at the Ilford Palais were talking of marriage within five days withing meeting each other When he returned, we were engaged within eight weeks, and saving for the deposit for the house we lived in for 40 years in Hullbridge. We married in May 1963.Alan was a kind man of great integrity. Born in East London, he was the seventh of nine children and he knew tragedy. He lost his mother, to whom he was devoted, when he was 17. I always felt that when we met, four years later, he transferred that love and devotion to me, then to our two sons.          Talent: Joan Laurie (pictured right) with Gladys Morgan and her mother\u0027s troupe  Very much a family man, Alan worked long hours in insurance, then in stockbroking, to give us a good and secure life.We went on to have five grandchildren, and he was immensely proud of them all. In his final year, I remember him saying to me: ‘Maureen, if we wrote a list of everything we wanted from our sons, we couldn’t add anything to it, could we?’Our retirement was spent in Norfolk. It wasn’t always idyllic. In 2008, he battled illness and was the victor. Then he nursed me with great patience through my own health problems. But early in 2017 he was diagnosed with cancer for a second time, and it couldn’t be beaten.His last hours were peaceful. Towards the end he took my hand and kissed it and said — just as he had all those years before — ‘I have to go now’. We both knew this time he wouldn’t be back in August.Alan David Blake, born March 14, 1939, died January 6, 2018, aged 78.  Just three years together, but the happiest of our lives My husband Paul by Veronica GibbyPaul came into my life just five years ago. I’d never met a man like him before and know I never will again.We met through a friendship club that puts people in touch with each other.I was 74, living with MS and just been through a second cancer scare (I’d previously had a double mastectomy). In 2013, I’d emerged from a turbulent 48-year marriage. None of this put him off.          Veronica met Paul five years ago and married. But Sadly, six weeks after the wedding, Paul had a severe stroke and was paralysed down his right sideThe two of us (pictured) arranged to meet for the first time at Harlow station in Essex and he gave me such a big bear hug I knew I wanted to spend the rest of my life with him. We married on my birthday, April 24, 2014.He treated me like a princess, saying: ‘I don’t see your sticks and wheelchair — I just see a beautiful caring lady.’Everyone loved Paul — my children, nine grandchildren and seven great grandchildren. They said it was a precious second chance at happiness. He’d been married, to Jean for 28 years, before her death in 2008.Paul was born in Pembroke Dock, South Wales. He joined the Navy at 17 and spent the next decade sailing the world. A telecommunications specialist, he later worked on oil rigs in Bahrain and for a construction company in London.But he never forgot his beloved Wales. He became events organiser at the London Welsh Rugby Club as well as running five London Marathons and 40 half marathons to raise money for children’s charities.Sadly, six weeks after our wedding, Paul had a severe stroke and was paralysed down his right side. He couldn’t walk and lost some of his speech. Unbeaten, he launched himself into his physiotherapy, saying: ‘I’m doing this for Veronica!’We’d always thought it would be him looking after me, not the other way round. But I helped him with his speech therapy and we joined the ‘Stroke Club’ in Haverfordwest and never looked back.They loved him there. He’d tell his silly jokes, compile quizzes and when the Stroke Association’s ‘Step out for Stroke’ mile walks started, he was the first to sign up. When he finished his last, at Pembroke Castle in June 2017, we dared to start planning our future — a cruise, weekends away, even a trip to Australia.But in July last year, Paul started getting terrible stomach pains and was diagnosed with cancer of the colon.The world has lost a great man with a golden heart and I’ve lost the love of my life. We had just three-and-a-half years as husband and wife, but they were the happiest years of my life.Paul John Gibby, born July 2, 1946, and died October 14, 2017, aged 71.  Is there someone who’s died recently whose life you would like to celebrate?Email: lives@dailymail.co.uk or write to: Extraordinary Lives, Daily Mail, 2 Derry Street, London W8 5TT"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/01/01/4F95244600000578-0-image-a-17_1535762849151.jpg","title":"Bubble Absolutely Fabulous ditches father children married star","story":"    Actress of stage and screen Jane Horrocks hits the west end of London with fellow actor Danny WebbIn a further plot twist, Webb, who has appeared in TV\u0027s Sherlock, Poirot and Endeavour, is married to casting director Leila Bertrand, with whom he has two grown-up daughters.Horrocks is said to have now left the family home in Twickenham she shared with Ted And Alice sitcom writer Nick and their two children Dylan, 21, and Molly, 19.\u0027Living with a man is quite different from dating a man,\u0027 she once said when asked why they never married. Still on her bike!

In 2000, when she directed the film version, working with female pornography actors, it was banned in France for a time, and became a cult hit across Europe. Despentes, who took her pen name from the area in Lyon where she was a sex worker, was branded crude, outrageous and refreshing – the working-class daughter of postal workers from Nancy in north-eastern France became literature’s “voice of the marginalised”. Since then she has written 10 more books, won literary awards and redefined French feminism in her 2006 manifesto King Kong Theory, in which she detailed being raped at 17 while hitchhiking with a friend, when they were attacked and threatened with a rifle by three young men.But now, at 49, it is her funny, irreverent and scathing trilogy about contemporary Paris Vernon Subutex that has cemented her status as a “rock’n’roll Zola”. It has sold hundreds of thousands of copies in France, won a clutch of prizes, been shortlisted for the International Man Booker prize, adapted into a big-budget TV series and translated across the world.The saga centres on a record-shop owner who, when his shop closes, is evicted and has to blag nights on sofas from old acquaintances before drifting into homelessness. He was once friends with a rock star, Alex Bleach, who was found dead from an overdose in a hotel room, and has some video tapes that several people are hunting down. The sweeping cast of characters reflect all strata of society, from retired pornography actors to a vile sex predator film producer (it was written before the accusations against Harvey Weinstein were made public), an extreme-right thug who works in a high street clothing store and a Muslim student in a headscarf who – pointedly – is neither submissive nor radicalised, but simply knows her own mind. Despentes says she is sick of veiled women being stereotyped and made a political target in France.Vernon Subutex is written like a TV series – an art-form she thinks has taken over from cinema “and perhaps will even take over from the novel”. The trilogy chronicles what she sees as the creeping advance of far-right ideas through French society: casual racism and disdain for the poor.“It’s about the passage from the 20th to the 21st century and a feeling in France of losing the dominant position,” she says. “Western Europeans have been privileged from birth, feeling like the dominant power. It’s also about a certain loss of virility and how one adapts to that, men or women.”Despentes, who has spent decades on the frontline of the gender war, thinks we’re in an era of “great change”, citing the #MeToo and Time’s Up movements. “This past year was pivotal,” she says. “For the first time, we’re seeing young women who view being at ease in the public space as their right. It has been a revolution ... Never was there a generation of women who were told so clearly: when you go out of your front door there is absolutely no reason you should come back in the evening down because a man has touched or heckled you.”#MeToo has kindled a revival of interest in Despentes’s King Kong Theory and a theatre adaptation returns to Paris this autumn. She thinks it might take a decade before we can fully assess the impact of these movements and remains wary of a backlash from the patriarchy.In Vernon Subutex, Despentes has created a male character who has captured the French imagination. In hindsight she feels readers and critics were a lot kinder to this hapless man than they would have been if it were a woman. “I think if there had been a female central character, the work would have been seen much less as a portrait of its generation and more as the story of a woman who messes up.”From her window you can see in the distance the Buttes-Chaumont, the vast park in the 19th arrondissement where tower blocks rub up against gentrified streets, and in which much of her story takes place.It was in this park that two Parisian brothers, the Kouachis, trained for jihad before carrying out the terrorist attacks on the magazine Charlie Hebdo in January 2015. The first volume of Vernon Subutex was published in France on the morning of those attacks. While Despentes was writing the third volume, the attacks on a Paris football stadium, restaurants and the Bataclan rock venue took place in November 2015. She altered the book to reflect society’s reaction.“The issue of terrorism is unavoidable in a contemporary French novel,” she says. “Just as the topic of refugees, homeless people and the rise of the far right is inescapable. Because I really wanted to make this novel a snapshot of France.”Despentes acknowledges the difficulties: “When there is a big terrorist attack, there’s stupefaction — that’s the whole point of terrorism. For several months after the Bataclan, I stopped writing it was impossible to continue because it seemed such a piddling thing to be doing. But then I thought what I need is the book I want to read right now, so I got back to it.”She pauses and says it might come as a surprise, but one of her biggest literary influences is Nick Hornby. “He’s got a way of writing about problems that when you read it, it’s almost feel-good. His books have been important to me in terms of learning what writing is, but they’ve also boosted my morale. There were times I wasn’t feeling great and I read two or three Nick Hornbys back to back and that perked me up.”In terms of French culture and thought, she says the biggest talent is now among women of colour: the writers Léonora Miano and Faïza Guène, the rapper Casey, the essayist Rokhaya Diallo and the documentary-maker Amandine Gay. There had been so little airtime given to these perspectives for 30 years that now it’s like an “eruption”.Despentes has said her own writing wouldn’t be what it was if she hadn’t given up alcohol at 30 and she is considering writing about addiction. At 35, she says, she “quit heterosexuality”. . “It’s easier to be a feminist when you’re lesbian. You’re not afraid of saying certain things, or of offending the person you live with because you’re too radical and your life isn’t in contradiction with your ideas.”Two events provided the seed for the Subutex trilogy. One was the economic crisis and how easily people in their 50s can lose jobs and homes and not be able to get back on the ladder. The other was the death of the singer Whitney Houston. “When Whitney Houston died there were articles about her and the relationship she had with a particular friend, who wasn’t well known, who stayed in the shadows, but who some implied was her mistress. That’s where the idea came from of someone who wasn’t well known but who was friends with a famous singer.”There is sex in Vernon Subutex, but Despentes says the trauma of the scandal around Baise-Moi runs deep and nowadays “there is a lot less sex in my books” she feels many contemporary French writers are tending to “remove the notion of sex” and getting a better reception from critics because of it. But it still has a place in French literature and art, she says, and needs to be talked about. She describes herself as a pro-sex feminist. As a former pornography reviewer who still watches vast amounts of the stuff, she is concerned about changes to the industry and the humiliation of female performers. With ever younger children accessing adult films, she says there needs to be more public discourse, special portals providing pornography for teenagers, education that there are different types of porn.“For a very long time, in the 70s and 80s, even 90s, pornography centred on a notion of women’s enjoyment. Today in international pornography – which all looks more or less the same – it’s the opposite: it’s a problem if a woman has any pleasure at all. Not all porn is about hatred of women but at the moment what is being watched is about that. What is going on in men’s heads, in their sexuality, when women’s pleasure has become a problem?”She wishes there was more critique of this by men. “Very few are asking how pornography got like this, what behavioural issues are at play.”Despentes also sees hypocrisy in the current arguments about prostitution and can’t understand why it isn’t treated by the law like any other work, and why men in positions of power, including male MPs, who use sex workers don’t seek to make their working conditions better. In King Kong Theory she wrote that having been a sex worker had helped her rebuild herself after rape. It’s about money, she says. Today King Kong Theory, with its account of Despentes’s rape, is the book she is most often asked to sign at events – and by a growing number of young men. When it was published 12 years ago, her publishers refused to use “feminism” on the cover. “There was a French way of thinking then that feminism wouldn’t sell, that feminism would put people off, that feminism was over,” she says. “But I knew I wasn’t the only person interested in it, and now that’s clear”• Vernon Subutex Two is published by Quercus.

Or anyway I assume they arrived by bus. I myself arrived by ambulance, strapped down against any tendency to slide on to the floor like a speeding custard.It was a low moment in my recent medical history, but once again the combined efforts of my family and the Addenbrooke’s crash-cart crew dug me out of the hole, so that I have emerged in time to witness the launch of my epic poem, The River In The Sky.Beautiful title, isn’t it? I can ask that rhetorical question in all modesty because I didn’t think of it. It’s what the Japanese call the Milky Way and nobody in the west has ever heard the phrase without immediately starting to write a book.I started writing my book the year before last, or I started to write a poem with that title. More precisely, I finally admitted to myself that a sheaf of unfinished poems belonged together. It’s conceivable that they belonged together in the wastepaper basket, and there might soon be critics who say so but it seemed to me that a small stack of would-be poetic fragments were adding up to the same story, the story of a mind heading into oblivion.I could imagine the cheer that would go up from my publishers when they heard what I was hatching. The cheer would be the sound of a sock-drawer full of baby mice being fed milk from an eye-dropper.There hasn’t been, they might pipingly point out, a hit long poem since Tennyson’s Maud, and even Tennyson, a shrewd operator for a dreamy poet, tended to overestimate the initial appeal of any poem longer than a snappy lyric. Maud was a showcase for his technical virtuosity but it was still a whopper.There is a true anecdote, which all would-be epic poets should bear in mind, about Ruskin’s wife fatally admitting to Tennyson at some social gathering that she had not yet read his poem Maud, which she had heard a lot about. (That last bit was probably the fatal trigger.) Generously keen that she be no longer deprived, Tennyson recited the whole thing to her from memory. Having detected signs of restless inattention on her part, he recited it to her again.Reeling against the sceptical uproar of the sock-drawer mice, all I can say about my new, and perhaps terminal, poetic project is that it’s not your usual kind of epic. For one thing, it’s quite short. In that regard it’s bang up to date. The great scholar John Carey, the world expert on Paradise Lost, has tacitly conceded, by editing a trimmed version, that a bit more shortness was what Milton’s epic needed.Christopher Ricks, Professor Carey’s only living rival for cleverness (how like Matthew Arnold’s Sohrab and Rustum they are, dominating the horizon with mighty use of arms) has pointed out that when a poet makes an allusion to someone else’s poetry he should be offering a bonus, not demanding an entrance fee.Mindful of this admonition, I have been careful in my own poem to keep everything mine, as it were – partly out of a conviction that if you aren’t ready to start again, you shouldn’t start. Hence my mini-epic spends almost none of its time proving that I have read Shakespeare. As somebody deservedly obscure once said: I tried him once, and he was full of quotations.Nor does my epic have an epic hero. Instead, it’s got me, going nowhere. In the text, apart from the occasional side-trip to the Great Barrier Reef, I don’t even get to Heaven, except to the extent that Heaven is here on Earth. But that’s something I’ve been convinced of since I was a child, and saw my mother weeping at the news of my father’s death: that Heaven and Hell are both here, with us.Heaven is here in the way my granddaughter seems continually to pick up speed when she drives my wheelchair, as if she were heading for Andromeda, which is in the poem, too: zillions of light years away but on its way here, unless we’re on the way there. Scientists, I understand, are ided on the subject.My poem also touches Heaven, or tries to, when dancers dance to its incidental music. The narrator dances the tango with a blind girl in Buenos Aires, on a stone terrace beneath the weeping stars. It really happened, or I think it did: there is always the possibility that I was dreaming even at the time, and only thought I was treading clouds of bliss.But unless I miss my guess, even the best and most beautiful things about Heaven are here now, or were here just recently. In my text, the Everly Brothers are still singing harmony. But aren’t they doing that still, and won’t they always?And Hell is here, too, but happening to other people, if you’re lucky. I’m still one of the lucky ones, and that’s the very thing that my quarrel with the Almighty is about. It’s all very well saving me from the killer microbes yet again, but what’s He doing giving a mishmash of a spine to that little girl down the corridor, the little girl whose mother is wearing out from anxiety right there before your eyes? What the devil is He thinking of?Perhaps He isn’t thinking of anything, which would kind of leave it with us. This is the main reason, in my view, that epic poems are bound to grow shorter: because the titanic war in the beyond will be continually rescaled as a crap-shoot in the back of a garage. Milton had rogue angels falling through space from crystal battlements. We will have dusty children bursting from hunger, and grown men behaving like smug maniacs because they honestly think that they are worth more than women.But there will still be epic poems, because every human life contains one. It comes out of nowhere and goes somewhere on its way to everywhere – which is nowhere all over again, but leaves a trail of memories. There won’t be many future poets who don’t dip their spoons into all that, even if nobody buys the book. And anyway, who says it will be a book? Maybe it will just go bleep. There is a multi-wheeled camera running loose on Mars that doesn’t even know where it is, but it can still go bleep.At which point, growing tired again now – I’m back in my office, but it takes an effort to walk from one end of it to the other – I should thank my elder daughter Claerwen for painting the book’s starry cover, and for pointing out to its dim-witted author that the reason the thermometer showed a higher reading back then was that his temperature really had gone up through the roof.Now that I am home again, my wife has taken over the job of ramming the thermometer into my ear, and it seems to me that she is doing so with more finesse lately, perhaps partly because I have dedicated my epic to her. Try it boys, along with the bunch of roses.‘All is not lost…’The opening verses of The River In The Sky All is not lost, despite the quietnessThat comes like nightfall now as the last strengthEbbs from my limbs, and feebleness of breathMakes even focusing my eyes a task –As when, before the merciful excisionOf my mist-generating cataracts,The money-spiders dwindled in their websBetween one iron drel and the nextOn my flagstone verandah, each frail webThe intermittent image of a discThat glittered like the Facel Vega’s wheelStill spinning when Camus gave up his life,Out past the journey’s edge.

Toxic air is a scientific and health issue, but the way we speak of it has religious roots.“Pollution” comes from the Latin for the desecration of a sacred space, spiritual or moral corruption, or general filth. In the middle ages it was adopted in French for nocturnal emissions of the kind that emanated from sleeping male sinners. Nowadays, of course, we happily chuck all kinds of stuff into rivers, seas and the air, including warming carbon dioxide and NOx, or nitrogen oxides. Add noise pollution and light pollution, and it seems there is no aspect of our environment we are not intent on profaning.The vestigial sense of the sacred in our idea of pollution chimes with the spiritual rhetoric of some environmentalists seeking to protect Gaia,\u0026nbspthe Earth goddess. China, where the pollution study was conducted, by contrast boasts of a gruff military approach, having declared “war on pollution” five years ago.

Normal People follows the lives of Marianne and Connell as their furtive teen romance develops into a tumultuous, life-defining relationship that never settles between friendship and love. Arriving this week in bookshops to almost universal and gushing praise, the 27-year-old Irish author’s second novel has received adulation from all corners. Under the headline “Why Sally Rooney’s love story deserves to win the Man Booker Prize”, the Evening Standard critic David Sexton this week praised her writing as “exquisite”, saying: “She makes apparently ordinary words and expressions matter so much. She is expert in studied disclosure and withholding too.”In the Observer, Julie Myerson called it “deeply and unashamedly romantic, but in the most rapturously contemporary sense” and praised “its near-perfect narrative execution”. In the Review today, Kate Clanchy deems it “a future classic”, adding: “Rooney is such a gifted, brave, adventurous writer, so exceptionally good at observing the lies people tell themselves on the deepest level.” In the New Statesman, author Olivia Laing called Rooney “the best young novelist – indeed one of the best novelists – I’ve read in years”, while a five-star review in the Independent proclaimed: “There’s nothing normal about Rooney. She’s exceptional.”Stephen Page, chief executive of Rooney’s publisher, Faber, said: “It’s a real boon that she has been universally praised by critics and readers alike.

That’s when I underwent “therapy” with the aim of making me straight. I went undercover to report and expose this vile practice, and judging from my experience the film is hauntingly accurate.Set in 1993, Cameron (Chloë Grace Moretz), a teenager in love with one of her schoolfriends, is discovered in a clinch at a high school dance by her (male) date. Cameron is sent away by her horrified parents to God’s Promise, a Christian camp that aims to indoctrinate young people with the belief that homosexuality is a sin and that sinners can be healed with the help of Jesus.Moretz has said in interviews that in her preparations for the role of Cameron Post, she met young people who had been through conversion therapy. I also did that to prepare for my undercover role. In Denver I met Christine Bakke-O’Neil, who runs a campaign called Beyond Ex-Gay. Christine grew up in a fundamentalist Christian family, and when she came out as a lesbian, her family and her Christian peers rejected her.Christine moved to Denver to take part in an ex-gay ministry. But after five years of exorcisms, reparative therapy and many hours at the altar, Christine accepted she was not going to change having met other “survivors” of the ex-gay movement, she came out of the closet once again.I chose a Christian counselling body that specialises in “female same-sex attraction” (they do not use the word lesbian), Janelle Hallman \u0026amp Associates.I spoke to a therapist called Kelley (first via Skype for a 50-minute session costing $125, and later at their counselling centre in Colorado) about my family background and my expectations for change. I told her I wanted to be heterosexual and become reconciled with my family and the church.Kelley was keen to find evidence that I was sexually abused in childhood. When she failed to find any, she asked if my mother had neglected me. Despite my insistence that my mother was never neglectful, Kelley maintained that she could detect in me “a deep sense of shame”. “All you need to do,” Kelley told me, “is to start thinking of yourself as perfectly normal – as heterosexual.”Although I was masquerading as a middle-aged woman unhappy with her sexuality, who had made her own decision to ask for help to “convert”, the tactics used by Kelley were about making me feel like there was something deeply flawed about me that needed fixing, and that I was unlovable and unworthy until I was “cured”.I was told that female same-sex attraction (“nestling into each others’ arms, suckling on breasts, dressing alike, daily multiple phone calls or contacts”) was simply a collection of symptoms of emotional dependency. In Cameron Post, Dr Lydia Marsh, the character who runs the conversion programme, says to Cameron: “Your struggle is with the sin of same-sex attraction. The first step is for you to stop thinking of yourself as a homosexual.”According to Kelley, I must have been frightened of my father when I was a child, and that as a result I saw all men as scary. She implied that I might be a lesbian because I did not have close female friends at school, despite the fact that I made it clear that I was only rejected at school when it was suspected I was a lesbian.I asked whether I should access the therapy back home that would make me feel better about being a lesbian, rather than pursue a route that would make me lose my identity and support network. But at no time was it suggested that I should access counselling that would make me feel better about being gay, or even refer me to one of the UK’s many gay-friendly churches.The government has pledged to ban conversion therapy in the UK, but it is growing in popularity in Africa, South America and Asia, the regions where being gay is massively stigmatised andor criminalised. During my counselling – despite the fact that I was in character, and am normally confident in my sexual identity – I became depressed and anxious. Several hours of being told I needed fixing, despite there being nothing damaged, took its toll. After my return home, I informed Kelley that I was an undercover reporter, and told her a little about the effect her “therapy” had on me, but she seemed resolute in her views.I have been an out-and-proud lesbian since I was at school, and came out in 1977. The first question I was asked by a friend when she discovered my sexuality was: “If there was a pill you could take that would make you straight, you would take it, right?”Of course, there is no magic pill to make lesbians and gay men straight, and I for one would never take it even if there were. I hope the powerful depiction of the horrors of conversion therapy in The Miseducation of Cameron Post add strength to the campaign to eradicate it worldwide.• Julie Bindel is a freelance journalist, political activist, and a founder of Justice for Women"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba26e95a0e616583023f083298a17a760af03bbb/482_170_2602_1561/master/2602.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da7e1a86394dd83b25f2be482ed9b71b","title":"the guardian view on frank field a voice worth hearing","story":"The Labour party has always been a broad church whose\u0026nbspinternal disagreements have given it much of its\u0026nbspvitality and relevance. It is impossible for MPs to sit in the Commons for years without ever disagreeing with\u0026nbsptheir leaders. What varies is the inidual’s willingness to show public dissent, to defy party orthodoxy and party whips. Frank Field, MP for Birkenhead since 1979, is one who has not been shy of taking an independent line. Another is Jeremy Corbyn, MP for Islington North since\u0026nbsp1983.For 35 years, Mr Field and Mr Corbyn have sat on the same side, regularly disagreeing with their party’s policy and with each other. Neither felt obliged to resign the whip until now. Mr Field on Thursday declared his intention to sit in the Commons as an independent. That is all the more extraordinary since, three years ago, he was one of the MPs whose nominations secured Mr Corbyn’s place in the contest that saw him elected as leader.Mr Field said at the time that he was pleased with his choice, because the other candidates were offering thin “post-Blair gruel”. On Thursday, he accused Mr\u0026nbspCorbyn of acting as “a force for antisemitism” – by refusing to recognise how comments he had made in the past emboldened anti-Jewish prejudice – and of tolerating a wider culture of “intolerance, nastiness and intimidation”. In levelling these charges, Mr Field drew on experience in his local constituency party. He was not inventing the factional aggressions, which makes it imperative that his concerns be taken seriously.The inappropriate response – sadly, one that some of Mr Corbyn’s supporters leapt for – is to suggest that Mr Field is an embittered has-been who was facing deselection anyway, so an unreliable critic of the leader. It is also wrong to imagine that he represents some wider pattern of anti-Corbyn sabotage. There are Labour MPs who crave a change of leader but they are disorganised and weak. Also, on the single biggest issue of the day – Brexit – most anti-Corbyn MPs are in fundamental disagreement with Mr Field. They tend to be staunchly remain he is an eager leaver. There is no conspiracy here, just frustration and dismay.Mr Field’s support for Brexit is not the only way in which he has offended Labour members. He has taken positions on welfare reform (on the relationship between benefits, culture and incentives to work, for example) usually expressed by the Conservatives. After the 2010 election, he led a commission on poverty, authorised by the coalition government. That\u0026nbspassociation with David Cameron is contamination enough in the eyes of some left purists.But Mr Field has also been a powerful critic of Tory\u0026nbsppolicy. No one who has followed his career, including his role since 2015 as chair of the Commons work and pensions committee, can doubt his commitment to fighting poverty. Nor are there grounds to doubt his integrity when it comes to criticising leaders, past and present. His reasons for resigning the whip are the ones he has given, and they should be taken seriously. It would be unwise to dismiss the judgment of someone who, in many years as an independent spirit, has never before felt so alienated by things that have been said by a Labour leader and done in the leader’s name.If Labour is not a broad enough church to accommodate Mr Field’s creed, if respected veterans and those who share his concerns feel their presence is unwelcome, the party will be politically diminished and much less able to protect the weak, whom Mr\u0026nbspField and Mr Corbyn have in their different ways struggled all their political lives to defend.

I’ve never wanted or needed an American passport. Besides which, I’ve always been vaguely neurotic about the downsides to dual citizenship: primarily, the question of what happens when you get kidnapped in a third country and neither of the countries to which you hold citizenship regards you as squarely their responsibility. (I realise this takes a rather rosy view of the Foreign Office or the State Department leaping to one’s rescue in any circumstances. But still.)Plus, of course, it is a very odd time to want to become an American. It’s just a question of bureaucracy, I told myself a green card is inadequate protection in these anti-immigrant times, and the idea of my children having inalienable residency rights where I don’t is chilling. Handy things come with citizenship, too, of course: voting, the opportunity to get arrested without being deported, smoother passage through JFK. And it would be madness not to do it, when the cost is filling in a few forms.All of these things made sense to me intellectually, but failed to explain a weird fact: that the moment the prospect of getting a blue passport arose, I found myself completely thrilled by it. Not just thrilled but inclined, suddenly, to look at America differently. I have lived in the US for 10 years, and not only never considered it home, but tended most of the time to disparage it.And I don’t mean the kind of affectionate disparagement most British people here reserve for home. Brits I know in New York tend to talk about the UK as a silly little country, with its underpowered prime minister and Brain of Britain Jeremy Corbyn, while being fairly certain of its basic superiority. I criticised the US not in this way – lightly, from a distance, with an underlying love – but instead often with vehement dislike: the grindingly hard economics of the place, the fact that all people do here – and for good reason – is talk, think and worry about money the lack of social care and that’s before you even get to the White House.It’s corrosive to live in a country one purports to dislike, particularly when one’s children sound like Americans. (Well, almost. They’re clinging to the correct pronunciation of “bath” at the moment, although I have lost the battle on “water” and “can’t”.) And yet the second the chance to get a passport came up, I found myself not only grateful to the place but, for the first time, invested in it. You can give up your green card and go home, but citizenship, even after moving, feels irrevocable.I should have known it wasn’t merely a question of paperwork. Years ago, a member of the South African consulate in London suggested I apply for a South African passport – my mother was South African before naturalizing as British – prior to moving to Johannesburg for six months and I found myself recoiling. Yuck, I thought I did not want to be a white holder of a South African passport, even in this day and age.These things are emotional, and they creep up unawares. At a beach on Long Island this weekend, I noted the huge American flag affixed to a neighbouring beach hut and felt a familiar surge of scorn, before finding it checked by some other impulse. Not national pride, obviously (I haven’t completely lost my mind), but the small, satisfying sense of being\u0026nbspimplicated."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9b04195cf94b285bee48f2de3926b124da15f20/0_481_7114_4267/master/7114.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f334a05b4f468ff31f82c4e97c05530a","title":"nasser hussain in the nets how a local cricket club got a first class makeover","story":"When Ilford Cricket Club won a community cricket honour, its facilities were soon transformed – shortly followed by league success and coaching sessions from stars of the game“Come on, keep those balls coming – otherwise we’re just people standing in a shed!”Nasser Hussain is not here to muck about. The former England captain is putting kids through their paces in the indoor nets of Ilford Cricket School. Famed in his pomp for a feisty batting style, he’s much the same as a teacher. Former England seamer, Sajid Mahmood, is in the adjoining net, teaching bowling.The kids can hardly believe their luck. They lap up the attention of both legends, grab selfies and get their bats signed. Proud parents film on their phones. Balls whizz through the air, and shrieks of excitement bounce off the walls. At the end of the class, a tiny youngster bowls out Hussain. The roof nearly lifts off the hall.Just an hour earlier, poor weather threatened to derail a much-anticipated day. ESPNcricinfo had been booked to give the full match day treatment to Ilford Cricket Club’s tie against rivals Ilford Town, courtesy of NatWest. Hussain and Mahmood were due to give a pre-match masterclass on the pitch.But after weeks of sunny, sweltering conditions, the day began with improbably grey skies, bucketing rain and heavy winds. As everyone sheltered in the clubhouse, the only sign of life outside was a cagouled woman, bravely walking her springer iel through the bluster.Then Hussain arrived, bouncing in with a chirpy: “Turned out nice again.” He was followed by the towering presence of Mahmood. As the energy began to shift, their masterclasses were moved indoors and a weather app suggested that a truncated match could be played in mid-afternoon. It was game on.Speaking after the classes, Hussain explained his pugnacious approach. “Look, cricket can be a dull game if you don’t get on with it,” he says. “I hate coaching sessions when all you hear is the coach – when you have an hour and the coach has spoken for 40 minutes and the kids are standing there bored.”In fact, the kids had been electrified and impressive in both the classes. Mahmood says: “I was really amazed by the number that turned out and the level of talent. Their technique was very, very good.” Hussain agreed, adding: “There’s a strong British-Asian community here and they pick up things very quickly because they follow the game so passionately.”Back at the clubhouse, Ilford chairman Maz Malik’s cheery energy was helping keep the day on track, despite the weather. “We’ve been having sub-continental conditions for six weeks, but today it’s back to the reality of English summer,” he laughed.A cricket fanatic – he says he’d get up to watch the Seychelles play the Bahamas at 3am – he has been part of the club since 1980, when he joined as a nine-year-old. As we speak, the razzmatazz of the day carries on around us: ESPN commentates on the match and NatWest’s virtual reality tent thrills kids. A barbecue sizzles away. Hussain, who cut his teeth here in the 1980s, and Mahmood chat with locals.“It’s been an exceptional day – we were very honoured to get selected,” says Malik. He describes the masterclasses as an “aspirational experience” for local kids. “It brings stars into reality. The kids see that these are human beings and that they can follow in their footsteps.”Gesturing to the NatWest “Cricket has no boundaries” banner, he talks about the “huge” changes he has seen in the sport. “Things have become less stuffy,” he says. “There has been less of the old boys’ network shirts, ties and collars. It’s become more accessible. We’re open for all – people of all abilities and backgrounds.”There are plans to host a “tape-ball” cricket tournament in August to attract those from south Asia and those who find the entry cost to full cricket prohibitive. The club has already subsidised some local youngsters who were referred by local authorities because of difficult circumstances.Members of the club, which was founded in 1879, say the atmosphere and relations across the board are much tighter since the involvement of CricketForce. Everyone has a new spring in their step. The first team recently topped the Essex Premier League for the first time in over 20 years. “I don’t see that as a coincidence,” says Malik.Captain Theeban Tavarasa, 31, has been involved with the club for 18 years, since his talent was spotted one day by Nasser Hussain’s father, Jawad, in the nets of Ilford Cricket School. “We are a very multicultural club, we have people from all walks of life: Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Sri Lankans, English, Irish – we’ve got such a good society here,” says Tavarasa.“I believe this local community needs a cricket club like this. When you hear about so much crime and discord in London, a club like ours can help the community with cohesion. We can set a shining example.”Summing up the occasion, Sajid Mahmood strikes a similar note. “Today has brought the community together,” he says. “I think NatWest have done a fantastic job in supporting this. They’ve realised the contribution days like this can make towards community cohesion.”Mohammad Akhtar was the star on the day, with a pivotal 59 from 40 balls as Ilford CC (173 for 4) beat Ilford Town (170 for 8) by six wickets. Watching from the perimeter, Usman Ul Haq, a highly-tipped youngster who also plays for Essex, discusses the positive impact cricket has had on his life. “It helps you stay away from trouble and harmful paths,” says the 13-year-old, whose proud father Inam has been an Ilford member for more than 20 years.“Today has been amazing,” continues Usman with a smile. “How often do you have a first-class cricketer in your net giving you tips, then hanging around, signing your bats and then coming on to the club house to have a nice chat with you?“What I’ve learned more than anything today is that you don’t need to be good at the game to enjoy the game. This whole day has shown that you should play for the love of it. That’s the best way.”As a erse and inclusive sport, cricket truly has no boundaries, and NatWest think that’s worth protecting.

You might even think of boxing: the city is home to some of the sport’s greatest exponents, including recent former world champion Tony Bellew and former British and Commonwealth champion David Price.But few people would associate Liverpool with cricket.Chance to Shine, the sports charity whose mission is to “spread the power of cricket throughout schools and communities” is hoping to change that. With the help of NatWest – with which it has formed a formidable, multi-year partnership – it aims to reintroduce cricket to inner-city state schools, and provide resources and facilities for underprivileged children to learn how to play the game. Since its inception, more than 3 million young people – half of whom are girls – have been given a chance to enjoy the sport. Some of those who were introduced to cricket through the charity have gone on to play on the national stage and even faced international Test teams.Chance to Shine currently runs three projects in Liverpool – the largest in the Anfield area, with smaller cricket training clubs in Toxteth and Dingle.“Liverpool isn’t known as a cricket city,” says Sam Goodall-Walker, a league coach on the Lancashire Cricket Board and a lead coach on the Chance to Shine project in Liverpool. “One of the challenges we face is to change the attitudes toward cricket in the city to show that anyone can come down, learn to play and be good at it.”Goodall-Walker has been a coach on the Chance to Shine project since 2013, during which time there have been a number of successes. “We ran a project in Anfield, in schools that didn’t have resources to play cricket, where nearly all the students hadn’t played before,” he says. “In the five years it’s been running, five students have started playing regular club cricket, and two students play cricket for the Lancashire district.”Of course, the successes aren’t just in getting young people to play competitively.“We work with young people who come from disadvantaged backgrounds,” says Goodall-Walker. “For example, we worked with one young man called Michael, who has dyspraxia, and there were times in his life when he felt really isolated and lacked confidence.”He goes on to say that it was the extra, specially tailored coaching that helps young men like Michael thrive at cricket. “Disability cricket training was the thing that really boosted his confidence and gave him the extra support and guidance he needed, and he is now playing senior-level cricket.”Goodall-Walker also says that the Chance to Shine cricket programme has the power to help young people arriving from other countries feel at home, and give them the opportunities to succeed.It’s not just boys benefitting from the Chance to Shine project in Liverpool either. “There’s around 30 girls who play cricket every week at our club,” says 15-year-old Charlotte Dunn, who plays at Wavetry cricket club. Dunn has been playing cricket for the past six years, and says that the enthusiasm of coaches, and the supportive environment means that “everyone, regardless of your background, where you’re from, whether you’re a boy or a girl, can learn and enjoy playing cricket”.Part of that supportive environment includes pairing younger players with older ones, who can act as role models and mentors. “I’ve been paired with people who are still in primary school, and showing them how to play can really boost their confidence,” she says. It’s that, combined with how “approachable the club and all its staff are,” which she says has made so many young women stick with the club. “The coaches will make sure everyone’s involved and that they’re having fun. The most important thing to them is that we’re having a good time.”Goodall-Walker says that while the project has achieved a great deal of success, there’s still “plenty more work to do”.“We have to be realistic if we want to survive in the long term,” he says. “We still want to work with schools to give them a chance to try out cricket, and we still want to work with youth clubs and community centres who want to try out new things ... but there has to be a bigger cultural change for cricket to get the same amount of support as football and other sports.”Part of that reluctance, he says, is because of how cricket – particularly in its longer formats – is perceived in working-class, urbanised areas of the city, where it is seen as “very traditional, and associated with middle-class white people”.“Attitudes toward cricket need to change,” he continues. “But that can only happen if the game adapts too. It needs to adapt to a society that moves faster, and can’t afford to spend a whole day playing and watching cricket. We need more variation in the kind of games offered to attract more people to the sport. There’s no reason why cricket needs to be so traditional or old-school. That’s what’s stopping it progressing and flourishing in places where there’s so much potential talent.”As a erse and inclusive sport, cricket truly has no boundaries, and NatWest think that’s worth protecting.

One 12-year-old chose a different path, and is now a graduate, cricket coach and teacherAt 12 years old Siraj Ali wasn’t a bad kid. But, like many of the young people he grew up with in the outskirts of Birmingham, he’d hang out on the street at night, sometimes get in trouble at school, and had anger management issues that could boil over.“The area that I come from, the crime rates are really high,” says Ali, a decade later. “In and outside school I was getting into a lot of trouble. I wasn’t being myself. I was being dragged into the wrong crowd.”Birmingham’s reputation for gang culture and the associated crimes – such as those involving knives and guns – is widely reported. In hindsight, Ali, now 22, reckons he was at risk of slipping into that “bad crowd” and that if things hadn’t changed he’d carry a criminal record by now and struggle to get a job.Thankfully, things did change – and in September 2017 he graduated from the University of Wolverhampton with a degree in sport, media, culture and development. He’s currently confident of being hired by a teaching agency and, perhaps most importantly for him, he’s teaching young people cricket at his local leisure centre, where he hopes he can help others negotiate the dangers of growing up in that neighbourhood.“If I hadn’t got involved in cricket something bad would have happened to me,” he says. “When I went to Street they just dragged me in another direction.”He’s referring to Chance to Shine Street, a charity that uses cricket as a means to build young people’s confidence, social skills and focus – while keeping them off the streets for a few hours a week. With the help of its official long-term partners, NatWest – who have a long history of supporting grassroots cricket to support communities and help make the game accessible to all – Chance to Shine Street has helped more than 38,000 youngsters since 2008. The broader Chance to Shine programme has introduced more than 3 million young people – half of whom are girls – to cricket since its inception.Now a coach with the organisation, Ali first encountered Street (as it’s generally known) as an angry 12-year-old. Invited along to a session by a local coach, he grew frustrated, smashed over the wickets and walked out. Luckily, both he and the coaching staff persevered. Ali went on to play around the country in his teens, continued playing for local T20 sides while at university, and is now dedicated to using cricket to help the kids coming of age in the Alum Rock and Saltley areas of Birmingham.“I’ve been coaching at the local leisure centre for four or five years now,” he says. “I enjoy the role because it’s challenging. With some of the kids you don’t know what’s going on at home or at school. But I always try to ask questions: ‘How are your studies? Are you getting into trouble? How are things at home?’”Ali, who coaches primary-school children as well as those in secondary school, reckons the key to Street’s power is the way cricket can help instil a sense of confidence in young people. “Street cricket is available for all kids, and it’s a fun and friendly environment,” he says. “These sessions are in areas where there isn’t much opportunity for kids, and they offer a chance for them to help themselves grow in many ways, such as in confidence. This is very important for kids – it can be very beneficial for them in their education.“When they play in a group, a big group of 13 or 14 kids, it’s a different crowd every time – one’s funny, one’s low on confidence, one’s very confident. They sit together, talk to each other, express how they feel and they become good friends. They work together like that. That’s the main key to our organisation – to help kids work together and get on and help each other.”Many of the young people he’s worked with over the past five years have gone on to a college education or university. The player-turned-coach attributes his ability to reach students to the fact that he’s been through the same things they’re going through the children can relate to him in a way they sometimes can’t to parents or teachers. “I understand them because I came from the same community and I’ve been through this all at a young age,” he says. “It’s all about understanding the kids and what they go through. Some of the children I have worked with are now playing for Warwickshire youth teams, so this is progress, and I will continue to help kids.”Mentoring is something Ali enjoys – and that influenced his choice of degree, which is focused on the development of young people. But it’s been a two-way street. At university, Ali found he was more confident than many of his peers, thanks to his time spent speaking to large groups of young people and working with people from across the charity and beyond.“When I first joined the street project as a coach, things were a lot different and I wasn’t confident leading sessions,” he says. “Coach Khaled worked with me and he started to review my performance. Week by week I was growing in confidence, and this confidence has been vital when I’ve had to make presentations at university or lead my group in front of the whole class. I am now a graduate and I am looking to continue to inspire kids and help them grow their passion for cricket and their education.”As a erse and inclusive sport, cricket truly has no boundaries, and NatWest think that’s worth protecting.

A student may have multiple exclusions in the same year. Nine of the 45 schools were part of the Outwood Grange academy trust, a multi-academy trust that runs 30 schools across Yorkshire, the Humber and the east Midlands.If your child has been suspended from school we’d like to hear from you. How long were they excluded for? What are your concerns about the rise in school exclusions? If you\u0027re a teacher we\u0027d also like to hear your experiences.

A spokesman for the trust said it had taken over “some of the toughest schools in England” and repeatedly turned around their performance. He said that in many cases, the schools it had taken over had previously been excluding high numbers of children informally, meaning the increase in the number of official exclusions was misleading.The trust said pupils at Outwood academy Ormesby had beaten the school’s GCSE record for the last three years and that the school was oversubscribed. It pointed to an Ofsted report that praised the school for “bringing about change and improvement successfully, and at remarkable speed”.“Fixed-term exclusions are never issued for ‘minor’ incidents, but may result from a student’s poor choice of reaction or response to a reasonable request,” it said.Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, said the fact that some schools were recording such high rates of suspension “should be a matter of huge concern to the government, and to the schools affected”.Some people believe schools are increasingly “playing” the system – getting rid of students who might do badly in their GCSEs and compromise the school’s performance in league tables.In June, an Ofsted investigation into the practice of “off-rolling” – where pupils disappear from the school register just before GCSEs – found that more than 19,000 pupils who were in year 10 in 2016 had vanished from the school roll by the start of year 11, the year when pupils sit their GCSEs.Figures published by the Department for Education last month found that there were more than 40 permanent exclusions a day (total of 7,700) during the 2016-17 school year, compared with a little over 35 a day the previous year. Fixed-term exclusions increased by about 40,000, to a total of 382,000, meaning nearly one in 20 pupils were given a fixed-period exclusion in that school year.In March the DfE launched a review into school exclusions, led by the former Conservative MP and children’s minister Edward Timpson. The government said the review would “explore how head teachers use exclusion in practice, and why some groups of pupils are more likely to be excluded”, but that it would not examine exclusion powers. It is expected to report by the end of the year.The launch of the review came after Cathryn Kirby, Ofsted’s regional director for the North East, Yorkshire and the Humber, wrote to secondary headteachers in the region to complain about the high rates of fixed-period.“Schools should only ever use exclusions as a last resort,” she said. “If not properly applied, being removed from school can disrupt a child’s education and affect their future life chances.”Secondary schools in Middlesbrough gave the highest number of fixed term exclusions of any local authority area in the last academic year, handing them to 11.67 pupils in 100. Doncaster and Barnsley also excluded more than one in ten pupils from secondary schools.Yorkshire and the Humber saw the most fixed-term exclusions of any region in the country, with an overall rate of 5.8 per 100 pupils. Inner London had the second highest rate (5.3 in 100) and the north east the third highest (4.9 in 100).Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said that it was deeply concerning to hear that so many schools were excluding such high numbers of pupils.“Real-terms funding cuts have forced schools to make behavioural and specialist learning support assistants redundant, many of whom supported pupils at risk of exclusion, including those with special educational needs or disabilities (SEND),” he said. “Alongside this, schools have lost external support because of the funding cuts to local authority specialist support services.“The reasons for a huge variance in rates of permanent and fixed term exclusions need to be examined carefully. However, it is clear that the competitive and fragmented system produced by the academy reforms encourages schools to compete for the pupils most likely to get high grades and increase exclusions of pupils who may be more challenging to teach.”A spokesperson for the Department for Education said the decision to exclude should be reasonable and fair, and that permanent exclusion should only ever be used as a last resort. “Statutory guidance also states that schools should consider the underlying causes of poor behaviour before excluding a pupil,” they said.“While we know that there has been an increase in exclusions there are still fewer than the peak ten years ago. We have launched an externally led review to look at how exclusions are used and why certain groups are disproportionally affected.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18fa31a4cb17a2957af126015d4e91df6c639a04/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3bbceea87152665de98610fff17d3f06","title":"english school outwood academy fixed term exclusions pupils","story":"Concern grows for children at school with England’s highest rate of fixed-term exclusionsSarah and David have lost count of the number of times their 15-year-old daughter was sent home from her school in Middlesbrough last year. “I’d do the five-minute drive to drop her off at school and not even get home before the school rang to tell me to come and pick her up because she had been excluded,” Sarah said.The girl’s offences ranged from tinting her eyebrows and keeping her coat on indoors to wearing black trainers after she hurt her foot. “When we were at school, you would never get excluded unless you set off the fire alarm or you did something really, really serious,” Sarah said. “Whereas now, if you go in with the wrong-coloured socks or have a coloured bobble in your hair, you get sent home.”While the trust argues that it has turned around the fortunes of some of the toughest schools in England, parents told the  the schools were run like military academies, with children being excluded for what they considered minor offences.The report notes that while the proportion of pupils receiving fixed-term exclusions was high, “some pupils still have to learn the consequence of disrupting others’ education”.Andy McDonald, the MP for Middlesbrough, said the exclusion rates at Outwood Academy Ormesby should have alarm bells ringing though the school had produced good results. Sarah and David said though their daughter was not violent and did not use bad language, she was defiant – a word used repeatedly in the trust’s behaviour policy – and that a period of regular exclusions coincided with her mother attempting suicide. “I understand that they need to educate other kids as well, but she deserves an education just as much as the next child, and if she’s struggling with something, whether it’s in her private life or not, she needs help,” said David, her stepfather. Another woman told the  her teenage son was excluded from the school 43 times in the space of the last academic year. “There’s a lack of support for kids with different needs,” she said. “Not every kid is on the same level, but the school thinks it is all about grades and not about the needs of the inidual kid.”Julia Cherrett, a Liberal Democrat councillor for the Bishopgarth and Elm Tree ward that includes the school, said she had been concerned by stories she was hearing from parents since the school became an academy.“I fully support any school in raising standards and aspirations among its pupils and teaching respect for others,” she said. “But when I hear of pupils not being allowed to remove their blazers in class in the extreme summer heat, while teachers are not wearing jackets, and pupils being told to remove jewellery while staff continue to wear earrings and necklaces, I do wonder what this says about ‘mutual respect’.” A Facebook group called Outwood Academy – Unhappy Parents of Pupils documents a stream of anecdotes of parents whose children are at schools run by the trust and have been handed exclusions for apparently minor things. One parent complained that her child had been excluded for having a toilet break that was deemed too long. Another said theirs had been excluded for forgetting their school planner.“I think it’s horrendous. It’s failing to educate my child … I’ve no idea why they have this policy because it’s not working. The amount of kids that you see getting excluded for silly things is unreal. They will get excluded for wearing nail varnish or makeup.” A spokesperson for Outwood Grange academies trust said in many cases, schools they had taken over had previously been excluding high numbers of children without recording it, meaning that the increase in the number of exclusions at their schools shown in official figures was misleading.“Our expectations of student behaviour are high but our approach is far from zero tolerance with the wealth of help and support we give our students,” it said. “The trust’s behaviour policy is discussed with parentscarers when the trust first takes on a school. Fixed-term exclusions are never issued for minor incidents, but may result from a student’s poor choice of reaction or response to a reasonable request.“A student’s academic ability is never a factor in exclusions, exclusions only happen where there are breaches of the schools’ published behaviour policy. Following a fixed-term exclusion, all students have a reintegration meeting at which the academy will explore the support and actions needed by staff to help students continue to succeed on their education journey with us.”The trust said that over time, “as we change the aspirations and culture of the schools”, it expected exclusions to decrease in their schools.

In 2004, during the height of Sydney’s last water shortage during the millennium drought they fell to 234 gigalitres.But on Friday, at a budget estimates hearing, chief executive of New South Wales water David Harris said that if inflows “continue along the path they’ve been going in the last couple of months” this year’s total amount into the catchment would be only 83 gigalitres.“We’ve had drought and water security issues in Sydney in the past but this is unprecedented, he said.It comes as further scrutiny is placed on Sydney’s long-dormant desalination plant at Kurnell.The plant has been in “water security mode” since 2012 when it was sold by the current Liberal government on a 50-year lease to a private consortium split 50-50 between Hastings Funds Management and the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, based in Canada.In that time the plant has been in a deep state of preservation, with sea inlets capped and the majority of the plant dried out.But at the same time the NSW government has paid out hundreds of millions of dollars a year on what’s called an “availability charge”.When up and running, the cost of the plant to Sydney Water would be $237.4 million per year year, or $129 per household.But while its mothballed, Sydney Water still pays out hundreds of millions of dollars to cover the plant’s future availability.Until last year that availability charge was costing taxpayers about $190 million per year.After the Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal reorganised the fee in 2017, Sydney Water says it now pays about $175 million to keep the plant ready to switch on.The value for money of that fee is now under question.The utilities minister Don Harwin has maintained that the plant – which was damaged by storms in 2015 – will be ready to be switched on by December.But officials at Water NSW have told  Australia that if the inflows don’t improve its more likely the trigger will be hit in November.Either way, this week the  revealed that it could be a year before the desalination plant is at full operational capacity.Stuart Khan, an expert in water security from the University of NSW, said the private operators “should be held” to the agreement.“We’ve signed up to a financial agreement that involves NSW water customers forking out a lot of money. If the terms of the agreement is that the plant going to be maintained in a condition where it’s ready to go when we need then we need to make sure the plant is held to that arrangement,” he said.“It would be like paying for house insurance and when your home burns down the insurer says well we might build you a house in six months.“We’ve been keeping up our side of the bargain and they need to too.”Khan has long been critical of Sydney’s approach to water security, and says a more mature conversation about the use of other sources such as recycled water is necessary.“In the short term we’ve seen our water supply system is very effective in getting through serious droughts like the millennium drought,” he said.“But there are two major factors in the future that will change that. The first is climate change, which I see as an uncertain change – we don’t know what’s going to happen. But the other one is population growth. We’re going to see millions of extra people in the Sydney basin over the next 50 years, double the current population of Sydney, and that’s obviously going to have a big impact on water security and water demand.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3728b09d46d1cd3272ac120b9b7cebd679d8ec7c/0_0_2764_1843/master/2764.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b5adaab869c74c7b906e399af8fd3097 1760w","title":"a star is born review lady gaga bradley cooper","story":"Bradley Cooper directs and co-stars in this outrageously watchable update of the love story doomed by shifting fameIt’s the romantic epic of male sacrificial woundedness and it’s been regenerating like Doctor Who. We had it in 1976 with Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson, in 1954 with Judy Garland and James Mason and originally way back in 1937 with Janet Gaynor and Fredric March. It’s even been regenerating obliquely in movies such as The Artist and La La Land. Now Bradley Cooper plays the boozy and downwardly mobile alpha-star laying his pride on the showbiz altar of the woman he loves. Cooper directs and co-stars in this outrageously watchable and colossally enjoyable new version, supercharged with dilithium crystals of pure melodrama. He appears opposite a sensationally good Lady Gaga, whose ability to be part ordinary person, part extraterrestrial celebrity empress functions at the highest level at all times.Here is the heart-wrenching gallantry of the grumpy, drunken singing star teetering over the apex of his fame, who discovers an unconventionally beautiful, talented young woman – single-handedly launching her on a glorious career while his own spirals downwards, redeeming his own former arrogance with this magnificently selfless act. He must accept the fate of being the embarrassing loser and has-been, finally not even allowed to be the wind beneath her wings.Cooper and veteran screenwriter Eric Roth are clearly inspired most directly by the StreisandKristofferson film. But in those closeups that Cooper awards himself, and his huge moments of emotional agony … well, he’s channelling a bit of Judy. He certainly de-machos the role, and creates a backstory of vulnerability. Yet the crunch question is: how are Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper going to reinvent that terrifying award-ceremony scene, when he embarrasses her publicly? Well, the climax of their ordeal is bigger than I ever thought possible. It’s the final station of the cross.Cooper takes his voice down a couple of octaves to play Jackson Maine, a gravel-toned MOR country-rocker doing stadium tours and keeping it together with huge amounts of booze and pills. He’s still a big success, but personally and emotionally he’s running on empty. (Cooper actually co-writes a few of his songs here, and his band is played by Neil Young’s longtime backing group: Lukas Nelson \u0026amp Promise of the Real.) He’s also suffering from encroaching deafness and tinnitus, which periodically bring him close to anxiety attacks and temper tantrums. He has to be shepherded by his manager and older brother, Bobby, played by Sam Elliott, for whom he has longstanding feelings of resentment, rivalry and guilt.Out of booze after a show one night, Jackson has his driver pull over when he spots what turns out to be a drag bar, where the boss lets a woman sing in non-drag: this is the extraordinarily talented Ally (Lady Gaga), who socks over a killer version of La Vie En Rose. Jackson is stunned, as well he might be. They have an adventure together and Ally’s unimpressed attitude to celebrity and her vocational attitude to music entrances Jackson. He falls deeply in love, even showing up at the family home, where she mortifyingly still lives with her dad, played by Andrew Dice Clay. Jackson finally gets her up on stage with him for a duet, and her greatness is obvious, but a dark shadow falls when she is approached by creepy Brit talent manager Rez (Rafi Gavron), under whose tutelage Ally seriously blows up. She is writer, singer, dancer and sex bomb. Poor Jackson is fame 1.0 and he realises Ally is fame 2.0, and the crunch comes when he is humiliatingly bumped from a promised opening slot at the Grammys, singing a tribute cover to Roy Orbison – of all the tellingly obsolete bygone stars. Ally, meanwhile, is up for three awards that very same evening.Cooper is arguably prettier than Lady Gaga, but she is the one who commands your attention: that sharp, quizzical, leonine, mesmeric face – an uningratiating face, very different from the wide-eyed openness of Streisand or Garland. (Weirdly, she rather more resembles Marta Heflin, playing the groupie-slash-interviewer who went to bed with Kristofferson in ’76.) Her songs are gorgeous and the ingenuous openness of her scenes with Jackson are wonderfully sympathetic. Meanwhile Cooper, whose screen persona can so often be bland and unchallenging, makes precisely this conservative tendency work for him in the role. He is so sad you want to hug him. Arguably, this film fudges some of Jackson’s dark side, by giving him partial deafness as well as alcoholism, but it is still a richly sympathetic spectacle.For all that it’s hokum, this film alludes tactlessly to something pretty real. It could be called: A Star Is Dying. The new generation supplants the existing one. For one star to get an award, a handful of defeated nominees have to swallow their pain, as the spotlight moves away from them. For one star to deliver the shock of the new, another one has to receive the shock of the old. A Star Is Born turns that transaction into a love story.• A Star is Born has premiered at the Venice film festival and is released in the UK and US on 5 October"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6dd52c1c0700f45f20fb93f1edf8849949e4be56/0_0_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f2a73dade94756e15d13df23b4cf36a5","title":"waste not tomato vine sauce passata","story":"Cooking tomato vines into a sauce gives a great boost of flavour – try it to make your own passataTomatoes taste best when grown in the sun, picked fresh off the vine and sprinkled with a touch of salt to bring out the taste of sunshine. But did you know the vine itself has an intense, tomatoey flavour that can be used as an ingredient to intensify the flavour of a sauce? It’s a neat trick when the tomatoes aren’t quite up to par and are in need of a flavour injection.Overripe and soft tomatoes make the best sauce: sweet, rich and full of flavour. Indulge in British tomatoes in late summer, when they are plentiful and the sun is strong enough to give them flavour. Avoid them in winter because heated greenhouses use excessive energy to farm them. Instead, go Italian, either by abstaining until next season or by making your own passata, which will last long into the winter. It takes just a few minutes to make, and preserves any ripe tomatoes you might have or want to buy while they are cheap – and is handy to have in the fridge ready to use in any number of dishes and boost the flavour of a meal no end.Bring a large pan of water to a boil. Add the tomatoes and the vine, if you have it, return to a boil, then boil for two minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer the tomatoes to a colander, then pass through a mouli or blend to a rough puree. To remove the pips and skin, pass the puree through a sieve otherwise, pour the passata into sterilised bottles, and add the tomato vine for flavour. If you are going to use it in the next couple of weeks, store in the fridge otherwise, preserve the sauce using the hot-water bath preservation method."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5be3bb1c09d8165136e8d56c457bb0cca7eb030c/0_276_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=631dde4776b59459cad5ed8ef02167d2","title":"abu dhabi ownership transformed manchester city decade","story":"From toilets with no doors and ‘the Temple of Doom’, City have made other top clubs fearful of an era of dominance at home and in EuropeIt was the look on Mark Hughes’s face that lingered in the memory. His first press conference since that seminal day – 1 September 2008 – when Manchester City came under the ownership of the Abu Dhabi royal family. Hughes was behind his desk in the manager’s office, trying to make sense of it all, and occasionally looking up to the whiteboard where Robinho’s name had been added to his team for their weekend game. Robinho? No words were necessary.Everything was very different at Manchester City back then. The greeting at the main entrance came in the Glaswegian accent of Jim Corbett, a former bombardier, in the hut he had decorated with posters of Ricky Hatton, rather than the welcome you can expect today from a small battalion of security guards, with their walkie-talkies, blazers and dangling earpieces.City did not even include a trophy cabinet when they moved into the Commonwealth Games stadium in 2003. All their collectables, including a porcelain cow, were stored in a dimly lit room and nobody should be surprised that when Vincent Kompany arrived with the most fortuitous timing, 10 days before the takeover, he can remember the dressing-room toilet did not even have a door. The groundsman, Lee Jackson, will tell you City were so skint he did not have enough white paint to do the lines on the pitch.And, despite everything, there was something rather endearing about City in the years before the money, when it was Manchester’s other club. “Manchester City has long been perceived as a ‘friendly’ club,” Mark Hodkinson writes in the book, Blue Moon, that offers the most insightful account, going back to the late 1990s. “In stereotypical terms, United is your out-of-town hypermarket, faceless, homogenised and shamelessly avaricious, while City is your friendly corner shop, all ‘how are you?’ and ‘nice-to-see-you’ love.”But City were also a club that dipped in and out of crisis, with a finely tuned reputation for magnificent failure, usually in comical circumstances. Their final game of the 2007-08 season was a nine-goal thriller at Middlesbrough. The problem was Middlesbrough scored eight. The wind howled, the curtains trembled. Kompany can also recall wondering why there was no coffee machine at the training ground. “We can do you a cup of tea,” he was told. But coffee? No, pal, not at this club.City were football’s Slapstick XI and the idea they were about to become the richest club on the planet felt rather perplexing for those of us who had covered their bleakest times and remembered Sir Alex Ferguson listing United’s rivals, in order, as Liverpool, Arsenal and Leeds. City tended not to get a mention unless Paul Hince, the chief sports writer and long-suffering Blue, was there from the Manchester Evening News and Ferguson wanted the latest from “the Temple of Doom”.Yet here we are, 10 years to the day, and maybe it is easier to understand now what Hughes meant about City wanting to be “bigger than the Big Four” (albeit with him not lasting too long under the new regime). Maybe Pelé was being a touch harsh when he said Robinho “needs serious counselling” for choosing City. Perhaps we journalists should not have sniggered when Garry Cook, City’s accident-prone chairman in those days of change, told us they would, in time, be the top team in Manchester. Cook came out with that line when the Premier League and Champions League trophies were United’s possessions, with Cristiano Ronaldo about to win his first Ballon d’Or and an advert for MUTV showing a skip outside Old Trafford, filled with empty cans of silver polish. It turns out Cook knew more than us, after all.Bernard Halford, the club’s life president, was there on the night everything changed, as the man who signed off the Robinho deal. “The papers went through at 10 minutes to midnight and there were fans outside, driving around the stadium, beeping their horns,” he recalls. “For City to spend £32m on a player was unheard of. A year before that, we’d have expected the entire team to cost £32m.”Halford’s association with City goes back to 1972 when he was appointed as the club secretary. He has worked with 22 managers (excluding caretakers), the last being Manuel Pellegrini, been through five relegations, five promotions and, pre-2008, toasted one solitary trophy. He is 77 now and better qualified than anyone to talk about the transformation of Manchester’s football landscape.“The biggest thing that tells you what we’ve become is when you’re in your car. I used to drive from Royton, where I lived, to Maine Road and I’d count how many shirts or scarves I’d see. Kids on zebra crossings, walking to school, that sort of thing. Red or blue? United or City? They outnumbered us, considerably. Not now, though. Now it can be 10-0, or even more.”Not everything has run as intended since Sheikh Mansour added the club to his portfolio. Cook’s 83-page blueprint pledged to turn them into “the Virgin of Asia and the world” with their own line of energy drinks, City-branded Mini Coopers, scooters, telephone cards, designer clothing stores and a chain of City Eating fast-food restaurants.Those plans never took off and – no apologies for repeating this story – Cook’s greatest moment came early on, discussing transfer targets with the new owners on a crackling telephone line from Abu Dhabi to Manchester. A comment about “it’s getting messy” was misheard and Cook immediately fired off a £30m bid to Barcelona. Apparently, he heard the instruction, amid all the excitement, as “let’s get Messi”.Likewise, perhaps you remember Sulaiman al-Fahim, Abu Dhabi’s equivalent of the old Harry Enfield Loadsamoney character, who fronted up the takeover and talked about making a £135m bid for Cristiano Ronaldo, as well as going for just about every other superstar footballer who might be available. Ronaldinho, Thierry Henry and Fernando Torres were all namechecked. “Ronaldo has said he wants to play for the biggest club in the world, so we will see if he is serious,” Fahim said.To give them their due, Abu Dhabi quickly realised it needed a different approach. Fahim was sidelined and, PR-wise, City have got more right than wrong on the upward trajectory, featuring three Premier League titles, one FA Cup, three League Cups, 11 trips to Wembley, Sergio Agüero in the 94th minute, David Silva, Yaya Touré, Kevin De Bruyne, the 6-1 at Old Trafford, Carlos Tevez and Welcome to Manchester, Pep Guardiola and the Centurions, Mario Balotelli and Why Always Me?As anniversaries go, not everyone will wish to celebrate. Critics will question whether the mind-boggling amounts of money have been good for the sport as a whole. Abu Dhabi’s human rights record will conjure up headlines of a different kind and, as long as that remains the case, there will be misgivings about the people at the top of the empire.At City, though, the most prominent banner inside the stadium is to thank Sheikh Mansour and, though Robinho stayed only 15 months, it was the Brazilian’s signing that made the rest of the football take notice. City gazumped Chelsea in the process, making it the first time Roman Abramovich had ever been outmuscled in the transfer market. There was also a late attempt – unsuccessful – to hijack Dimitar Berbatov’s move from Tottenham Hotspur to Manchester United.And, yes, Kompany can also report that it is possible now to get his brew of choice. “It was like one of those television makeover shows where they are building stuff and then there’s the big reveal. We went away for the international break and they changed everything at the training ground. I don’t know how they did it so fast. Next thing you know, we had this massive coffee machine come in from Nespresso. I think it was used so much it needed to go in for maintenance after two weeks. I said: ‘I told you coffee would work here.’”Those pitches are leased now to Bury of League Two. In the old days, City trained at Platt Lane, in the heart of Moss Side, where the local drunks would gather by the fence to shout abuse as the players jogged by. Now, there is a village-sized training ground opposite the Etihad Stadium and, as Halford says, it is a “buzzing area” full of new opportunities.“It’s beyond a football supporter’s dream, Alice in Wonderland stuff, and it’s not just the football team, it’s everything the sheikh has created for the city of Manchester,” Halford adds. “We’re top of everything – community schemes, job creation in what was a deprived area, our training ground, our academy. It’s not just a snowflake on the river, it’s long term.”And the next 10 years? That perhaps is the era that should frighten City’s rivals the most. “You can only see more pots on the shelf and, before long, the Champions League,” Halford says. “That would be the ultimate dream. And when we’ve won it, we’d say: ‘We want to win it again next year? Can we do it again? And again?’ We want to be up there with the great Real Madrid and Barcelona sides.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87384958183e84b9c10dd6fd00a0c4e59ec24aa5/0_333_4779_2867/master/4779.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d2915832ffa10c4ed96bbf296c03572","title":"england wales womens world cup qualifier match report","story":"Whether it was helped by the waistcoat Phil Neville was wearing or down to something he said at the interval, the manager eventually got the reaction he wanted from his England players as they safely negotiated a potentially awkward evening in Newport to book their place at next summer’s Women’s World Cup finals in France.Toni Duggan, Jill Scott and Nikita Parris scored the second-half goals that underlined the gulf in class between the two nations on a night when Wales, whose team is made up predominantly of part-time players, saw their hopes of qualifying for the World Cup at the expense of England shattered.Dogged, resilient and combative until half-time, Wales were blown away in 12 second-half minutes as England started to play with much more conviction and go through the gears. All three goals arrived in that exhilarating spell as the game threatened to turn into an exercise in damage-limitation for Wales and in particular their goalkeeper, Laura O’Sullivan, who endured a difficult second half.Wales, to their credit, kept going and can take huge satisfaction from a campaign that ended with them playing in front of a record crowd of 5,000 and also with a glimmer of hope that they could still seize one of the four World Cup play-off berths if results go their way in the remaining qualifiers.England were just too good for them here, though, especially after the interval, when they moved the ball much more quickly and piled on the pressure. Duggan’s goal had been coming in that respect and it was no real surprise when England quickly added a second through Scott’s looping header. A mistake by O’Sullivan at her near post led to Parris nodding in England’s third.Neville sounded pleased rather than relieved with the outcome, almost as if he never doubted that his players would deliver if they stuck to their beliefs. “I wanted to see my players play to their ability and I think you saw that in the second half,” the England manager said. “You saw them play like one of the best teams in the world, with control, with one- and two-touch passing, with a bit of flair and enjoyment, and these are the characteristics that we want to take forward.”It says everything about how this game was viewed in Wales that the tickets sold out within 24 hours of going on sale. Rodney Parade, the home of Newport County, was packed to the rafters and the Wales manager, Jayne Ludlow, had not left a stone unturned in terms of trying to exploit every advantage possible. The dimensions of the pitch were reduced to make the playing surface as small as possible and Wales turned down England’s request to water the pitch beforehand.Yet the biggest thing in Wales’s favour in the opening stages was a poor offside decision. Parris reacted quickest to stab home after Alex Greenwood’s deflected shot hit the crossbar but England’s celebrations were cut short because of the assistant referee’s flag. Television replays confirmed that Parris had been clearly onside.Although Greenwood impressed with her desire to get forward on the left and Jordan Nobbs moved the ball intelligently at the base of the England midfield, the visitors lost their way a little after that early chance. England were dominating possession but their passing was slow and prosaic, playing into the hands of a Wales team that sat deep and defended in numbers.Asked what he said to his players at the interval to get such a positive response in the second half, Neville said: “Relax. If we’re going to get affected by what’s going on around us at Rodney Parade, what chance have we got playing in a World Cup final in Lyon? So I wanted them to relax and stick to the game plan – that was the biggest message all week.”The breakthrough arrived shortly before the hour mark. O’Sullivan came off her line to try to deal with a cross from Nobbs, Fran Kirby shifted the loose ball on to Duggan and the winger expertly opened up her body to steer in a right-footed shot from inside the area. Wales were still reeling from that setback when they conceded a second. Lucy Bronze lofted the ball into the area and Scott, totally unmarked, sent a looping header over the stranded O’Sullivan.Wales knew the game was in effect over and so did the home supporters, who had got behind their team so fervently in the opening 45 minutes. England, however, were not finished. O’Sullivan was unable to deal with Greenwood’s free-kick and the ball popped up for Jodie Taylor to set up Parris, who nodded home the third."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5588fb60bef281482a0910da5ca8682df8c746ba/528_256_3045_1827/master/3045.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78d63904a6e9b767d5b22f6dde3bd454","title":"more mourinho mithering and saido berahino scores football weekly extra","story":"Max is joined by Barry Glendenning, Andy Brassell and Lars Sivertsen to discuss Mourinho (again), Carabao Cup action, Declan Rice’s international dilemma, Hal Robson-Kanu’s international retirement and flesh-eating ratsJoin the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

But together they showed me how to navigate the contradictions of my identityIt was a glorious July afternoon and my Arab grandmother – Teta, we called her – was being daubed liberally with margarine by my Scottish grandmother. On a goofy impulse, Teta had climbed inside an inflatable rubber ring and become stuck. We all took turns trying to budge it, but she was lodged firmly. So, Granny retrieved a tub of marge. My grandmothers wept with laughter as Granny smeared Teta with grease until the ring popped off like a champagne cork. We all cheered. Teta decided not to go swimming after all.When my parents met in the 1980s, they were newly arrived in England. My father was a posh international graduate student from Beirut and my mother was a working-class Scottish girl doing night shifts in the local pub while working as a librarian. They were married in a civil and a Muslim service, where my grandparents exchanged gifts to symbolise the union of our families: a kilt and a jellaba.My siblings and I grew up in London and negotiated our ided identity with no small amount of confusion and crisis. Our grandparents represented the extreme split in our heritage. We spent a summer under Israeli bombardment in Beirut with my Arab grandparents we spent winter evenings tucked up next to a gas fire eating mince and tatties with my Scottish grandparents. I had rarely seen my grandmothers in the same room until one year we decided to take a joint family holiday in Cornwall. I was 10.My grandmothers were my heroes in different ways. A chain-smoking maverick in a pinafore, Granny was from a small mining village in the middle of Scotland. She was a snooker connoisseur with a lusty baritone and a love of grisly police procedurals. Tirelessly productive, she crocheted blankets at a rate of one a day. Granny believed in fortification against discomfort she was a consummate master of the cosy. On cold evenings, she would warm our beds with an electric blanket and a hot-water bottle, then tuck us in so tightly that we lay bound to the bed, sweating and gasping for breath.My other grandmother is the most eccentric person I have met. Irreverent and misleadingly ditzy, she gleefully stole from hotels, trespassed for wild flowers and drove like a Beiruti speed racer. Teta was from a privileged background: she had grown up in a mansion and was the sister of a Lebanese prime minister. She was well educated and sophisticated. She had an ear for classical music, spoke three languages fluently and performed calculations in French. She was a friend of Kim Philby and Patricia Highsmith, but, if you asked her questions about the glamorous people she had met, she would produce breathless and giggly anecdotes about their pets.The summer we arranged the joint holiday, I counted down the days until I would be cosseted by so much grandmotherly attention. But, in the weeks leading up to the trip, I began to worry. Granny did not like to go swimming or go on walks. Granny went to church Teta cackled at the idea of mosque. Granny cooked Teta had a cook. In the narcissistic preoccupation of identity politics, my siblings and I assessed each other against a roving scale of categorisations: were we like Granny – pragmatic, stoic, competent? Or were we fussy, flamboyant and impulsive, like Teta?The summer began and we piled into a huge rented house. Granny was palpably nervous – she did not know how to be lazy. I had seen photos of my mother’s childhood holidays, with Granny wrapped in a blanket and a woollen hat on a grey pebbled beach. It was probably August. But now that we had secured a summer vacation with nothing for her to do, or fix, or crochet, Granny could not sit still. “It’ll just take a minute,” was her perpetual refrain as she leapt to her feet to adjust cushions or make cups of tea. Teta was the youngest of 12 she had grown up with an army of sibling caretakers, while Granny had been a lifelong caregiver. Teta was enthusiastic about the luxury of leisure time. Each evening, she counted down to the curfew of a permissible whisky, while Granny perched on the edge of her seat, unable to give herself permission to relax.One Saturday, I dragged them on an expedition to the tiny, slanted high street. I had an ulterior motive for the outing: a lurid confection I had spied in the window of a sweet shop. Vivid pink with a stripe of white through the middle, it conjured the Enid Blyton magic of a bucolic childhood I never experienced, as I grew up in the middle of London. I fantasised about this treat for days – I was delirious for it. When the afternoon arrived for a special outing to the shop, I was half-crazed with anticipation. After my first mouthful, however, I broke into grief-stricken tears. It was coconut-flavoured. I sobbed. The pink and white stripes did not taste different at all. I was devastated. A betrayal! My grandmothers locked eyes. “Don’t waste it,” they said in unison.While food waste hardly seems a foundation for a friendship, it was the first time I had seen them agree wholeheartedly. Their parsimony about food immediately became a point of solidarity. Teta would cut around putrid sores in fruit and then nibble them up: “Mmm,” she would say, “delicious.” Granny sawed the burnt crusts off my toast and then crunched them herself. That summer, Teta and Granny commandeered the kitchen. The meals were delicious, but the leftovers were a plague. During each meal, they were dutifully returned to the Tupperware, the same plate of rice and peas hardened into a glistening shell. Dingy rags of chicken skin sat in saucers of stiff dripping. Table crumbs were scattered on the lawn for the birds. At restaurants, Teta would fold tiny scraps into her napkin and hide them in her handbag, bringing them out again at home with a flourish. “Look,” she would cry, “liver!”Over pots of boiling stock, my grandmothers shared jokes and stories, poking fun at us, at themselves. Despite their differences, they shared histories of personal struggles. Two of Teta’s houses and their entire contents had been bombed and occupied. Granny had worked her entire life, securing her financial independence through difficult jobs: at a petrol station at a hospital, where she washed and prepared bodies after death. Teta was a breast cancer survivor. But their tragedies were discussed with a shared insouciant challenge to authority, an irreverent form of defiant resilience. Granny’s osteoarthritis pained her every move, but good luck to anyone who suggested she sit down and relax. With cheerful enthusiasm, Teta encouraged us to play catch with her prosthetic breast.At the time, I had been afraid that my grandmothers’ differences were an omen of something incongruent about me and my siblings. While I know as an adult that mixed-race families are not a magic solution to racism, as a child their friendship seemed to validate our bothness. One Sunday, when Granny made pancakes still lemony from washing-up liquid left in the pan, she and Teta sat down and ate the whole pile together. Watching them scoff and laugh and gobble up inedible pancakes acted as reassurance for my childish anxieties that it was possible to be Scottish and Arab, Presbyterian and Muslim that we could navigate the contradictions through squabbling, forgiving, loving and Tupperware.My grandmothers died within months of each other in 2004. In a total coincidence, Teta was buried next to a gravestone sharing Granny’s name. I think of their friendship whenever I scoop a froth of mould from the top of jam or boil up carrot shavings for stock. And I am still surprised that they agreed to waste the margarine."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4be4ea7ecadd989f025b40a5faf39fc98a04ee9/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=afc588e47fe0a539efb7859b3b3cdf7e","title":"blind date marcus emmy","story":"What were you hoping for?To meet my future first wife.

Jones was in insecure employment on a zero-hours contract in 2011 when he turned to Britain’s then biggest payday lender. There was a lull in work and he “needed something to tide me over” while he waited for his finances to pick up.He cannot recall how much he borrowed in total. Asked if it was several hundred pounds, he said it may well have been more than that. Later, however, he obtained more secure permanent work and was eventually able to pay off what he owed.In 2011, the year Jones became a Wonga customer, the company posted good figures: its profits tripled to £45.8m on revenues of £185m as the firm issued almost 2.5m loans. The following year the company told employees that by 2015 it could be valued at £15bn. However, in 2014 Wonga had a traumatic year: it was embroiled in scandal for sending out fake legal letters, ordered to pay millions in compensation and forced to write off £220m of debts owed by 330,000 borrowers. Then in 2015, regulator-imposed price caps on payday loans were introduced. The firm never recovered from that sequence of events, with waves of compensation claims playing a critical role in its demise.Jones was one of those who was compensated at that time and he received in the region of £800. In a tweet on Thursday referring to the Labour MP Stella Creasy, a leading campaigner against payday loans, he said: “Incredibly proud of the campaign @stellacreasy ran on this, fell in the trap myself and it was compensation from Wonga that helped me break the cycle.”Jones now works full time and since 2016 he has been a Labour councillor on East Staffordshire borough council.He acknowledged Wonga “was something that filled a gap in the market”, adding that with its instant decision loans it was “an easy, overly accessible way to access credit when you need it ... almost too easy”. At the same time, he said, it “preyed” on people who might not have been able to access other forms of credit.He added: “There needs to be some sort of campaign to make credit unions more accessible.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26f34e41314891bd13d6216309124fa00c54bf98/0_0_1350_900/master/1350.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab3e85da3ae4fcd68a3bb01fde2378f3 700w","title":"lana del rey pulls out of israeli festival after backlash","story":"Singer had been pressured to cancel show most Palestinians would not be allowed to watchLana Del Rey has pulled out of a music festival in Israel next week in the wake of a backlash over her decision to perform.The American singer was to have been one of the headline performers at the Meteor festival from 6 to 8 September. It is being held on a kibbutz in northern Israel that most Palestinians would not be permitted to attend.In a tweet on Friday, Del Rey said she wanted to play for both Palestinian and Israeli fans, but it had not been possible to “line up both visits with such short notice”.She had therefore decided to postpone her appearance at the festival until it was possible to “schedule visits for both my Israeli and Palestinian fans, as well as hopefully other countries in the region”.“I’m doing my best to navigate the waters of the constant tumultuous hardships in the war-torn countries all over the world that I travel through monthly.”Del Rey had come under pressure from the Palestine Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel to change her decision: “We doubt that you would have played in apartheid South Africa likewise, artists refuse to play in apartheid Israel.”The pressure group welcomed her decision to withdraw in a tweet on Friday night:A petition launched jointly by Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel and Jewish Voice for Peace had gathered nearly 15,000 signatures, and the campaign also spawned the Twitter hashtag #LanaDontGo.Del Rey joins the likes of Lorde in deciding not to perform in Israel in protest over its government’s treatment of Palestinians and its military action in Palestine.However, last November Nick Cave said he was making “a principled stand against anyone who tries to censor and silence musicians” and complained of “a sort of public humiliation from Roger Waters and co” for those who do choose to play in Israel.Radiohead went ahead with a concert in Tel Aviv in July 2017, with Thom Yorke arguing that “playing in a country isn’t the same as endorsing its government … We don’t endorse Netanyahu any more than Trump, but we still play in America.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0904d2c94743cdc1087b92708bc5fc38f5cf857/0_47_1935_1383/master/1935.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=88063744dbd113268fe7ba78be548985 2020w","title":"bristol bath premiership match report","story":"The Gallagher Premiership season still has nine months to run but the newly styled Bristol Bears are already up and roaring. If proof were needed that Pat Lam’s promoted side will be no easybeats it duly materialised in front of a record stadium crowd as the hosts gave their old rivals Bath a rousing West Country hurry-up.On this evidence Bristol’s positivity will be an adornment to the league, even if they briefly made heavy weather of defending an early 9-0 lead against a Bath squad coated in a fair amount of early-season rust. The critical breakthrough finally arrived with seven minutes left when a juggling Alapati Leiua ed over in the left corner, rewarding his team for their spirit, endeavour and superior skills.A lot of water has flowed under the Clifton Suspension Bridge since Bristol were a real force in the rugby world but something is definitely stirring beside the Avon Gorge. Lam’s team have a gleaming home ground to match any in the league and are not going to sit passively by and wait for others to determine their fate. With their captain, Steven Luatua, in indomitable mood and their Irish fly-half Ian Madigan slotting four penalties this was a perfect launchpad to a campaign which will be well worth watching.Bristolians are crying out for a rugby team good enough to compete at the top end of the table and would love to be annoyingly noisy M4 neighbours as far as Bath are concerned. Hence the vital importance of this gala first night. In perfect conditions there were plenty of inevitable early nerves but Bristol’s intent was obvious. Luatua was a conspicuous presence from the outset and Madigan’s ninth-minute penalty duly rewarded the Bears for their positive start.There was further encouragement for the home support when Rhys Priestland, who missed two costly penalties, saw his first attempt bounce away off an upright. Bath then squandered a certain try when a mortified Tom Homer saw the ball slip from his grasp in the act of touching down with no defenders in the vicinity. “It was a game we let slip through our fingers and we’ll rue our mistakes,” sighed Bath’s director of rugby, Todd Blackadder.The watching England head coach, Eddie Jones, will also have winced at the funereal pace of Bath’s game at times. Bristol’s backs did their best to inject some momentum but, without much in the way of territory, the hosts spent large chunks of the season’s opening half-hour on the defensive.They should also have had a try on the board when Luke Morahan, after a slashing 50-metre break, failed to find his support with the line at Bristol’s mercy. A second penalty from Madigan offered some consolation, with the crowd further buoyed by the adventurous passing game being attempted by Lam’s backline. In terms of imagination and movement the Bears were looking much the brighter team.A third Madigan penalty made it 9-0 before Homer redeemed himself with a 53rd-minute try, converted by the previously luckless Priestland. A yellow card for a deliberate knockdown against Tusi Pisi gave Bath a further boost but, despite the considerable efforts of Zach Mercer, Bristol had the last laugh.Morahan, so quick off the mark, bought himself a precious half-yard of space and Leiua, doing brilliantly well to cling on to the ball at pace, did the rest. Madigan’s conversion attempt bounced off a post and Leiua had another late score disallowed but, ultimately, it mattered not. The Wurzels’ Drink Up Thy Cider was soon blasting out of the speakers and Bristol were well and truly back.Lam’s pride afterwards was obvious. “It’s been a big day for the club. There’s a long way to go but it’s a good start for us.” The Bears will also hope to have the lethal Charles Piutau back fit at some stage. Their highest-profile signing is seeing a specialist on Saturday for further checks on a damaged shoulder but the club remain optimistic their All Black full-back will be available in November. Where Bristol will be in the table by then is tricky to predict but already they are relishing the bear necessities of Premiership life."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/464f234f7f925475f8b15383bf985f7312d48534/103_131_1935_1161/master/1935.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cef6cd8415fe42a040bc1490a36e0c57","title":"england india fourth test day two match report","story":"Once again the fresh faces led the way in a Test match that is keeping everyone transfixed. It looks like one of those beauties where every boundary and every dismissal changes the balance immediately. And the chances of a draw have long since faded.Moeen Ali and Sam Curran were to the fore again, while India were indebted to their self-effacing grafter, Cheteshwar Pujara, who provided the backbone of their innings.Moeen, on what must be one of his favourite Test grounds – he took six for 67 at Southampton against India four years ago – somehow managed to torment a side who are supposed to be able to brush aside spinners with their eyes shut.That is more or less what they did to Moeen in India two years ago. But England’s second spinner is on one of his streaks when everything clicks and the brains had the good sense to pick him. He finished with five for 63 from 16 eventful overs India were bowled out for 273, a lead of 27, and the game is on a knife-edge. What of Curran? Well, he bowled as well as any of the others but took only one wicket. However, it was Virat Kohli’s and in this series that dismissal has a major impact on the mood of both sides.Just as India under Pujara’s watchful guidance seemed poised to go a long way past England’s total on a day when the ball seemed less inclined to misbehave Moeen took four wickets in 16 balls. There was some assistance from the pitch but rather more from India’s batsmen, who are supposed to be undermined by swing rather than spin. It was not a five-wicket haul of the greatest pedigree since most of Moeen’s victims were from the lower order but it was still a critical intervention.The assumption was that the pace attack would have the greatest impact even though the skies were brighter than on the first day and the pitch a little drier. However England’s senior citizens did not start well. Then Stuart Broad had KL Rahul lbw and, as is so often the case with him, his rhythm returned and he became a threat. By his own high standards Jimmy Anderson was not on song and would finish wicketless in a completed Test innings for the first time in 13 months.By noon Broad had removed Shikhar Dhawan, whose open-faced bat edged to Jos Buttler behind the stumps. Now Pujara and Kohli buckled down amid a testing spell from Curran Kohli passed 6,000 runs in Test cricket Pujara, despite a few outside edges, was somewhere near his pragmatic best. Root used six bowlers in that first session and none were from Durham, from which we discerned Ben Stokes, like Jonny Bairstow, is not fully fit.Moeen had obviously impressed his captain just before lunch since he continued after the interval, first alongside Broad and then Curran, who was the man to make the vital breakthrough. Kohli came forward – one hesitates to say lunge with such a great batsman – and the ball took the outside edge of his bat, whereupon Alastair Cook at first slip took a fine low catch.At last England had a foothold Root introduced Stokes and soon after he dropped a tough catch off him at second slip but the miss was not expensive since before long Ajinkya Rahane was lbw for 11. Stokes may be carrying an injury but he bowled with as much venom as anyone as Rahane and Pujara, who was hit on the head by a bouncer, could testify. However he was allowed only one seven-over spell.Now England turned the screw. Remember how Rishabh Pant hit his second ball in Test cricket for six. Well, here the peculiar tension of this format of the game would afflict him. He faced 29 balls without scoring and was out lbw prodding forward to Moeen just before tea.After the break Moeen caused havoc against an India lower order that, initially, were not inclined to hold their end up for Pujara. They fell like skittles. Hardik Pandya flicked elegantly towards short mid-wicket where Root took an excellent ing catch Ashwin tried an extravagant reverse sweep and was bowled and next ball Mohammed Shami played down the wrong line and lost his off-stump. Suddenly India were 195 for eight but, as was the case on Thursday, the last two wickets prospered, a circumstance that suggests the pitch is not misbehaving a great deal.Ishant Sharma hung around until caught at batpad off Moeen while 32 more runs were added. Then there was an even more frustrating last-wicket stand for England that mustered a morale-boosting 46. Pujara by now had dispensed with passivity and had become the conductor of the band with Jasprit Bumrah a resolute accomplice. He scored his 15th Test century and was skipping around the crease when the field was up, improvising lofted boundaries one moment and stealing the strike the next. He even ran between the wickets with assurance.England had four overs to face at the end and, given the form of the openers, this may not have been comfortable viewing from the dressing room. Kohli opened with Ashwin, who has been one of Cook’s tormentors this summer. Keaton Jennings had to deal with Bumrah. Both survived. It felt like a minor triumph."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f35b356a1f6df378db9651b9b614f50a41fa867a/0_24_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f47d3ad6e878c2a3915bb31d9060e81","title":"st helens wigan super league match report","story":"• St Helens 10-30 Wigan• Dan Sarginson scores first two tries to set Wigan on their wayOn nights like these there are really no need for in-depth team talks and pre-match pick-me-ups, but on Shaun Wane’s final visit to St Helens after an association ning almost 30 years with his beloved Wigan, one suspects he would have had a good go anyway.Occasions such as these could yet become a footnote in the Super League season if Wigan are not the ones lifting the trophy high at Old Trafford in October – but with a month to go until the play-offs, Wane’s Warriors are beginning to lay down some sort of statement.Throughout his time at the club Wane has consistently said that nothing is more important than winning the sport’s most famous derby against their great rivals, St Helens, for the town in which rugby league is more akin to a religion than a sport. Here his players backed up their coach’s beliefs as they did exactly what he asked them to do: spoil the Saints’ party.“They wanted to win that League Leaders’ Shield tonight and that was a major motivation for us,” said Wane, who is heading for Scottish rugby union after this season. “We didn’t want to be stood out there watching them lift that trophy.”Wane instantly regarded this as one of his side’s best performances of 2018. It is hard to disagree. Led by the outstanding Joe Greenwood and John Bateman up front, Wigan were in control at half-time through three tries without reply – two to Dan Sarginson. And though there were brief moments of a fightback from the Saints, Wigan were just as impressive after half-time.Make no mistake, St Helens will still finish top and will still win the League Leaders’ Shield. But the concern is that the team who were sweeping aside all-comers in the first two-thirds of the season are beginning to limp towards the time of year which, in reality, is the only part that matters.The Saints have now suffered three defeats in four games, which included the Challenge Cup semi-final loss to the eventual winners, Catalans. With the opportunity to secure a trophy against their arch-enemies here, this was the ideal time to quell any talk of a wobble.Instead they stuttered once again. “I think we underestimated how much they wanted to beat us,” their coach, Justin Holbrook, said. It took an extraordinary finish from Tommy Makinson, the winger claiming a cross-field kick before just about staying in-field, to break Wigan’s resistance seconds before half-time.Before that they led 14-0 thanks to Sarginson’s two tries and a marvellous solo effort from Bateman, who will become the latest English talent to thrive in the NRL next year when he joins Canberra. At 23 he could yet become one of the world’s best forwards.Tom Davies’ try 70 seconds after half-time opened up a three-score lead Wigan rarely looked likely to surrender, despite Makinson’s second try shortly after. The visitors finished the stronger of the two sides too first, Oliver Gildart rounded Ben Barba – whose form continues to falter amidst talk of an NRL return in 2019 – with ease, before Sean O’Loughlin rounded off a typically excellent display with Wigan’s sixth try in the final minutes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/377b3de5ce55488adc7f9b2a9bb02d88b9ad9ee6/0_37_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e951ad7a488ff17a2d0fcafd2fd4b502","title":"tour of britain wales first winner in paris gears up for race at home","story":"Welsh cyclist will be part of 120-strong peloton cycling 109-mile course through WalesThe farming village of Bancyfelin in the heart of Wales, with one pub, a post office and a tiny primary school, will be almost emptied tomorrow as cycling’s Tour of Britain rolls through the larger town of Carmarthen, five miles away.The biggest draw in the peloton is the homecoming hero Geraint Thomas, whose dad Howell is from Bancyfelin, a community of just 300 people in the south-west of the country and where the family still has strong ties. The 32-year-old is back in the saddle in a meaningful race for the first time since breezing triumphantly down Paris’s Champs-Élysées, arms held aloft as the first Welsh winner of the Tour de France.Thousands of people, many of them wearing yellow T-shirts in a nod to the yellow leader’s jersey that Thomas donned for most of the Tour de France, will line narrow streets for the opening stage of the eight-day race. The route begins in Pembrey country park in Carmarthenshire and winds 109 miles through Wales, including some stern climbs in the Brecon Beacons, before finishing in Newport.It was a huge coup for organisers to secure Thomas’s participation, just five weeks after the conclusion of the Tour de France, arguably the most gruelling event in all sport. Also in the 120-strong peloton is Chris Froome, a four-time Tour de France winner, and the Dutchman Wout Poels, a Team Sky colleague.The trio are among the world’s top 10 riders and their presence possibly reflects the improving standing of the Tour of Britain among the world cycling elite.“We think of ourselves as the fourth classic, after the Tour de France, the Giro d’Italia and the Vuelta a España,” said Heath Harvey, chief executive of the race organisers SweetSpot. “Some people might say we’re not quite there yet but at least we have that vision.” The race, now sponsored by Ovo Energy, dates back to 1945 and has taken various names over the years, including the Milk Race, the Kellogg’s Tour of Britain and the Pru Tour. It has existed in its current incarnation since 2004 and spectator numbers have steadily crept up. About one and a half million people are expected to witness this year’s race, which will end in London a week tomorrow.A significant number of those, particularly in Thomas’s home country, are expected to be first-time spectators of the race, inspired by his exploits over the Channel.“New spectators of cycling are always blown away by the speed and scale, and how close you get to the riders,” Harvey said. “The wind will move your hair and shake you in your boots it really is a spectacle.”It is also free, apart from the cost of travel to the roadside. “The lovely thing about cycling is that you can still see the best athletes in the world and appreciate the art and be inspired by their performance without putting your hand in your pocket,” Harvey added. “It makes cycling very democratic.”For those not able to get to the race it will also be shown live for five hours a day on the BBC and in more than 120 countries worldwide.Harvey would not be drawn on how much it had cost to lure Thomas away from the hefty round of TV and personal appearances that have dominated his time since winning in France. But any race in the world, outside the big three, would envy such an illustrious rostrum of riders.“The sporting gods were clearly listening to our prayers. It makes our workload twice as large, having a field of this calibre,” he said. “But it’s a good problem to have.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/609e417d83d1a2bc931d8a5a72b1f9a4f080f8ee/0_275_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e93eb3b7847ee9114789d3c14c04ecb8","title":"readers travel photography competition august winners","story":"Spontaneity, subtle colours and excellent composition permeate this month’s selection.

Among them are a number showing the duo with their wives, Joan Morecambe and Doreen Wise, in the garden of the Morecambes’ home in Harpenden, Hertfordshire.Others were taken on the set of the TV show, with guests including Diana Rigg, Patrick Moore, and Elton John, who is seen sat at a piano in tracksuit bottoms and a designer jacket.The images highlight the madness of some of their comedy routines. Where else will anyone see the actor Peter Cushing in a top-hat-and-tails dance routine? Or John Thaw and Dennis Waterman, at the height of their The Sweeney fame, dressed as German soldiers?Morecambe and Wise joined the BBC from ITV in 1968 after six series of their ATV-made show Two of a Kind. Morecambe said at the time that they had asked for more money and for the programmes to be televised in colour so they could be sold to the US.“But ATV couldn’t agree on this,” he said. “The BBC met our terms. This doesn’t mean we have necessarily fallen out with ATV. If they offer us good terms in the future, we may well do our next series for them.” In the event they stayed with the BBC for nine series. Initially on BBC Two, because it was then the only channel broadcasting in colour, The Morecambe \u0026amp Wise Show became one of the most popular in British TV history.The Christmas specials are some of the most watched UK programmes ever with the 1977 show, including newsreaders such as Frank Bough and Richard Baker in a There is Nothing Like a Dame sailor routine, attracting 28.5 million viewers, according to one estimate.The duo made four series at ITV before Morecambe’s death in 1984, aged 58.They are still held in huge affection. The comedian and impressionist Jon Culshaw said they brought generations together. “Their lovable brilliance is something we’ve never seen the likes of since,” he said. “As we celebrate 50 years of The Morecambe \u0026amp Wise Show, I look back on their programmes with enormous admiration and such happy, warm memories. They’re genuinely loved.”Along with the release of the images on Saturday, BBC Two will also repeat Eric and Ernie, a drama telling the story of their formative years, and an hour-long selection of their sketches."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc30aa59277a3fcdf06de1cdffdf11a9c1558945/0_76_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9dddc890c86850d93c4cb498cc53f3c4","title":"john mccain lies in state in the us capitol","story":"McCain was one of most influential US politicians of the past century never to win the White House"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ace6f2077ea6f3fb5fea4d20f0d3a72d32b3548a/0_49_1565_939/master/1565.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6bbdfac0b256546ffc1e6539a8708348","title":"stalinist truman show artist paid 400 people to live as soviet citizens","story":"Participants lived in replica Stalin-era research institute as part of three-year art projectIn an art project that has been compared to The Truman Show, Big Brother and the Charlie Kaufman film Synecdoche, New York, a Russian artist has paid 400 people to live for three years in a fictional but functioning Stalin-era research institute.In an experiment long anticipated in the film and art worlds but confirmed by the  on Friday, Ilya Khrzhanovsky created an institute of theoretical physics in eastern Ukraine modelled on the shadowy facilities which existed in the Soviet Union from the 1930s to the 1950s.Inside it were more than 400 real people, who relived 30 years of the Soviet experience in three years between 2008-11, eating the same food, wearing the same clothes, and obeying the same rules as Soviet citizens would have.People fell in and out of love, conceived 14 children, formed friendships and made enemies, according to executive producer Martine d’Anglejan-Chatillon.Khrzhanovsky used the story of Soviet physicist Lev Landau – whose nickname also provided the project’s title, DAU – as the basis for his fictional world. “It is really to show how people are, it is not particular to that culture or that time,” says d’Anglejan-Chatillon. “It is about looking at what human nature is capable of, under a microscope, and the capacity for beauty and intellect and optimism and change or a capacity for the opposite.“In a way what Ilya created was an encyclopaedia of human relationships and human nature and how things develop over time in people.”It has been a sprawling project shrouded in secrecy. Very few journalists have ever been given access. One who was, Michael Idov, wrote a piece for GQ in 2011 headlined The Movie Set That Ate Itself, describing Khrzhanovsky as “unhinged”.James Meek, a novelist and former  Moscow correspondent, was in 2015 invited to a building on Piccadilly where Khrzhanovsky has spent years pulling the project together. He wrote a piece for the London Review of Books in which he said “I felt I’d crossed a membrane into another medium.”The research facility was also a vast movie set and for some of the time the participants were filmed by the German cinematographer Jürgen Jürges. Over 700 hours of footage was captured, and the film, DAU Freiheit, or DAU Freedom, will be shown to the public for the first time at an art installation in Berlin this October. “The world has been waiting for this,” said d’Anglejan-Chatillon. “The film world has been anticipating this for a long time.”For the event, a large section of the Berlin Wall will be rebuilt on Unter den Linden boulevard in the German capital, creating a walled-in “city within a city”. Visitors must purchase “visas” online and hand over their phones before entering. The project will end with a ritualistic tearing down of the wall on 9 November, exactly 29 years after the event in 1989.The installation in Berlin will also feature performances and live interventions by artists including Brian Eno and Robert del Naja of Massive Attack.“You often hear things described as ‘ambitious’. Nothing I’ve ever encountered comes close to the ambition of DAU,” said Eno of the exhibit.“It’s the most extraordinary and multi-layered art-project I’ve ever heard of, involving many thousands of people – artists, actors, musicians, artisans, lighting designers, editors, cinematographers, officials, cartographers, scientists, shamans, and thousands of ordinary humans – and it’s still growing.”Khrzhanovsky’s project has piqued the interest of many distinguished artists and scientists. Visitors and participants in DAU include the artists Marina Abramović and Carsten Höller, opera director Peter Sellars, Nobel prize-winning physicist David Gross, and mathematician Shing-Tung Ya. Events in Paris, before Christmas, and London, in the new year, will follow the project. In Berlin the installation will be hosted by the Berliner Festspiele arts festival. Details for London and Paris have yet to be released."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1facfe105cef4018392562456a2bd3fa189d821/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1c26d77adaffeeabce3e1b98a341be6","title":"saudi arabia may dig canal to turn qatar into an island","story":"Plan takes shape amid bitter dispute that led the Saudis, UAE, Bahrain and Egypt to cut ties with small peninsula nation A Saudi official hinted on Friday the kingdom was moving forward with a plan to dig a canal that would turn the neighbouring Qatari peninsula into an island, amid a diplomatic feud between the Gulf nations.“I am impatiently waiting for details on the implementation of the Salwa island project, a great, historic project that will change the geography of the region,” Saud al-Qahtani, a senior adviser to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, said on Twitter.The plan, which would physically separate the Qatari peninsula from the Saudi mainland, is the latest stress point in a fractious 14-month long dispute between the two states.Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic and trade ties with Qatar in June 2017, accusing it of supporting terrorism and being too close to Riyadh’s arch rival, Iran – charges Doha denies.In April the pro-government Sabq news website reported government plans to build a channel 60km long and 200m wide stretching across Saudi Arabia’s border with Qatar.Part of the canal, which would cost up to 2.8 billion riyals ($750m), would be reserved for a nuclear waste facility, it said.Five unnamed companies that specialised in digging canals had been invited to bid for the project and the winner would be announced in September, Makkah newspaper reported in June.Saudi authorities did not respond to requests for comment and there was no immediate reaction on the plan from Qatar.After the dispute erupted last year, Qatar – a small peninsula nation – found its only land border closed, its state-owned airline barred from using its neighbours’ airspace and Qatari residents expelled from the boycotting countries.Mediation efforts led by Kuwait and the US, which has its largest Middle East air base in Qatar, have failed to resolve the dispute."},{"url":null,"title":"how cool is dublin s newest garda station","story":"  August 30, 2018Minister insists incoming Garda chief will bring experience and expertise to force   August 30, 2018Minister thanks \u0026Oacute Cual\u0026aacutein for \u0026lsquosteady\u0026rsquo service to the State at opening of new Garda station "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3613237.1535736035!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"woman distressed after bank debt investigator made evening call to her home","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMichelle Fowler at home in Enniscorthy, Co Wexford. Photograph: Nick Bradshaw A separated mother of two has spoken of her distress after a man acting on behalf of Permanent TSB called to her home shortly before 9pm on a Friday night seeking information about her.Michelle Fowler (39), a special needs assistant who lives in Co Wexford, has been separated for more than five years and has two sons, aged 15 and 12. She left the family home in 2012 and a substantial mortgage and arrears remain attached to it. Ms Fowler told The  she was recently alone in her rented home when she heard banging on her sittingroom window. She thought it was a friend but when she opened the front door she found “a tall man with white hair in a tracksuit, probably in his 50s” standing outside. She said the man asked for her name and in response she asked him who he was and sought identification. “He flashed an identification card at me but wouldn’t let me hold it to look at it,” she said. “He refused to give me his name, and proceeded to ask me questions. He asked if the house I’m currently in is mine or rented. “I asked again for his name and proper identification. He refused to give his name but said his job was to find out the location of people who owe money to PTSB.”Ms Fowler said she tried to close the door but he “put his hand on the front door and pushed it in so that I couldn’t close it. He refused to leave and refused to let me close the door”.She told him her finances were being handled by the Phoenix Project, a Portlaoise-based charity helping people in mortgage distress.“He said he wanted answers to questions. Because this man would not leave, and because I was terrified, I answered the questions.” She told him she was renting the house and that she had not lived in the mortgaged property since October 2012. Ms Fowler said she asked the man not to call to her house again and said if PTSB wanted any information they could deal with the Phoenix Project. “His answer was to tell me that the bank might take my car to help pay off the money owed. He then took his foot out of the door and left.”She said she suffered from anxiety as a result of the incident. “I will now have to go back to my doctor for anxiety medication. My whole body is sore from stress, my muscles are cramped and I have palpitations, all symptoms of anxiety.” William Prior of the Phoenix Project expressed concern at how the woman had been approached. “To make contact with a woman on her own in her home in this manner at this time on a Friday evening is shocking,” he said. “There were no support services open at that hour and if she had come to harm after this visit, who would have taken responsibility.”John O’Donohoe, a solicitor who volunteers with the Phoenix Project and has represented Ms Fowler in court, noted that his client lacked the capacity to repay any residual debt owed to PTSB due to her situation. “What is the point of calling to her house on a Friday night? She has no money. Either the debt is written off or she files for bankruptcy. PTSB cannot get any money if it is not there, so what they are doing seems pointless and needlessly upsetting.” In a statement Permanent TSB said it took “allegations like this seriously” and that having “investigated this matter fully with our legal advisers and with the trace company which is the company which employs the agent who was engaged to trace the customer in question . . . we believe that these allegations are without foundation”.The spokesman said the Consumer Credit Act allows “visits and telephone calls” and stipulates that personal visits cannot be made between 9pm and 9am. “Therefore 9am-9pm visits are permitted,” he said. He said the agent who visited Ms Fowler was “a retired garda sergeant who received an Exemplary Service Record Certification upon retirement from the force and who has an unblemished record”.He said the agent’s only job was “to trace the customer – nothing more. In such situations neither the trace company nor the inidual agent who carries out the trace is informed for what purpose the trace is being made. “Neither the trace company nor the agent are given any information about the personal history of the customer they have been asked to trace. Therefore, the claim that the agent said he was tracing people who owed money to the bank does not make sense.”The spokesman said the agent in question had described his encounter with the customer as “brief, very straightforward and uneventful”. “The customer was polite and courteous and co-operative in confirming her identity and her current address,” he said.This article was amended on Friday 31st August, 2018 as an earlier version incorrectly stated Ms Fowler’s family home was sold leaving a substantial residual debt. This has now been corrected.

Photograph: Virginia MayoAPA Brexit deal must be signed by “November at the latest”, the EU’s chief negotiator has warned. Michel Barnier told a press conference in Brussels there will be no agreement unless an operational “backstop” arrangement for the Irish Border can be agreed. In the event of a hard no-deal Brexit, the EU wants a backstop that would effectively create a border down the Irish Sea between the island of Ireland and Great Britain. But he said was “determined” to reach an agreement ahead of the October deadline, though he said there would be “flexibility” for further negotiations. Standing alongside UK Brexit secretary Dominic Raab, he said: “Week after week and step by step we are eliminating subjects, bones of contention... I’m determined, we’re going to find an agreement for an orderly withdrawal which is much better than the opposite and Dominic and I think it’s possible to reach that in October.” Mr Barnier added: “If you take account of the date chosen by the United Kingdom to leave, that’s March 29 which is in UK law and you simply count backwards the time that you need for ratification about three months here or there then it takes you to November at the latest. “It’s as simple as that.” It follows concerns that a deal may fail to materialise before the deadline. Mr Raab said that he wanted to continue “accelerating and intensifying” negotiations, adding: “We’re committed to resolving the deal by (the October council) and ultimately on my side I am stubbornly optimistic that a deal is within our reach.” Earlier, Mr Barnier said a backstop is “essential to conclude the negotiations”, stating: “With no backstop there will be no agreement.” He described the issue as a “matter of some urgency”, adding that he had asked the Brexit Secretary to provide data on how the “necessary controls and checks take place”. British prime minister Theresa May has repeatedly said she will refuse to contemplate any backstop deal that treats Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK. The UK Government insists that any backstop position should include the UK as a whole. Mr Raab said the government “remained committed” to finding a solution in Northern Ireland. He said: “On Northern Ireland we remain committed to giving effect to the joint report, continuing the work on the potential solutions, working with Michel and his team on some of the issues he’s raised and continuing to drive that forward. “The solutions must be workable, they’ve got to be workable for the communities living in Northern Ireland and living in the Republic of Ireland.” Mr Barnier also told media in Brussels that the future partnership between the EU and UK would be without precedent. He said: “If we achieve what was in the March guidelines then you really do have a partnership with no precedent, this a very ambitious free trade agreement, specific agreements in all sorts of area of common interest.” Mr Barnier was later asked if he believed the Conservative Party Conference would have an impact on negotiations, he said: “I’m not going to comment on the internal political life on the UK, conferences of this party or that party. “We’re negotiating with Theresa May’s Government with Dominic Raab and his team and they’re the ones round the negotiating table.” –PA"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3614338.1535738680!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"exploring the border a frontier marked by myriad crossings","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Monaghan Way, near the border with south Armagh. Ninety-five of the Border’s 208 crossings are between Monaghan and its three northern neighbours, Fermanagh, Tyrone and Armagh.There are more than twice as many border crossings in Co Monaghan alone as there are between Norway and Sweden, an international boundary much beloved of simplifying Brexiteers.If you include unmapped routes – sometimes no more than planks across a stream – Monaghan may even give the European Union’s entire eastern frontier a run for its money.When civil servants from Northern Ireland and the Republic finally agreed an estimate of the Border’s total number of crossings earlier this summer, a century after partition, the count came to 208, or one for every 2½ kilometres.Almost half – 95 – were between Monaghan and its three northern neighbours, Fermanagh, Tyrone and Armagh. The figure dwarfed even the 59 counted for Donegal, and made the borders of Louth (33 crossings), Cavan (15) and Leitrim (six) seem unperforated by comparison.The Brexit-enforced task of counting them was described by officials as “almost impossible” because of confusions between public and private land, places where the Border runs up the middle of roads, and other anomalies. And there is no better place to see what the counters were up against than on the route between Cavan and Clones, where my own exploration of the Border began.Over a distance of 12km, you cross the frontier four times. But that’s only on the main road, the N54 (as it is in the Republic) and A3 (as it becomes on its brief visits north). Turn off this on to the many side roads to your left and right and you enter a maze that must keep bureaucrats and other lovers of order awake at night.Not long after I met the A3 for the first time, another interesting statistic appeared beside a gateway. “Do not cross this field unless you can do it in nine seconds,” read the warning notice, “because the bull can do it in 10!” There was no sign of the bull, although inviting as the field looked, with the river Finn meandering through it, I wasn’t tempted.A little farther on, in an unintended joke, services offered by a local business included “alignment” – the buzzword of Britain’s torturous Brexit negotiations. In this case, it was only car tyres they were offering to align.And, as a tourist on foot, my main concern with tyres was not getting run over by the traffic that hurls along here at, or over, the speed limits (80kmh in the Republic, 60mph – 96.5kmh – in the North, and both irrelevant to some drivers). Already, however, I was approaching the notorious Drummully salient, perhaps the single greatest challenge to cross-Border alignment, and happy for the excuse it gave to leave the main road.Like the hundreds of local townlands that share the prefix, Drummully gets its name partly via the Irish droim (“ridge”), from the drumlin belt that stretches across Ireland at this latitude. The proliferation of such Drums in south Ulster suggests marching – a connection Drumcree helped perpetuate. And there has indeed been a long-established tendency to mark territory in these parts.Just east of Drummully is a place with the even more martial name of Drumswords, where in 1828, in an incident known as “the rising of Burke”, an Orangemen of local infamy was hanged posthumously from a tree, several days after he had been buried in the local cemetery. But even allowing for the depth of political enmities around here, how Drummully ever became an international frontier is one of the deeper mysteries of partition.Sometimes also referred to as a “polyp” by map-makers, the area is a virtual exclave of Monaghan, all but surrounded by Fermanagh. The connecting isthmus is only metres wide: that sprinting bull could probably cross it in 10 seconds too. But there is no road into Drummully at the connecting point.On the contrary, direct entry from the Republic is cut off by the aforementioned river Finn, which uniformed gardaí have sometimes had to wade across to avoid the complications of road-based approaches, all of which pass through the North.Peter Leary, Fermanagh-born author of Unapproved Routes: Histories of the Irish Border 1922-1972, suggests Drummully was “almost certainly a ballybetagh”: an ancient unit of territory usually comprising 16 townlands. And however it ended up in Monaghan – almost but not quite gripped by two Fermanagh claws, like one of those toys in the amusement arcade game – it was clearly never designed to withstand the stresses of international border duty.Post-partition, farmers inside it suddenly had to cross the frontier twice en route to market in Clones, and the same on the way back. This was complicated even before the Northern authorities started cratering and “spiking” roads to block terror attacks. Meanwhile, the Church of Ireland in Drummully was now separated from its rectory by the Border, and in the confusion, for years, marriages went unregistered in Dublin.Regardless of personal affiliations, sane people on both sides of the political ide thought that either Drummully would have to be sent north by the 1924 Boundary Commission, or that the surrounding northern bits would go south. The commission took a long look at the area. Then events intervened, and the entire Border stayed where it was.So today, although the drumlins, hedgerows and even the road markings offer no clue of a change in jurisdictions, signs on the A3 suddenly welcome visitors in English, Irish and six other languages, including Polish, Japanese and Ulster Scots.These have been joined more recently by Brexit-inspired posters, including one erected by the 1916 Societies: “Hard Border? Soft Border? No Border!” Apart from those, the main road’s surest indication that you have crossed jurisdictions is a shop advertising “fireworks”, sale of which is illegal in the Republic.But even clues such as this disappear when you plunge into the network of boreens south of the N54. There, only the all-knowing blue dot on your iPhone map knows for sure which side of the Border you are, although once, when I thought I was in the North, I was surprised to encounter an old green post box, embedded in the pier of a farmhouse gate. The post box didn’t have a painted-over red crown. It was one of those rarities, with a harp: placed here after this bucolic backwater found itself promoted to frontier duties.Otherwise, speaking of backwaters, water is often the best guide to the Border’s whereabouts, even if this year’s long, hot summer had reduced some of the boundary streams to the status of underground rumour. But somewhere deep in Drummully the road I was on wound its way up to a dramatically humped-back bridge, with sturdy stone walls either side. And although the Border was nudging us from both east and west at this point, the blue dot on my phone placed me firmly in between, in the Republic.So what was this momentous-looking bridge in the middle of nowhere, with no water underneath and surrounded by dense vegetation? As I realised only subsequently, it must have been a ghost of the old Clones-Cavan railway line, long abandoned and now being reclaimed by nature.Back on the main road, much later, and after another brief and uneventful sojourn in the UK, I reached the outskirts of Clones, where a house bedecked with three different flags – the white and blue of Monaghan GAA, the Irish Tricolour and the green, red and black of Palestine – seemed to suggest we were in the Republic again.But no, not quite yet, according to the blue dot. The flags must have been erected by an exile living in what he or she might have called the “occupied territories”. For Clones too is hemmed in by the Border, which crowds it from three sides, with historically ruinous results for the local economy.Then, just north of the town, for reasons best known to itself, the boundary goes wandering once more, into a drunken S-shape, so that again you cross it several times in quick succession. While trying to make sense of its movements there, I noticed a young man get out of a car, set up a camera tripod in the middle of the road and take pictures of the tarmac.“Are you by any chance photographing the Border?” I asked him.And sure enough, he was, as a project for the Glasgow School of Art. We agreed the route was especially illogical around here. But there wasn’t much time to talk. He was a young man in a hurry, with many crossings still to photograph. I passed him again up the road, where he had already shot another piece of tarmac and was packing up the tripod once more before speeding away to the next rendezvous.By now, the fanciful notion I had started with – that this summer, in instalments, I might walk the entire Monaghan frontier – had vanished in the face of its awe-inspiring vastness.There were too many crisis-crossing detours, even on the official routes, not to mind such paths as the one Clones writer Eugene McCabe cut through a field once and called the “Khyber Pass” (as mentioned in another recent book, Hard Border – Walking Through a Century of Irish Partition, by McCabe’s nephew Darach MacDonald).So I left the hilly fastnesses of north Monaghan, Emyvale, Glaslough and Peter Robinson’s road to Clontibret for another time and instead, for the second day of rambling, crossed the county to the Border’s most southerly land extreme, near the village of Blackstaff.There’s not much to Blackstaff these days. But in the years before the 1798 rebellion, according to Samuel Lewis’s Topographical Dictionary of Ireland (1837), it comprised “200 wretched hovels”, whose population elected a “mayor” annually to settle disputes. Even when the hamlet was “broken up”, after 1798, natives continued to hold annual reunions there for many years.Now it’s a quiet gateway into south Armagh, formerly known as “Bandit Country”. And if Jacob Rees-Mogg ever needs a crash course in Border studies, this might be the section I would bring him to, if only for the dog I met soon after crossing into Armagh.The old adage about letting sleeping canines lie was more than usually feasible during the hot weather. I tiptoed past several farmyards where watchdogs slumbered. Elsewhere I was grateful that, thanks to sheep and litigation, the more active ones are less likely to roam freely than dogs of 30 or 40 years ago.But this particular animal, of indeterminate breed, had been fitted with a muzzle. He was thereby at liberty to come out on to the road to growl at me, as I walked by. So muzzle or no muzzle, I passed gingerly, complimenting him on being an “excellent metaphor” for the fragility of the peace process. He kept growling until I was well clear of the property.There were more direct reminders than the dog of the Troubles here, including some elaborate roadside monuments to the Republican fallen. Their inscriptions can be elliptical. One on the Annaghad Road speaks of an IRA volunteer who simply “died near this spot” in 1996. Another at Cullaville commemorates an IRA man who, in contrast, was “murdered by criminals”.I was on the main road to Castleblayney then, still known as the “concession road” from its unusual legal status after partition. When the Border first descended, and customs officers wrestled with the challenges of one of world’s most dense rural road networks, it was decreed that only 16 crossings were “approved” for general use.The vast majority were “unapproved”, except for local farmers, doctors on call, people on foot or bicycles, and sometimes funerals (an exemption often said to have been exploited by smugglers). The “concession” roads, linking two parts of a jurisdiction but passing through the other, could be used for transit as long as drivers didn’t stop.But as Peter Leary reminds us, natives of Cullaville, being from Armagh, and wishing to travel the short distance northwest to ’Blayney in Monaghan, were legally expected to take the opposite direction, to Crossmaglen, then south into Louth, then double around on to the concession road, on which they too were required not to stop, even in their home village. The detour was about 45km. It was understandably unpopular, and gave way under mass protests in the 1960s.The concession road is another scary place to walk these days, thanks to traffic. So it was a relief to get off it again and follow the Border up along the shores of Lough Ross, itself a cross-Border body of water. Here you can abandon roads altogether for a while, thanks to one of Ireland’s lesser-known tourist attractions: the Monaghan Way.But the Border gets back to business, in every sense, when the L4400 meets the main Castleblayney-Crossmaglen Road. The actual boundary involved a short detour to my right there, and as usual was barely recognisable now except for a patch of tar repair.Beside that, however, was a walled-off business called Border Systems, a name that at first glance could be a hard Brexiteer’s fantasy. On closer inspection, the services offered were for purely private security: house alarms, CCTV, automated gates, etc. The frictionless Border technologies Brexit supporters talk of are at least as far into the future here, where nobody wants them anyway, as elsewhere.Meanwhile, another wall I passed on the road into ’Blayney carried a faded reminder of Troubles past: “Touts beware”.And nearby was an example of the “ordinary crime” (as it used to be called, to differentiate from the political) on which post-Troubles security systems are focused.A poster of a John Deere tractor, under the word “Stolen”, was fixed to a telegraph pole, with a reward offered for information. The notice added that the tractor had been “last seen in south Armagh”.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: Alexander BecherEPAIt all played out this week under the doleful gaze of the massive Karl Marx head in Chemnitz.Saxony’s third-largest city was, in East German times, named after the philosopher and political theorist until reverting to its historic name in 1990.Last Sunday at 3.15am near the 7m statue, Daniel Hillig, a local 35-year-old carpenter with a German mother and Cuban father, was stabbed and died a short time later of his injuries in hospital.Two friends were also injured in the scuffle and, as news spread, locals began laying flowers on the scarlet-splattered paving stones where the fatal attack took place.Within 24 hours, after the arrest of Syrian and Iraqi asylum-seeker suspects, the crime scene had become the latest fault line in Germany’s unresolved refugee debate.An estimated 5,000 neo-Nazis, violent football hooligans and angry locals, joined a “march of mourning” for the dead man. Many of the crowd – mostly men aged 20-50 – held signs reading “Stop the asylum flood” others with free hands gave the forbidden Hitler salute and chanted: “Germany for Germans, foreigners out.”Standing opposite, a crowd of about 1,500 black-clad young people held up signs reading, among other things, “Pogroms are so 1930s”, a gallows-humour reference to attacks on dark-skinned people in Chemnitz, hours after the Sunday stabbing.Between the two camps – as bottles, fireworks and insults flew – stood 700 nervous, outnumbered police officers in full riot gear.When Saxony’s state premier, Michael Kretschmer, arrived in the city for a meeting with locals on Thursday, he was booed and jeered.“Locals feel they are being treated unfairly,” he said afterwards in reference to the billions erted from welfare budgets to spend on housing and subsistence costs for about 1.3 million people who have arrived in Germany since 2015.This week has been a rude awakening for Kretschmer and his local Christian Democratic Union, which has ruled Saxony continuously since 1990. For most of that time, despite a thriving football hooligan scene and Dresden’s xenophobic Pegida movement, the CDU insisted that Saxony didn’t have a far-right problem.After owning up to reality this week, however, the CDU has just a year to tackle extremist, populist groups capitalising on security concerns and anti-immigrant feeling – or face a rout in state elections next year.The far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), just 3 per cent behind the CDU in Saxony, warned this week on social media of “ongoing slaughter” of Germans from knife-wielding migrants.Party co-leader Alexander Gauland insisted on Friday it was “legitimate to go ballistic” after a crime like last Sunday’s stabbing. “What is of course not legitimate,” he added hastily, “is that people hunt others or give Hitler salute.”So how can Germany’s political mainstream throttle the growing populist anger?Kretschmer has warned against “putting those who spread hate into the same pot as those in the middle of our society” with legitimate concerns. But Germany’s centre-left are wary of currying favour with ordinary people willing to march along with Hitler-saluting rowdies.They want a state crackdown on violent protesters and on the Saxon justice ministry official whose photograph of the main suspects’ charge sheets – including their full identities and addresses, and those of witnesses – found their way on to AfD and Pegida social media accounts.Police say one of the two suspects, a 22-year-old Iraqi man who arrived in Germany with false documents, was due to be deported and had chalked up a considerable criminal record in Germany: fraud, drug possession, damage to property.“If I did everything he did I’d be in prison, but he was walking around,” said Roland Ludwig, a 74-year-old local man in Chemnitz.As a weekend of renewed AfD marches looms, left-wing anti-fascist groups and friends of Daniel Hillig have taken to social media to challenge efforts by extremist groups to co-opt their friend’s death.On Facebook a woman who appears to have been the dead man’s wife wrote: “He wouldn’t have wanted this.”Back at the scene of Sunday’s stabbing, among the flowers and candles, a short, sharp warning to Saxony’s politicians: “Take the knives from them or we’ll take your political office.”Read more on how Europe attempts to deal with the migrant crisis"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3613874.1535740151!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"clocks in dublin and belfast could be on different times after brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe European Commission will recommend that Member States stop changing the time by an hour twice a year. Photograph: Getty ImagesAfter Brexit the Republic and Northern Ireland could find themselves, for half the year, operating on different clocks one hour apart, if new proposals from the EU Commission to abolish summer-time clock switching are approved. The Commission yesterday announced that it will propose a directive to member states and the European Parliament to abolish twice-yearly clock-switching following a Europe-wide “consultation process”. The online survey saw 84 per cent of respondents saying they are in favour of putting an end to the bi-annual clock change. More than three quarters (76 per cent) of the respondents consider that changing the clock twice a year is a ‘very negative’ or ‘negative’ experience.The survey received 4.6 million responses from all 28 Member States, the highest number ever in such a consultation. But two thirds of those were from Germany - some 3.7 per cent of its electorate. Ireland’s survey turnout was as little as 0.24 per cent, while in the UK it was only 0.02 per cent.Although member states have the sole prerogative to decide what time zone they are part of - there are three in the EU, with Ireland and the UK an hour back from Belgium - the Commission says that the Union collectively has the right to determine whether countries make the summertime switch within those time zones. In Ireland, should Brexit go ahead and the UK decides to keep the summertime clock change, clocks in Northern Ireland would go continue to go forward an hour on the last Sunday of March and back one hour on the last Sunday of October. Clocks in the South would remain unaltered, with both parts of the island out of step for seven months every year.Asked if the introduction of a time border to the island of Ireland is compatible with the EU’s determination in Brexit talks to avoid a hard border, a Commission spokesman would only insist that the two issues are not related.Observers suggest, however, that the requirement on the North to maintain regulatory alignment with the South in the EU’s proposed but contested backstop provision would seem to imply an obligation on the North to align with the EUIrish clocks. That would mean the North being out of step with the rest of the UK, a time border down the Irish Sea, surely anathema to the DUP. The DUPs’ Sammy Wilson said it was “just further proof, as if it were needed, that Brussels is bonkers. It wouldn’t just be a time border, it would be a ticking time bomb under the proposed backstop arrangements which are contested.” The East Antrim MP, a member of the UK Parliamentary committee on Brexit’, added: “It’s another reason why Theresa May should be putting it up to the EU that there will be no backstop. The Irish government can put the clocks back, or forward, whatever they like. That’s up to them. But we in Northern Ireland will have the same time zone, the same rules, the same customs arrangements and same regulations as the rest of the UK. That’s the bottom line for us.”Since 1996, all Europeans have been changing their clock forward by one hour on the last Sunday of March and by one hour backward on the last Sunday of October. The purpose of EU rules was not to harmonise the time regime in the EU, the Commission says, but to address the problems, notably for the transport and logistics sectors, which arise from an uncoordinated application of clock-changes in the course of the year.

On the other side, there are those of us who want to stop illegal immigration.”Orban and Salvini attacked Macron on the very day he was weakened by the surprise resignation of his popular ecology minister, Nicolas Hulot. But the French president welcomed their barbs. “If they think I’m their principal opponent, they’re right,” Macron said during a visit to Denmark. He would “in no way give in to nationalists and those who advocate this discourse of hatred”, he promised.Macron has portrayed next May’s European elections as a referendum against what he calls the “illiberal democrats” of Italy and central Europe. He is staking the future of his République En Marche movement on its ability to galvanise what he calls “progressive forces” to become the leading force in the next EU parliament. He wants Europe to be “the model of this humanist refoundation of\u0026nbsp globalisation”, he told French ambassadors in his annual foreign policy address on Monday.The tone of Macron’s speech was far less optimistic than a year ago. “All across the European Union, we see the fascination for illiberal democracy looming,” he said. “This European battle is only beginning. It will be long. It will be difficult. It will be at the centre of French action throughout my term . . . The rise of extremes is almost a general rule, and France is an exception.”Hungary and Italy are against European solidarity, except when it comes to exploiting EU structural funding, in which case they became “opportunistic”, Macron said.In his closing address to the ambassadors’ conference, foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian went further. “Member states are free to elect the leaders they want to,” he said. “But our vision of the EU . . . is not compatible with governments that don’t respect its fundamental principles, who do not feel bound by solidarity with the community, and who have a utilitarian approach to the union . . above all the redistribution of money . . . We are not ready to pay for that Europe.”In the midst of his verbal joust with Orban and Salvini, Macron faced renewed criticism at home, over his record on ecology, as criticised by Hulot, for appointing Philippe Besson, an author who has written effusively about him, to be consul general in Los Angeles, and for a comment to the French community in Copenhagen.The far-right leader Marine Le Pen accused Macron of “contempt” for the French. The far-left deputy Alexis Corbière said the president considers the French a millstone: “One has the impression that he would like to change peoples. I propose changing presidents instead. It will be quicker.”That the French resist reform is an oft-stated truism, but Macron’s opponents seize on his every pronouncement to attack him. The BVA monthly barometer poll published on Friday showed Macon’s approval rating has reached its lowest level, at 34 per cent. \u0026nbspIn his speech to the ambassadors, Macron had vaunted the fact that he and Merkel agreed at their summit in Meseberg in June to establish a joint budget for the euro zone.But in an interview with the Financial Times, Germany’s deputy finance minister Jörg Kukies appeared to renege on that commitment. “Why should we weaken the EU by establishing a parallel structure?” Kukies asked. Negotiating an EU budget for the 2020-2027 period was a more pressing issue, he said."},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

I think it is a reflection of a far greater focus in state schools on passing of exams and a sustained effort to drive up standards, which of course is very much down to Michael Gove. More than 1,100 schools still sat the Cambridge iGCSE examinations this year“These were only sharpened by Gove, who devoted huge attention to the curriculum and refocusing state schools on the importance of exams.”Sir Anthony went on to add: “It will send a tremor through the independent school system, although over the short-term I don’t think there will be a decline in numbers just yet as many parents still look to the private system for a more rounded education. “The iGCSEs were the gold standard at one stage but I don’t think that the case any longer. I think this year’s result might make them think more about the reformed courses and whether they should start dancing more to the tune of state schools.”More than 1,100 schools still sat the Cambridge iGCSE examinations this year, compared to more than 2000 schools last year.Whilst the figure for those achieving an A or 7 and above at private schools stands at three times the national average, this years decline of 0.3 per cent has been partially attributed to teachers and parents no longer being able to help pupils with their coursework after it was removed as part of the GCSE reforms.Under the new GCSEs which are now graded 9 to 1 many of the subjects have had their coursework element removed Under the new GCSEs which are now graded 9 to 1 many of the subjects have had their coursework element removed all together.Chairman of Campaign for Real Education Chris McGovern said: “I think the lack of coursework is a clear reason for the changing figures. There is no doubt that middle-class parents and their teachers can support pupils in coursework. “But this now isn’t possible and will have certainly had an impact on the number of students getting those top grades thanks to their reliance on coursework. “I hope that the gap will narrow between the national and private average now this element has been taken away - disadvantaged children suffered with coursework as their parents are less likely to be able to offer the same level of support. Removing coursework makes the system fairer.” The number of students receiving the top grade has jumped this yearLast month the chair of the ISC Barnaby Lenon told The Daily  that some schools rely heavily on coursework to boost grades, with teachers offering extra help to low ability pupils who may not fare so well in the final exams.The former headmaster at Harrow School said: “Schools with a number of weaker pupils, who relied more heavily on coursework in the past, may find their results plummeting.Now, the fact is that many pupils get their best mark in their teacher assessed coursework. Where a school has a significant number of more marginal pupils who historically got over the passfail boundary as a result of their high coursework marks, clearly those are the schools who might suffer from these reforms.”Private schools outscore state schools for the top gradesYesterday he did however however argue that the fall in the latest figures was as a result of the ISC accepting non-selective schools, and went on to congratulate Ofqual for the smooth implementation of the new system. Despite the fall in the number of pupils getting one grade A or 7 and above in the private sector the percentage remained more than three times the national average of 20.3 per cent.ISC figures also revealed that 73.7 per cent of their students gained at least one A*8 or 9 grade - an increase on last year’s 70.5 per cent.Kevin Stannard, director of innovation and learning at the Girls’ Day School Trust, said that whilst it was “entirely possible” that the removal of coursework had negatively impacted results, it was difficult to tell at this early stage of the new GCSEs being implemented. He added: “I think we need to wait to see more of a pattern, it will certainly be easier to compare when we have the 2019 results but for now we will be using the 2018 results as a benchmark.”Please review our commenting policyTax avoiders \u0026#39being blocked from honours list\u0026#39Brazilian court disqualifies Lula from presidential electionAretha Franklin funeral: How pastor\u0026#39s bleak view of \u0026#39abortion after birth\u0026#39 in black America provoked furyBill Clinton, Ariana Grande, and Stevie Wonder among mourners at Aretha Franklin\u0026#39s funeralManafort associate admits paying Trump inauguration $50,000 in Ukrainian cashPolice investigate possible terror link to double stabbing at Amsterdam stationDonald Trump disapproval ratings hit record high after week of legal woesJournalists arrested over alleged theft of documents on Northern Ireland killingsJanbaz Tarin charged with Solihull murders of Raneem Oudeh and her mother Khaola SaleemUAE used Israeli spyware to hack Saudi, Qatari and Lebanese rivalsUS announces end of all funds to UN agency for Palestinian refugeesDonald Trump to visit Ireland in November to \u0026#39renew deep historic ties\u0026#39Mexican historians prove authenticity of looted ancient Mayan text Social media is the new pillow talk, MoD warns as it tells troops to be careful with chatter onlineWhite farmers warn of ‘new Zimbabwe’ as calls grow for land expropriation in South AfricaNovichok case police cars dumped in Cotswolds landfill Boris Yeltsin suggested secret meeting on submarine with Bill Clinton, transcripts revealUS politician says decision not to have American flag in new moon landing film is \u0026#39total lunacy\u0026#39Nicola Sturgeon warns SNP MPs Alex Salmond will get no special treatment as she faces civil warWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/08/31/TELEMMGLPICT000172327859_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqEDjTm7JpzhSGR1_8ApEWQA1vLvhkMtVb21dMmpQBfEs.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"shigella everything need know causes symptoms treatment","story":"John and Susan Cooper who died after falling ill at a Red Sea hotel in Egypt. Two other guests evacuated from the hotel have contracted a shigella infection. Following the sudden deaths of a British couple at a holiday resort in Egypt last week, two of the  guests evacuated from the hotel where the couple were staying have said they have been infected with the bacteria Shigella.They were among some 300 guests evacuated from the Steigenberger Aqua Magic hotel in Hurghada following the sudden deaths of John and Susan Cooper from Burnley, Lancashire, who died within hours of each other.Samples tested in a British lab showed that the mother and her young daughter, from the north west, were suffering from infection with the bacteria, which can be transmitted through food or water. It is believed that they caught the infection while staying at the resort. Others are also thought to have been infected.Shigella - a group of bacteria similar to E. coli -  is a highly contagious and common cause of food poisoning. The bacteria causes the infectious disease known as shigellosis.There are four different types of shigella. Shigella sonnei and shigella flexneri are the kinds more commonly found in the UK.Shigella boydii and shigella dysenteriae are more common in developing countries - cases of infection with these types of the bacteria found in the UK tend to be among travellers coming back from holiday. Shigella dysenteriae type 1 can be deadly.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), most people who are infected with the bacteria develop diarrhoea, fever, and stomach cramps one to two days after they have been exposed. Mild cases of the infection usually clear up in five to seven days.Some people who are infected with shigella do not show any symptoms but they are still able to transmit the bacteria to other people.In more serious cases shigella can cause dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes bloody or mucus-containing diarrhoea.Shigella is highly contagious and it takes just a few of the germs to make someone sick. The germs are found in the faeces of infected people while they have diarrhea and for up to two weeks after the diarrhea has gone away.The germs are spread when someone touches their mouth with hands that have been in contact with the shigella bacteria or eats food with the germ on it. You can get shigella bacteria on your hands after touching surfaces or objects that have been contaminated with germs from the stool of someone with the infection, eating food made by someone who has shigellosis, handling nappies of an infected child, swallowing infected water or having sexual contact with someone who is infected or is recovering from a recent infection.Shigella causes some 165 million cases of disease worldwide each year - mostly among children under five in less wealthy countries.Countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Central America and Asia have in the past been hit by pandemic waves of the disease.2,327 laboratory-confirmed cases of shigella infection were reported in England, Wales and Northern Ireland in 2014 compared to 1,991 cases the previous year. At least 20 per cent of cases were related to travel.Confirmed cases in the UK have risen in recent years - according to Public Health England (PHE) this is most likely due to a rise in infections among gay and bisexual men. Clusters of cases have in the past also been reported in schools and day care centres - however, there is currently no warning of a general outbreak in the UK. More than one million people are estimated to die from shigella infections each year.Most cases clear up without issues but serious complications could include severe dehydration, seizures (particularly in children),  kidney failure and paralysis of the colon preventing bowel movement or passing gas which could cause the colon to rupture open if left untreated.Young children are the most likely to get shigellosis, but anyone can be infected. According to PHE, cases among adults in the UK (not just those returning from holiday) have risen in recent years and the majority of reported cases in the UK are now seen in people over the age of 16.People who go on holiday to developing countries could contract types of shigellosis that are not easily treated by antibiotics.There have also been outbreaks of shigella among gay and bisexual men who can transmit the bacteria during sex.There is still no vaccine to prevent shigella infection so practicing good hygiene is one of the main ways to help prevent the germ from spreading.According to Mayo Clinic in the US, hygiene measures you can take to prevent the bug from transferring to others include frequent and careful handwashing with soap, not preparing food for other people if you have diarrhoea, keeping children with diarrhoea home from school,  cleaning nappy changing areas after use and disposing of dirty nappies in covered, lined bins and not swallowing water from ponds, lakes or untreated pools. Severe or persistent cases of shigellosis are usually treated with antibiotics.You should pay a visit to your  GP if symptoms do not improve after a few days or are severe - for example if your or your child\u0027s diarrhea is bloody, if the diarrhoea is causing weight loss or dehydration or if it is accompanied by a fever higher than 38 C.

The challenge for TCL, beyond simply building a smarthphone, is rebuilding on a brand that was once so popular it became known as \u0027CrackBerry\u0027 – referencing the addictiveness of the devices it built.Scroll Free September: Why you should go cold turkey on social mediaThe way to do this, TCL figures, is to appeal to enterprise customer by\u0026nbspfocussing on two key areas: privacy and productivity.Today\u0027s smartphones try to offer a one size fits all solution, but that is no longer realistic when we have a global marketplace as erse as we have today, said Alain Lejeune, a senior vice president at TCL Communcation.But this is why we focues on making modern BlackBerry smartphones like Key2 LE, to stand out and deliver a great experience for everyday communication, with access to all the features, connectivity and applications our customers expect.Key2 LE comes in Slate, Champagne and Atomic colours (BlackBerry Mobile)Despite being a scaled version of the Key2, the Key2 LE features impressive specs for a phone that retails at just $399. A Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 processor, together with 4GB of RAM, makes it theoretically as powerful as a midrange laptop. A 3,000mAh battery also means it has a battery life of 22 hours, though no reviews have yet emerged to confirm this.Most important for its demographic, perhaps, is the inclusion of its own custom apps and software, such as the DTEK security dashboard app and Locker, which helps users hide apps behind a security wall.Earlier this year, BlackBerry\u0026nbspMobile said it was aiming for a 3 to 5 per cent market share over the next few years, with the company saying it was heading in the right direction. But while promising for business users, it will take a massive market reversal for the Key range of BlackBerry-branded smartphones to achieve this.\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this

london declare independence uk 1970s free independent","story":"Created with Sketch.The Free Independent Republic of Frestonia was born of a generation who knew counterculture as much as precarious living. Now a new book collects photography and stories from the communityClick to followThe IndependentThe community designed a flag, appointed ministers of state – including actor David Rappaport as foreign minister – made their own postage stamps and issued visas for visitorsThere was a lot of talk, in the wake of the Brexit referendum, suggesting that London should stage its own exit from the United Kingdom, declare independence, and ask to rejoin the EU as a nation state.Ignoring for now the fact that not everyone – though\u0026nbspit might seem that way to London – outside the capital voted to leave the EU, it seemed a satisfying, though jokey, postscript to the Brexit vote. Indeed, more than 180,000 Londoners signed an online petition calling for the mayor, Sadiq\u0026nbspKhan, to “declare London independent, and apply to join the EU –\u0026nbspincluding membership of the Schengen zone”.But what a lot of the signatories might not have realised was that there was indeed a precedent for London seceding from the UK. Or at least, one street of the capital.\u0026nbspWelcome to the Free Independent Republic of Frestonia. Or, what’s left of it, which these days amounts to the Frestonian Gallery, keeping the name and spirit alive of one of the most curious episodes in London’s history. It\u0026nbspbegan on Halloween\u0026nbsp1977, when the residents of Freston Road in Notting Dale, West London, which was largely comprised of squats and communes, declared independence.Threatened with eviction, the squatters said they were no longer part of the UK and appealed to the United Nations to send in peacekeeping forces to prevent Greater London Council turfing them out of the homes they had claimed. They designed a flag, appointed ministers of state, and even made their own postage stamps and issued visas for visitors.The short-lived story of the Free Independent Republic of Frestonia has now been documented in a new book of photographs by one of its residents, the photographer Tony Sleep, who was resident on Freston Road from 1974.\u0026nbspSleep describes the Frestonia experiment as “part publicity stunt, part theatrical protest”, and adds that while it wasn’t a serious attempt to break away from the UK, there was never any need to, because what became Frestonia “was already on a different planet”.He writes in the lavish book: “Frestonia was rooted in the counterculture of the time. The period is now dismissed as little more than daft clothes and hair, accompanied by a great soundtrack and the invention of sex and drugs.“It was, we are told, youthful self indulgence that ended badly because it was irresponsible and naive.”Frestonian Gallery)Frestonia was born out of problems that young people will recognise today: the lack of affordable accommodation. Sleep points out that the millennial generation might have a beef with the baby boomers who grew up in the 1960s and 1970s because they had it easy, and accommodation was cheap and plentiful. Not a bit of it, he says.“Rented flats were in very short supply, and mostly slum standard. You might achieve a rented bedsit as long as you weren’t black, Irish\u0026nbspor a dog. Then, as now, landlords wanted ‘professional’ people.“Council housing lists were only for families, and backlogged for decades. Despite what now seem like absurdly low prices, only the wealthy and secure could obtain mortgages at a time before easy mass debts. Less than half the population owned their own homes at the start of the 1970s.”Freston Road, where squatters and activists founded housing coop and community Frestonia\u0026nbsp(Getty)Many of the houses on Freston Road were empty, having been condemned as unfit for human habitation, and most of the residents had been relocated to the new highrise blocks of flats that began to go up in the 1960s and 1970s. There had been a move to demolish the vacant properties, but residents in neighbouring communities had complained that they would be looking out onto swathes of barren, rubble-strewn land that would encourage flytipping, so the authorities decided to take the cheaper option and just leave the buildings standing for a while.Freston Road might have been abandoned, but that didn’t mean it was unused. From 1974, squatters began to break into the empty houses and set up home there Tony Sleep, aged 24 at that time, was one of them.He recalls:\u0026nbsp“Squatting is distinctly equal opportunity. If you can gain possession, it’s yours. This led to an interesting mix of people who had little in common except needing somewhere to live and being poor for one reason or another. While some tried to make their new homes habitable, several houses were quickly wrecked.”Sleep remembers well his first sight of Freston Road. He’d been living in a “dismal rented basement” in west Kensington, but as he and his girlfriend parted company, he needed somewhere else to live, and heard about a street of empty houses. Some of his friends went to have a look and broke into two of the houses.“That night I paid them a visit,” writes Sleep. “Eight people, four guys, four girls, in one candlelit room, the only one that had windows. There was no toilet, no water, no electricity.”But his friends set to work installing plumbing and wiring as best they could, found an old toilet, rescued carpets and furniture from skips, and Sleep asked if he could move in with them.By 1977 Freston Road had settled into an unorthodox community, of sorts. But the attention of the GLC wandered back to these old, abandoned homes, and the squatters were told that they were to be evicted from these properties.The council offered to place the squatters in what were considered “hard to let” properties dotted around London, and some took the flats –\u0026nbspand, says Sleep, were promptly replaced in Freston Road by other people desperate for somewhere to live.\u0026nbspThe GLC announced its intention to bulldoze Freston Road after all, and a meeting was called, attended by 200 people. They decided – inspired by the Ealing comedy Passport to Pimlico – to go it alone. The Free Independent Republic of Frestonia was born. And the battle was on.The Frestonian National Anthem was written (“Long live Frestonia! Land of the free – not the GLC”) and a community newspaper, The Tribal Messenger, was distributed. Frestonia made the international press, and the Daily Mirror ran a piece declaring “All Hall, Frestonia”. The actor David Rappaport was made foreign minister, and playwright Heathcote Williams became ambassador to the United Kingdom.It was all a bit jolly and, of course, more than a pinch of Ealing comedy. But, Sleep points out, Frestonia was also an interesting way of putting British society under the\u0026nbspmicroscope.“Communities are defined, more or less, by what people have in common,” he writes. “That’s usually class, background or aspiration, sometimes race or religion. What people have in common helps them feel safe and valued. What is different can be threatening or isive.Frestonian Gallery)“Families, on the other hand, are a matter of being stuck with people you sometimes struggle to tolerate, let alone like. Frestonia was a bit of both.“Frestonians were, beneath the veneer of pragmatic anarchy, from different cultures. There were the hippies, idealists of a sort. There were the punks, nihilists of a sort. And there were the itinerant street people, whose lack of youth and lost changes gave them a thread of bitterness to chew on together.”Over the next couple of years, fighting the threat of the GLC bulldozers, the anarchic squat collective organised itself more seriously, forming the Bramley Housing Cooperative with an aim that was less about the fun of independence and more about securing the future of the Freston Road community.Eventually, the GLC won the war, and demolition of the squats began in 1983. But the Bramley Housing Cooperative, working with the Notting Hill Housing Trust, continued to fight for Freston Road as a residential area. And, ultimately, they won.Sleep says, “Frestonia didn’t cease when the squats were demolished. How could it? They were only useful ruins. Frestonia was about the people, its improbable family.“If you walk through Frestonia now, there’s little to suggest it is much different from anywhere else. You’ll find a street of small, but perhaps unusually pretty houses, built in the mid 1980s. They look carefully designed, a bit too inidual to be social housing. You may not notice the enclosed communal gardens, or the sheltered housing scheme that the coop insisted on, you won’t know the coop ensured housing for some of the more vulnerable Frestonians.”It might be that Frestonia would be forgotten all together, but for Tony Sleep’s photographic record of the people, events and houses on Freston Road in the late 1970s and early 1980s.‘Pop-up squat’: Activists occupy property to protest Housing BillNew photography exhibition shows the tough reality of squattingChallenging consumption and overwork in a Danish communityThe name does linger on in the form of the Frestonian Gallery, opened in 2017 by Matt Incledon and Rollo Campbell, who have published Tony Sleep’s photographs and recollections in Welcome To Frestonia. A pair of, in their own words, “itinerant art dealers”, they opened the gallery in The People’s Hall, a Victorian building that was once at the heart of Frestonia.\u0026nbspFrestonian Gallery opened in 2017 to remember a most curious episode in London’s history\u0026nbsp(Tony SleepFrestonian Gallery)Becoming appraised of the story of Frestonia, they were introduced to Tony Sleep, and arranged an exhibition of his photographs. They write in their foreword: “It was an exhibition unlike anything either of us had worked on previously. Each day at the gallery provided a steady stream of visitors keen to revisit and share their own personal memories of Frestonia. It would be a nice point at which to say ‘We then decided a book of Tony’s work needs to be published...’ but again, in truth, the decision had been made for us already by the sheer emotional response to this unique exhibition.”Was it all worth it for the Frestonians? Did it make a difference? Tony Sleep closes his remarkable document of this time by musing, “Forty years on, the UK seems to have travelled in a large circle and arrived little the wiser, but probably angrier, more cynical and more ided than ever.\u0026nbspWe are all Frestonians, on this small blue dot in the middle of nowhere. We are all one family, whether we like it or not.”Welcome to Frestonia by Tony Sleep\u0026nbspis published by the Frestonian Gallery (frestoniangallery), priced £35Free Independent Republic of FrestoniaEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"subscribe to the daily edition our newspaper for your tablet","story":"For full functionality of this site it is necessary to enable JavaScript...Please follow the instructions in the link below.Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience."},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/29/15/06898485.jpg  width= 2500  height= 1667  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/29/15/06898485.jpg","title":"brexit eu barnier border ireland urgency latest october raab","story":"Created with Sketch.Michel Barnier\u0026nbspsays agreement on Northern Ireland border \u0027critical\u0027 to final Brexit dealClick to followIndy PoliticsEU says Brexit border plan now \u0027a matter of some urgency\u0027The UK must agree a backstop plan for the Northern Ireland border after Brexit\u0026nbspas\u0026nbspa matter of some urgency, the EU\u0027s chief negotiator has warned.Speaking after the latest round of negotiations,\u0026nbspMichel Barnier\u0026nbspsaid that\u0026nbspwithout a detailed plan, there will be no agreement.The sticking point relates to what should happen to the Northern Ireland border if the UK and EU are unable to reach a trade deal that would see an open border maintained.\u0026nbspSpeaking alongside\u0026nbspDominic Raab, the Brexit secretary, Mr Barnier\u0026nbspsaid: We\u0026nbspmust have a detailed backstop solution, which is legally operational, in the withdrawal agreement.The prime minister, Theresa May, committed herself to this, as have all the leaders of EU institution – the parliament for example.He added: It is\u0026nbspa matter of some urgency.

Since the referendum there has been hot debate over the meaning of Brexit: would it entail a full withdrawal from the existing agreement, known as hard Brexit, or the soft version in which we would remain part of a common customs area for most goods, as Turkey does?Though progress was made last year, there has still been no solid agreement on whether there should be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.Despite protests from a small number of Conservative MPs, the Government and the EU are largely in agreement that a transitional period is needed after Brexit.58 Rights of EU citizens living the UKThe Prime Minister has promised EU citizens already living in the UK the right to live and work here after Brexit, but the rights of those who arrive after Brexit day remains unclear.68 Future trade agreement (with the EU)Despite this being a key issue in negotiations, the Government has yet to lay out exactly what it wants from a trade deal with the EU.The Government has already begun trying to woo foreign leaders into prospective trade agreements, with various high profile state visits to China, India and Canada for May, and the now infamous invitation to US President Donald Trump to visit London.Banks in the UK will be hit hard regardless of the Brexit outcome.

She had been complaining for weeks of strange urges and impulses, as well as voices telling her to do things she wouldn’t usually do.Her parents, desperate to help their vulnerable daughter, believed this could be the work of the devil, so they took her to see prominent exorcist Manuel Acuña - the only man who seemed to have the cure.Manuel, known to his thousands of followers as the Padre, has exorcised hundreds of girls just like Natalia - believing that the cures to their mental health problems are religious, rather than medical.In Natalias case, the Padre, sweating profusely, spends an hour locked in combat with the devil, chanting to himself as the girls horrific screams echo around his church, in the suburbs of Argentinian capital Buenos Aires.Many of us would imagine that exorcisms dont exist outside of horror films, but the truth is that they are still relatively commonplace in some parts of the world.In Argentina, where religion plays a huge role in society, the Padre has found that there is a huge demand for exorcisms, often for vulnerable, unwell girls who need help from doctors.During the procedures, he shouts, brandishes crosses and rings bells to ward off demons, while his subjects thrash and moan - supposedly as a result of the high-energy battle between the Padre and the devil.And now the enigmatic figure, who often appears on local TV shows, has been made the subject of a new BBC3 documentary, Exorcism: The Battle for Young Minds.In the show, journalist Andrew Gold meets the Padre, who he says was clearly influenced by the big-screen depiction of exorcisms.His church was adorned with movie posters superimposing his face onto characters from the X-Files and The Exorcist, Andrew told Sun Online.But when Andrew took part in an exorcism - by ringing bells around Natalias head as she lay strapped to the ground - the sinister reality set it.When watching videos, there’s a distance that makes the exorcism process seem either paranormal or a little embarrassing, Andrew says.But to actually be in the room is something else.Initially keen to get involved, I’d taken hold of the bells that supposedly drove off the devil.But standing over Natalia, the gravity of her situation dawned on me. This was a woman at my feet who I perceived to be suffering from a serious mental illness.After the exorcism, Natalia claims that she is feeling better, and the Padre is eager to chalk her experience up as another win for his church.But when Andrew checks in with Natalia again later on, he learns that her symptoms have not improved at all.And in other cases, it appears that the Padres work can even harm the people he exorcises.That was what happened when 17-year-old Candela came to him, asking for help.When Andrew meets Candela, her mum explains that she suffers from bulimia, hears voices in her head and cuts herself.I tried to kill myself on Monday, the teenager adds, holding out her hand to reveal a lattice of red scars over her wrist.Candela has been to see doctors about this, but psychiatrists have all wanted to check Candela into their clinics.Her mother refused, and instead brought her for a consultation with the Padre, who recommended an exorcism as a solution to Candelas problems.What worried me was the thought of Candela, already in a suicidal state, being subjected to his violent methods, Andrew says.It made me wonder how many other teenagers were shunning medical advice in favour of quick-fix promises.Candelas mother watched on, desperate, during her daughters exorcism.Throughout the procedure, Candela twitches and cries, a cross resting on her chest as the Padre shouts at her and chants biblical slogans in her ears.The power burns you, he says, supposedly speaking to the devil within. The power commands you. Come out now in the name of Jesus.No, Candela shouts in response, supposedly speaking the words of Satan. She belongs to me.When the ordeal is over, Candela says she feels like a weight is off her shoulders.Smiling and relieved, she hugs her mother and says: Im free of evil. Its a big relief after two years.But when Andrew checks in with her months later, he learns that her mental state has deteriorated substantially.So why would she say she feels better in the aftermath of the terrifying ordeal?Often, just believing that something will make you better can improve your condition in the short term - and this may explain why Candela was initially pleased with her exorcism.But this boost wont last forever, and many of the young women exorcised by the padre need long-term help from medical professionals, not a few hours with cross-wielding demon-slayers.In the documentary, Andrew speaks with doctor Eduardo Garin, who is used to losing his patients to paranormal figures like the Padre.He believes that exorcism is so popular because it genuinely appears to work at first, as a catharsis.But the doctor warns: “I can only tell you as a doctor and as a scientist. It is a dangerous practice.”He adds that its effects can only ever be beneficial for a year or two, until a new psychological episode makes the patient go back to feeling like they did before.Buenos Aires is actually home to one of the highest proportions of psychologists per person, but poorer residents like Candela often dont have access to them.This, plus ingrained taboos around mental illness, have helped to fuel a booming industry for exorcists who claim to offer quick cures to serious issues.So, if exorcisms arent real, why does the Padre do it?His opponents say its all a money-making scheme.The Padre, who doesnt pay his volunteer staff, collects contributions to the church from everyone he treats or holds consultations with, and the exorcism business has elevated him to a minor celebrity in Argentina.He also offers paid-for classes about paranormal phenomena at his church, and his spiritual gift shop sells an array of goods which he has supposedly blessed - including plastic bottles of holy water.At the end of the BBC documentary, a furious Padre inexplicably flips and demands to be left alone, calling reporters snotty brats and little punks when they try to press him on the controversies surrounding his exorcisms.You got the scandal you were looking for, he rages. And you came to defraud the churchs trust.They just want Argentina to look bad. Theyre English. Theyre the enemy - they always have been. They took the Falklands.With that, the Padre storms off, without addressing any of the serious concerns.Andrew still isnt satisfied. He says: Id spent weeks watching this man in his battle to free young minds.The deeper I looked, the more I worried that teenagers were looking up to this powerful figure, instead of seeking professional advice.Having spent time with Natalia and Candela, I couldnt deny that they seemed happier after their exorcisms. I only wondered how long it would last.Exorcism: The Battle For Young Minds is available now on BBC iPlayer Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He’s doing a great job of giving them something to focus on while they grieve.“It’s obviously tinged with sadness though as they know Alfie would have been a fantastic big brother, if only he’d managed to survive.”Alfie’s parents, from Liverpool, launched a legal bid to keep him alive after doctors applied to turn off his life support.Tom even flew to Rome to see Pope Francis when doctors in Italy offered to treat Alfie.

I love you my guy.”Pope Francis tweeted afterwards: “I am deeply moved by the death of little Alfie. I pray especially for his parents as God the Father receives him in his tender embrace.”Both Kate and Tom carry a rare gene which sparked Alfie’s illness, so there were fears Thomas could inherit the same condition.

There are three peers in the House of Lords who are all crossbenchers but still Labour Party members, so why is it one rule for then and one rule for me?”A legal victory for Mr Field would be potentially explosive for the spiralling rebellion of moderate MPs against Mr Corbyn.It would mean dozens of others would also be free to resign the whip and ignore Mr Corbyn’s daily voting orders without fear of getting the boot from the wider party.Mr Field also said he is considering triggering an embarrassing by-election, in which he would run against an official Labour candidate.Labour denied Mr Field had been ejected from the party, insisting instead that he had in effect expelled himself.A senior Labour source said: “The Chief Whip has met with Frank Field this afternoon.“They had an amicable discussion.“It was conveyed to him that the Labour Party rules state that resigning the Labour Whip means you automatically opt to resign from the Labour Party.”The row’s dramatic escalation came as a second rebel Labour MP declared he will also resign the party whip next week if Jeremy Corbyn fails to adopt a strong new antisemitism rules.Longstanding MP for Ilford South Mike Gapes’s ultimatum to follow Frank Field out comes ahead of a crucial showdown meeting of the party’s ruling National Executive Committee on Tuesday.JEREMY Corbyn is facing further departures over anti-Semitism.A series of moderate Labour MPs are said by comrades to be weighing up whether to follow Frank Field and resign the party whip.The five seen as most likely are:- Mike Gapes, MP for Ilford SouthThe 69 year-old veteran Socialist boss is under massive pressure to adopt the full international Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition without any caveats.The hard left Labour leader is still insisting on having a free speech defence that allows hard left members to criticise Israel’s right to exist.If Mr Corbyn doesn’t climb down, Mr Gapes said he will “consider his position”.Saying he was “tainted and sickened” by the avalanche of racism charges against Labour, he added: “I am agonising every day about the situation and the state of the Labour”.Another Labour MP John Mann called on Mr Corbyn to “show leadership” by announcing every Jewish MP will be automatically reselected as a candidate for the next election.Mr Mann added: “That’s leadership Jeremy, so get leading”.Some of these obnoxious idiots even have media columns where they ­masquerade as journalists, instead of myopic propagandists for a hard-left ideology which ends in starvation and early graves everywhere it is tried.Field has given his life to Labour.He has done infinitely more for his constituents and the poor than any of Labour’s new influx of middle-class posers will if they live to be 120.He’s had enough. No one in their right mind should blame him. The party is a magnet for intolerant thugs, its leader a brazen anti-Semite and halfwit.Corbyn cosies up to Islamists sworn to wipe Israel off the map. He honours ­terrorists who kill Jews. He makes racist speeches, hiding behind the age-old “Zionist” euphemism.He rewrites internationally accepted definitions of anti-Semitism to allow himself and his followers more flexibility to voice their hate.The Sun has been at odds with Labour before.

So thanks to Northern Powerhouse Minister Jake Berry  for touring his patch for a week and claiming everything is hunky-dory up here as we eagerly await Brexit’s golden dawn.  The North’s economy is in “rude health” he wrote, and its resilient people are ready to rise “to the \u0026shychallenges Brexit may bring” with the Tories’ Northern Powerhouse “key to delivering this change”.  Meanwhile, in the real world, the Northern Rail Network is on its knees due to the indifference of the Tory Transport Secretary, and the North is about to lose \u0026pound2.37billion of investment because the Tories used flawed statistics to underestimate, by 13,000, the number of new homes needed.   Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham says the Cabinet Office refused to talk to northern politicians about Brexit  or release assessments of the potentially \u0026shycatastrophic impact of a no-deal withdrawal.  And recent analysis showed that of the top seven Leave-voting constituencies, which now have a majority of voters in favour of remain-ing, five are in the North.  Which may be down to the dawning realisation that when EU funding to the poorest areas dries up, Tories won’t inject fresh money. Because they couldn’t give a flying ferret about the needs of anyone who can’t keep them in power. Wales has had \u0026pound4billion in EU \u0026shystructural funds since 2000, and between 2007 and 2013 more than 20,000 projects in the North received Brussels funding. Can you really see the Tories matching those huge injections when the post-Brexit cash drain kicks in and they go into an election needing to bribe their heartlands? Where I live, in Liverpool, EU funding kick-started the transformation of the city centre and waterfront, coming at a time when some Tory ministers wanted to pull all \u0026shyfinancial support and let it suffer terminal decline.  As a solid anti-Tory city in a mainly anti-Tory region, there was no political capital to be lost by pulling the plug. There still isn’t. In January, the new Royal Liverpool hospital was 80% completed when Tory-bankrolling builders Carillion went bust. Ever since, it has sat there, a vast, unfinished building site, as patients who desperately need the new hospital have to make do with the dilapidated one which should by now have been demolished. Local politicians have lobbied the government to step in and finish the job but have been told that the funds aren’t in place. Meanwhile, another stalled Carillion hospital, The Midland politan, has been given the \u0026pound300million needed to get the job done.

With the Tories tearing themselves apart over Brexit, communities struggling with the impact of austerity and public services buckling under the strain of cuts, this should be when Labour is giving voice to the concerns the rest of the country is singing. Instead, it has spent its summer trying to firefight claims about anti-Semitism, bullying and intimidation. The uneasy truce established within the Parliamentary Party after Jeremy Corbyn saw off the leadership challenge by Owen Smith in 2016 is at risk of being shattered. The party is awash with rumours of splits and defections. Other MPs could follow Frank Field by resigning the whip and some may try to establish a new party. This is not a new situation for Labour. Throughout its history, the tensions between the left and right of the party have flared up, whether it was fury at Ramsay MacDonald’s decision to form a national government, frustration at Clement Attlee’s caution or the bitter factionalism of the early 1980s.  During most of those moments, the party found a way to cling together and maintain the broad church which saw Herbert Morrison and Nye Bevan in the 1940s, and Peter Mandelson and Tony Benn in the 1990s, stay in the same congregation. The lessons of what happened when the Labour Party did split still act as a cautionary warning for those contemplating a new party. They witnessed the creation of the Social Democrat Party and saw the only outcome of this ultimately fruitless endeavour was to cost Labour victory in the 1983 and 1987 general elections. Sentimentality and solidarity are intrinsic to Labour’s DNA but the situation at the moment is so dire even these strong values may not be enough to keep the party together. It is personality rather than policy which lies at the heart of Labour’s problems. The majority of the party has embraced Corbyn’s agenda, albeit some more willingly than others. The battles are not over the domestic agenda of renationalisation, greater redistribution and investing in our public services. The exception is Brexit where the party is still wrestling with the need to appeal to those who believe our departure is a disaster without alienating many traditional Labour voters who welcome the opportunity to regain control of our borders and thrive as an independent nation.  While Corbyn’s stance on Brexit remains a source of frustration, there is an understanding as to why he has adopted a nuanced position, not least because this ambivalence proved successful at the general election. The dissatisfaction with him stems from his style of leadership and the perception that he has not done enough to tackle the alleged anti-Semitism and abuse of party members carried out in his name. Supporters will rightly point out that Corbyn has a long history of fighting racism and deplores any form of hatred, intolerance and intimidation. They also argue that the allegations of anti-Semitism have been whipped up by a right-wing media which found its other attacks on Labour to have fallen flat. Accusations of racism and entryism can also be levelled at the Conservatives but they receive far less coverage. However unfair, the responsibility lies more heavily on Labour to adhere to the highest standards in order to \u0026shyprotect itself from a biased press. This requires stronger leadership from Jeremy \u0026shyCorbyn.

Kate James, 20, gave birth just months after losing little Alfie who suffered from a rare degenerative brain condition. He is believed to be named Thomas after dad Tom Evans, 21, and was born at the beginning of August. Alfie was in a coma for the final 16 months of his life and died in April aged 23 months. Alfie’s parents, from Liverpool, launched a legal bid to keep him alive after doctors at Alder Hey Children’s Hospital applied to turn off his life support. Doctors argued that his condition could not improve and strongly opposed moves by his family to provide specialist care outside the country.  Hundreds of supporters - dubbed “Alfie’s Army” - backed the parents and Tom even flew to Rome to see Pope Francis when doctors in Italy offered to treat the youngster. But the tragic toddler’s life support was finally switched off in April as the family’s lawyers eventually exhausted all legal avenues following a Court of Appeal ruling. A source told The Sun : “Kate knew she was pregnant in Alfie’s final few weeks and wanted to keep it quiet so she could give her all to Alfie. “She and Tom are delighted with their new arrival. He’s doing a great job of giving them something to focus on while they grieve.  “It’s obviously tinged with sadness though as they know Alfie would have been a fantastic big brother, if only he’d managed to survive.” Both Kate and Tom carry a rare gene which sparked Alfie’s illness, so there were fears Thomas could inherit the same condition. But it is reported the three-week-old boy has passed a series of tests in hospital, leaving his parents very relieved.” Thomas wrote a heartbreaking post on Facebook in tribute to his late son earlier this week. On Thursday he wrote: Four months today you gained your wings buddie. The pain and heartache gets worse everyday.

Diana was 36 when she was killed in a Mercedes along with Dodi and her driver Henri Paul on August 31, 1997. The princess\u0027s turbulent personal life saw her clash with the royal family and battle bouts of severe depression - eventually turning to bulimia as a release valve. But, in the months leading up to her death, it seemed Diana had found true happiness with Dodi Fayed, the millionaire son of Harrods tycoon Mohammed Al Fayed. Letters sent just weeks before the crash reveal Diana spoke of spending magical time Dodi while on a yachting holidays in Sardinia and France  In the first letter, dated August 6 1997, she wrote: Darling Dodi, Heaven knows where on earth I begin to thank you for the most magical six days on the ocean waves. It is a bit of an Oh my God situation. I adored it all and every possible minute was full of laughter and happiness, and that combination is a serious treat. She ended: This comes with all the love in the world and, as always, a million heartfelt thanks for bringing such joy into this particular chick\u0027s life, from Diana xx In a second letter later that month, Diana sent an accompanying gift of a pair of cuff links originally belonging to her father.  She wrote: Darling Dodi, These cufflinks were the very last gift that I received from the man I loved most in the world, my father. They are given to you as I know how much joy it would give him to know they were in such safe and special hands. Fondest love, from Diana. The couple were killed just over a fortnight later. The letters were read at the inquest into Diana\u0027s death in 2007. Diana and Dodi met after Dodi\u0027s father Mohamed invited the princess and her two sons to stay at his palatial villa in St Tropez - where other guests included his 42-year-old son Dodi.

Serial rapist Joji Obara was jailed for life in 2008 for drugging the former flight attendant then dismembering and disposing of her body. He was not convicted of her murder because her remains were too decomposed to establish how she died. Now it is feared he could be eligible for parole in less than two years.  Lucie’s dad Tim Blackman said: “If I thought he was going to be eligible for parole at some point I would really seriously look in to doing everything I could to stop it. He has never taken any responsibility, admitted guilt or shown any contrition.” Lucie was 21 when she went missing in July 2000 in Tokyo, where she had been working as a bar hostess in the city’s Roppongi district. Her body was found seven months later in a seafront cave a few hundred yards from the home of Obara, a millionaire businessman who had an obsession with Western women. Lucy had been cut into eight and her head was encased in concrete.  Obara was finally jailed in 2008, after being acquitted the year before. But the fact he was not convicted of murder meant he was spared the death sentence and instead got a life term, which under Japanese law is said to be a minimum 20 years. But taking into account the seven years he spent in custody during his long trial, he has been incarcerated for 18 years – so could put in an application for parole in less than two. Speaking ahead of Lucie’s birthday, Tim said he does not feel anger but “intense sorrow” when he thinks of his daughter’s sick attacker, who he described as “just a monster”.  He said: “In court he avoided looking in our direction. He was constantly in his papers or looking at his counsel. He approached it in a business-like way with files and papers which is kind of ridiculous.” Police probing Lucie’s disappearance found 2,000 video tapes of Obara raping scores of women he drugged with Rohypnol. If they woke, he would use chloroform to subdue them. As a result he was convicted of eight counts of rape, as well as his role in the death of Australian backpacker Carita Ridgway in 1992, who died from complications from chloroform. Tim, 65, is proud that Lucie became a “heroine” for Obara’s other victims. He told the Mirror: “It’s exactly what she’d have done in any other circumstance, to think of others first.”  When his daughter went missing, property developer Tim flew to Japan in a high-profile campaign to find her. Time has not lessened the pain of losing his sharp and funny daughter. He said: “Every day you think about what she’d be doing now, whether she would be married, whether I’d have grandchildren by her now. It leaves a constant chasm of emptiness when you lose someone young like that.”  Although the former British Airways stewardess had not settled on a long-term job, her father is convinced that she would have found her niche and built a successful career. He also believes Lucie of Sevenoaks, Kent, who always liked children and babysat regularly, would be a mum by now, raising a family of her own.  He said: “The word memory doesn’t really work for Lucie, because it reflects to the past. Whereas I just think about her and she’s around us all the time. So many people would like to hear that you’re getting better. “You hear this word closure. But it just doesn’t exist in these sorts of cases. The notion that you just shut the door on that part of your life just doesn’t happen. As a father you don’t want to put that burden down.” He said the marriage of Lucie’s brother Rupert, 34, last month was a “fantastically happy and utterly wonderful” occasion, but that “Lucie was in our minds all day”. Sadly time has not healed the rift between Tim and his ex-wife, Lucie’s mum Jane Steare, who hit out at him for accepting \u0026pound420,000 from an associate of Obara’s, under the Japanese practice of offering “atonement”.  Years of flying across the world fighting for his daughter had taken a toll on his finances and he used the rest to establish the Lucie Blackman Trust.

The princess had endured a turbulent personal life which saw her clash with the royal family and battle bouts of severe depression. But, in the weeks leading up to her death, it seemed Diana had found true happiness with Dodi, the millionaire son of Harrods tycoon Mohammed Al-Fayed. The pair moved in similar circles and had seen each other at polo events and film premieres in London\u0027s West End. However, it wasn\u0027t until July 1997 that Diana and Dodi started a relationship during a luxury summer break in the south of France.   Diana was still reeling from her split from the surgeon Hasnat Khan when she accepted Mohamed Al-Fayed\u0027s invitation to stay at his palatial villa in St Tropez with William, 15, and Harry, 12.  Al-Fayed had been a friend of her father, the late Earl Spencer, and her stepmother, Raine, the Countess of Chambrun, sat on the Harrods International Board. Throughout the summer, a care-free Diana was pictured relaxing with then 42-year-old son Dodi, who had reportedly broke off his engagement with an American model to be with her.  That summer he showered her with gifts and soon the pair had embarked on a whirlwind romance. She was pictured lounging on the deck of the yacht with Dodi, kissing him, and cuddling in the warm sea and sprawled in the sun. The pictures of them kissing - taken by Italian photographer Mario Brenna - were sold for more than \u0026pound1million around the world. Diana was, according to friends, relaxed about the publicity over her new relationship but would have known it would cause a surge in interest of new pictures of her with Dodi.

Shocking video captured by mum Jess Appleby, 28, shows the blood-curdling moment Stewart Palmer tries to burst into her house through a side door wielding the nightmarish weapon. Her partner Dean Brown claims only his last-minute heroics saved her and her young son Archie from a grisly fate. Dean said: It shook me up for a while because he nearly got in the kitchen. If I hadn\u0027t have kicked him and shut the door he would have cut us all up with that chainsaw.  I had to look after her and her son. I did what I had to do. In a series of three videos - shot by Jess and a neighbour - the confrontation quickly escalates from an argument in her front garden to a full-blown fist fight in the street of their Barnsley estate. Footage shows bald thug Palmer - wearing an Ellesse zip-up top - approaching the woman\u0027s window as a child shouts you just spat at me from inside. The young mum and model charges out of the house through a side gate to confront him, repeatedly saying get off my property as she tries to push him away. Dean then comes out and the two men begin fighting.  But suddenly the camera drops as another woman rushes in and the two start to scrap. Footage filmed by the next-door neighbour shows the fracas unfolding, with the two women trading blows whilst witnesses egg them on and children in the background are heard crying. Others run in to break it up but struggle to separate the two duelling women, and soon the two men start fighting again. Eventually the situation begins to calm down but the four feisty sluggers continue to exchange accusations over the garden fence. At this point, Palmer walks away, but another clip shows him charging up to the house with a roaring chainsaw before the video cuts out.

The pair laugh, before she adds: I have to say that because you are sitting there, directing the witty comment to Charles. In response, Charles can be seen gesturing his head in an upward nod, before appearing to roll his eyes back. Body language expert Judi James said Charles\u0027s response to his fianc\u0026eacutee\u0027s words was peculiar and the footage shows signals of incompatibility.  She said: This interview is littered with signals of incompatibility and emphatic anxiety rituals from Charles that seem to increase in front of our eyes. Diana\u0027s trait of sitting with her chin sunk into her hand suggests she was hoping to be seen as dreamily romantic but it was also a gesture associated with boredom. In contrast Charles sits upright and tense with his hands fiddling and picking in a self-comfort ritual that suggests agitation.

The 36-year-old was being driven in a black Mercedes S-280 limo after she and partner Dodi - son of Egyptian billionaire Mohamed Al-Fayed - left the Ritz Hotel, where they had been staying. The car was speeding through the tunnel in the early hours of the morning on August 31, when it crashed into a pillar at 65mph.  Driver Henri Paul, who also died in the crash, lost control on the dual-carriageway. The Princess\u0027 bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones survived. Admitting he was intensely protective towards her Charles said he was furious when he received the tragic news and wished he could have done something to save his sister.

David and Louise Turpin face dozens of charges of torture, false imprisonment and abuse and could face life in prison if found guilty. Police raided the Turpins\u0027 home in Perris in January, after an emaciated 17-year-old girl escaped through a window and called 911. Officers found the girl\u0027s 12 brothers and sisters - ranging in age from 2 to 29 - trapped inside the darkened, foul-smelling house, with some even chained to beds.  The siblings, suffering from malnourishment, muscle wasting, stunted growth and other signs of severe abuse, were taken into protective custody and their parents were arrested. Prosecutors have said the victims were deprived of food, basic hygiene and medical care. It has also been claimed the children were harshly punished for trivial reasons, such as wasting water by washing their hands above the wrist, and even taunted with food they were forbidden to eat. Defence lawyers are yet to offer an explanation for the circumstances alleged by authorites.  Described as \u0027a deeply religious\u0027 couple, the Turpin\u0027s home-schooled their children and made them memorise Bible scripture, according to David\u0027s parents, James and Betty Turpin. The defendants were each charged with 12 counts of torture, 12 counts of false imprisonment, seven counts of abuse of a dependant adult and eight counts of child abuse. Louise Turpin, 50, also faces an additional assault charge.  David Turpin, 56, a former aeronautics engineer, was also charged with one count of committing a lewd act on a child, plus eight counts of perjury over his claims of running a private school, with his children as the students. The couple entered a not guilty plea to all charges and denied all allegations.

In scenes reminiscent of horror classic The Exorcist a young girl wails and writhes on the floor as the purple-robed priest thrusts a crucifix in her face and shouts Christian slogans. He is supposedly attempting to drive the devil from within her. The option of an exorcism was taken by Natalia, who lives in the Argentinian capital Buenos Aires. The teenager had been complaining for weeks of strange urges and impulses, as well as voices telling her to do things she wouldn’t usually do.  Her religious parents believed the symptoms could be the work of the devil and sent her to see prominent exorcist Manuel Acu\u0026ntildea. He has exorcised thousands of girls like Natalia and vehemently believes their mental issues can be cured through a religious ceremony and not in a doctor\u0027s office. In Natalia\u0027s case, Manuel, known as the Padre, spent an hour locked in combat with the devil.  In a BBC documentary he can be seen chanting to himself as the girl\u0027s screams echo around his church, in the suburbs of Buenos Aires.   The documentary sheds light on the practice of exorcisms, which are still popular in some of the more superstitious parts of the world. There is a huge demand for exorcisms in Argentina, often from unwell girls who would be better served seeing a doctor or medical professional. The procedures are like something out of a movie. The padre brandishes a cross and rings a bell as the afflicted person thrashes and moans. The inside story of exorcisms has come to light as Manuel, who often appears on local TV shows, becomes the subject of a new BBC3 documentary, Exorcism: The Battle for Young Minds. In the show, journalist Andrew Gold meets the Padre, who he says was clearly influenced by the big-screen depiction of exorcisms.  Andrew told Sun Online : His church was adorned with movie posters superimposing his face onto characters from the X-Files and The Exorcist.   But when Andrew says that when he took part in an exorcism the reality set it. He said: When watching videos, there’s a distance that makes the exorcism process seem either paranormal or a little embarrassing. But to actually be in the room is something else. Initially keen to get involved, I’d taken hold of the bells that supposedly drove off the devil. But standing over Natalia, the gravity of her situation dawned on me. This was a woman at my feet who I perceived to be suffering from a serious mental illness. She came from an impoverished district where nobody discussed mental health, so it was tough for her both socially and financially to put herself in the care of psychologists. After the ordeal Natalia claims she is feeling better - however when she is checked up on later on by Andrew she has in fact not improved at all.

jimmy shands collection goes on display in dundee","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNewly-restored rare musical manuscripts collected by the legendary Sir Jimmy Shand are to go on display in Dundee.The books and sheet music were donated to the Wighton Centre at Central Library in 2013 after they were acquired at auction by the Friends of Wighton.Following a lengthy restoration process, which led to some books having to be conserved page by page, the volumes are now ready to be enjoyed by the public.A launch ceremony is being held at the Wighton Centre today at 11am, which will be attended by Sir Jimmy’s son Jimmy Jr and his wife Margaret.Jimmy Jr and his family also contributed additional material to the rare collection of classical Scottish scripts.Members of the Friends of Wighton’s instrumental classes will play a selection of tunes from the collection.Sheena Wellington, of the Friends of Wighton, said Sir Jimmy, pictured right, had been a discerning collector of books and manuscripts, some of which are hundreds of years old.Sheena – who like Sir Jimmy is an inductee of the Scottish Traditional Music Hall of Fame – said: “We’re absolutely thrilled to have them on display and we have some real rarities.“There is a collection of 19th Century books bound into one volume that we believe could be a first edition.”Among some of the other treasures are an 18th Century collection of harpsichord songs and a book of ancient Orkney melodies from 1885.There is also is a volume of ballroom songs from 1870, of which no catalogue record exists in any library in the world – making it unique.Jimmy Jr said his dad – who died in 2000 at the age of 92 – would be “overwhelmed” to know his collection was being shared with the city.“I’m delighted about it all – my father would have been delighted too, that it is now something the public can enjoy,” he said.“We wish the Wighton Centre every success with the collection and hope a lot of folk come to see it.”In total, the collection comprises 23 volumes, some of which will be on public display.The rest can be viewed on request, under the supervision of a librarian.Funding for the conservation was provided through fundraising efforts and a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund. The careful work was carried out by hand, by local professional book expert Emma Fraser.Sheena said that Emma, who runs The Book and Paper Studio on Union Street, had done a “beautiful job”.While the legendary accordion player is often linked with Auchtermuchty, Sir Jimmy spent many years in Dundee and lived in Lochee for 20 years.The City of Discovery had a unique part to play in his story.He was already an accomplished player of the melodeon – similar to an accordion – when he discovered the instrument that would make him famous.Sheena said: “He walked by Forbes’s music shop on the Nethergate and saw an accordion in the window.“I believe a pal said to him to go in and have a wee go.“He started to play and the owner realised he was a bit special and gave him a job selling accordions.“The rest, as they say, is history.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b891612d398b.jpg ","title":"one of scotlands first sponsored teddy bear parachute jumps to be held in dundee","story":"\t\t\t\t\tOne of the first sponsored teddy bear parachute jumps in Scotland will be held in Dundee to raise money for impoverished Zimbabwean youngsters.Organised by businessman Alan Calder-McNicoll, dozens of teddies will “jump” from a window 30ft above the ground at Mains Castle on Saturday September 8.Cash raised will go to a soon-to-be-launched apprenticeship scheme to tackle shocking levels of unemployment in Gweru, Zimbabwe, said to be among the highest in the world.Mr McNicoll, 69, said: “The teddies are symbolic of the children in Gweru — thrown out and unloved.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b89129c4e1aa.jpg ","title":"plans underway for next years dundee womens festival","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPlans are already underway for next year’s Dundee Women’s Festival, which will be held from March 2-16.A spokeswoman said: “We will be holding two weeks of events celebrating women and highlighting issues affecting women and girls today.”She said that anyone wishing to be involved was invited to attend a meeting at 4pm on Tuesday September 4 at Dundee International Women’s Centre.The festival will include art, comedy, dance, drama, debate, music, talks and workshops.The festival has been held now for 12 years.It was under threat last year due to lack of funds and was scaled back from its usual three-week run to one week.However, organisers are hopeful that it can run for two weeks next year.This year’s festival had the theme of “A Vote For The Future” and celebrated 100 years of women’s suffrage.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"steven caulker triggers clause and leaves dundee","story":"The 26-year-old “triggered a clause in his contract” allowing him to leave, the club said.A statement read: “Dundee Football Club can confirm that Steven Caulker has this evening parted company with the club.“Steven has triggered a release clause in his contract to leave before the end of the transfer window in search of a new challenge.“We would like to thank Steven for his efforts whilst at club and wish him all the best for the future.”Caulker’s brief spell at Dundee was not without controversy.The club previously said they rejected a club record bid for the England international from Rosenborg.In the summer he was sent home from Dundee’s preseason trip to Portugal \u0026#8211 however the Dark Blues insisted this was down to an ankle injury.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":null,"title":"community-officer-confiscates-mans-frosty-jacks-before-pouring-it-into-a-bin","story":"                          A PCSO has been branded a \"bully\" for confiscating a man\u0027 sealed bottle of cider and pouring it in a bin -

It changes the dynamic in the market hall. It\u0027 a great unit with fantastic windows and great visibility.The idea is to charge \u0026pound20 per hour for use of the premises.If the initiative is approved by the council\u0027 city committee, Mrs Murray promised the unit would be redecorated before it is let.Meanwhile, the market could be renamed Old Town Arcade Inverness in a major rebranding exercise.The proposal has emerged after talks between interested parties and council, which has employed consultant Tristram Woolston Design of Cannich to look at the marketing of the landmark, which has often been a focal point for city visitors from home and abroad.Mrs Murray said further talks will be held before it goes to Highland councillors for consideration.\u0026ldquoThe consultant has identified problems with the existing name, in that the building and its environment doesn\u0026rsquot strongly present Victorian qualities and it\u0027 not a \u0026lsquomarket\u0026rsquo as such, but has permanent enclosed retail units rather than changeable stalls, she said.\u0026ldquoThe vision for this historic building after refurbishment is to provide a high-quality destination with a mix of unique Highland brands and products, a place to eat and drink, and a venue for events and entertainment.\u0026ldquoOther similar destinations in the UK and abroad call themselves arcades and hence the proposed new name is Old Town Arcade Inverness.Those involved will discuss the new image for the facility in September.Inverness economist Tony Mackay said it might be better to focus on other matters.\u0026ldquoTo be honest I\u0026rsquom not sure what sort of impact changing the name will have, he said.\u0026ldquoThere needs to be improvements at the market, there are a few empty premises in the centre. It\u0027 gone downhill due to lack of investments and the decline in people shopping in the city centre.\u0026ldquoWe need to move away from the traditional shopping idea, more social activities and more attractions are what is needed. The shops at the Victorian Market shut at 5pm. Staying open later and having maybe street entertainers there in the evening could attract more people.Saturday 1 Sep 2018 6:35 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04106000/04106341.jpg","title":"Dont miss chance to nominate a hero","story":"TIME is running out to nominate someone you know to be one of this year\u0027s Highland Heroes.The awards, organised by SPP Media and now in their second year, celebrate people in the Highlands who make a real difference to our communities, healthcare, education, safety and wellbeing.Readers are being invited to nominate people in any of the 12 categories: primary pupil, secondary pupil, primary teacher, secondary teacher, carer, fundraiser, volunteer, community champion, brave child, health professional, emergency services or armed forces hero and public servant.The deadline for nominations is midnight tomorrow.SPP Media\u0027s editorial director David Bourn said: \"This is a last call for you to tell us about the real heroes who go above and beyond to make your community, workplace or school a special place.\"Highland Heroes wants to celebrate the contribution people in our area make to the lives of others by giving them the recognition they deserve.\"So if you know a Highland Hero, now is the time to share their story.\"To nominate somebody for the awards, visit www.surveymonkey/r/HighlandHeroes2018 or email heroes@spp-group with your name, address, email and phone number, along with the person you are nominating, up to 200 words to explain why, and their contact details.After the deadline closes, a judging panel will draw up a shortlist in each category before readers are given the opportunity to vote for their favourites in a special supplement we will publish in September.The winners of each category, along with an overall hero, will be announced at a ceremony at the Kingsmills Hotel in Inverness on Thursday, November 8.The awards are sponsored by Inverness Airport.* Click here to read more about Highland Heroes.Saturday 1 Sep 2018 6:35 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117241.jpg","title":"Drawings recall old Inverness streetscapes","story":"\u0026nbspAN intriguing glimpse into how an Inverness street looked almost 100 years ago is being showcased in a new exhibition.Intricate line drawings of buildings in Academy Street have gone on show at the city\u0027 museum and art gallery.They have been created following painstaking research by civil engineer Gordon Lynn who has sifted through old photographs and documents held by places such as the Highland Archive Centre, the Royal Commission for Ancient and Historical Monuments in Edinburgh and High Life Highland\u0027 Am Baile collection.The exhibition is being held as part of the Inverness Townscape Heritage Project, which aims to regenerate the Academy Street area.

enhanced for non-golfers.\u0026ldquoThere\u0027 also a lot of potential for it to become a new city park, he added.\u0026ldquoThe natural serenity of the area is magnificent.\u0026ldquoFurther down the line there is a lot of potential for other things to go in there as well.Once the revamped golf course is playable, work will begin on the next stage of the West Link.The councillors\u0026rsquo visit was held in advance of a public consultation on the next stage of the plans, and Cllr Macpherson says the success of the first stage shows that the project has made a difference.\u0026ldquoWe have already seen the positive impact the first phase of the new West Link has had on the city, he said.\u0026ldquoThat\u0027 something which has taken pressure off roads in the city centre.\u0026ldquoNow with the next phase, we will have two swing bridges over the canal.\u0026ldquoThat will ease a lot of frustration for drivers because one of them will always be open.The public consultation into the second stage of the West Link will be held at Canal Park on September 5.Cllr Macpherson urged local residents to attend the event and \u0026ldquotake their chance to make their voice heard.Meanwhile, Highland Council has submitted a planning application to build 34 houses and flats close to the golf course on land south of Golf View Terrace.Permission was granted in

I haven’t been able to do that in the past.“I started off well in pre-season and at the start of the season and he said to me that I was ready for first-team football and that Aberdeen was a great place for me.“Personally for me Frank Lampard has had a massive impact and I think all the lads at Derby will say the same.“He’s been second to none in terms of tactics and intelligence of the game.“On the first day of pre-season you pick up little things which explain why he’s played at the top and achieved what he has in his career.“He hasn’t just taken an interest in me. A lot of the young lads at Derby have taken a big stride under him in pre-season and have ended up playing games this season.“It shows if you’re good enough you will play and he gives you the confidence to make you feel at ease in the big games.”Another major factor in Lowe’s decision to join the Reds was Lampard’s assistant at Pride Park, Jody Morris.Morris played under Dons boss Derek McInnes for four years at St Johnstone and then Bristol City and also played with McInnes at Millwall.Lowe revealed speaking to Morris and then McInnes also helped to convince him moving to the Granite City was right for him.He added: “There were a lot of reasons to come to Aberdeen.“The gaffer  spoke to me and what he said to me and his belief in my game gave me the confidence to believe I could come away from home and play in Scottish football.“Jody Morris  has worked with the gaffer and he spoke really highly of him.“Jody said he’s a great gaffer and that I’ll learn a lot under him.“And I could tell just by training that I will, so hopefully over the next six months I will keep learning.“This could be a launchpad for me because I’ve played games in the Championship.“But I need to kick on and I feel like Aberdeen is the place to do that.“They did well last year and hopefully we can kick on.”Lowe also outlined what the Red Army can expect from him during his time with Aberdeen.He said: “They can expect me to be athletic and get up and down that left side and whip balls in.“I’ll be aggressive, on the front foot and I’ll show that I want to play for Aberdeen with my passion.”Lowe could make his Dons debut against Kilmarnock tomorrow.He said: “I don’t know much about them. I know Craig Bryson was there and he’s at Derby.“He spoke to me about the Scottish game and said the games aren’t easy in the league and that it’s similar to the Championship.“He said it would be good for me and Aberdeen are a massive club.“The Scottish league isn’t easy and Bryson, Jody and the gaffer at Derby have all told me that.“So it’s a good test for me in terms of where I’m at physically and mentally.“Going into Saturday I’m raring to go and if I get the call to play against Kilmarnock I’ll be ready to go.”Meanwhile, Aberdeen reserve player Sam Roscoe has joined Championship side Alloa Athletic on a season-long loan deal.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/08/sports.jpg ","title":"aberdeens the perfect playground for freshers articleisfree","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFor students just starting at one of Aberdeen’s colleges or universities it can be daunting trying to figure out where to eat, drink and exercise.If you don’t know where to go, or have people to point you in the right direction, you can be lost in a sea of possibility.There’s so much on offer.

This officially launched in March with more than 250 practitioners attending and around 70% of those worked in the city.There are now 845 staff employed in the ELC sector in Aberdeen.Councillor Lesley Dunbar, vice-convener of the committee, said the council is “committed” to employing 300 “highly trained and motivated” practitioners.She added: “Aberdeen City Council has established an Early Learning Academy to try and encourage and promote early learning childcare as a positive career choice.“This academy will help us train those new employees as well as allowing us to implement best practice right across the city to ensure every child that goes to nursery school get the same dedicated level of support they need as young children.”The Scottish Government has committed to providing local authorities across Scotland with revenue funding of an additional £567 million per year by 2021-22, the first full financial year of the expansion.In addition, the Scottish Government has committed to provide councils with total capital funding of £476m over four years to support buildings projects to create new indoor and outdoor capacity to deliver the expansion.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"free car parking vote","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDrivers could soon park for free after 5pm at four major car parks in Aberdeen city centre, if proposals take a step forward next week.The Alive After Five Scheme will offer free parking from 5-8pm on Monday to Saturday at the Denburn, Chapel Street, Frederick Street and West North Street car parks.The six-month trial is due to launch on October 1 for six months, if councillors give the plan the go ahead.They will meet on Thursday to approve the change to hours and then again on September 18 when the final budget approval for the scheme will be sought.If successful, the scheme could see city centre businesses open later, according to business organisation Aberdeen Inspired.Altogether the four car parks offer nearly 2,000 parking spaces.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/08/PJ-KT-290818-01-003.jpg-929x564.jpg ","title":"john swinney very focussed on getting more teachers for the north east","story":"\t\t\t\t\tEducation Secretary John Swinney said he is “very focused” on trying to secure additional teachers to fill vacancies in the north-east.The Deputy First Minister made the remarks during a visit to the north-east yesterday to see for himself the progress being made on the £55 million Inverurie Community Campus project as the final beam was put into place.It was revealed this month teaching vacancies across the north-east have hit 140 – with a total of 85 empty posts still to be filled in Aberdeen and 55 needed in Aberdeenshire.Speaking to The Evening Express, Mr Swinney said vacancies are “unacceptable” but added they were at a “very, very low level” compared to other countries.He said: “We will do a survey of vacancy rates in September. This is our annual survey.“But the most recent information showed we had vacancies running at about 1 to 1.5% in Scottish education.“So clearly where we have vacancies it is unacceptable but it is at a very, very low level compared to many of our international peers.“Obviously there’s a whole range of different measures being taken to expand the pool of teachers available.“We’ve expanded recruitment into initial teacher education, we’ve created nearly a dozen new routes to make it more practical and flexible for individuals to gain access and indeed one of those routes is very focused on the north-east of Scotland through the partnerships that exist in that respect.“I’m very focused on trying to identify how we can secure the additional teachers into the teaching profession and to

shop raider who threatened an Aberdeen shopkeeper and stole seven jars of coffee fractured his skull after being rugby tackled by a passer-by as he fled.Michael Rae went into Bridge Street News in Aberdeen city centre with a knife on Boxing Day last year and swiped a coffee jar in full view of staff member Shihab Yahia Arabi.Mr Arabi approached the 43-year-old and told him to put the coffee back or pay for it.He then followed Rae around the shop to make sure he would not try to steal anything else, Aberdeen Sheriff Court heard.An argument then broke out between the two men and Rae held up his arm to show Mr Arabi he had a knife concealed up his sleeve.Shocked, Mr Arabi retreated, went behind the shop counter and called the police.The court heard how Mr Arabi “is a big-built man” who would have been “well able to deal” with Rae, of Deansloch Terrace, Northfield, had the pair come to blows but Mr Arabi did the right thing by instead alerting police.Rae grabbed seven jars of coffee and ran out of the shop, Sheriff Jack Brown was told.However his attempt to flee was cut short. Seconds after Rae left the store, a bystander who had seen part of the robbery rugby tackled Rae to the ground. The force of the tackle caused Rae to hit his head on the pavement and he suffered a fractured skull.Following his recovery in hospital, Rae was charged with assault and robbery – charges he admitted at Aberdeen Sheriff Court.At a hearing on Wednesday, the court heard Rae “had no recollection of what had happened, though he accepts that his intention was to steal from the shop”.The court accepted that, while Rae had the knife, he did not brandish it, or threaten Mr Arabi with it during the robbery, though he “uttered threatening remarks” and “presented the knife”.The court heard Rae has a drug problem and was willing to co-operate with any training programme.Sheriff Brown said: “Usually, in cases that come before me where someone has a knife during a confrontation, the perpetrator should be taken to prison. As far as this case is concerned, 13 months in custody would be correct.“However, I’m prepared to defer sentence while we look at the possibility of a Drug Treatment and Testing Order .“That is an intensive course which you must comply with.“It goes without saying that if you do not comply with the DTTO, you will be going to prison.”Rae was told to reappear at the court on October 3.After the hearing, the shop’s manager, Reeha Khan, told the Evening Express: “I am glad the court has given this man another chance.“He cannot remember what happened because he was under the influence of something and there was no damage to the shop.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"west enjoying view from top","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAfter bagging four goals in midweek, Willie West is hoping to do his bit again tomorrow to keep Fraserburgh top of the Highland League.The Broch beat Deveronvale 5-1 on Wednesday night to stay top of the table on goal difference ahead of Cove and Brora.Next up for the Buchan outfit is Wick Academy at Bellslea tomorrow and after netting four in midweek West is hoping Fraserburgh can beat the Scorries and stay at the summit.The 30-year-old said: “Cove have a game in hand and they are the team in form.“But for us it’s pleasing to be up there and now we’re up there we want to stay there for as long as we can. We spent some time up there last season, but Cove, with their cup involvement, they had more games.“There might be a lag where we’ve played one or two more this season but we need to take advantage of that and keep it going.“Although it’s only goal difference, it’s nice to look at the table and see yourself top, and we want to stay there on Saturday.“We always get a tough game against Wick, they’ve got some of the best players in the league in their side.“On their day they can beat the best teams and they showed that a couple of weeks ago by beating Formartine.“It will be a really tough game but we need to try to keep this momentum going by getting three points.”West returned to a starting role in Banff after spending some time on the bench. Prior to that he also missed a couple of games due a groin niggle.He says the rest did him good but maintains that even if he is absent from the team Fraserburgh are still a formidable outfit due to the strength in depth of Mark Cowie’s squad.West added: “The break did me good. I still haven’t got rid of it, I just need to manage it.“It’s something that restricts me at times and gives me pain, but it’s getting older – it’s harder to shake off these little niggles.“But we’re lucky the squad is strong and it means I might not even play on Saturday because we have other people to come in.“Mark Cowie has got a bit of a selection headache with the options he’s got.”West was delighted with his four goals from midfield against Vale and said: “I was in the right place at the right time, really. It was a couple of runs into the box and it came to me.“Two of my goals were on my weaker, right foot and it was pleasing they just seemed to go into the corners.“My shooting wasn’t very good in the warm-up but the main thing is, it’s good in the game.“Then I got two headers: one from a corner and one from a good cross.

However, they often endure short, painful lives without the most basic requirements.This is where SPANA makes such a huge difference, ensuring animals have access to the free veterinary treatment they urgently need when they are sick or injured.Actors Dame Judi Dench and Joanna Lumley are throwing their support behind this year’s event, and we hope your readers will be inspired to take part and help transform the lives of working animals around the world.The SPANA World Tea Party fundraising pack, full of free recipes, is available from www.spana.org/teaparty or by calling 020 7831 3999.SPANA World Tea Party Host, Tom HorsfieldSir,It only takes one person to put a stop to the accidental loss of life to drowning.With recent headlines being filled with tragic stories of people losing their lives to drowning, Lesley Laird, Shadow Scottish Secretary and the Royal Life Saving Society UK  urge the public to be that \u0026#8216one person\u0026#8217: take some simple precautions and get \u0026#8216water smart\u0026#8217, before cooling off this summer.For more information on the issue, the statistics involved and interview opportunities, please contact Claire Huggins on 0300 323 0096 or email clairehuggins@rlss.org.ukSenior Communications Executive, Claire HugginsSir,There are more people using Instagram for interiors inspiration than ever before, but 70 percent of Scottish Instagram users feel dissatisfied with their homes after looking at images of other people’s houses on social media, a study has found.Researchers who polled 1,500 UK adults using social media for inspiration with their homes, found that a whopping 66 percent of those are displeased with their home. They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ .energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process. If we want to find a treatment or cure for disorders of memory like Alzheimer’s disease then we need to have a test of memory in animals that is analogous to human memory tests.\u0026#8217Steve Bargeton, St Andrews\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"do you want to see inveraray bank crumble","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 05/08/18, 6:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAnn Thomas\u0026#8217 latest cartoon depicts the growing worry over the potential closure of Inveraray\u0026#8217s branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland.The branch has been threatened with closure since the end of 2017, prompting protests and petitions.The status of the branch is still undecided and the bank remains open for now.The opportunity to have a say is quickly closing, with an online petition set to be hand-delivered by the person who initially set it up, Mid Argyll writer and journalist Marian Pallister.The petition will be handed over in Inveraray on Wednesday August 8.To sign online, visit the 38degrees website and search for ‘RBS Inveraray’.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 32","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 12/08/18, 6:15 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,At the latest Mid Argyll, Kintyre and Islands meeting I stated a large number of my younger constituents have been contacting me in regards to the availability of housing.While a greater number of affordable rental accommodation is more than welcome, a larger amount of affordable housing to buy needs to be built across Argyll.I was also very happy at a recent meeting with my fellow Conservative councillors to discuss the huge importance of having a more streamlined planning service that helps rather than hinders economic strength across Argyll and Bute.An effective planning system plays an important role in supporting growth – promoting and enabling the homes, jobs and services that communities need, creating a more competitive local economy and minimising uncertainty and delay for those proposing or affected by development.We in Argyll are seeing a tremendous increase in our industrial output and we as a council must not place barriers in the way of future growth in this area.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.Sir,I\u0026#8217m calling on Argyll and Bute\u0026#8217s small shopkeepers to enter the Best Small Shops competition, celebrating the creativity of small shops and the central role they play in their local community.Argyll and Bute is a hub of small local retailers, many of which are a lifeline.The Best Small Shops competition is open to any small shop operating in the UK.

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

But Alfie Briggs does plan to downsize the long-established business. Mr Briggs, 74, wants to change part of the arcade, to create a town house. And he has been granted planning consent by South Ayrshire Council. Mr Briggs says he will transform the smaller part of the arcade - next to the Harbour Bar pub - back into a house. But the larger, deeper part of the business will remain an amusement arcade. However, Mr Briggs also has consent to create a house there, should it ever be required. He said: “I was advised to do it  this way. But I’m definitely not closing the arcade.” He added: “I won’t be around forever, and maybe my children will decide it should go back to a house. “But I know I won’t do it.” Mr Briggs, who lives in Ayr, has owned Mayfair Amusements since 1984. The business was created in 1962 by the late Edwin Lawrence, a former travelling showman. He had bought the two-storey house next to the Harbour Bar pub, and converted the downstairs front into a small amusement arcade. This had originally been John Carson’s fish shop. The arcade was greatly expanded around 1970, after the acquistion of a house at No 29 Knockcushan Street. The arcade, which included a prize bingo and a shop, was run successfully by Mr Lawrence and his family, until bought by Mr Briggs. The new owner kept the name ‘Mayfair Amusements’ which was a tribute to Mr Lawrence’s wife May, as well as an affluent part of London. Alfie Briggs recalls: “There was more business for everyone back in the days when there was about five amusement arcades in Girvan. “Takings have certainly gone down, but we’re still getting by. “This conversion will allow me to rent out a house and a flat, instead of just a flat.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilGirvanAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"ayr united fans under starters","story":"NewsAyr United fans under starter\u0027s orders for Somerset Park charity racenight in aid of Ian McCall\u0027s player fundInternet supporters\u0027 team KaisAyr is staging the bash this Saturday night in United\u0027s Hospitality Suite.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson10:56, 23 AUG 2018NewsAyr\u0027s Craig McGuffie and Alan Forrest go for a ride with mascot Pandamonium \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThey’re under starter’s orders for a top night of action at Somerset Park this Saturday.

The ailing Kyle Centre is to lodge plans for a round the clock fitness facility. Retail chiefs want to rival Heathfield’s bid for a similar project on the outskirts of town. Both are now set to go before South Ayrshire Council in a battle for planning permission. Kyle Centre boss, Fiona Paton, said: “Lifestyles and work patterns are changing and we believe there is demand for this. “There is no escaping that we, as a centre, need to evolve and we’ve had to adapt our business model since I came here 10 years ago. “Opening a gym is part of that direction of travel and can help sustain the centre moving forward.” Energie Fitness has agreed a deal to open an 8000sq foot unit within the barren centre. And bosses claim their stalling dream to open a cinema is far from dead.  Negotiations, understood to be with screen giant Odeon, have so far failed to bear fruit. But Fiona, 48, said: “This sits separately from our plan to open the cinema, which very much remains the long term aim. “Unfortunately it has taken longer than we’d have liked but we are getting there with it. “I can understand why some people have given up on the Kyle Centre – but I wouldn’t be here unless we had a bright future. “We have private investment and our vision is very clear, it is just a matter of staying patient. “People say that our success is vital to the town and that is true. “There is a lot going on in Ayr at the moment and a prosperous Kyle Centre is key to that.” We revealed earlier this summer that retail rivals Heathfield had signed a deal with the Gym Group to open a 24 hour gym. Both plans are now subject to council approval. Kyle bosses say their gym could be ready to open by the turn of the year.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"rbs-blocks-81-year-olds-coin-swap-savings","story":"BANK staff in Galashiels are backtracking to allow an 81-year-old customer to keep cashing in her coins.\nFor over 60 years Jaye Riddell from Selkirk has been saving her loose change.\nAnd she has exchanged her coins into notes during regular trips to the Royal Bank of Scotland branch.\nOn Friday the now-widowed granny\u0027s request to change her cache of one- and two-pound coins was turned down by a cashier.\nAnd her request to speak to the manager also fell upon deaf ears.\nAn upset Jaye told the Border : \"I went in just a week or two ago with \u0026pound60 worth of one-pound coins to change and they gave me notes without any bother.\n\"When I went in this time they refused to give me the little bags so I could count my coins into them, like I\u0027ve always done.\n\"I was told to put my coins into a machine and it would go into my account instead -

collaborations between Scottish and Barbadian or \u0026ldquoBajan culture.\nMusicians, dancers, drummers and pipers all come together for a fun-filled weekend, accompanied by top chefs, serving up much loved Scottish meals with a distinct Bajan twist.\nThe now popular festival had humble beginnings in the 1990s when a Welsh men\u0026rsquos choir travelled to the island to perform in a local concert hall.\nSince then, the celebration has expanded and has featured Celtic acts from Canada, across the UK, Ireland, the USA and even Australia.\nFestival director Carol Anderson from Edinburgh

dogs \u0026ndash but gave just six advisory notices and five dog control orders to irresponsible owners.\nHowever, following a meeting with Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale MSP Christine Grahame, the council has revealed it has handed out 15 dog control notices over the last 12 months, with two still pending.\nMs Grahame, who introduced the Control of Dogs  Act 2010 as a member\u0026rsquos bill, said: \u0026ldquoI had a very useful discussion with the representatives from Scottish Borders Council and it was important to hear first-hand how this legislation is being used in practice.\n\u0026ldquoIn the last year there have been 15 dog control notices with two pending, although there are some issues with obtaining owner details. Some owners just need to be spoken to and advised of their responsibilities.\nDog control orders allow Scottish Borders Council to impose certain conditions on dog owners. For example, a dog which frequently runs away may be required to be kept on a lead at all times, or an aggressive dog may have to be muzzled when in public spaces.\nThe control orders can also be used to compel dog owners to seek training for themselves and their pet. Failure to adhere to a dog control order could lead to a ban from keeping animals or the dog being put down.\nA Scottish Borders Council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe council is currently reviewing its responsible dog ownership strategy, which will aim to remind owners of their social and legal responsibilities.\n\u0026ldquoAs part of this strategy, the council works in partnership with local and national charities to promote responsible ownership and dog control by educating the public at ious events across the Borders.\n\u0026ldquoThe council responds to all complaints received concerning out of control dogs, but in order to assist us in investigating each complaint fully, we ideally require the dog owner\u0026rsquos details.\n\u0026ldquoMembers of the public can contact 0300 100 1800 or visit www.scotborders.gov.uk if they have a concern about a dog\u0026rsquos behaviour.\nMs Grahame added: \u0026ldquoMy main concern is that members of the public may not be aware that if a dog\u0026rsquos behaviour is causing concern, for example being allowed to be out of control, they can report it to the council through this route.\n\u0026ldquoThe police, of course, deal with the most serious incidents.

It was nailed to the stretcher rather than the modern method of stapling. At some stage a further bar of yellowed wood had to added to keep the canvas taut.Further internet research revealed a painter known as H Shapiro, who was born in 1933. Helen was born in 1946.Unfortunately for those hoping for a massive price tag, the H stands iously for Hermon or Herman.A painting with a similar style, titled Loch Long, appeared recently on eBay and was described as: ‘Oil on canvas, possibly an early work by the artist Herman  Shapiro.‘It is hand signed, lower right, with “H. Shapiro” and dated ‘52 .’A large collection of Mr Shapiro’s other work, mainly of life studies of a distinctly different style is for sale with a gallery, named Hatfield Hines in Norwich.One of the partners at the gallery said they had bought the paintings. Despite having much biographical detail the partner claimed they had no way of contacting Mr Shapiro.That gallery states that Mr Shapiro was born in London and is settled in Scotland, which fits Clachan’s picture.He studied at Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts from 1949-54 where he was apparently influenced by Bloch, Minton and Vaughan and was associated with the acclaimed Camberwell Group.By the mid 1950s he had started teaching in South Wales schools and went on to lecture at Cardiff College of Art.His paintings and sculpture are mostly based on the female figure, more recently in a domestic environment. He also enjoys the open, figureless, landscape.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"from our facebook beautiful and impressive sunflowers","story":"Below are some of their comments.Jane Wykes, from Dunoon, said: \u0026#8216Loved this on our arrival.

The move comes just 16 months after a public consultation on similar plans in which three quarters of those who took part objected to the change, leading the council to scrap the proposal.  The council said the move was part of a review of its service provision however, it has been criticised for not taking the plan back to the community before making the decision.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoIt is extremely disappointing that East Lothian Council are pressing ahead with service changes in Prestonpans that were rejected last year.  \u0026ldquoPrestonpans Community Council and other local community organisations should have been consulted on these changes rather than being presented with a fait accompli and we would ask that the council assure the local community that they will consult fully on the future proposals for Aldhammer House.  The proposal to turn the library, which was built in 1905 through funds from Scottish philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, into a shared facility and move council services from their offices in the town\u0026rsquos Aldhammer House, was first put to the public in June 2016.  At the time the community council raised concerns that merging the services would take away people\u0026rsquos views of the library as a safe and neutral area.  And at a public meeting in the town Manja Porteus, then six, whose dad Tim is a professional storyteller and Courier columnist, appealed to the council to rethink its proposals and leave the library alone.  Following a public consultation, the council announced it had scrapped the plans in March last year, stating that \u0026ldquothe majority of respondents said they wanted the two services to remain in separate buildings and did not want to see any changes to the library building.  However, last week they said that a wide range of services would move into the library from August 27.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoAs more of our customers make use of online services and library staff are readily available to help people to go online, the council has reviewed its service provision and Aldhammer House will be developed to provide complementary services which give more support to the local community.  \u0026ldquoMeanwhile, Prestonpans Library will be developed as a joint library/area office as has been done in Dunbar, North Berwick and Tranent.  \u0026ldquoThis builds on the council\u0026rsquos work to strengthen our communities and support town centres such as Prestonpans with easy access to high-quality local facilities and services.  Aldhammer House will continue to be staffed by housing service staff, as well as keeping The Pantry Foodbank, Citizens Advice Bureau and local politicians\u0026rsquo surgeries. Capital Credit Union will also continue to operate part-time there. All other services will move to the library.  The changes were welcomed by some on social media, who said it had worked in other communities.  One person said: \u0026ldquoDoes it really matter where you pay your rent or fill in forms? If the council can\u0026rsquot afford it then they can\u0026rsquot afford it.  However, there was an angry response from others.  One woman said: \u0026ldquoThis is an outrage, what can we do?

Currently, Prestonpans Infant and Nursery School, on West Loan, has a school roll of 358 up to P3, with the primary school, on Preston Road, home to 332 pupils from P4 to P7.  The leadership of Prestonpans Early Learning and Childcare Centre, which opened last year on Kirk Street to provide additional nursery places for the town, would also transfer to the headteacher of the new single school structure if the move goes ahead.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, was surprised to hear the news.  He said: \u0026ldquoFirstly, I would like to see the details of it and what is behind the proposals because the infant school is a superbly-run school and works exceptionally well.  \u0026ldquoThe primary school is a very well-run and successful school as well \u0026ndash we have got two very well-run and successful schools.  \u0026ldquoWe would need to look at what the implications are.  Fiona Robertson, East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos head of education, stressed the local authority was \u0026ldquoabsolutely committed to continuously improving the quality of education at the two schools.  She said: \u0026ldquoOur Education Service Local Improvement Plan sets out a range of key outcomes, one of which is to ensure consistency in our approaches to planning learning, teaching and assessment.  \u0026ldquoWe believe that the proposal to establish a single school operating under a single management team offers the best solution to ensuring this consistency, improving transitions for children, and will deliver considerable educational benefits to all of the schools\u0026rsquo children and young people.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet member for education and children\u0026rsquos services, said: \u0026ldquoOur first priority is to ensure that we provide the best educational experiences and outcomes for the children and young people of Prestonpans. The consultation process will focus on how we do this through an educational benefit statement.  \u0026ldquoWe have already informed the chairs of the parent councils of this proposal.  \u0026ldquoAll parents, carers and the wider school community will have the opportunity to comment on the proposal once the consultation has been published and the statutory consultation period begins on Monday.  The consultation runs to October 2, with drop-in sessions held at both schools next month.  Prestonpans Infant School hosts a consultation event on September 4 from noon to 5pm, with the primary school event taking place a week later between the same times.  Finally, a public meeting takes place on September 26 from 7pm at Preston Lodge High School.

She needed an early-morning shower to remove the lingering smell of wood smoke in her hair this morning before getting ready.  She protested a bit, as she said she liked the smell of wood smoke because it reminded her of camping in the Highlands. But soon she was all excited to be dressed up, smart and clean for school. She is attending Prestonpans Infant School, as her big sister did before her, and as I did when it was the primary school.  She looked so smart and business-like as she walked into class with a beaming smile. We shared this moment with many other parents, who were taking the same photos and shedding similar tears. Only the day before, Skye had climbed the side of a mountain in Glencoe as if she had once been a mountain goat and proclaimed she wanted to live by a waterfall.  Now, all dressed to conform , she has entered a formal system which in my day did its best to  beat out any original creativity that didn\u0026rsquot fit in with teachers\u0026rsquo expectations.  But as our daughter walked through the same doors I had once gone through, I was uplifted by a hopeful expectation that when we come to pick her up she will be less smart, less clean and her hair even wilder. That\u0026rsquos what school should be like for a wee girl not yet reached five. And I know she is in good hands in that respect at Prestonpans Infants.  But as I kissed her goodbye this morning, she asked: \u0026ldquoCan we have tea by a campfire in the woods? The campfire had been the communal focus during our camping trip. As darkness fell, the spirit of the fire glowed brighter and danced with our imaginations as we told stories and riddles with each other. I of course agreed, but her comment helped me think of which tale to tell this week.  Much of our summer has been spent exploring the wonders of East Lothian. We explored beaches and caves. We climbed hills and moors. We swam and paddled in rivers, climbed trees and sat under them having picnics.  But wherever we went there was one thing that we always saw, even in quite remote places: litter. Sometimes there was more, sometimes there was less, but we couldn\u0026rsquot escape it. My children notice it I suppose because I mention it. Our children pick up other people\u0026rsquos litter as we walk, so we now need an extra rucksack to carry it.  \u0026ldquoWhy do people do this? asked my nine-year-old after she had watched a family sitting in a car in a car park by a beach. They had been eating sandwiches and drinking juice, and then threw all the packaging out of the windows. The plastic juice bottles rolled about in the breeze and the sandwich packaging blew away and got caught in some sea buckthorn bushes nearby. The family then drove away, no doubt having had a nice day at the beach, but leaving their rubbish for others to enjoy.  I make no apologies for sounding angry at this. And I do not blame the children, it\u0026rsquos the adults who frame this behaviour. I understand people want to keep their cars tidy but I couldn\u0026rsquot answer my daughter\u0026rsquos question as we sat watching someone else\u0026rsquos rubbish desecrate a beauty spot. I just can\u0026rsquot understand the mindset. So all I said was: \u0026ldquoWell they just don\u0026rsquot know any better I suppose, or maybe just don\u0026rsquot care.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos so sad, she replied, then went very quiet. Then she came up with an answer to the problem: a story:  \u0026lsquoThe king of the sea told all the mermaids not to go close to the shore because of the dangerous litter that humans pollute it with. One mermaid asked what litter was and the king replied it was many things, such as broken glass and plastic which kills sea creatures, as well as making the place humans live look ugly.  \u0026ldquoWhy do they do this? asked the mermaid. The king shrugged his shoulders, and said: \u0026ldquoThey must be less clever than the animals they kill.  But one day the mermaid disobeyed her king and swam to the shore close to the beach at North Berwick. But her tail was cut by broken glass and then she got caught in plastic bags floating on the surface. She was in trouble and a fisherman saw her.  He helped her remove the bags and gave her cream for her cut tail.  \u0026ldquoWhy do you people do this? she asked him. He felt ashamed because he also would throw litter. He promised her he would never do it again. But there was so much rubbish in the sea that they agreed they would try and collect it.  So the mermaid gathered her friends and collected the rubbish. The fisherman\u0026rsquos boat was soon so full that it nearly sank, and when he returned to the harbour people saw the mountain of rubbish he had caught. They laughed at him, thinking he was not a good fisherman because all he had caught was litter and rubbish.  \u0026ldquoLook, said the fisherman, \u0026ldquothis is what we are doing to the sea and the land. Why do we do this? But nobody cared.  \u0026ldquoThis is impossible, we can\u0026rsquot collect all of it, said the mermaid, \u0026ldquoand every day the wind blows more into the sea.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos hopeless, people will never change, said the fisherman. But the mermaid was angry: \u0026ldquoThey must change or else we will all die, including them too eventually.  Mermaids have powers to control the wind. They can whip up storms and so she decided she would make a very unusual, magic storm.  The wind blew not everywhere but where the litter lay. It blew all the rubbish thrown by the humans back into their houses and cars. People woke up with broken glass in their beds and plastic bags covering their children. Their homes were piled high with dangerous and ugly rubbish. When they tried to get rid of it, it just blew back in.  The countryside and sea became wonderfully litter free because of this magic storm, and when people littered the storm whipped up again and blew it straight into their house or car. They couldn\u0026rsquot escape from it. People were living knee-deep in the rubbish they had thrown out of windows or not recycled.  So soon they stopped littering because now they understood what it meant for the other creatures. Finally they cared, because they were the ones who suffered most. At last they got the wisdom of the animals.\u0026rsquo  This story, I think, would make the perfect start to any school day."},{"url":null,"title":"call-for-new-state-energy-company-to-be-based-at-cockenzie","story":"  Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council is preparing to publish a document outlining its views for the future use of the site, which supports the vision put forward in a masterplan produced following public consultation.  And it takes the masterplan a stage further with more detailed ideas for each of the zones proposed in its vision, including calling for the Scottish Government to be invited to base its HQ for its proposed state company on the site, as well as suggesting offshore windfarm company Inch Cape \u0026ndash which wants to place a substation on the land to bring energy ashore from proposed turbines \u0026ndash should also be encouraged to put its Scottish base there.  The community council document comes in the wake of a brochure produced by neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council promoting its vision of a Port of Prestonpans cruise terminal at the former power station site.  That proposal sparked anger among supporters of the masterplan vision, who accused the Prestonpans group of ignoring the views of the local communities.  It led to the launch of \u0026lsquoGreenhills: delivering the Masterplan\u0026rsquo, a campaign by local groups and businesses backing the consultation document.  Now Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council has drawn up a draft brochure which sets out why it supports the plans and proposes a range of detailed ways it could be taken forward.  That includes putting head offices for Inch Cape and the Scottish Government energy interests in one part of the site, identified as its \u0026lsquoEnergy Quarter\u0026rsquo.  It also floats the idea of flooding the power station footprint to create a marina \u0026ndash as suggested by a local fisherman \u0026ndash with associated retail and leisure facilities, attracting businesses such as a film studio or 3D printing innovation to the site, or even creating a brewery.  Graeme Jeffrey, community council chairman, said: \u0026ldquoAs a community council we are promoting our vision of what we would like to see. It supports the masterplan, looking at how it could be delivered.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe have set out our ambitions for a public energy company and its contribution towards tackling fuel poverty.  \u0026ldquoWe will be consulting on proposals later in the year and will make sure that Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council have an opportunity to provide their views."},{"url":null,"title":"cheese-sold-in-east-lothian-recalled-after-salmonella-found","story":"  L\u0026rsquoEARL Mounier of France is recalling some batches of its Cheese AOP Pelardon after finding traces of the bacteria in the product.

Mother Nature has been kind and the pipe is, by and large, under sand once again \u0026ndash though there are concerns it is likely to be exposed again in future if a permanent solution is not found.  As well as being an eyesore at a popular tourist spot, sand and rocks collect around the pipe and are then blasted by the tide at the sea wall, causing it damage.  The town\u0026rsquos community council has long voiced concerns over the issue and claims houses overlooking the iconic West Beach are \u0026ldquoin danger.  North Berwick Community Council  contacted Scottish Water over the issue and the company\u0026rsquos response was read out at a NBCC meeting last week.  A letter from Brian Lironi, director of corporate affairs, said: \u0026ldquoWe are not able to re-lay this section of pipe. However, following an inspection of it, we plan to carry out some work on the casing around the laterals and raised manhole columns.  \u0026ldquoThis work will take place outside of the bathing season when the laterals are more exposed and the beach is less busy. This should help to improve the aesthetic of the pipe.  The letter added: \u0026ldquoOn the point of erosion, we do not believe our pipe is to blame for this. With that said, I am asking for this to be looked at in more detail as it is important that we take an evidence-led approach. This will not happen during the bathing season.  Mr Lironi said the community council would be kept informed of any developments.  Spring 2018 was not the first time that severe weather saw the sewage pipe badly exposed. The pipe was clearly visible in the aftermath of storms in December 2010 and it took many, many months before the tides re-covered it with sand."},{"url":null,"title":"in-this-weeks-courier","story":"  HADDINGTON...

Plans lodged with East Lothian Council are split into two.  The design and access statement states: \u0026ldquoThe brief is twofold: to diversify the core business on the site with the introduction of small-scale gin and whisky distillation to enable the production of speciality spirits for sale within the business pub chain.  \u0026ldquoSecondly, in light of the increasing demand for both brewery tours and the use of the Monk\u0026rsquos Retreat as a function venue, it is felt that the facilities require being upgraded, both in terms of general amenity, improving the visitor experience and to provide for the disabled visitor with the addition of a platform lift and accessible toilet.  A spokeswoman for owners Greene King explained why they were looking to diversify at the site, on Belhaven\u0026rsquos Brewery Lane.  She said: \u0026ldquoLike any business we are always exploring options to develop our business and facilities. The recent planning application is just one of many opportunities we are considering but no decision has been made yet about whether it is an option we will pursue if planning permission is granted.  In terms of the production of gin and whisky, a still house would be created.  According to the design and access statement: \u0026ldquoThe distillery will be designed to produce 250 litres of spirit a day. It will be unique in the marketplace, making spirit from the same wurt as the beer.  \u0026ldquoThe spirit will be a mixture of Scotch whisky, gin and rum.  \u0026ldquoThis volume and complexity will mean that the brewery will need to employ an additional person to run the distillery.  \u0026ldquoIn time the site would like to re-instate a historical greenhouse within the gardens in order to grow their own botanicals to add to the gin however, this will be part of a separate application.  The new still house would mirror the mash house, which was given planning permission in January 2011, in terms of its look.  It is two storeys, with a more modern design than some of the historic buildings on-site.  If the plans were given the green light, work would also be carried out at the main building on the Belhaven site.  A museum is already in place on the ground floor of the main building, with a pub on the first floor.  Plans show a refurbishment of both floors as \u0026ldquothe existing interiors are now tired and dated and in need of a revamp.  The application, which could go before members of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee later this year, adds: \u0026ldquoConsidering the site\u0026rsquos historic importance both locally and within Scotland, it is clear that any development both internally and externally requires to be sensitive.  \u0026ldquoIt is also important to recognise the value of this development in terms of the improved visitor experience, which will impact visitor numbers to the area as a whole, and the business diversification."},{"url":null,"title":"avid-lynyrd-skynyrd-fan-pens-foreword-to-new-book-about-his-idols","story":"  Iain Monk has contributed to The Gospel According to Abraham by Paul Abraham, who was the American band\u0026rsquos road manager for a decade.  The new book is full of stories about the band, best known for hits such as Sweet Home Alabama and Free Bird.  Iain said: \u0026ldquoI became an instant fan of the band in the 1970s and was instantaneously hooked by the music, that kind of southern rock music.  \u0026ldquoMy obsession for the band just grew from there but the first time I saw them live was in 1988 in New York when I flew over to see them.  \u0026ldquoI had written to the band\u0026rsquos management to see if they could help me with tickets and I think they were impressed that I was coming from Scotland to see the band.  \u0026ldquoThat relationship grew with management, road crew and members of the band and I started following them across America.  Iain, who lives in Gullane, has spent countless hours travelling across the globe to see his idols perform at 31 shows, ranging from New York, Boston and Washington to Belgium, the Netherlands and all across the UK.  His friendship with band members and those associated with the band has even seen him spend a week at the family home of Randall Hall, who was the band\u0026rsquos guitarist, in Florida. A friendship also grew with Paul Abraham, with Iain interviewing the road manager for his Lynyrd Skynyrd blog about his intention to write a book.  Iain said the band, which was formed in 1969 and continued following the tragic death of lead singer Ronnie Van Zant in 1977, were \u0026ldquoamazing live but also \u0026ldquolovely people.  He added: \u0026ldquoThey are down to earth, very friendly people in my experience and the people that formed the band are very approachable.  \u0026ldquoI have been very, very fortunate that I have been given access to the band over the years.  \u0026ldquoThat is something most fans would simply not get and I think that is down to trust and trusting me not to take advantage of their generosity.  The 55-year-old was delighted to be asked to write the foreword for the book, which is now available online.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis memoir provides a ringside seat, it is an intriguing glimpse into Skynyrd\u0026rsquos world. Fans will feel more than satisfied. Paul had a lot to get of his chest. The book offers up more explosive revelations than a Donald Trump press conference.  \u0026ldquoOver the many years I followed Skynyrd on tour, I was treated like royalty by the band.

Having binge-watched Love Island while off her feet, the 16-year-old Ross High School pupil was starstruck when Jack \u0026ndash who was already in Tranent to visit family \u0026ndash appeared at her Church Street home to wish her well.  \u0026ldquoIt was mental, Hannah told the Courier.  \u0026ldquoHe was in Tranent and my little sister [Sophie, 12] had messaged him, and I didn\u0026rsquot know.  \u0026ldquoShe told him I\u0026rsquod had surgery and was being really moody!

He has family up here so he was up visiting them.  \u0026ldquoHe stayed for about 20 minutes.

ICOL wants to build a substation, which will bring energy from an offshore windfarm onshore and into the National Grid, on the former power station footprint.  The application has been opposed by local community councils and the council, who believe it is not the best use of the site, which was bought by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower in March and is subject to an ongoing masterplan process for its future.  However, within weeks of the council buying the site, Scottish Ministers called-in the only lodged application for the land, from ICOL.  They said the move was because it was of \u0026ldquonational importance and denied any link to the fact that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on a state visit to China \u0026ndash whose state-owned company Red Rock own ICOL \u0026ndash at the time of the announcement.  The reporter appointed to investigate the application carried out a site visit at the start of this month.  Following that visit, it was announced a hearing into the plans would be held and Allison Coard was named as the appointed reporter who would oversee the hearing and report back to ministers.  Ward councillor Lachlan Bruce welcomed the announcement.  He said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom glad that there is going to be a hearing on this application.  \u0026ldquoI, of course, would prefer if members of the public could also speak at the hearing to give their views and opinions but I do think that community councils being invited is a welcome step.  \u0026ldquoOf course, this is again lengthening the process of the application out. If it had been left by the Scottish Government for East Lothian to make a decision we probably would have had an outcome by now and members of the public would also have had their chance to have a say.  \u0026ldquoI am confident that the hearing will be a further step in helping to convince the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos independent reporter that the current Inch Cape application is wrong for the site and wrong for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton and Prestonpans.  Invitations have been sent out to Prestonpans and Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Councils inviting them to be represented at the hearing, along with East Lothian Council and representatives of ICOL.  All four have confirmed they will be attending the hearing.  In a statement following the visit, it was announced: \u0026ldquoThe reporter considers it would be helpful to have some wider community participation at the hearing and suggests that these views might be represented by one or both of the local community councils.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe appointed Reporter has decided that a hearing should be held on certain matters to help her consider the application, and the council has confirmed in writing that we will participate in this procedure. The council welcomes the Reporter\u0026rsquos decision to invite both Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council and Prestonpans Community Council to participate in the hearing.  A preliminary date for the start of the hearing has been announced as Tuesday, October 2, with a venue and more details of those attending to follow.  A spokesperson for ICOL said: \u0026ldquoWe welcome the announcement that a hearing will take place on the planning application for the proposed substation, in line with planning guidance for schemes of national importance.

He said: \u0026ldquoUsing the flood mark in the video-still as a reference, I got a friend who has access to a theodolite to use this and project this water level to other landmarks around the river and town centre.  \u0026ldquoRobert Byers from Haddington Camera Club then used his photo editing skills and a photoshop \u0026lsquoflood\u0026rsquo plug-in to reconstruct the photos.  In August 1948, persistent heavy rainfall saw the county face its most serious flooding in history.  Although much of East Lothian was affected, Haddington took a major hit. High Street as far west as the Town House was under several feet of water which stretched to the gates of Amisfield Park, a distance of more than half a mile.  Distillery Park, the Nungate, Peffers Place and Brewery Park were similarly devastated.  The Biel Burn also flooded, submerging all the low-lying land north and west of West Barns.  The flood occurred as the culmination of a period of truly exceptional rainfall \u0026ndash 122 mm of rain fell between August 1 and 8, followed by 153 mm in the next five days.  The saturated ground then received a huge 139 mm of rain in the next 24 hours, bringing severe flooding across the county.  The Haddingtonshire Courier reported on \u0026ldquodisastrous flooding without parallel in living memory \u0026ndash if not in history.  In the August 20, 1948 edition of the Courier, \u0026ldquoserious damage was inflicted on the banks of the River Tyne while other streams burst their banks and \u0026ldquoleft destruction in their wake.  It added: \u0026ldquoSo heavy was the flood of water that the streams made courses for themselves, with the result that many people were flooded out of house and home.  \u0026ldquoOne of the worst areas to suffer was Haddington, where a large number of people were rendered homeless, while shops and business premises were flooded to a depth of several feet.  Meanwhile at West Barns, the Biel Burn overflowed, causing serious damage to houses and shops in the village but fortunately \u0026ldquono loss of life is reported, although some people had narrow escapes, so suddenly did the water levels rise.  The floods also caused serious damage to crops on farms close to the Tyne and extensive damage was also caused to the now-demolished New County Cinema on Hardgate.  Nungate residents who had been enjoying the evening\u0026rsquos film were instructed by cinema management to return home to avoid being cut off as water levels rapidly rose.  And slightly further afield, the electricity supply in Gifford and Saltoun was interrupted, and at the Maltings in Haddington the sub-station was completely swept away. It was anticipated it would take many months for the affected areas to return to normal, and calls for assistance to help with the recovery were issued."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-the-commodore-of-haddington","story":"  TEENAGERS often get a bad press. To be sure, it\u0026rsquos a time when parents wonder what has happened to their children and feel they have lost them or gone wrong somewhere. This is because teenage years are a time of great change in terms of brain development. Quite literally the teenage brain is being remodelled and new priorities and emotions are created as a result.  It\u0026rsquos a time when peers and their approval become more important than parents or family, or almost anything else. Taking risks, or doing seemingly foolish things, are all part of this. We are familiar with the term \u0026lsquopeer pressure\u0026rsquo, but in our teenage years, approval by our peers and being included by them takes on a massive importance. It is an essential part of growing up and creating a new self-identity.  And a story from over 200 years ago shows that although the word teenager may not have been invented, and that there was no such thing as \u0026lsquoyouth culture\u0026rsquo as we now know it, behaviour was much the same.  It involves a group of young men who we would now call teenagers. They were a group of friends from Haddington. They included George Neill, John and William Haldane who were brothers, Peter Martine, Benjie Hunter and John Davie, whose nickname was \u0026lsquoLettie\u0026rsquo. They were all from Haddington, and their escapade became a story told well into their senior years. The nickname \u0026lsquoCommodore\u0026rsquo was coined for George on this day and stayed with him until he took it to his grave many years later.  Much of the tale is left to the imagination but the essentials were well told. One of the group came up with the idea of hiring a boat and heading out to Fife. These young men were not from poor backgrounds and so had the means to do this. So with the madcap plan devised, they set off as a group to the fishing village of Prestonpans.  The negotiations to hire a boat were concluded and they set off for the foreign shore of Fife, aiming for the town of Kirkcaldy. I cannot comment on their sailing abilities but they must have had some experience for they successfully navigated themselves to the shore of the \u0026lsquoLang Toun\u0026rsquo, possibly using the Lomond hills as a marker.  They came ashore like invading Vikings, intent on mischief. No social media in those days, but each town had a drummer who would disseminate news. And so they found Kirkcaldy\u0026rsquos drummer and paid him to announce to the town that at three in the afternoon there would be a spectacular diving and swimming show at the harbour entrance. The drummer set forth announcing the news, creating an air of expectation.  The group chose Lettie to be the performer. He was the best swimmer amongst them. As 3 o\u0026rsquoclock approached, a large excited crowd assembled on the harbour walls. The Haddington lads looked at each other with wry smiles and secret sniggers. Their ruse had worked, perhaps too successfully.  \u0026ldquoShow them what ye can dae, Lettie was told by his friends. And so Lettie stood on the edge of the boat and dived into the sea, from a height of about two feet. The crowd was silent, except for a wee five-year-old girl who clapped. She was the only one impressed by the spectacle.  There were murmurings as the Kirkcaldy folk began to realise they had been duped and were being made a fool of by these young Haddington lads. The mood began to get angry, and boos were followed by threats and words I cannot print here. It was clear it was time to go.  \u0026ldquoThank ye, the lads said, bowing to the crowd and laughing, mocking them for being so gullible. Stones began to fly towards them as they set off back towards Prestonpans, gesturing to the now-furious crowd. The lads in the boat were hysterical with laughter. They had raided and fooled the \u0026lsquoLang Toun\u0026rsquo.  But then their laughter stopped. Emerging from the harbour was a boat filled with angry Kirkcaldy lads who were shouting serious threats. The prank looked as if it might end unpleasantly so the Haddington lads had no choice but to row for their lives.  George took command. His friends had nicknamed him the Commodore at the beginning of their voyage, not so much because of his nautical skills but because of his leadership qualities. They were now desperately needed.  \u0026ldquoRow lads, row, he called on them. To be truthful the Haddington lads were at a disadvantage. They were not skilled seamen and in truth they were more bookish than brawn. But fear can do mighty things to a man\u0026rsquos capabilities, and as the adrenaline pumped through their veins they found levels of strength they didn\u0026rsquot know they had. They rowed like true Vikings, heave ho, heave ho. The sea splashed at their feet, their hearts nearly burst, but they kept the pace.  Slowly they began to pull ahead from the Kirkcaldy boat. \u0026ldquoKeep rowing, lads, dinnae look back, dinnae slow doon, called George, who was himself rowing as hard as he could. The tide was strong, the night was drawing in and the weather was beginning to change. The Kirkcaldy boat turned back, but the Haddington lads dare not attempt a Fife landing. They had no choice but to cross the Firth.  Darkness fell, then a thick haar covered them in freezing mist. They rowed through the night not sure in which direction they were headed. They wondered if their parents would ever know what had happened to them if, as now seemed likely, they were lost at sea.  The morning sun slowly burned off the mist. Thankfully they were still in the Firth, and there in front of them was the smoke coming from the lums and salt works of Prestonpans. They wept with relief and summoned up their last drops of energy to row ashore. Their final few hundred metres to the stony beach was watched by village children and women drying clothes.  Some fishermen helped pull the boat to land and the Haddington lads literally collapsed out of the vessel onto the beach, utterly exhausted but elated to be still alive.  George Neill was later to become a well-respected Baillie in Haddington, a bookseller and publisher of great local repute. He outlived his friends who had shared that day of adventure and danger.  He was often asked by those who knew him less well: \u0026ldquoWhy do people call you the Commodore? He never tired of telling the tale of his teenage adventure."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-secondary-schools-delighted-with-pupils-exam-results","story":"  This year saw the best pass rate in Higher exams across East Lothian for five years.  East Lothian Council said that pupils across its six secondary schools \u0026ndash Musselburgh Grammar School Knox Academy, Haddington North Berwick High School Preston Lodge High School in Prestonpans Ross High School, Tranent and Dunbar Grammar School \u0026ndash improved their performances, with the number of Highers passed going up to more than 79 per cent.  Lauren Rodger, headteacher at North Berwick High School, told the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe are absolutely delighted.  \u0026ldquoOur Higher results are brilliant and we\u0026rsquore really pleased with how all the current sixth year pupils have performed.  \u0026ldquoI know schools are judged on their exam results, but for us it\u0026rsquos also about seeing the pupils develop \u0026ndash that\u0026rsquos the most pleasing part.  Similarly pleased was Paul Reynolds, the Ross High School headteacher.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are delighted with the exam results.  \u0026ldquoOur Higher results have been record-breaking and the sixth-years who have just left us have got really positive results that will allow them to hopefully go to uni or further education.  Meanwhile, Musselburgh Grammar School is celebrating record attainment levels for S5 and S6 pupils at all levels in this year\u0026rsquos exam results.  Headteacher Colin Gerrie said that there were also many \u0026ldquoexcellent results achieved by pupils in S4.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe results achieved by our students this year are exceptionally good and continue the successes of recent years, with school records broken on an annual basis.  \u0026ldquoWe do not underestimate the hard work of our pupils and the commitment of our teachers to make this happen.  His counterpart at Preston Lodge High School, Gavin Clark, also gave his thoughts.  At PL, four S5 pupils achieved six As at Higher, although the number of pupils gaining one, two, three or four Highers dropped from the last set of results.  Mr Clark added: \u0026ldquoWe expected that to happen, as a result of our regular tracking process.  \u0026ldquoThis dip in no way diminishes the achievements of those who performed so impressively in examinations.  At Knox Academy, new headteacher Susan Cook gave an update on how the school was performing.  She said: \u0026ldquoSeventy-four per cent of S4 pupils attained five or more qualifications at National 3 69 per cent achieved five or more passes at National 4 and 47 per cent achieved five or more passes at National 5 at grades A-C and 55 per cent at grades A-D.  \u0026ldquoThere were some outstanding individual performances in S4, with eight of our candidates achieving seven A passes at N5.  \u0026ldquoThese results are a really strong foundation to build S5 performance upon and I would encourage all parents/carers to continue to support their child to study at home as the transition from S4 to S5 in terms of challenge and pace moves up a few gears and much more study is required, especially at Higher level.  Meanwhile, the performance of S5 pupils in their Higher exams was down on the previous three years.  Ms Cook added: \u0026ldquoFifty-five per cent attained one or more Highers 35 per cent three or more and 16 per cent attained five or more Highers.  \u0026ldquoTwenty-two of our pupils achieved five Highers and some with straights As across all subjects.  \u0026ldquoMany other pupils achieved a mixture of Higher and National 5 awards and will build upon these in their sixth year.  Finally, there was \u0026ldquoan improving trend for S6 pupils over the last four years at Higher level, Ms Cook added.  The headteacher said: \u0026ldquoThose attaining one or more Highers was 62 per cent and then added to their results from S4 and S5  this rose to 76.22 per cent having achieved one or more Highers over S5/S6 \u0026ndash one per cent lower than last year, which in terms of statistics is not significant. However, it\u0026rsquos more than 13 per cent more than pupils attained in 2015 and 2016.  \u0026ldquoThirty per cent of the year group attained three or more Highers and the accumulate total was 66 per cent .  Finally, Claire Slowther, headteacher at Dunbar Grammar School, told the Courier that the staff at the school were \u0026ldquovery pleased with the exam results and said: \u0026ldquoAt Dunbar Grammar we are very pleased with the SQA results our students have achieved.  \u0026ldquoIt is wonderful to see the hard work of our students be rewarded with great results.  \u0026ldquoOur excellent team of teachers always work hard to support and challenge students and we were all really delighted to see them do well.  \u0026ldquoWe are incredibly proud of the achievements of our students and are looking forward to celebrating these at our awards evening, which will be held on September 12."},{"url":null,"title":"plans-for-longniddry-south-to-go-on-display","story":"  Developers Cruden Homes  and ZeroC will be displaying their proposals for development at the Longniddry Inn on Wednesday from 3pm to 8pm.

That project came about following rising safety concerns from drivers who did not feel confident using the unlit road.  Since then, driver confidence has improved by 78 per cent, with the project, which was undertaken by UK-based Clearview Intelligence in partnership with Transport Scotland and Amey, shortlisted in the Road Safety, Traffic Management and Enforcement category at the National Transport Awards, which take place in October.  Councillor Norman Hampshire, a Dunbar ward councillor and deputy leader of East Lothian Council, as well as chairman of the A1 Action Group, was one of those hailing the project as a big success.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe installation of the studs has, in my view, revolutionised the driving experience on the A1 after dark.  \u0026ldquoThe studs have improved night-time visibility beyond all recognition along certain parts of the route.  Concerns about driving conditions on the unlit road were first raised by the A1 Action Group, which comprises councillors from Scottish Borders and East Lothian Councils, transportation groups and community councils.  Transport Scotland met with the action group and, upon investigating the road, recognised that entering or exiting the A1 during the hours of darkness was a key area of concern due to a lack of visibility, junction definition and consistency in signage and road markings.  Clearview Intelligence was then appointed by Amey to make improvements to the road as part of a wider project and installed the road studs to give a visual consistency to the route by ensuring all major junctions were visible and treated similarly.  This included using white, red, amber and green studs to effectively highlight road edges, the centre of the road and junctions.  Andy Salotti, director of solutions at Clearview Intelligence, said: \u0026ldquoWe are immensely proud of the work we did to improve the driving conditions on the A1 and delighted this has been recognised at a national level.

The agricultural land has been earmarked by East Lothian Council for business use but Barratt claimed the council\u0026rsquos vision was financially unviable.  They said the only way to make the \u0026ldquonumbers add up was to create a mixed use site with housing and industry.  But their claims were rejected by councillors after Provost John McMillan , cabinet spokesman on economic development, insisted: \u0026ldquoIf we build it, they will come.  The quote, paraphrasing one made famous in the US baseball movie Field of Dreams starring Kevin Costner, came as he backed council officials who recommended the plans from Barratt and site owners The Co-operative be thrown out.  Jason Watt, from Barratt, told a meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos planning committee in Haddington last Tuesday that site drainage and geology issues meant it would cost \u0026pound1.5m to get ready for development.  Once general costs were taken into account, the total development bill would be \u0026pound2.25m \u0026ndash yet the value of the land was estimated at only \u0026pound1.1m.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe numbers clearly do not add up and never will unless there is cross subsidising with a mixed use development.  Ward councillor Kenny McLeod  backed the Barratt proposal, highlighting the lack of council housing available for rent in Tranent: the proposed Barratt development included 25 per cent affordable housing.  Mr McLeod said: \u0026ldquoWe need to keep the local connection and they are not building housing for rent in this area.  \u0026ldquoIt must be 50 years since a house was put in the area for rent.

That means traffic was responsible for 18.5 per cent of the total amount of carbon dioxide released in East Lothian in 2016.  But in total, CO2 emissions in the county fell over the same period.  Jason Rose, from East Lothian Greens, blamed more housing developments in East Lothian for the rise in CO2 from emissions relating to transport.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoTo live [in the new developments], you need a car. More houses means more cars.  Mr Rose also highlighted the fact that nearly half of East Lothian residents commute to Edinburgh every day for work.  \u0026ldquoThe main issue is half the people who live in East Lothian work in Edinburgh, so they have to commute, he said.  \u0026ldquoBuses take a long time, you want cheap and reliable.  \u0026ldquoWith trains, there definitely needs to be more of an effort to improve length and frequency.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council should be trying to increase employment in East Lothian, so people don\u0026rsquot need to commute.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove heard some people say, \u0026lsquooh what if you open a bridge here or build another road?\u0026rsquo but creating more roads just increases traffic and spreads the problem around.  Overall, emissions from transport, both private and for business purposes, increased by 3.5 per cent in the UK over the period between 2011 and 2016.  However, total CO2 emissions fell by 4.6 per cent over the five years in East Lothian.  The county was responsible for releasing 1.1 million tonnes of CO2 in 2016 \u0026ndash down from 1.15 million tonnes five years earlier.  But Mr Rose highlighted that it was not just CO2 emissions that needed to be monitored.  \u0026ldquoWe need to watch for NO2  and PM10  \u0026ndash those are the pollutants that can cause health risks, he added.  In East Lothian, industrial and commercial activities are by far the main producer of CO2 emissions, releasing 63.9 per cent of the total. In 2016, households produced 16 per cent of the CO2 in the county, lower than five years earlier.  The Department also takes into account the amount of CO2 produced by farms and through other rural activities and the CO2 removed from the air by trees.  According to its estimates, these agricultural activities produced more greenhouse gases than forests removed, and so were responsible for 1.6 per cent of the carbon emissions in East Lothian in 2016.  Overall, the UK reduced its carbon emissions by 15.4 per cent over the five years."},{"url":null,"title":"in-this-weeks-courier","story":"  We\u0027ll also reveal the Top 25 in this year\u0027s Pet Idol competition.

The choice is his.  The comments came as Mr\u0026nbspField\u0026nbspsaid he will employ \u0026ldquothe best legal minds to dispute party rules which say he cannot return to the party after resigning the whip.  Mr\u0026nbspField, who has served as the MP for Birkenhead for almost 40 years, was told by party chief whip Nick Brown that his decision to resign automatically meant he was no longer a member.  Labour sources confirmed that by resigning the whip Mr\u0026nbspFieldhad \u0026ldquoautomatically opted to resign from the Labour Party.  Mr\u0026nbspField\u0026nbsptold the Press Association that he would be making a legal challenge against the move.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt was a very friendly meeting, he\u0026rsquos a good colleague, but the sad bit of news in it was that he thought the Labour Party rule book was clear, that if I resign the whip I couldn\u0026rsquot be a Labour Party member.  \u0026ldquoI told him I was sorry to hear that obviously, that I would actually get the best legal minds I could on the job and that I would dispute that.  The one-time minister for welfare reform, who was charged by Tony Blair to reform the welfare state by \u0026ldquothinking the unthinkable, sensationally resigned saying that the party was now governed by \u0026ldquoa culture of intolerance, nastiness and intimidation.  In an interview with the Press Association he said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos been a pretty big and tiring step that I\u0026rsquove taken, I don\u0026rsquot regret it, I think it is important.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not a gesture politician, I do this, I hope with others, to effect change and I think that process has actually started on this.  \u0026ldquoThe people of Birkenhead are sovereign in this matter, I would hope that providence willing, to be the Labour candidate next time.  \u0026ldquoIf not I will be the Independent Labour Party next time.  Mr\u0026nbspField\u0026nbspsaid the saga was \u0026ldquoone of the saddest in his long career.  The longstanding Labour man added that talk of a by-election was \u0026ldquoanother game, for another day.  He earlier stressed his resignation of the whip over the anti-Semitism crisis was not part of a plot to bring down the Labour leader.  \u0026ldquoI hope and I believe Jeremy will lead us into the next election and it is not true I\u0026rsquom a constant critic of Jeremy, said Mr\u0026nbspField.  \u0026ldquoThat isn\u0026rsquot true. I believe he has the right to take us into the next election because he has won two leadership contests.  \u0026ldquoThe idea this is part of a plot or anything else is simply crazy. It is because I think he will lead us into the next election that I think these issues are urgent.  However, Mr\u0026nbspField\u0026nbspadded that he felt Mr Corbyn\u0026rsquos thanks for his service was \u0026ldquoas though I was resigning from a whist club and pointed out that he had been a member of Labour longer than his leader.  The Birkenhead MP also denied claims that he was jumping before he was pushed, having lost a no-confidence vote within his constituency Labour party after backing Brexit.  He said: \u0026ldquoI have been through all this before when I have been deselected and I am still the Labour party candidate.  \u0026ldquoI wish to be the Labour party candidate at the next election and, if I am not, I shall stand as an independent Labour candidate.  \u0026ldquoThe people who decide this are not a small caucus of 30-odd people but the 70,000 electors of Birkenhead.

Ministers hope the move will protect home buyers from a small minority of rogue estate agents who delay sales or sell a property using misleading information.  Last year, the regulator issued 16 prohibition orders and this additional funding will enable them to hire new staff to tackle problems during the home buying and selling process.  Housing Minister Heather Wheeler, announcing the policy, said: \u0026ldquoMaking the housing market work is about more than just building homes, but helping hard working families buy and sell with confidence.  \u0026ldquoThis new funding will help ensure all estate agents are held to a high standard, reducing stress for people when making one of the most important purchases in their life.  Lord Toby Harris, chair of National Trading Standards, said: \u0026ldquoWe are determined to ensure that consumers receive the protection they deserve when buying or selling a home.  \u0026ldquoThis extra funding is welcome and will allow the National Trading Standards Estate Agency Team to do more to tackle the estate agents who flout the rules.

Charlie Dove-Edwin, who works at Richmond, the American International University in London, was among a team teaching in Sierra Leone this summer.  It is the second year running that he has taken part.  He said he originally signed up because he liked \u0026ldquothe idea of taking professors from the UK or the US to Sierra Leone, thereby teaching the same stuff there rather than students coming here.  Mr Dove-Edwin, who taught a course on country risk analysis, also has a personal connection to Sierra Leone as his grandfather was educated in the country.  There are differences between students in the UK and Sierra Leone \u0026ndash such as in age ranges, which is \u0026ldquomassive in the latter, he said.  \u0026ldquoGoing to university is the be all and end all, so you can have people in their 50s, you can have people in their late 20s and I\u0026rsquod say, probably way, way fewer just out of school than you would get in the UK.  There are also differences in terms of facilities \u0026ndash with courses more \u0026ldquotextbook driven in Sierra Leone, and less access to computers and the internet.  Students opt to take part in the summer schools, which are not part of their regular courses, he said.  \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos a desire in Africa for education, they\u0026rsquore just curious to know more and the fact that someone\u0026rsquos come to Sierra Leone to teach them about other things, they get very interested in that, Mr Dove-Edwin said.  This year, Professors Without Borders ran schools in Sierra Leone, Uganda, Thailand and India, with three to four people working in each school.  The organisation grew out of a conversation between three colleagues \u0026ndash all university lecturers \u0026ndash in a London cafe, and is now in its third year of running summer schools.  Co-founder Tessy de Nassau said they had discussed the opportunities open to their students through studying and living in the capital.  \u0026ldquoWe said, you know, it\u0026rsquos just unfair that a lot of students around the world don\u0026rsquot have this opportunity. So rather than having these students coming to London, or Europe or America to study, we bring it to them. That was the first thought.  \u0026ldquoWe said we really want to enable really skilled, quality education for everyone.

The research, carried out by the Bank of Scotland, showed average property prices reached an average \u0026pound277,134 in the areas around the country\u0026rsquos top 20 secondary schools.  That leaves buyers having to pay on average 36% more than if they were buying a property elsewhere in the same local authority area \u0026ndash with this amounting to a difference of \u0026pound72,973.  The premium paid for living near to a prestigious school has increased from \u0026pound41,441 last year, the data showed.  The increase was due to a number of new schools in relatively expensive areas for property, the Bank of Scotland said.  The four schools where buyers have to pay \u0026pound120,000 more than the average prices in the local authority area were Hyndland Secondary School in Glasgow , Cults Academy in Aberdeen , Boroughmuir High School in Edinburgh  and James Gillespie\u0026rsquos High School .  However the research also revealed that for five of the top 20 secondaries, homes in the catchment area actually cost less than the local average.  The best performing of these is St Ninian\u0026rsquos High School in East Renfrewshire \u0026ndash ranked as the fourth best secondary in Scotland \u0026ndash where house prices cost on average \u0026pound259,024,\u0026nbspsome 2% lower than the rest of the local authority.  Houses near Woodfarm High School are also 2% lower than the East Renfrewshire average, while in East Dunbartonshire properties in the catchment area for both Bishopbriggs Academy and Turnbull High Scool area 19% cheaper than the average, with this rising to 23% for homes close to Lenzie Academy.  In the last five years homes within the catchment areas of the top 20 secondary schools have increased in value by 30% \u0026ndash or \u0026pound64,034 \u0026ndash from 2013, when the average price for such a property was \u0026pound213,101.  Over the same period homes near James Hillespie\u0026rsquos High School have increased from \u0026pound271,020 to \u0026pound424,647 \u0026ndash an increase of 57% \u0026ndash while in Glasgow properties close to Jordanhill School have risen 50%, going from \u0026pound110,018 to \u0026pound165,082.  Graham Blair, mortgages director at Bank of Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoWhen buying a home, many parents want their children to be close to a top performing school, and school catchment house price premiums generally tend to align to where we already know property is more expensive, for example, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Glasgow.  \u0026ldquoWith the mix of top schools changing so much from last year, there is a risk that parents focused on school catchment areas could spend money on a property \u0026ndash only for the nearby school to drop out of the top performing list in the coming years.  \u0026ldquoTherefore, they may benefit more from buying in an area where the schools are consistently in top 20 but house prices trade at more of a discount."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7299554.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"what-the-papers-say-september-1","story":"  The  reports that a computer tool which uses artificial intelligence could help save the lives of thousands of cancer patients.

School welfare and support officer Rachel was over the moon when her partner Mick Seedall, 48, popped the question in summer 2016.  But when she tipped the scales at 21st 5lb and a size 24 she decided she wasn\u0027t going to settle for a \u0027typical plus size A-line dress\u0027.  She then vowed to snuggle into her dream size 14 dress and immediately cut out fat from her diet, joined a Slimming World group and went swimming five times a week.  Rachel, of Blackburn, Lancs., said: \"I started swimming 50 to 70 lengths four or five times a week and my weight came down.  \u0026ldquoMy eating habits also changed and I swapped out bad foods for good foods.  \"I loved putting mayonnaise on everything so I cut that out and I\u0026rsquove stopped cooking a lot of things in oil.  \"I now remove as much fat as I can from foods and I now have fruit in my bag.  Rachel had ballooned up over the years due to her \u0027sweet tooth\u0027 - and her love for mayonnaise.  She was also diagnosed with benign intracranial hypertension, a pressure on the brain caused by too much fluid because of her rotund size.  But she ditched the dressings for the perfect dress by making her own home made chips and favourite Slimming World recipe for syn-free chilli burgers.  She joined her local Slimming World group in January 2017 and in 17 months lost seven stone before her wedding in May 27 this year.  Rachel said: \u0026ldquoI had to lose weight for my health - and for my wedding dress.  \"When I tried the dress on for the first time three weeks before my wedding and it fit, it was just relieved but also elated.  \"It felt so so-real after I had put so much pressure on myself I just really wanted to fit into it so bad.\"  After losing the weight, Rachel\u0027s ailments subsided which gave her more confidence to do more exercise and concentrate on her meal plans.  Speaking about her diet, she added: \u0026ldquoI never starved myself or went on a crazy diet, I just ate better. I don\u0026rsquot get the hypertension symptoms anymore, which is great.  \u0026ldquoBefore my weight loss, I was always tired, out of breath.  \"I had dreams of what I wanted to wear and with losing the weight I was able to fulfill it.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In lengthy posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be, if not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to return to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But if this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But if Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8486553.jpg?type=article-full","title":"five-women-in-business-speak-out","story":"  All women can think of another woman who has inspired her to try a career in business, education or industry.

It seemed the perfect job Helen didn\u0026rsquot drink yet was interested in finding out more about the process. Little did she know it would take her life in a whole new direction.  Rather than viewing distilling as chemical engineering, Helen found it felt far more artistic - all based on the creative expression of how it looks, smells and tastes. After inheriting an old family book detailing how her relatives used to distil on the family farm, Helen realised distilling was part of her history and heritage.    With derelict out-buildings on her family\u0026rsquos farm, Helen had a fresh appreciation for these old spaces once viewed as a millstone around her neck. Buildings that were near fresh spring water, surrounded by botanicals created a unique opportunity.  Gin attracted Helen initially as the old distilling manual described how people used to flavour spirits with whatever was around them. The farm had a wealth of natural botanicals, including Scottish juniper, so suddenly this untapped heather hill was incredibly valuable.  The gin is named Badvo, after Helen\u0026rsquos family farm where the stories of distilling inspired Helen when starting out. The heron logo represents the fresh spring water used, as only a very pure spring can support enough fish for a heron. To fund the start-up, Helen pre-sold the first batch of 105 bottles collectively for \u0026pound6,500, going on to use the money to unlock match funding, which snowballed until the entire distillery was grant funded.    Helen commented: \u0026ldquoI got a lot of flak for being a solo entrepreneur. Yes, there are downsides to being a one-man band, but it gives you the opportunity to be dynamic. You can make a decision and you don\u0026rsquot have to justify it to anyone or get it past any board.  \u0026ldquoIt hurts occasionally when people assume someone else set up the distillery as I am too young or too female to have accomplished this alone. I just don\u0026rsquot think some people can comprehend how you can cover so much ground at this stage in life, but I think this is the perfect time.

On the contrary, her peer group expected that students of both sexes could progress to further education, and into careers of our choice. This certainly was Julie\u0026rsquos experience.    Graduating from Glasgow University, Bachelor of Laws with Honours in 1993, Julie then went on to complete the required post-graduate Diploma in Legal Practice in 1994. A legal Traineeship commenced immediately, and she was formally admitted as a solicitor in 1995, at the age of 23. By 27, Julie had been promoted to partner. At that time, she was one of the youngest female partners in a law firm in Scotland. By 2015, more than 60 per cent of solicitors under the age of 40, practising in Scotland, were women \u0026ndash unimaginable in 1995, far less in 1918. For the following 11 years, Julie practised a wide range of areas of law and managed three of her firm\u0027s\u0026nbspbranch offices. She was in charge of HR, and worked long hours.  In 2010, Julie decided to leave the relative security of her large firm behind. Seeking a better work/life balance, she set up her own firm \u0026ndash Millen Solicitors. Hard work continued, and although she faced pressures of a different kind as a sole practitioner, she succeeded in achieving a balance, not only for herself, but for every member of her team.  From the outset, Julie envisaged a practice which would provide an exceptional level of service to clients, and a collegiate and stimulating environment for employees. These values continue at the core of Millen Solicitors as they approach the end of their 8th successful year.    \u0026ldquoFamily Solicitors For Generations is the business maxim, with a nod to their specialisms in all aspects of family law, as well as powers of attorney, wills and executries. Julie and her team provide an outstanding, supportive and compassionate service to families, parents, grandparents and children in times of crisis or uncertainty, at ying stages of their respective lives. Their clients agree, with the majority of work now coming in the form of referrals from satisfied clients, and professional colleagues seeking their expertise.  Julie comments: \u0026ldquoI am proud to have contributed to the cracking of the \u0026ldquoglass ceiling, and I look forward to seeing Scotland\u0026rsquos entrepreneurial women achieve its eventual demise.

Colin Beattie MSP, the SNP\u0026rsquos national treasurer, appeared to contribute \u0026pound20 towards the fundraiser. He did not respond to multiple attempts to contact him, and the donation was later removed.  SNP MP Angus MacNeil also appeared to welcome the appeal on Twitter, and even retweeted one user who said: \u0026ldquoCan\u0026rsquot help but think this is a terrible indictment of the SNP\u0026rsquos disciplinary culture. Innocent until proven guilty!  Chris McEleny, an SNP councillor and former deputy leadership hopeful, said he had contributed money because \u0026ldquoAlex has supported me in the past and it\u0026rsquos my turn to give back.  He said: \u0026ldquoWalking away from my friends just because the going got tough is not something I\u0026rsquom going to do. It\u0026rsquos almost as if in modern day Scotland some are suggesting a person doesn\u0026rsquot have the right to defend themselves.  Posting a link to his fundraiser on Wednesday night, Mr Salmond\u0026rsquos Twitter account claimed he was putting Scottish independence first through his decision to resign his SNP membership.  The tweet read: \"Salmond puts Scottish independence first. Help support the costs of Alex Salmond\u0027s Judicial Review in the Court of Session.\"  Lawyer and pro-independence commentator Andrew Tickell labelled it \u0026ldquoremarkably dispiriting.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe former first minister is accused of sexual assault. We have no idea where the truth lies. We presume him to be innocent. Where is the authentic locus to bring the constitution into this?  Former Labour first minister Jack McConnell was among those who urged people to donate to charities helping victims of sexual assault and harassment. Other Labour figures called on supporters to donate to Women\u0026rsquos Aid.  Posting a link to a Women\u0027s Aid donation page, Labour MP Danielle Rowley said: \"Instead of donating to a rich and powerful man, I have a better idea.\"  In what some interpreted as a coded rebuke of Mr Salmond, Ms Sturgeon also tweeted her support for a Women\u0026rsquos Aid campaign against the UK Government on Thursday afternoon.  She later insisted nothing must be done to make it harder for women to come forward with sexual harassment allegations.  She told the BBC: \u0026ldquoWhatever any of us do and say in the context of this very high profile case, we must absolutely make sure we don\u0026rsquot make it harder for \u0026ndash or discourage \u0026ndash women from coming forward in the future. I think that\u0026rsquos an obligation on all of us right now.  Scottish Labour MSP Jackie Baillie labelled Mr Salmond\u0026rsquos fundraiser a \u0026ldquodisgrace.  She said: \u0026ldquoSaying it\u0026rsquos about independence is rubbish. This is simply about distracting attention from the allegations of sexual harassment. It is an abuse of power and our politics should be better than this."},{"url":null,"title":"franz-ferdinand-to-headline-hogmanay-party","story":"  The Scottish group will perform at the Concert in the Gardens for the first time following the release of their latest album, Always Ascending.

In an interview with the BBC, Mr Rees-Mogg also questioned the need for the Scottish Government to assume more powers over areas such as trade and immigration once the UK leaves the EU.  He said: \"Of course Scotland is entitled to have another referendum at some point in the future, but I think the SNP\u0027s position of a generation is a reasonable one.\"  \"It should be a generational decision and a generational decision is not made over two or three years.  \"A generation is somewhere beyond 20 years.\"  During the last independence referendum, the then First Minister Alex Salmond described the vote as being a \"once in a generation\" moment for the country to decide.  That has caused some difficulties for his old party since, as it wrestled with a desire from some within the SNP to push ahead with further plans for a second attempt sooner rather than later.  But others are said to want to focus efforts on the more immediate question of Brexit.  And on that, Mr Mogg said granting Holyrood further powers over immigration and trade could prove problematic - despite the Scottish government considering them as vital.  He said: \"There are some powers held by the European Union that will inevitably flow down to the devolved parliaments or assemblies.  \"Whether it\u0027s possible to do it on trade is a more complex issue because those are international treaties that affect the whole of the United Kingdom market and it would be difficult to do on a devolved basis.  \"The principle that powers that come from Brussels should, as far as possible, go to the constituent parts of the United Kingdom is a good one but that won\u0027t be possible for everything.\"  \"To do it for immigration would be really difficult because once people had come into Scotland, how would you limit their ability to go around the rest of the country?  \"We certainly don\u0027t want to be the sort of country that has internal controls or identify cards. I think that would undermine some of our most ancient freedoms.\"  Despite the fact the majority of Scots voted to stay within the UK, a different trend to elsewhere in the UK, he added: \"On a democratic basis the decision .. is as valid for Scotland as it is for the rest of the UK.\"  He also shrugged off research suggesting Scotland\u0027s GDP would fall by as much as 8.5% in the event a no-deal Brexit was forced through. claiming they were in some way jaundiced by those who commissioned them.  \"They\u0027re not in any sense properly independent,\" he said,\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThese forecasts are predicated are based on the political outlook of the people commissioning the forecasts.\"  Regarded as a \u0027hard line\u0027 Brexiteer, the MP also insisted Theresa May would still be Prime Minister in a year\u0027s time, but heralded Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson as a potential heir.  He said: \"She would, at some future date, make a wonderful leader, both as first minister of Scotland and, in due course, leader of the Conservative party in England.  \"She is a wonderful, capable person.\"  \"I think Ruth Davidson is a brilliant, charismatic and capable political figure.\"  However his comments over independence, Brexit and the economy were rubbished by the SNP\u0027s Brexit Chief Mike Russell.  \"Trust in politics and trust in Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson evaporated a long time ago, given the way that the Brexit referendum was run and given their antics since then,\" he said. \"The way to restore trust in politics is to listen to the people and in Scotland that means to represent the people in Scotland who said \u0027we don\u0027t want to leave\u0027.

Confirmation of the action came as the crowdfunding campaign set up by the former first minister to help towards his legal costs got closer to raising \u0026pound100,000.  But his decision to ask the public for financial support has been branded \"unprecedented\" and \"unbelievable\" by opposition politicians - with some urging people to donate cash to women\u0027s organisations instead of give money to the former SNP leader, who served at both Holyrood and Westminster during his lengthy political career.

Mr Salmond announced his crowdfunding campaign at the same time he revealed he was quitting the SNP.  He said he was doing so because he feared there would \"substantial internal division\" within the party if his successor Nicola Sturgeon was forced to suspend him.  A Scottish Government spokesman said: \"We will vigorously defend our position. As we stated last week there are a number of inaccuracies in Mr Salmond\u0027s public statements which for legal reasons we cannot ad dress just now.

One day back in the early 80s in the wake of that revolution, I listened as a small group or ordinary Nicaraguans in the capital, Managua, told me about what life was like under Somoza\u0026rsquos brutal rule.  They spoke of paramilitary death squads, torture and how their autocratic leader had once said: \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot want an educated population I want oxen.  Somoza and his cadres I was to learn, quite literally bled Nicaraguan citizens like those I spoke with to death, the president and his son being both part owners of a company called Plasmaferesis.  This was a business that collected blood plasma from up to 1,000 of Nicaragua\u0026rsquos poorest people every day for sale in the United States and Europe.  The homeless, the alcoholics, the desperately poor went to sell half a litre for a few Nicaraguan cordobas in order to survive, while Somoza and his family pocketed the vast profits from the exported blood plasma.  It\u0026rsquos hardly surprising then that when the socialist Sandinista revolutionaries finally ousted the Somocista, few Nicaraguans mourned the family\u0026rsquos passing.  Fast forward almost forty years though and today it is the once heroic leader of that same revolution and now himself president, Daniel Ortega, that stands accused of brutality and gross human rights violations.  Just these past days the UN Human Rights Office has issued a damning report accusing Mr Ortega\u0026rsquos government of turning turned a blind eye to violations between April 18 and August 18, including the disproportionate use of force, extrajudicial killings by the Nicaraguan police, disappearances, widespread arbitrary detentions and instances of torture and sexual violence in detention centres.  \u0026ldquoRepression and retaliation against demonstrators continue in Nicaragua as the world looks away, UN human rights chief Zeid Ra\u0026rsquoad al-Hussein said in a statement.  For its part the Nicaraguan government has issued a strong rebuttal to the report, insisting as it has done for some time, that the UN had ignored violence aimed at overthrowing a democratically elected government.  Turmoil in Nicaragua, which is among the Western hemisphere\u0026rsquos poorest countries, began in April after President Ortega announced austerity measures including cuts in social security benefits.  But tensions and frustration within the country have been building for years over Mr Ortega\u0026rsquos stubborn hold on power.  Among many of the country\u0026rsquos citizens there is the widespread perception that much like the Somoza dictatorship that Mr Ortega and his Sandinista revolution ousted, the latest president his family and cronies, have likewise been busy enriching themselves at the country\u0026rsquos expense.  To many outside Nicaragua watching current developments there are fears that the country is moving in the same political trajectory as Venezuela, where there too President Nicolas Maduro has responded to opposition protests with an \u0026ldquoan iron fist.  Above all though it\u0026rsquos the dramatic rise in human rights violations in Nicaragua that have added to concerns among monitoring groups. According to the UN\u0026rsquos latest findings, as many as 300 people have been killed and 2,000 injured over the past few months.  With Mr Ortega\u0026rsquos ruling Sandinista party now said to be using supporters mobilised into \u0026ldquoshock forces or \u0026ldquomobs to attack peaceful protesters and heavily armed pro-government paramilitaries to arrest people across the country, there are eerie and disquieting echoes of the years during Somoza\u0026rsquos rule.  Mr Ortega himself has named his crackdown on protestors Operacion Limpieza, or \u0026ldquocleanup, the same term that Somoza had used to describe his effort to eliminate the Sandinistas four decades ago.  Such painful ironies have proved too much for many former Sandinista revolutionaries who have gone over to the opposition ranks after their children were among those recently killed in the protests.  Claims however that the protests against Mr Ortega are stoked by outside influences and provocateurs also continue to do the rounds. Certainly the US and CIA have a along history of interfering with elected governments in Latin America, from Chile to El Salvador, and Argentina to Haiti.  But while there is currently scant evidence of this interference what is undeniable is the scale and extent of human rights violations carried out by Mr Ortega\u0026rsquos forces.  This week\u0026rsquos UN report will go some considerable way to highlighting violations which to date has been largely ignored at a global level.  Here in Scotland itself a recently formed group, Scottish Solidarity with Nicaragua, has launched a petition to bring attention to the worsening situation and foster political action. The group has also been able to solicit a statement from the Scottish Government that says it \u0026ldquoshares concerns about the violence in Nicaragua.  The statement goes on to \u0026ldquocondemn violence against peaceful protesters, arbitrary detentions, media restrictions, and the use of live ammunition and urges the Nicaraguan government to \u0026ldquostop repression of peaceful protests and to ensure a thorough investigation of all reports of human rights abuses.  Back in Nicaragua meanwhile there is little sign that Mr Ortega is willing to make concessions or relinquish power in face of the latest UN condemnation.  The Civic Alliance as the opposition to the government is known, appears for now to be licking its wounds and biding its time while considering the next move.  It\u0026rsquos almost forty years ago now since the Sandinistas created history and entered the annals of revolutionary heroes when they overthrew Somoza.  Rarely since as a foreign correspondent have I witnessed anything to compare with the Sandinista revolution except perhaps the ongoing Rojava revolution by the Kurds in northern Syria.  Talking to those ordinary Nicaraguans I met in the wake of Somoza\u0026rsquos overthrow back then there was a real sense of hope for the future.  Little could they have imagined that all these years later, the spectre of Somoza\u0026rsquos dictatorship would come back to haunt them, least of all in the shape of Daniel Ortega."},{"url":null,"title":"labour-mp-frank-field-told-to-withdraw-resignation-of-face-expulsion-from-party","story":"  Mr Field, who has served as the MP for Birkenhead for almost 40 years, was told by party chief whip Nick Brown that unless he reversed his decision to resign the whip he would be kicked out of the party within two weeks.

He said: \"I said that I wish to remain a member of the Labour party. I had an hour with him and a good chat.  \"I absolutely want to remain a member of the party.  \"There are members of the House of Lords who don\u0027t take the Labour whip.  \"I will argue on that basis that I have a right to remain a member of the party.  \"They continue to pay their Labour membership fees.\"  He added: \"I will be looking for a solicitor, whoever that might be.\"  The longstanding Labour man earlier told BBC Breakfast that he was considering whether to trigger a by-election if he could not remain in the party.  But he stressed his resignation of the whip over the anti-Semitism crisis was not part of a plot to bring down the Labour leader.  \"I hope and I believe Jeremy will lead us into the next election and it is not true I\u0027m a constant critic of Jeremy,\" said Mr Field.  \"That isn\u0027t true.  \"I believe he has the right to take us into the next election because he has won two leadership contests.  \"The idea this is part of a plot or anything else is simply crazy. It is because I think he will lead us into the next election that I think these issues are urgent.\"  However, Mr Field added that he felt Mr Corbyn\u0027s thanks for his service was \"as though I was resigning from a whist club\" and pointed out that he had been a member of Labour longer than his leader.  The Birkenhead MP also denied claims that he was jumping before he was pushed, having lost a no-confidence vote within his constituency Labour party after backing Brexit.

Adults allow all sorts of outside influences to shade their maxims about how things should be done, but very rarely stop to unpick why they believe that which they believe.  Justifying your views about a child\u0026rsquos life is one of the trickiest parts of being a children\u0026rsquos panel member. One might believe they know what is best for a child or young person \u0026ndash but faced with a room full of dissent, it can be hard to reach a conclusion and explain why.  A core difficulty is the competing dictums of a child\u0026rsquos rights and a child\u0026rsquos welfare. It is this tension that sits at the heart of Ian McEwan\u0026rsquos novel, The Children Act, which has been turned into a film starring Emma Thompson and is currently in cinemas. It refers to the 1989 law passed by Westminster, which attempts to ensure children are safeguarded by the adults and agencies in their lives. It admirably states that a \u0026ldquochild\u0026rsquos welfare should be the court\u0026rsquos paramount consideration. But the definition of \u0026ldquowelfare is left up to the individuals deciding what is right for that child.  In Scotland, of course, we support children and young people through the children\u0026rsquos hearings system, where a tribunal of lay people make legally binding decisions about safety and welfare.  It is often the case that children and young people, who are encouraged to speak for themselves at hearings if they can, want what is not necessarily best for them. An example of this is contact with parents who may have abused or neglected them. Other times, parents will assert their right to see their child, even when that is not beneficial to the child\u0026rsquos welfare.  In recent years the children\u0026rsquos hearing system has become more frequently populated with solicitors as legal aid became easier to access. The solicitor is the only person in the room whose priority is not the child, but their client, when the child and the parent\u0026rsquos interests clash.  Social work and the family may be at complete loggerheads. The truth is a slippery thing and never straightforward but a panel must weigh up testimony, all the while remembering there is no dilemma as long as one keeps the child at the forefront of decision making.  It is necessary to ensure everyone involved is viscerally dedicated to ensuring child welfare. This means recruiting the right people and is where the recent children\u0026rsquos hearing recruitment campaign went so badly wrong. Panel members were portrayed in the adverts with halos.  Some panel members may see themselves as white knights but these are not the right people to be involved with the system. A panel member should not be there for the sake of an ego boost or the smug satisfaction a halo would imply.  If one group wears a halo, it implies others are lesser and that is completely against the spirit of the thing. It\u0026rsquos also a nonsense: none of us are angels, all of us have flaws. None of us are immune from mistakes.  The children\u0026rsquos panel system faces scrutiny. Perhaps one day it will be professionalised and the thought of volunteers making these life-altering decisions will be an anachronism.  For now, it is not angels watching over our young people. It must be humans who are sharp-thinking, thoughtful and, as in The Children\u0026rsquos Act, alert to centring the child at all times."},{"url":null,"title":"art group at inveruie clan","story":"        A new art group is being launched for anyone affected by cancer in Inverurie.

The group will be led by CLAN support volunteer, Helen London.        Helen said: “I paint and draw as a hobby and have found it be an absorbing and rewarding activity. The plan is for the group to have a go at creating their own paintings and drawings and we can try out ious mediums such as watercolours or pastels.”CLAN Cancer Support’s area coordinator for Inverurie, Fiona Cormack, said: “There is an existing craft group on the Thursday afternoon which meets weekly and has proved very popular.“This monthly art group will complement that and let people practise or try a new skill while meeting others who have been affected by cancer.”CLAN Inverurie offers information and support to people with a cancer diagnosis and their families.                                                                                                        The centre is open on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday providing one-to-one counselling, complementary therapies aimed at pain and stress relief, and ious activity and social groups.A coffee morning is held on the first Monday of the month.For more information please contact CLAN on 01224 647000 or visit clanhouse.org.

The Garioch Partnership had applied for a Community Asset Transfer in a bid to transform the Market Place School building into a third sector hub.                                                    However after discussing the plan at a meeting of the Garioch Area Committee on Tuesday, August 28, councillors decided to refuse the application.                                                    During the debate, councillors said that their decision was made as they felt the business case was not robust enough, that what the Partnership were prepared to pay was too low compared to the value of the estate, and the model by which they proposed operating it was not financially sustainable.        Members of the committee told the Partnership that this was not a straightforward decision, which was given the correct amount of scrutiny as a result. The debate referenced an amount of misinformation locally about the Community Campus and what it will provide.They stressed that the new facility will add more community space to the town, which can be used alongside the school, not in isolation.The perception that the community will only get access out with school hours is not the case, and the facility has been designed to ensure the community and school will use the premises side-by-side.                                                                                                         Speaking after the meeting, Garioch Area Committee Chair Cllr Fergus Hood said: “Committee took this decision today based on the application before us.“The application and business case we scrutinised did not fully articulate either the community or financial benefits of this transfer. “It is our view, and that of officers in their recommendations, that this application was not detailed enough, not fully thought-out and placed a number of expectations and burdens on Aberdeenshire Council.“The offer from officers and members still stands, we would like to work with the Garioch Partnership to find them a more suitable location for a third sector hub.                                                                                                        “We support the aspiration behind this application but we do not think that this application we saw today will fulfil this need.” Market Place School closed its doors in October last year and its pupils relocated to Uryside School.The town centre building has been vacant since.

Flu vaccination consent forms will be arriving home in school bags next week as the autumn term gets underway, which parents need to return within the seven-day window if they wish their child to be vaccinated.                                                    The safe and effective nasal vaccine is the best way to help protect children from flu - it only takes a few minutes and provides protection for around a year.        To date, more than 1.6 million doses of the nasal vaccine have been given to 2-11-year-olds in Scotland, and the vaccine will be offered to 400,000 primary aged children this year as part of the Scottish childhood immunisation programme.The Deputy Chief Medical Officer for Scotland has urged parents to consider getting their child vaccinated, not only to protect them, but to help stop the spread of the virus to others.Dr Gregor Smith, Deputy Chief Medical Officer for Scotland said: “Incidences of flu in Scotland rose last winter, which is why we’re advising people to get ready to fight flu ahead of winter hitting.“Flu can be serious, and can result in even healthy children being hospitalised. The vaccine remains the best way to protect your child against flu and its complications, and helps protect those around them who may be vulnerable to flu.                                                                                                        “Primary school children cannot receive their flu vaccination if a signed consent form isn’t returned, so I’d encourage parents to look out for it.

A language that official bodies such as the UNESCO insist has been dead since the 1800\u0026rsquos.\u0026ldquoIt wouldn\u0026rsquot be the first time UNESCO has prematurely pronounced a language as dead. Back in 2009 UNESCO declared Manx extinct despite there being over 1500 speakers of Manx.\u0026ldquoUNESCO was forced to change its classification of Manx from \u0026ldquoExtinct to \u0026lsquoEndangered\u0026rsquo after a group of school children wrote to them in Manx asking what language they were writing in if Manx didn\u0026rsquot exist.\u0026ldquoThe more people I talked to the more I came to find that Norn isn\u0026rsquot dead, it has just become lost in our English.

Some reports suggest it may be more than just a fanciful notion.When first contacted by Wick historian Harry Gray about the recent restoration of the \"Iron Wellie\", we had visions of a giant Wellington boot unearthed from the Caithness moors. That theory was firmly booted into touch after a visit to this unearthed marvel on the northern side of Wick Bay.The Iron Wellie is in fact a spring water well situated down a flight of recently restored Caithness flagstone steps close to the Soldiers\u0027 Tower on the North Head.Charlie Bain of Wick Paths Group explained how together with Denny Swanson, Tommy Munro and others from the Royal British Legion Scotland they recently restored the site of the spring.\"The steps down to it were overgrown and damaged,\" he said. \"We also replaced the pipe the water flows through and there is a marker stone at the top of the steps.\"Denny Swanson said he remembered bringing the water to his mother who suffered from arthritis for most of her life.\"She sent me down every second day for a bottle of \u0027Iron Wellie water\u0027, as she called it. She maintained it helped her arthritis and it certainly seemed to take some of her pain away.\"After Harry symbolically cut a ribbon of barricade tape the group, together with Charlie\u0027s dog Jet, went down for a taste of the water that many in the area depended on in bygone times. It is speculated that the inhabitants of nearby Tinkers\u0027 Cave would have consumed the water. The Wick worthy Tudor James resided close to the site and lived to a ripe old age.Harry said that the Iron Wellie was also known as the Chalybeate Spring and its taste has been described like \"sookin\u0027 pennies\".\"Chalybeate waters, also known as ferruginous waters, are mineral waters containing salts of iron \u0026ndash hence the local name Iron Wellie,\" he said.\"There is no written history of this well but it was certainly known in the 18th century and by the turn of the 20th century it was sometimes referred to as \u0027Jocky Simpson\u0027s Wellie\u0027. Who Jocky Simpson was, is lost in time.\"Harry said that \"generations of Wickers\" out for a walk along the braes or exiles home on holiday would nearly always stop for a drink from the wellie.\"We as youngsters firmly believed that the water did us good despite the taste and it was a welcome drink when playing around the North Head or when fishing or swimming from the rocks,\" he said.\"Young lads get hungry and we would sneak a turnip from Bob Cormack\u0027s field above the wellie, dock it on a stab [for the uninitiated that means removing the ends of the neep by striking it against a fence post] and we then cut off the skin and washed the neep in the Iron Wellie water before sitting on a rock and devouring it.\"Harry laughed at how present-day health and safety regulations would make drinking the water seem like a risky act \"but none of us became ill or died from it, perhaps proving the efficacy of the wellie\u0027s water\".Perhaps in the future Wick will host thousands of pilgrims queuing up for a taste of the rejuvenating powers of the Iron Wellie water.Saturday 1 Sep 2018 6:45

This partnership will help us to take our technology to a broader customer base and provides us with the manufacturing support and expertise we need.AMTE is a privately owned company and is the UK\u0026rsquos only volume cell manufacturing facility.Saturday 1 Sep 2018 6:46 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"New group set up to save Trinkie","story":"MEMORIES of the golden era of the Trinkie came flooding back this week when a new group was set up with the intention of restoring Wick\u0026rsquos famous outdoor pool to its former glory.From the reflections, you\u0026rsquod think people were talking of the sun-swept coast of Spain, or \u0026ndash more closely \u0026ndash the holiday camp pools of Butlin\u0026rsquos or the 1980s TV show Hi-de-Hi.A significant number of Wick residents turned up to the meeting at the Francis Street Club, where it was decided to form the Trinkie Heritage Preservation Group.A previous group was disbanded earlier this year, blaming a \u0026ldquolack of community support.Friends of the Trinkie said it had enjoyed maintaining the outdoor pool at Wick\u0026rsquos South Head over the years, and stressed that it had not been an easy decision.For years, the lido on the Pulteneytown seafront formed a communal gathering spot, not just where people learned to swim, but also for barbecues, get-togethers and family occasions. Local resident and self-professed \u0026ldquoTrinkie lover Bryan Newlands welcomed the group\u0026rsquos formation, underlining that the pool harboured a lot of memories. \u0026ldquoI used to go there a lot... Even though I lived on the other side of town, every summer myself and a friend would go \u0026ndash even when it was raining, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was a great place as the town didn\u0026rsquot have an indoor swimming pool until 1994. Many people learned to swim at the Trinkie.While a slideshow showed images of how the pool used to look and how much Wickers got from it, other more contemporary images show a dilapidated ruin \u0026ndash a far cry from the hustle, bustle and smiles of yesteryear.The new group was formed with a mission to \u0026ldquobring the pool back to life and a number of office-bearers were proposed and elected.James Bremner was elected chairman with other roles going to William Macdonald , Catherine Patterson  and Garance Warburton .Seven committee members were also elected: Fiona Bremner, Trudi Mcalpine, Davina Lyall, Fiona McPhee, Leslie Grant, Roddy Mackay and Councillor Willie Mackay.Ms Patterson underlined that it was going to be no easy fix as \u0026ldquothere are holes in the wall at the deep end, which also has cracks that go right down to the ground.\u0026ldquoThe previous group... had the holes patched up, but they kept reappearing, she said. \u0026ldquoThe wall itself is also crumbling and the bridge that divides the deep and shallow ends has had its fixtures corroded. Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because if nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Saturday 1 Sep 2018 6:46 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117256.jpg","title":"Norse era in Caithness was our very own Game of Thrones","story":"He has taken some of the most dramatic events from a time when the county was the southern part of the Orkney earldom and condensed them into a rollicking, fast-moving narrative in The Katanes Saga .It is based on a series of articles published in the John O\u0026rsquoGroat Journal over a decade ago, reinterpreting source material from ious sagas, and follows on from The Raven Banner, published in the mid-1990s and now out of print. Like that earlier work, The Katanes Saga is told in an unpretentious, engaging, sometimes blokey style. From the drunken arguments to the devious plots to the mutilations and killings, Cassells tells it like it is.\u0026ldquoThe Raven Banner was basically a guide to Norse Caithness with a little bit about each area and what I thought were the main things that happened in Norse times, he explains. \u0026ldquoThe Katanes Saga is far more in-depth.\u0026ldquoThey were people like you and me. They had the same faults. You could meet three Vikings in the pub any night.\u0026ldquoOne word I would use to describe the Norse is pragmatic. They were really pragmatic people. If that\u0026rsquos the way it works, that\u0026rsquos the way it works \u0026ndash if it doesn\u0026rsquot, I\u0026rsquoll do it my way.\u0026ldquoI do mention that of all the Norse earls of Orkney only a handful actually died in their beds. Most suffered violent deaths. One was killed with contact poison from his own auntie and mother on a shirt.Cassells  is a retired Royal Mail manager who previously worked as a lighthouse keeper on Muckle Flugga and Stroma. Those experiences inspired two other books, No More Paraffin-Oilers and A Light Walk.The Katanes Saga sees him returning to a theme that first sparked his interest at an early age. Born in Barrow, he moved to Thurso in late 1950s when his father came to work at the Admiralty test establishment.\u0026ldquoI always liked Greek and Roman mythology and I started reading about Norse mythology as well, he recalls. \u0026ldquoAs a young boy I lived in Sweyn Road in Thurso and I wondered who Sweyn was. A pal of mine said, \u0026lsquoAch, that\u0026rsquoll be Sweyn the pirate.\u0026rsquo So for about a year I had this happy vision of a Pugwash-type character that the street was named after. I then discovered Sweyn Asleifarson.Swyen , iously described \u0026ldquothe last of the Vikings and \u0026ldquothe greatest troublemaker in the westernlands, had an estate at Duncansby and was renowned for raiding, plundering and pillaging. One of the many who suffered at his hands was Frakokk, who had featured in the poisoned-shirt incident: she was burned to death in her farmhouse at Helmsdale, along with other members of her faction, in a revenge attack led by Swyen.It\u0026rsquos an example of the way in which many of the strands are intertwined, as Cassells points out.\u0026ldquoI read the sagas and I started taking a look at place names, he says. \u0026ldquoFor a long time I lived at Scrabster \u0026ndash Skarabolstadr, the \u0026lsquohomestead of the sea-mews\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoAnd the stories were interesting to read. They were intriguing.\u0026ldquoYou try and unravel it and it\u0026rsquos just more or less two families feuding all the way through it. That goes right to the very last act of the local earl being knifed in a beer cellar in Thurso.One of the most shocking events is the burning to death of Bishop Adam by a mob in Halkirk in a dispute over a butter tax.\u0026ldquoHe got a bit greedy, Cassells says. \u0026ldquoThey complained to the earl at the time who more or less said, \u0026lsquoDamn the bishop, you can burn him as you please,\u0026rsquo so they took him at his word.\u0026ldquoBishops crop up a couple of times. There was lot of enmity between the local Norse earldom and the Scottish king over bishops. A bishop got his eyes put out in Scrabster.\u0026ldquoAfter the bishop was murdered at Halkirk, the Scottish king came up here and carried out what was, for want of a better description, pure genocide of the people from the Halkirk area. I believe they were all massacred round about where the Pennyland estate is now in Thurso. Hundreds of people were killed there.\u0026ldquoIn those days you just didn\u0026rsquot go burning bishops \u0026ndash they\u0026rsquore going to come down heavy on you.\u0026ldquoRavenshill Road used to be known as the Gallows Hill, before the atomic houses were built there, so that has been a place for judicial executions for quite a long time.From the machinations of the \u0026ldquofemme fatale Ragnhild at Murkle to the murder of Earl Rognvald at Forsie to the Battle of Clairdon Hill outside Thurso, the power struggles and manoeuvrings come thick and fast. It\u0026rsquos a rapid-fire history lesson, but more than anything Cassells simply wants people to enjoy the stories.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a thing I never learned in school here. It was never mentioned, he says. \u0026ldquoThis is our own local history, and I just hope people think it\u0026rsquos a good read.The Katanes Saga  is self-published and is on sale in Caithness Horizons, newsagents in Thurso, and Wick Heritage Museum.Saturday 1 Sep 2018 6:46 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Open evening in Thurso for potential Childrens Panel members","story":"AN open evening is taking place next week with the aim of attracting volunteers for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel in Caithness.Tuesday\u0026rsquos event in Thurso will allow members of the public to find out how they can play a part in the children\u0026rsquos hearings system \u0026ndash helping others and giving something back to the community in the process.Volunteers from all walks of life make life-changing decisions that create a difference in the lives of many, and this is very true for children, young people and families in Caithness and across Scotland within the children\u0026rsquos hearing system.It relies on the voluntary involvement of around 2500 people who are willing and able to give their time and commitment to serve as Children\u0026rsquos Panel members.A number of agencies work together with the system to deliver protection, care and support to families, children and young people.

This is a deal with one of the biggest names in international air travel, and we see it as the start of a partnership that will develop into a full codeshare agreement later in the year.”Gokhan Haciibrahimoglu, general manager of Turkish Airlines Scotland said: “We are pleased to be working with Loganair for our flights operating from Edinburgh Airport, thus giving Turkish Airlines the opportunity to extend its network and better serve Scotland. Our partnership will allow both of our passengers to easily connect with the regional airports of North and West Scotland to over 304 destinations and 122 countries.”The move is the latest in Loganair’s Better Connected programme, which aims to provide the Scottish airline’s key destinations with a wide range of links both for local community travelling worldwide \u0026#8211 but just as importantly to also enable incoming visitors, whether for tourism or business, to enjoy ease of booking and ease of access.Deals have already been signed with Air France, Dutch giants KLM, Emirates, Thomas Cook Airlines, and customers can through-ticket and through-check baggage where flights connect at Glasgow, Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Inverness and Norwich. Single ticket booking for ongoing flights with more than one carrier offers multiple benefits including through check-in, protected connections in the event of delays and, importantly, the APD saving on flights from the Highlands and Islands which can be as much as £78 per person if connecting onwards to long-haul destinations.The partnerships with KLM and Air France allow passengers from all Loganair’s Highlands \u0026amp Islands destinations to travel via Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow or Inverness onto KLM flights to Amsterdam and from there to destinations worldwide and via Aberdeen and Edinburgh to Air France flights to Paris Charles de Gaulle and again onwards to destinations worldwide.The deal with Thomas Cook Airlines allows holiday connections from the Highlands and Islands via Glasgow to destinations including the USA, and the same will apply to Emirates services to the Middle East and to the Far East and Australia.The Thomas Cook partnership also provides long-haul connections from Inverness and Norwich via Manchester to destinations including New York, Los Angeles, Boston, San Francisco, Seattle, Orlando and Las Vegas on a single ticket.It also complements codeshare arrangements Loganair already has in place with British Airways and its partner airlines at Manchester, offering connectivity to transatlantic routes, including Chicago and Philadelphia, with onward connections throughout the US.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It sounds like a long time, but my experience of these things is that it catches up on you very quickly and there’s a lot of work to do between now and then.”Excellent communication and interpersonal skills, in addition to good team-working are vital attributes. However, notably, an interest in sport is not essential.The voluntary services of personnel with experience in event planning, fundraising and sponsorship, business and project management, procurement, marketing and PR, communication and strategic planning, are also being sought.Mr Deans added: “We’re looking for people with the skills, but they really need that long-term commitment and time to devote to this.”Recruitment information and an online application can be found at www.oiga.org.uk/organising-committee-recruitment-statement/For further information, and any queries, email info@oiga.org.uk.The deadline for applications is Saturday, September 29.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This allows our robust and oily new make spirit to gently mature over an extended period of time, delivering a full-on aromatic peat flavour with a surprisingly sweet finish.In Malt Advocate, John Hansell commented “Whiskies like this one remind me why I fell in love with whisky in the first place” and we know exactly what he means. There’s that fudgy sweetness that characterises the more mature Highland Park, but here it’s combined with complex aromatic spices as well as dark chocolate orange and floral peat notes. Dry at the finish, it leaves an aromatic smoky flavour and a mouth-watering hint of mild, salty sea spray – the result of 30 years’ maturation on Orkney’s windswept island environment.Average colour tint 23.3Nutmeg | Dark chocolate orange | Aromatic peat smoke | Sticky toffee pudding | Sea salt45.7%700ml A simple guide to appreciating the flavours and aromas.Highland Park offer a range of tours of their distillery along with tastings of their famous whiskies.

This will briefly divert cars onto the adjacent railway track and back again at set windows during the day when trains are not passing by.But motorists who miss one of the windows could face waits of up to two-and-a-half hours for the next one.And this has prompted Highland Council to urge drivers to make sure they plan their journey and allow enough travel time so they are not caught out.A council spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoWe have worked closely with Network Rail and our contractor TRAC Engineering Ltd to keep disruption to road users to a minimum when the road\u0026ldquoBut inevitably there will be times when road users will face longer waits \u0026ndash so we urge people to plan their travel carefully and avoid the periods when the diversion is not going to be available.During the works the road will be closed overnight to all traffic between the two gates between 10pm and 7am.Traffic control measures will operate between 7am and 10pm while the road-to-rail bypass is installed. This could take up to two weeks, but may be finished sooner.Once the temporary bypass is installed, the timetable of opening slots between trains will take effect.Cards showing details of the timetable that will be operating for the road to rail diversion have been distributed among local communities.Copies are also available at the Highland Council website by searching for Stromeferry Bypass at www.highland.gov.ukThe road-to-rail bypass will be available for use between 7am and 10pm, but only by traffic weighing less than seven-and-a-half tonnes .Traffic above those limits will have to divert along the A87, A82, A832 and A890.The council believes the restrictions and roadworks will be finished by November 24, when the A890 will fully reopen.Saturday 1 Sep 2018 6:46 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Local residents are digging in the last few metres of cable to more than 35 per cent of the properties.Community spokesman Steve Jones said: \"It\u0026rsquos a tremendously exciting time. Like many residents I\u0026rsquove only been getting very slow speeds capped at 0.5Mbps, making even the most basic of online activities difficult and frustrating, so looking forward to ultrafast speeds is fantastic.\"Fast, reliable broadband will bring huge potential to regenerate our scattered communities. It\u0026rsquos a prerequisite for attracting families and businesses to the area, where the population has fallen in recent years. People now expect good internet as a basic. In essence, it will help us to build a closer and more integrated community.\"Lesley Negri, who runs the historic Aultguish Inn near Garve with her husband Dario, added: \"It will make a huge difference to us, especially for our booking system and payments.\"At the moment everything slows down from 4pm and we can\u0026rsquot manage customer expectations. Many of our customers want to stream things or download photographs and it\u0026rsquos impossible to do that at the moment. We\u0026rsquove lived with slow broadband for so long that we can\u0026rsquot imagine what it\u0026rsquos going to be like when we can access ultrafast speeds!\"Saturday 1 Sep 2018 6:46 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Detailed measures will be presented next week.Leaders of the minority independent administration said every attempt would be made to minimise the impact on services but \u0026ldquosome impact on service is inevitable.Budget leader Alister Mackinnon said: \u0026ldquoOur  reserves of \u0026pound8 million are well below the minimum recommended by Audit Scotland and it\u0026rsquos vital that they\u0026rsquore not depleted further. The committee agreed stricter controls on recruitment and overtime, a review of all agency appointments and tighter controls on staff travel.The \u0026pound5.1 million figure equates to one per cent of the total budget and compares with a \u0026pound2.7 million estimate at this stage last year. The potential overspend is blamed on high cost placements for \u0026lsquolooked-after children\u0026rsquo, lower income from new parking charges and fewer savings from toilet closures because those two policies have not yet taken full effect.Council chiefs insisted no staff jobs were at risk.Finance director Derek Yule, however, warned there were \u0026ldquono more rabbits to be pulled from hats to tackle the problems.Black Isle Liberal Democrat Gordon Adam blamed Scottish Government grant cuts while SNP city councillor Richard Laird said the crisis was \u0026ldquoentirely of this council\u0026rsquos making.Council leader Margaret Davidson claimed local government services were \u0026ldquonot a priority for the Scottish Government.The budget leader angered the SNP benches, accusing group leader Maxine Smith of not fully participating in budget discussions. He said he invited her to meetings but had been turned down \u0026ldquobecause she views her private commitments more important than reorganising her diary.She was not in the chamber to respond. In a later statement she said: \u0026ldquoOn Friday, I received a request to attend a meeting on Monday to discuss the budget. I had commitments but they were pre-arranged meetings with constituents. I\u0026rsquove sent him a meeting request for tomorrow. I\u0026rsquom available any time, so hopefully he\u0026rsquoll re-arrange his diary. On the budget, our job in opposition is to scrutinise.A spokesman for the Scottish Government said: \u0026ldquoHighland Council has had more this year despite UK government cuts to our budget. It will receive over \u0026pound487 million Scottish Government funding in 2018-19.n Support was voiced for a city councillor who has quit as the SNP\u0026rsquos deputy leader on Highland Council.Richard Laird  cited health reasons for his decision. He will remain a Central Ward councillor. He said: \u0026ldquoMy health isn\u0026rsquot good enough. That\u0026rsquos the reason I\u0026rsquom stepping down. For the last year or so, both my physical health and my mental health have been in decline. I\u0026rsquove been told by the doctor to reduce my workload a bit.SNP group leader Maxine Smith said: \u0026ldquoI am saddened that Richard has had to step down as depute group leader, as we have worked well together. His illness has been creeping up on him for some time and he feels he needs time to rest, so removing the huge responsibility of chairing a strategic committee is a sensible thing to do. Richard will continue to be a valued member of our group.

Experts at the University of Edinburgh, working with the Wellcome Sanger Institute near Cambridge, announced that they have completed a project to sequence the golden eagle genome – the first time it has been done for the species.            The golden eagle is the first of 25 UK species to be sequenced in a project to learn more about the genetic make-up of animals including grey and red squirrels, robins and brown trout.            Those behind the project said there are around 300,000 golden eagles worldwide, with between 9,300-12,300 pairs living in Europe.Despite having widespread populations worldwide, the 508 breeding pairs in the UK are largely restricted to the Scottish Highlands and islands, and many existing world populations are said to be small and declining.Scientists from the university’s Royal  School of Veterinary Studies sent golden eagle samples to the institute.The sequencing teams then extracted DNA from the samples and used the latest technology to generate the reference genome.Project bosses said they believe the genome will help scientists and conservationists understand the diversity and viability of the species around the world.            They hope it will ultimately aid the monitoring of existing, reinforced and reintroduced populations of the birds, such as those in the South of Scotland Golden Eagle translocation project, which aims to bolster the protected species’ numbers.Dr Rob Ogden, head of conservation genetics at the university and a scientific adviser to the project, said: “With the golden eagle genome sequence, we will be able to compare the eagles being relocated to southern Scotland to those already in the area to ensure we are creating a genetically diverse population.“We will also be able to start investigating the biological effects of any genetic differences that we detect, not only within the Scottish population, but worldwide.”Professor Sir Mike Stratton, director of the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said: “We are delighted to announce that the golden eagle genome, the first species of the 25 Genomes Project, is complete.            “Using the biological insights we will get from the golden eagle genome, we can look to our responsibilities as custodians of life on this planet, and tend life on earth in a more informed manner using those genome sequences at a time when nature around us is under considerable pressure.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4792786.1535713335!/image/image.jpg","title":"jacob rees mogg scotland should be allowed to hold second independence referendum","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        Jacob Rees-Mogg has said Scotland should be allowed to hold a second referendum on independence \u0026#8211 but not for around 20 years.                The Conservative MP, who is one of the party’s most hard line Brexiteers, made the comments as he arrived in Scotland on a short speaking tour.            He said he agreed with Alex Salmond’s previous view that the 2014 vote on Scottish independence was a “once in a generation” decision which should not be revisited in the short term.            “Of course Scotland is entitled to have another referendum at some point in the future, but I think the SNP’s position of a ‘generation’ is a reasonable one – that it should be a generational decision,” he told the BBC. “A generational decision is not one made over two or three years.”READ MORE: Flashback: When Jacob Rees-Mogg campaigned in Fife with his nannyHe added that 20 years was a more realistic timeframe for another vote on Scottish independence, meaning that it would not take place until nearly 2040. Mr Rees-Mogg also said he was in favour of more powers being devolved to Scotland in the wake of Brexit, but not over the key areas of trade or immigration.

Despite their different political backgrounds, Mr Rees-Mogg also praised the Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson, tipping her as a future leader of the UK party.“I think Ruth Davidson is a brilliant, charismatic and capable political figure, I admire her hugely,” he said.“She will at some future date make a wonderful leader, both as First Minister in Scotland and in due course leader of the Conservative Party in England. She is a wonderfully capable person.”READ MORE: Richard Leonard: Mediocre SNP too timid to stand up to Tory austerityAn SNP spokeswoman said: “The fact that right-wing, extreme Brexiteer Tories like Jacob Rees-Mogg are seeking to dictate to the people of Scotland shows exactly why decisions about Scotland should be taken in Scotland and not at Westminster.            “The SNP’s 2016 manifesto clearly set out the case for a second independence referendum if there was a ‘significant material change in circumstances that prevailed in 2014, such as Scotland being taken out of the EU against our will’ – a position that has subsequently been backed by a majority of MSPs in the Scottish Parliament.“As the deeply damaging consequences of Brexit become clearer, and as Scotland’s economy continues to outperform the UK, it’s no wonder that people like Jacob Rees-Mogg are rattled at the prospect of people once again discussing the immense opportunities of Scottish independence.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4783471.1534192405!/image/image.jpg","title":"chris bambery how scotland s own occupy movement took over edinburgh 80 years ago","story":"        Frustration and anger at rising inequality is nothing new, as a largely forgotten chapter of Scotland\u0026#8217s history of protest shows, writes Chris Bambery                In June 1933, for three days and nights, jobless protesters occupied the centre of Edinburgh, sleeping out on Princes Street under the windows of the city elite’s gentlemen’s clubs.            An army of the unemployed descended on Edinburgh from all corners of Scotland. With them were bands, field kitchens and banners. Each marcher had a knapsack and blanket. The goal of the marchers was to meet with Sir Godfrey Collins, Secretary of State for Scotland, to demand the abolition of the means test, increased relief for men, women and children and for work schemes to provide jobs. The city authorities made it clear the marchers were not welcome and they would provide no accommodation or food.            The march was organised by the Communist-led National Unemployed Workers Movement , whose Scottish organiser was the veteran agitator, Harry McShane, but it won support from the Independent Labour Party, the trade unions and Labour Party. The Aberdeen and Dundee contingents marched south to join with the Fife contingent in Kirkcaldy. The Ayrshire contingent joined with Lanarkshire marching via Shotts and East Calder. The Renfrewshire and Dunbartonshire contingents, including a women’s section marched via Glasgow, Coatbridge, Airdrie, Bathgate, and Broxburn. The main Glasgow contingent marched to Kilsyth and Falkirk, where they joined with Stirlingshire, and onto Edinburgh via Bo’ness.READ MORE: Video: Rare footage of Edinburgh in the 1930sOn Sunday 12 June, they joined up in Costorphine for their entry into the capital. The next day 20,000 people greeted them at the Mound. The first sign of a thaw on the part of the authorities was when the Ministries of Labour, Health and Education agreed to meet delegations of marchers. But there was still no reply from Collins. A second victory was when the police lifted a ban on street collections. But Collins refused to meet with them.The NUWM members paraded through the royal palace of Holyrood with their band playing ‘The Internationale’ and other socialist tunes, and when the city council refused to provide accommodation their leader, Harry McShane, said they’d sleep on the pavement of Princes Street, the city’s most prestigious thoroughfare, as marcher William McVicar recalled: “I think someone offered us somewhere [to sleep] like Waverley Market or somethin’. And McShane and them wouldn’t accept that, they says, ‘No, no, we’re not going there.’ So they says, ‘Oh well, we cannae give you anything else.’ And of course he says, ‘Right we’ll sleep in Princes Street.’” The Edinburgh Evening News reported McShane telling the marchers as they gathered on the south side of Princes Street: “So far here we are and here we stay until another decision is reached. We can breakfast, dinner or tea here, and the men require a rest. They can have that rest in Princes Street. We have decided to give them a long lie in ‘bed’ this morning.” The Edinburgh Dispatch caught the mood among the ordinary folk of Edinburgh as they made thier way along Princes Street on that first morning: “Walking along on the carriageway one heard snatches of conversation: ‘Slept well?’ ‘How did ye enjoy yer feather bed?’ ‘Did ye feel a draught coming in during the night?’”            On the first morning, women marchers blocked the tramway while men shaved using their reflections in the windows of the big department stores. Tom Ferns remembers: “And they couldnae ha’ picked a better spot than Princes Street. Under the Conservative Party headquarters, the Liberal Party headquarters and the big luxury hotels, here was hundreds and hundreds o’ angry unemployed. Obviously a sight like that is not seen every day, particularly in the capital city of Edinburgh.”READ MORE: Astonishing press photographs capture interwar-era EdinburghAnother marcher, James Allison, said, “the police were going mad”. Yet Edinburgh police were not keen on inciting a pitched battle as Hugh Sloan recalled: “At dinner time, our field-kitchen came along and the police chief told Harry McShane, ‘This is Princes Street, you can’t feed here.’ Harry told them, ‘It was good enough for us to sleep here, it’s good enough for us to feed here.’” The marchers then demanded free transport home. Eventually the city’s chief constable and deputy town clerk told them they would provide transport if McShane guaranteed there would be no more marches to Edinburgh. He refused and the chief constable, worried about disturbances on the capital’s streets, backed down. Transport was then provided to take the marchers home.            On the last night, the marchers and their supporters gathered to burn an effigy of Sir Godfrey Collins before boarding buses and a final meal paid for by the city council. The march organisers refused to give a guarantee that no further hunger marchers would defile the city!Throughout the 1930s, the unemployed protested but the NUWM also organised children’s parties in the summer and at Christmas. A number of the marchers would go on to fight in the Spanish Civil War, including the leader of the Aberdeen contingent, Bob Cooney.The inter-war period, not just the “Hungry Thirties”, was grim in Scotland. Prior to the First World War, it had been at the cutting edge of British industry. Within a few years of the wars end the traditional industries, coal, steel and shipbuilding were in trouble. Scottish banks and companies were bought up by their bigger English rivals. Unemployment was a permanent feature, peaking in the 1930s and only ending with the demands of the Second World War.The shale mining industry collapsed, for example, as cheap imported oil cut demand for paraffin. In December 1925, “The Scotsman” reported from Tarbrax, a shale mining village then in South Lanarkshire under the headline “Situation at Tarbrax: Faced With Starvation,” which reported: “Workers from Tarbrax, to the number of nearly 400, marched in procession to Carnwath, nearly ten miles distant, on Thursday night last for the purpose of asking poor relief. Relief under the emergency clause of the Poor Law Act, which enables people in a state of absolute destitution to get relief, has been given to a number of people in Tarbrax on the recommendation of the doctor there. A meeting of Carnwath Parish Council has been called for today to consider the whole situation.”  Starvation – it’s a strong word. My father was little over a year old when the mine at Tarbrax shut. His father would have been on that cold December march before briefly finding work at another pit nearby, then giving up and coming to Edinburgh in search of work. He was without a permanent job until the end of the 1930s.

What did you want to be when you grew up?             I dreamed of becoming a vet, after a summer visit to my aunt and uncle who live on a horse farm in the US and run a veterinary hospital. Age six, watching my Uncle Lenny stick his gloved hand into a horse to check on the position of a soon-to-be-born foal seemed somehow to be an unimaginably glamorous career path.            Combine that with a love for the 1980s TV series All Creatures Great and Small and the scene was set: I was going to be a female James Herriot with a successful small animal practice in the Yorkshire Dales.There was only one problem, which I didn’t really admit to myself until a few years later – I didn’t really like animals that much. I was also, though I hated to acknowledge it, a little scared of them, particularly the ones with teeth. I would have made a terrible vet. I later switched my allegiances to the written word and by the age of ten, had decided my destiny was in journalism. Unusually, apparently, I somehow seem to have stuck with it. A report out this week listed journalism as one of those professions which people ranked as their top ambitions when they were children – along with fashion model and private investigator – but which they quickly ditched in favour of a more “sensible” career when they grew up.The survey, from jobs website Indeed, also found that horticulturalists, wine tasters and wedding planners make the list of things that young people thought they might do, but that were quickly ditched in favour of more practical options as they got older.Some, of course, such as my colleague Kevan – who put journalistic dreams on hold from the age of 16, but finally got his first newspaper job aged 37 – have been lucky enough to end up working in their chosen profession. My friend Tamsyn based her teenage career choice on fellow Scot Anna, a character in 1990s TV series This Life, played by Daniela Nardini – and stuck with it. “I wanted to be a lawyer, like Anna in ‘This Life’,” she explained. “I am a lawyer and I still have a haircut influenced by Anna’s, so I think that’s a win.”            READ MORE: Jane Bradley: The struggle to build futuristic cities that people likeSometimes, of course, life throws up opportunities that people would never otherwise have considered – or known about. A lot of career choices are made through basic opportunity – or lack thereof. In the area I grew up in, almost everyone worked in the chemical industry: either as engineers or on the plant floor. Outside of that, other people had normal jobs which have to exist everywhere: in retail, the service sector, teaching, medicine. It was only when I went to university that I became aware that other people  did things for a living that I’d never even heard of: advertising executives, marketing managers, charity fundraisers. If I’d known they existed earlier, they may well have been part of my long-term plan.When he was five, my friend John told his sister that he wanted to become a cow when he grew up. It is possible that he was talking of a cow of the pantomime iety, as in his teens he embraced a passion for acting and even finished drama school – only to become embroiled in a summer charity aid programme which took him to eastern Europe, where he has lived, working in ious capacities, for the majority of the past two decades.My former university flatmate, Mike, on the other hand, dreamed of being editor of the Beano, postponed his degree for a year to play in a semi-successful rock band in Italy, and has now finally settled down in Singapore, where he works in sales for a sports media team.            Is he happy with his choice? He says so, though I secretly wonder whether he is holding out hope that he will one day scoop the top job which will allow him to decide on the adventures of Dennis and Gnasher and hand out badges for the Beano fan club.READ MORE: Jane Bradley: Pioneeer of AI will be turning in his graveOliver hoped to become an architect, but his musical talent took over and he was forced to put aside a stable career – still dabbling design on the side – to front one of the UK’s most successful cover bands.Others have realised their childhood dreams, even if it has taken years to do so. In fact, I am impressed at how many of my friends say they have achieved the ambitions they set for themselves as youngsters. Laura wanted to be a dancer and, at the age of 20, scooped a job at the Moulin Rouge in Paris. Jayne wanted to be a photographer or a steam train driver. After a lengthy career in photography, she is now in training to drive steam engines in her spare time, complete with fetching boiler suit and flat cap.            Edinburgh-based author Alison Belsham tells me she harboured ambitions to be a tap dancer for much of her youth, but found herself somewhat hampered by her two left feet. “I did it at school, but I was absolutely hopeless,” she admits. “But I also wanted to be a writer, which I have just achieved.”Even some of those who have made a long and successful career out of a non-practical job had to wait it out before they achieved their goal. Actor Hugh Jackman, best known for playing Wolverine in the X-Men movies was employed as a PE teacher at an English public school, while Whoopie Goldberg worked as a beautician in a morgue before shooting to fame as one of the world’s best-known actresses.The Indeed report claims that more people are returning to jobs relating to an interest, passion and hobby, with just 12 per cent of those surveyed saying that salary was a major factor in their chosen profession.When I told my veterinarian aunt that I was writing this column, she admitted that she, too, was scared of dogs as a child – and suffered further setbacks after being told by a 1960s headmistress that a girl could not study veterinary medicine. Maybe there’s still hope for me yet."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4793199.1535733881!/image/image.jpg","title":"john mclellan alex salmond s reputation is already in tatters","story":"        Ex-First Minister Alex Salmond\u0026#8217s RT show and decision to crowdfund legal challenge speak volumes about him, writes John McLellan.                Having looked back at the way the SNP has handled recent allegations against a clutch of its elected members, I wrote a short article for Thursday’s Edinburgh Evening News which concluded that ex-First Minister Alex Salmond should have voluntarily suspended his SNP membership while facing allegations of sexual harassment.            “Mr Salmond could have saved the First Minister the embarrassment of having to justify the party’s decision [not to suspend him] by suspending himself,” I wrote. “Without admitting guilt, that would have shown real responsibility, humility and leadership.”            Not that Mr Salmond gives two hoots what I think, or anyone else for that matter, but when I heard late on Wednesday night he had indeed resigned from the SNP I had a brief moment of panic because the article had been overtaken by events, followed by some relief that at least I’d called it correctly.Well, almost correctly. It was already too late to show responsibility and leadership, given we know now that he’d known about the allegations for some months and had regular discussions with First Minster Nicola Sturgeon about them. Humility? Mr Salmond doesn’t do humility and I didn’t really expect him to resign his membership. And sure enough launching a crowd-funding appeal to pay for his judicial review of the Scottish Government process and tying it in with the independence cause was anything but humble and fanned the flames beneath Nationalist conspiracy theories, as if that was necessary.“I will continue to serve the independence movement in whatever role and whatever capacity I can,” he said on his crowd-funding page. No surprise there, but what followed was a clear attempt to conflate the cause and his own situation. “It is a rare thing to be devoted to a cause more important than any individual, it is a precious thing to cherish it and my intention now – as it has always been – is to protect and sustain that cause.”READ MORE: SNP ‘pretty united’ after Alex Salmond resignation, says Ian BlackfordWhether this produces a long-term damaging split in the SNP remains to be seen, but there were enough pledges of to hit the £50,000 target within hours and, at time of writing, the fund was approaching £100,000 with over 4,000 donors. Mr Salmond has only given a vague promise to use the excess to “support good causes in Scotland and beyond”, but the use of “support” rather than “donate” is intriguing. Those who trouser up might want to ask how the rest of the money will be spent, in case “good causes beyond” means more trade trips to Iran with Tasmina Ahmed-Sheik.            Mr Salmond is, of course, innocent of the harassment allegations until proven guilty, but his reputation is being wrecked by his own actions. Ill-judged performances at the Edinburgh Fringe last year, the cringe-worthy show on Russian propaganda channel RT, and now the abuse of the independence movement to raise money on the pretext that this affair is about more than the proper investigation of serious allegations are not the actions of the self-aware. Yet he had it in his grasp to become a respected elder statesman after what few could deny was a spectacularly successful political career. Years ago, Mr Salmond gave up his horse-racing column for this newspaper because he felt it was incompatible with the need, as he put it, to be seen as an “homme serieux”. Clearing his name of the harassment allegations is one thing, but his reputation as a serious man of keen judgement may be smashed forever.

The city council is currently advertising a total of 31 vacant teaching posts, involving a range of subjects and including one for a headteacher.            Lothian Conservative MSP Miles Briggs said the number of teaching vacancies meant other teachers were having to cover extra classes on top of the ones they had already and claimed there would be a knock-on effect on pupils.            He said the teacher shortage came at a time when \u2028Education Secretary John Swinney had warned that Scotland was facing “a very challenging period in education”.But council chiefs played down the number of vacancies and said when previous posts were advertised there had been a good response.Earlier this month, Mr Swinney insisted there was no crisis in morale among Scottish teachers despite complaints about punishing workloads and low pay.He said: “I don’t think we have a crisis in morale. I think what we have got is a very challenging period in education where we have some staff shortages.Mr Swinney said the last survey of vacancies suggested Scotland as a whole was about 800 teachers short across the country.            Mr Briggs said the Capital’s vacancies should have been tackled before the schools returned on 14 August after the summer holidays.He said: “Edinburgh parents that I have spoken to would really have liked more to have been done to fill these positions before the start of term to minimise any disruption to classes.“Hard working teachers are being asked to cover even more classes because SNP have proven again that they are not capable of managing workforces effectively.“This will unfortunately have a knock-on effect for pupils because of disruptions within schools and teachers being spread more thinly.”            City education convener Councillor Ian Perry said: “We don’t have a major issue in Edinburgh with teacher recruitment, as shown earlier this year when our recruitment campaign for 34 posts attracted over 557 applications.“We currently have 31 vacancies advertised out of a total of 3,500 teacher positions which is less than 1 per cent of the total number of teachers.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4793326.1535748592!/image/image.jpg","title":"stars turn out to say a little prayer for the queen of soul","story":"        An all-star line-up of mourners filled a Detroit church with prayers and songs yesterday for Aretha Franklin\u0026#8217s funeral, honouring her not just as the Queen of Soul but also as a lifelong friend, family member, churchgoer and activist.                 Guests at the Greater Grace Temple included former president Bill Clinton, former first lady Hillary Clinton, the Reverend Jesse Jackson, Stevie Wonder and Motown legend Smokey Robinson.             Robinson remembered first hearing Aretha Franklin play piano when he was just eight and their remaining close for the rest of her life, talking for hours at a time. “You’re so special,” he said, before crooning a few lines from his song Really Gonna Miss You.             “Really gonna miss you, really gonna be different without you,” he sang. Expected to last several hours, the service encompassed many elements, emotions and grand entrances that were hallmarks of her more than six decades on sacred and secular stages. It was a send-off both grand and personal. Ariana Grande sang one of the Queen of Soul’s biggest hits,  A Natural Woman, and Faith Hill performed What a Friend We Have In Jesus. The Aretha Franklin Orchestra performed a medley featuring I Say a Little Prayer, Angel and other songs the Queen of Soul was known for, along with gospel numbers I Love the Lord and Walk in the Light. Barbara Sampson read a statement from former president George W Bush, saying that Franklin would continue to inspire future generations. Reverend Al Sharpton read a statement from former president Barack Obama, saying that Franklin’s “work reflected the very best of the American story.” Sharpton received loud cheers when he criticised President Donald Trump for saying the singer “worked for” him as he responded to news of her death. “She performed for you,” Sharpton said of Franklin, who sang at Trump-owned venues. “She worked for us.”             Franklin’s body arrived in a 1940 Cadillac LaSalle hearse."},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen  and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory.

Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"lpa chief announces plans to retire ","story":"Sandra Laurenson is to retire as chief executive at Lerwick Port Authority in November after more than 40 years of service.\nThe LPA has announced Captain Calum Grains will succeed her.\nThe management changes at the Shetland port have been announced by the Authority following its August board meeting.\nMs Laurenson said: “I am delighted that Calum is succeeding me as chief executive, with all the benefits of continuity to such an interesting job.\n\u0026#8220He will very much enjoy, as I have, the support of a great team at the port, as well as that of all the customers who keep the ‘top port’ going,” she said.\n• For full story, see tomorrow\u0026#8217s Shetland Times.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"feast of film kicks off with parade to cinema ","story":"The 12th Screenplay film festival officially launched on Saturday with a parade from the Market Cross to Mareel.\nWeather was less than favourable for the high-spirited march to the cinema, an annual fixture of the Shetland Arts\u0026#8217 organised festival.\nDinosaurs leading the march from the Market Cross to Mareel.

It was installed in 1970 and we have to ensure that we can continue to provide clean, safe, fresh drinking water to our customers locally in the years ahead.\"\nWhile just a trickle of villagers attended the four-hour drop-in session, the development team considered it a fair proportion of the local population, especially as the community council was represented during the consultation exercise.\n\"The feedback so far has been good and very useful and we have discussed ious questions and concerns and the process is now under way.\"\nOne of the early callers to study the plans was former community council chairman Bill Carr, who told the Strathy: \"While larger than the current plant, the new buildings do look more \u0027integrated\u0027 and assuming the old site is cleared and landscaped \u0026ndash as they say it will be \u0026ndash this should be good news for Dalwhinnie.\n\"It will be especially good news if there\u0027s some tree-planting around the new works.\n\"And the community could possibly acquire the old site as a village resource. A car park, for example, would be a major benefit, although that would of course be a question for the current community council to consider.\"\nAlso there to view the proposals was local Highland councillor Muriel Cockburn, who heard that the new works would have capacity to produce up to 200,000 litres of drinking water per day, supplied by an \"abundant source of raw water from the River Spey\".\n\"It all looks like a major improvement,\" she said, as she surveyed the old treatment works \u0026ndash mere yards from the disused compound where A9 mega pylon workers had been based until a few years ago.\nConcerns have long been raised over that particular eyesore but hopes are high now that a new tenant will be moving in soon to make use of the building.\nFull details of that particular development are still awaited.\nBut if the Scottish Water team win through on schedule, their new treatment works would be installed between the two old buildings.\n\"Obviously we will have to go on using the old treatment works while we construct the new system,\" explained project manager Debbie Henderson. \"But once in place the village will have a new works to look at.\n\"It will actually include two new buildings, which will be prefabricated and delivered to the site from Ross-shire Engineering\u0027s factory in Muir of Ord.\"\nGeorge Phimister, the company\u0027s senior project manager, explained: \"The main treatment process involved passing the raw water through a series of membranes which filter out larger organic compounds while allowing clean water molecules to pass through very fine pores.\n\"The water that has passed through the membranes is then treated further to ensure that it meets customers\u0027 expectations and remains safe to drink all the way to the tap.\"\nThe system will involve new piping from bore holes to a storage tank to the north of the village.\nMr Steel explained: \"Having gathered local feedback we will consider the comments will later advise customers when we are submitting our planning application.\n\"Subject to being granted approval, we anticipate being on site in early 2019, with work continuing into 2020.\"\nSaturday 1 Sep 2018 6:47 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117295.jpg","title":"Lack of 999 cover for busy Harley weekend","story":"Gavin Musgrove\n\u0026nbsp\nAVIEMORE was covered by only a single-manned ambulance for most of the Harley Davidson Thunder in the Glens rally, it has emerged.\nIt means that a casualty could be attended to but not taken to Raigmore Hospital in Inverness in the event of an emergency until a second ambulance crew had arrived at the scene.\nIt is understood the village only had an ambulance with single crew rather than double crew available last Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday until 5pm.\nThere were an estimated 3000 motorcyclists in the area for the UK\u0027s biggest Harley rally.\nGMB Scotland also said Kingussie only had a single manned crew in operation from just after midnight on Thursday until Sunday morning.\nThe union said the situation is simply not acceptable and poses a real danger.\nAlong with the Strathy, the GMB has been calling for the Scottish Ambulance Service to get rid of the current on-call system and to replace it with 24/7 shifts to bring the Aviemore base into line with most other stations in Scotland.\nJohn Marr, GMB branch secretary, said: \"Only a first responder service would have been able to be provided by an ambulance with single crew.\n\"This would have involved looking after the casualty at the location until back up arrived.\n\"We think it is dangerous and we are stepping up our calls on the government to provide the Scottish Ambulance Service with the funds required to give Badenoch and Strathspey the service the area deserves.\n\"At the moment we are going round in circles asking why there is no 24/7 cover despite Aviemore being one of the busiest tourism spots in the whole of Scotland.\n\"We have repeatedly informed the Scottish Ambulance Service that this is a dangerous situation but nothing is happening.\"\nHighland Council convener and local councillor Bill Lobban, said: \"The current level of ambulance cover is clearly completely unacceptable.\n\"Given our population added to the huge number of visitors we see on a daily basis the Scottish Ambulance Service needs to make sure we have sufficient staff on duty to provide a safe and effective service.

state of emergency \"reserve\" funds of only \u0026pound8 million, warning there were \"no more rabbits to be pulled from hats\" to solve the problem.\nPolitical rivals then locked horns in an unprecedented clash in the chamber at Inverness headquarters.\nLiberal Democrat Gordon Adam blamed successive Scottish Government grant cuts for the council\u0026rsquos financial woes.\nSNP city

surprised by the scale of projected overspend. To put things into context, he said \u0026pound5.1 million equated to only one per cent of the total budget.\nBut he added: \"I have no more rabbits to pull out of the hat to help.

Cllr Smith was not in the chamber to respond.\nSNP group finance spokesman Ian Cockburn rose to his feet, accusing the budget leader of being \"out of order\" with his attack.\nCllr Mackinnon ordered him to sit down, insisting that he was chairing the meeting.\n\"You\u0026rsquove had umpteen opportunities to come back to discuss alternative savings with us, and to date you have not taken advantage of that,\" he said.\nIn a statement, Cllr Smith later said: \"Late afternoon on Friday I received a meeting request to attend a meeting on Monday to discuss the budget.\n\"Of course I already had commitments but they weren\u0026rsquot \u0026lsquopersonal\u0026rsquo although even if they were it\u0026rsquos none of his business.

There is certainly great excitement surrounding them and anticipation is high amongst both band and audience.\n“The Stirling concerts will be celebrations of our long musical journey, albeit tinged with the realisation that these are farewell appearances and so naturally emotions will be high – this is something we experienced recently at the farewell concerts in England and Europe – all spectacular events but nevertheless very moving.\n“We’ve been overwhelmed by the response to the announcement of the Stirling concerts – all the positive comments, the stories about what our music has meant to so many people, the sadness as the end approaches. But overall there will be a huge amount of love and positivity at Stirling and that’s what will carry everyone through these days ahead.\u0026#8221\nJones has been with Runrig all his adult life, having first joined the band on stage as a 17-year old at a dance in Portree’s Skye Gathering Hall in late 1977. He hopes the set list – which will be lengthy – will give a full reflection of the groups’s journey from a three -piece Scottish dance band playing island village halls to one which has sold out major venues across Scotland and Europe.\nHe said: “Compiling a set list is always a dilemma, with such a large back catalogue to choose from. Of course, there are certain songs that have to be included, otherwise we’d be lynched – but it’s also nice to pick some lesser-performed songs, possibly giving them a fresh twist.\n“Our set will be a good bit longer than usual – the problem was trying to keep the length down to sensible proportions – in essence, it will hopefully represent the band’s whole career, a celebration of our music and the unique bond with our audience.”\n century – the history of their native communities has shaped Runrig’s lyrics and songs. Jones believes that staying true to their roots – fusing them with the popular rock and pop influences they listened to in their teenage bedrooms \u0026#8211 has made sure the band’s popularity has endured through the generations.\n“We’ve been fortunate that throughout our long career we’ve continually gained new fans of all ages, at home and abroad, which has sustained us, even as fashions come and go around us,” he adds. “I guess there must be something in the lyrics, the melodies and the ethos of the band that has attracted such loyalty amongst fans, something universal that transcends our shared background in the heartland of the Highlands and connects with the wider world.”\nAuthenticity has been the hallmark of a band which can essentially still trace its origins to the three Portree streets of Fraser Crescent, Kitson Crescent, and Balmoral Road.\nThe original Run-rig dance band was founded by the Skye-raised sons of North Uist Calum and Rory MacDonald, along with Blair Douglas in 1973, and a year later the trio were joined by Donnie Munro, who became the band’s singer for more than two decades. Munro, who left in 1997 and was replaced by Canadian singer Bruce Guthro, will be on stage as a special guest this weekend.\n\nJones’ hopes for a legacy of music that people can continue to enjoy, and be inspired by, seem assured.\nHe adds: “Even though the band’s touring and performing life will have finished, I hope that people will continue to enjoy and discover our music for many years to come, perhaps giving inspiration to musicians that will follow on from us, in the knowledge that if you stick to your own path, be true to your musical roots and retain an open mind, great things may happen.”\nAs for the future – the band say it might be the end for Runrig, but it won’t mean retirement or the end of their music-making careers.\nSaid Jones: “The first thing to say is that there will be a long wind-down period – for instance we’ll film and record Stirling, so that will have to be worked on and brought to some sort of completion, plus there is the whole ongoing administration of the band archive and legacy which may lead to some interesting sideline projects.\n“Beyond that, we’ll all still be involved with our own individual performing, writing and music-making projects – that’s something you never retire from.\n“Personally, I’ll miss the band dreadfully but on the positive side I’ll spend more time on Skye plus I’ll have time to learn some new accordion tunes!”\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Run-Rig-1977-ADJUST-e1534430676612.jpg","title":"oidhche mhath runrig whfp editorial 24 8","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n night spoke for the Highlands.\nThe unassuming Malcolm has often been a coolly detached figure on stage, concentrating solely on his guitar.\nBut he has been playing with the Run Rig Dance and Ceilidh Band since he was 17 years old and he is now in his 60th year.

Runrig and the legacy of fresh Gaelic musical talent that came in their wake are now bigger than their Highland infancy.\nBut whenever you listen to a Runrig song, there will always be an echo of that dance hall accordion, of Robert MacDonald, of Blair Douglas, of the island fan base that sent them on their way.\nIn the words of the title of their first, vinyl, album, they will always Play Gaelic.\n\u0026nbsp\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-visitorthebest-360px_Page_4.jpg","title":"uig to tarbert service delayed due to medical","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nThe 2.10 pm sailing from Uig, Skye to Tarbert, Harris on Wednesday  was delayed due to a medical emergency.\nThe announcement was posted on the CalMac Service Info Twitter account around 2.45 pm, and a further post has since stated that subsequent sailings will be delayed.

Arising out of the local experience of sectarian discrimination, the march helped to set in train a series of events that would change Irish politics forever.\nNationalists in the Six Counties had begun to explore new ways of highlighting the reality of discrimination. They had looked to Governments in Dublin for decades but found little help there. The IRA’s Resistance Campaign had ended in 1962, having failed heroically against the overwhelming military superiority of the British Army and RUC. However, the imposition of internment without trial, the banning of Sinn Féin and the use of the B Specials as a rural terror force, all exposed the violence that lay beneath the surface of the Orange state. \n which read: ‘Protestant girl required for housework. Apply to the Hon. Mrs. Terence O’Neill...’\n\nFive years after O’Neill’s accession nothing had changed. Unemployment and emigration among Catholics was far higher than among their Protestant neighbours. In County Tyrone, with a population of just over 73,000 Catholics to 60,500 Protestants, there were only 52 Catholics employed in local government as against 300 Protestants. Such discrimination was highlighted by the Campaign for Social Justice established by Patricia and Conn McCluskey in Dungannon in 1964. \nParallel with these developments, the IRA and Sinn Féin were rethinking their strategy with more emphasis to be placed on open campaigning against injustice in the North. The Wolfe Tone Society was established as a forum for debate and to circumvent the Stormont ban on the Republican Clubs, the name which, in turn, had been adopted to evade the ban on Sinn Féin. Members of the Wolfe Tone Society, the Campaign for Social Justice and others were involved in the formation of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association  in February 1967.\nIt was direct action on the ground that propelled the nascent Civil Rights Movement onto the streets. The Brantry Republican Club in County Tyrone had campaigned for council housing to be built but when 15 houses were built in Caledon only one of them was allocated to a Catholic. The house next door was allocated to a single Protestant woman, the secretary of a unionist politician. \nLocal people decided to protest. The main organiser was Annie Mary  Gildernew, grandmother of Sinn Féin\u0027s Michelle Gildernew. Over a period of several months in 1967/68 a local family and supporters occupied a house in the Caledon estate. When they were evicted the case was raised in Stormont and began to make headlines beyond Tyrone. This was the spur for the march from Coalisland to Dungannon which received the endorsement of NICRA. \n\n\nIn a pattern that was to become all too familiar in the months ahead, Ian Paisley organised a counter-demonstration for Market Square in Dungannon. This was then used as a pretext by the RUC to ban the NICRA parade from the Square. \nAbout 2,500 took part in the NICRA march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon. The main speaker was Austin Currie MP, later a Fine Gael TD. Also speaking was Gerry Fitt, West Belfast MP. Fitt who, years later, was lifted into the House of Lords by Margaret Thatcher, declared that they would go on until they had “Civil Rights and a 32-County Republic”.\nBut the real leaders of the Civil Rights Movement which began that day were the rank and file, the ordinary people of Tyrone and beyond who marched for justice and freedom. \nThe first Civil Rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon was held on 24 August 1968, 50 years ago this week.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27459  ","story":"Sinn Féin spokesperson for Business, Innovation and Enterprise Maurice Quinlivan TD\n Callum Smyth\n\n“The government is currently missing its own targets when it comes to reforming the apprenticeship system.

In 2017 just 391 people took part in newly establishedapprenticeship programmes, compared to the government’s target of 800.\n “Inaddition, only nine of the promised fifteen new apprenticeship programmes wereintroduced last year.”\n SinnFéin has also outlined the benefits of an all-Ireland apprenticeship system andthe benefits that would come with including trade unions in the development andgovernance of the programmes. The document reiterates Sinn Féin’s aim toabolish student contribution fees for apprentices and details how the partywill promote apprenticeship programmes as another tertiary education choice.\n Apprenticeshipis a tried and proven way for employers to develop highly skilled workers fortheir company and industry by using a mixture of coursework and practical onthe job learning. Record numbers of students are attending third leveleducation, but with this route not being suitable for everyone, Sinn Féin wantsto create more alternative routes for young people.\nDeputyQuinlivan continued\n“AcrossIreland we lack significant alternative opportunities for young people topursue other education. We want to build on the success of the traditionalcraft trades in Ireland such as plumbing, bricklaying and plastering, andexpand this way of learning, into a host of new fields.\n“Apprenticeships in fields such as green energy, retail, hospitality andfinancial services are hugely popular in other European countries. We aim toexpand the system into these areas to create different opportunities for allyoung people including more females and people with disabilities.”\n Currently,most apprenticeships are aimed towards male participants with just 160 out of13,589 people in apprenticeship programmes across the state being female in2018. In addition, the physically demanding nature of the current availableapprenticeships has resulted in just 1.7% of total apprentices in 2016 beingpeople with disabilities.\n\nSinnFéin aims to increase investment in apprenticeships to over €350 million perannum within five years. \nTheLimerick City TD, Deputy Quinlivan has said that this will “fund the treblingof the number apprenticeship programmes and provide places for 60,000apprentices”.\nDeputy Quinlivan continued: “€5,166,000 of investment will be required overfive years for the development of 63 new apprenticeship programmes, bringingthe total number of craft and new courses to 100.\n“Ireland’sallocation from the EU for training and education of the young is €68 million.Fine Gael was forced to return €19.8 million of this allocation in 2016, asthey failed to submit a payment application.\n“SinnFéin will ensure all EU monies allocated to Ireland would be fully utilised, tobenefit the education and training of our young people. To date, none of thismoney has been drawn down from the EU.”\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27460  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nLet\u0026#039s exceed those who turned out on the very first civil rights march in August 1968 and let\u0026#039s ensure that a very clear and committed demand is presented to the governments - the Irish government as much as the British government - to address those issues of a rights based society that are enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement. - Mitchel McLaughlin\nThis Saturday the 50th anniversary of the first organised civil rights march in the North will be marked with a commemoration march from Coalisland to Dungannon. \nThe original march, held on August 24, 1968, was the first to be organised by the Civil Rights Association in the north, which was founded the previous year to challenge the institutionalised discrimination and injustice of the Six County state. \nIt was stopped at an RUC cordon before it reached its destination at Market Square in Dungannon but the organisers went ahead with their protest and held speeches at sang the civil rights anthem, \u0027We Shall Overcome\u0027, at the police cordon. \nAn estimated 2,500 people took part in the original march fifty years ago. \nThe Coalisland to Dungannon march was followed by a march in Derry on October 5 1968 which was brutally attacked by the RUC. The attack on the marchers was carried out in front of the news cameras, brining global attention to the civil rights campaign and the the discrimination of the unionist regime at Stormont. \n\nThis Saturday\u0027s march, organised by Sinn Féin, is the first in a series of events planned to mark the 50th anniversary of the beginning of the civil rights campaign. \nMid Ulster Sinn Féin MP, Francie Molloy, who helped organise and took part in the original parade 50 years ago, said that the campaign for rights is as relevant now as it was in 1968 and encouraged people to take part in Saturday\u0027s march. \n\"Presently, with the deliberate denial of rights, a shortage of affordable housing and the ongoing issue of constituency boundary proposals, it is clear there is still a job of work to be done,\" he said. \nWith the DUP\u0027s denial of rights to the LGB\u0026ampT community, Irish language speakers and bereaved families awaiting inquests, it is clear the campaign for rights needs to continue in the north. The onset of the Tory Brexit, backed by the DUP, also represents an attack on the rights of people in the north. \nThe main speaker at the end of the commemoration at the Square in Dungannon will be former Sinn Féin MLA Mitchel McLaughlin. \nSpeaking ahead of Saturday\u0027s march, the former Northern Assembly Speaker called for a huge turnout. \"Let\u0027s exceed those who turned out on the very first civil rights march in August 1968 and let\u0027s ensure that a very clear and committed demand is presented to the governments - the Irish government as much as the British government - to address those issues of a rights based society that are enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement,\" he said. \nThe parade will begin in Coalisland at 3pm on Saturday and make its way to Dungannon. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27461  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\n“The denial of rights, equality and respect is as wrong today as it was fifty years ago. - Mitchel McLaughlin\nHundreds of people took part in a commemoration in Tyrone yesterday to mark the 50th anniversary of the first civil rights march to be held in the north. \nThe march retraced the steps of the original march from Coalisland to Dungannon and was attended by Sinn Féin representatives from across the north. \nIt was led by Mid Ulster Sinn Féin MP Francie Molloy, who took part in the original march 50 years ago as a steward. \nMarchers carried replicas of the posters carried by the original march, reading \u0027One man, one vote,\u0027 \u0027Equal housing now\u0027 as well as banners referring to the Caledon housing protest which was the motivation for the march. \nContemporary posters on the threat posed to Brexit to rights were also carried by marchers. \n\nIn 1968 the original march was stopped before it reached the Square in Dungannon by the RUC because loyalist protestors staged a counter demonstration. \nThis time, however, the march reached its destination where speeches were made by Francie Molloy, local MLA Colm Gildernew and Fermanagh/South Tyrone MP Michelle Gildernew. \nThe main speaker of the march was veteran republican and civil rights activist Mictchel McLaughlin. \nIn his speech, the former Assembly Speaker said tat much has changed in the last five decades and that we are on the verge of a major shift towards Irish unity. \n\"The Orange state is now gone and we now have a peaceful and democratic way forward. \n“This is a very different place than it was in 1968 and I am convinced that we are now on the verge of another seismic shift towards a new, agreed and united Ireland that will provide a prosperous and shared future for all our citizens,\" he said. \n\nBut Mr McLaughlin also warned that our rights are still under threat today from Brexit and the right wing alliance between the Tories and the DUP. \n“My deep concern is that there are still people who want to deny rights and equality to their fellow citizens today. \n\"People in the north still face attacks on their electoral and civil rights, alongside the continued denial of rights to LGBTQ couples, women, Irish language speakers, and bereaved families seeking a coroner’s inquest.\n“Today, we are experiencing an unacceptable blockade on rights, imposed by the DUP and facilitated by the British government.\n“Rights are also under threat by a right-wing Tory Brexit and there are unwelcome echoes of gerrymandering and the hollowing out of democracy by the recent Boundary Commission proposals.\n“The denial of rights, equality and respect is as wrong today as it was fifty years ago,\" he added. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27462  ","story":"Sinn Féin Vice President Michelle O\u0026#039Neill.\n Michael McMonagle\n\n“We must specifically acknowledge the damage done by the Catholic Church to the lives of many women and children in the mother and baby homes, the Magdalene Laundries and a succession of abuse scandals and cover ups.- Michelle O\u0026#039Neill\nThe visit to Ireland by Pope Francis this weekend is an opportunity for the Catholic church to address the ongoing legacy of abuse, Sinn Féin Vice President Michelle O\u0027Neill has said. \nMichelle O\u0027Neill made the comments ahead of the historic visit to Ireland of Pope Francis this weekend to attend the World Meeting of Families which is being held in Dublin.

While I acknowledge that the Pope will meet a number of victims and survivors of clerical abuse and it is important that he hears and listens to their stories, more is needed.

The march was blocked by the RUC at Thomas Street from entering Dungannon’s Market Square, subsequently leading to the second Civil Rights march in Derry’s Duke Street on 5th October 1968.\n\"The first civil rights march was a major cornerstone in Irish history, the people of the north stood up and said no more will we be treated as second class citizens, shaping politics on the island of Ireland for decades,\" he said.\nOver 2,500 took part in the first civil rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon.\nThis would evidently change politics here forever - this was very much a campaign organised by people, from all backgrounds and none. \nProminent republicans were also central to the organisation of demonstrations, including the now Mid Ulster MP, Francie Molloy and the late Stan Corrigan.\nReflecting on the first civil rights march, 50 years on, Colm Gildernew said the first civil rights march should act as a rallying cry to those of us who seek to promote rights, equality and respect for all in society today.\n\"We are currently experiencing an unacceptable blockade on a swathe of rights-based issues by the DUP, including Irish language, marriage equality, women’s health, and legacy rights.  \n\"There are huge concerns arising from Brexit and the recent Boundary Commission proposals, seen by many as a new attempt to gerrymander the north.

They were on active service and at Drumnakilly, close to their homes, they were ambushed and shot dead by a unit of the British Army’s SAS regiment. The Volunteers were brothers Gerard and Martin Harte and Brian Mullin.\nThe SAS killings brought to an end a month which had been one of the most intense and tragic of the war in Ireland. It began on 1 August with the IRA bombing of Inglis Barracks in London, close to Margaret Thatcher’s Finchley constituency. It was the first IRA attack in England since the bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton during the Tory Party conference four years earlier. A British solider was killed in the Inglis Barracks blast. In the following days, the IRA killed three British soldiers and an RUC detective in the North. \n\nOn 8 August, two young nationalist men were murdered by a loyalist death squad in Belfast. There were two more such sectarian killings of young nationalist men in Belfast, on 17 and 18 August. On 20 August, eight British soldiers were killed at Ballygawley, County Tyrone, when the IRA bombed a bus carrying members of the Light Infantry Regiment returning from England. On 31 August, two civilians were killed in Derry after they triggered an IRA booby-trap bomb intended for British forces. \nPolitically this period was dominated by the issue of extradition and, on 27 August, Robert Russell, one of the IRA prisoners who broke out of the H-Blocks in the mass escape of 1983, was handed across the border to the RUC. This was despite widespread protests, including public dissent from within Fianna Fáil.\nIt was on the Long Bog Road at Drumnakilly, four miles outside Omagh, that the three IRA Volunteers met their deaths.\nAt 4pm on 30 August, they were ambushed by British forces who poured a hail of bullets into their car. The RUC and British Army immediately sealed off the area and the bodies of the three men were left at the scene, within the cordon and inaccessible to grieving relatives, until the following afternoon. \n\nGerard Harte  was the eldest of the three Volunteers and was an experienced IRA activist. With his brother, Martin, he was a prominent member of the Loughmacrory St Theresa’s GAA Club, where he organised youth teams. \nMartin Harte was just 21 but had been in the IRA for four years at the time of his death. A talented football player, he had captained the Loughmacrory team. He was the father of a three-month-old son and, to compound the tragedy, his widow was Briege Mullin, sister of his friend and comrade Brian Mullin. \nVolunteer Brian Mullin  had been singled out for particular harassment by British forces. He was arrested and interrogated in Gough Barrack on numerous occasions and a few weeks before his death he and his brothers were beaten by crown forces outside their family home.\n\n\nHundreds of British soldiers and RUC members saturated the Tyrone countryside as the three Volunteers were laid to rest. Speaking at the graveside of the Harte brothers, Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams said the Volunteers were “good, decent, patriotic freedom fighters driven to fight for justice”. \nVolunteers Brian Mullin, Gerard Harte and Martin Harte were killed on 30 August 1988, 30 years ago this week.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_935986.jpg--.jpg?1534836507000\n","title":"the sky s the limit for stephens catering equipment abseiling team","story":"  \n \n  \nAN adventurous group of employees from Stephens Catering Equipment are going to great heights to raise money for Northern Ireland Chest, Heart and Stroke charity.\n  \nThe 12 strong team will be abseiling from the Europa Hotel on September 23 and what makes this even more of a challenge for the team is that most of them are afraid of heights!\n  \nClaire Adair explained: “This is the first abseil for most of us and a real challenge. \n  \n“I wanted to arrange a charity event that will really make us face our fears. \n  \n“Most of us taking part have a fear of heights so it will be a huge challenge.

This shows the consistently high performance that our students are achieving over a wide range of subjects.” \n  \nA large percentage of pupils will be returning to embark upon A-Level studies and the College would also like to formally wish those leaving all the very best in the future career paths they choose to follow.\n  \n\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_995389.jpg--.jpg?1535635289000\n","title":"peter marks 40 years with moy park","story":"  \nBROUGHSHANE man, Peter Morgan, has been an employee of Moy Park for almost 40 years and still maintains \u0027every day is a school day\u0027.\n  \nPeter is the Agri Business Technical Manager at the Larne Road site. \n  \nAs Moy Park celebrates 75 years in business this year, Peter reflects on personal milestones and discusses how the agri sector has changed during this time.\n  \nSpeaking to the , eter said: “I finished college in 1981 and joined the O’Kane Poultry team after studying agriculture and gaining a HND in Poultry Husbandry.\n  \nI always enjoyed the outdoor life and thought a career in food production would be beneficial in the long term as society became more attuned to food demand and supply issues.\n  \n\n  \nFirst role\n  \n\n  \nPeter\u0027s first role in O’Kane was as a Broiler Advisory Officer, which involved helping farmers with their bird management and ensuring they were producing good, quality chicken. \n  \nI was later made Manager of the Broiler Growing Operation in 1989 and took on additional responsibilities in 1995 as Manager for Broiler, Breeder and Hatcheries.\n  \nNearly 30 years later after Moy Park acquired O’Kane in 2010, I took on my current position as Agri Business Technical Manager, Peter explained.\n  \nIn this role, Peter is responsible for ensuring they are compliant with all operating procedures, using only approved products across the farming supply base and helping farmers achieve excellence in what they do.\n  \nPeter continued: As you can imagine, there has been significant advances in research and development over the course of my career, which keeps us at the forefront of bird health and welfare, sustainability, product quality, food safety and value for money.\n  \nFor example, reducing campylobacter has been a top priority for not only the poultry industry, but in particular Moy Park. This is the most common form of food poisoning in the UK. \n  \nWe have heavily invested in research throughout the production chain and we have already implemented new ideas such as hot water heating, double barrier changing facilities in each house and other technologies which we firmly believe have had a major impact in reducing the number of our birds which can become infected with Campylobacter. \n  \nFurthermore, we are focusing on excellence in biosecurity and innovative processing technologies.\n  \n\n  \nOngoing challenges\n  \n\n  \nControlling infectious disease in poultry is an ongoing challenge Moy Park face, in particular avian influenza . To address this, they have upgraded their AI contingency planning, rewriting the rulebook in the past year to ensure they have a robust plan in place.\n  \nWe have to think carefully how we would react and prevent spread if AI came in to Northern Ireland and together with agencies and Government departments we exchange views regularly with working groups, in order to remain on top of this key issue, Peter said.\n  \n\n  \nCareer Highlight\n  \n\n  \nOver his 40 years with the company Peter said a key highlight has been promoting ownership and pride with the people he works closely with.\n  \nA back to basics approach is one of my fundamental pillars, and I still firmly believe that bird husbandry and welfare are key to producing a high-quality product.\n  \nThere are endless opportunities for those considering a career in agriculture and food production, and as my wife and son also work in the poultry industry, I can definitely vouch for that!\n  \nAs the world population continues to expand, the demand for goods also increases and food production, and those working in the industry, will have to keep up with this development.\n  \nBy strengthening our production capabilities over the past number of years, we are well placed to meet this demand, with poultry a healthy and versatile source of protein which is also good value for money.\n  \n\n  \nPositive outlook\n  \n\n  \nPeter concluded: As I look back on my time in the industry and at Moy Park, I’ve always started each morning the same way, and I think it has stood me in good stead!\n  \nThe first thing I think of is ‘today will bring a new challenge, a new opportunity and I will most likely learn something new’ as every day is a school day!”\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_995387.jpg--.jpg?1535635242000\n","title":"superb gcse results for dunclug college","story":"  \nDUNCLUG College is celebrating historic levels of achievement at GCSE level. \n  \nAll students, including those with ious learning challenges sat a minimum of 7 GCSE subjects, including the compulsory core of English, Maths and Science and a range of GCSE optional choices in a balance of General and Applied courses.\n  \n Many gifted and competitive students sat 8, 9 or 10 subjects. The overall result for GCSE English for the whole cohort was 80% in the A – C range, with the overall Mathematics result being almost 60%: in each case this represented the best outcomes in the school’s history. \n  \nOverall, almost 80% of students achieved 5 or more subjects in the A – C range with almost 60% achieving this standard inclusive of English and Maths. This significantly exceeds the National and Northern Ireland averages and places our school and is testimony to the success which can be attained at a non-selective school. \n  \n Many factors contribute to such success, not least the support of parents, the commitment of students and the motivational teaching which is inspirational yet grounded, and which proves that high expectations enable students to push boundaries and indeed predictions. \n  \nSubjects which achieved the outstanding success rate of 100% of pupils gaining Grade C or better were as follows: Art, Construction, Media Studies, Double Award Science, Occupational Studies, Further Maths, Prince’s Trust, Agriculture \u0026amp Community Sport. Other high achieving subjects included: Applied Business 70%, English 80%, English Literature 92%, Engineering 70%, French 75%, Geography 79%, ICT 70%, Single Award Science 78%, Technology \u0026amp Design 91%, Drama 91%, Music 82%, BTEC Sport 91%\n  \nThe Principal noted that amongst the numerous excellent combinations of grades were children with special educational needs, and many personal best achievements. It was also very encouraging to note that 96% of all students in the year group achieved at least 5 grades in the A – E range.\n  \nCongratulations to top achievers: Kirsten McLeister - 5 A* and 3A, Craig Francey - 4A*, 4A, 1B and 1C and Charlotte McKay 1A*, 4A, 2B and 1C.\n  \nOther students with a profile of A - C grades in eight or more subjects included: Stuart Adams, Tori Agnew, Chloe Bleakley, Alan Clarke, Daniel Compton, Megan Davison, Laura Du Bois Pidgeon, Amy Ewart, Joy Forsythe, Rachel Greer, Abigail Harris, Timothy Hill, Korben Houston, Lynn Hughes, Deanna Johnston, Jamie Knox, Danielle Mahaffy, Tamzin McClenaghan, Adam McConnell, Grace McCullough, Emma McDowell, Thomas McFall, Megan McKay, Luke Neeson, Robbie O’Neill, Aimee Penney, David Saunderson, Chad Shaw, Joshua Shaw, Robyn Telford, Charlotte Waide, James Warwick, Leah Young. This, in addition to the list of students, too numerous to list, who achieved 7 top grades.\n  \nInterviews are currently underway at the College for Sixth Form places and/or advice for students on the next steps in their learning. Applications are also welcome from students from other schools.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

grateful family of a Ballymoney schoolboy whose life was saved by his older brother\u0027s bone marrow have spoken publicly for the first time.\nA year after seven-year-old Caden Moore received a transplant at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children from his 11-year-old brother Ben their proud mother Sabrina has agreed to share their inspiring story.\nSabrina and her husband Bryan are hoping their unforgettable experiences will encourage others to give blood and sign the Stem Cell and Bone Marrow Register.\nSpeaking exclusively to The Chronicle, teacher Sabrina said: It\u0027s been the toughest year of our lives but what a difference the past 12 months have made no words can ever express how we all felt this time last year.\n\u0026#8220To have two children going through such life-changing procedures in the same hospital, on the same day, is something we could never have imagined. Caden is improving every day and Ben has never looked back. We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus      return false     else if        your_email.focus      return false     else if        friends_name.focus      return false     else if        friends_email.focus      return false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random return false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n       .ready .click .hide          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.fadeIn          return false                .click .parents.fadeOut          return false                    */       ]]\n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n                           username.focus            return false           else if              password.focus            return false           else                      ]]\n      \n      \"\n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n               return false\" title=\"View The Leader online!\"\n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n banner\" title=\"Advertise with Us\" /\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n          ?

The Skoda man felt the format incurred unnecessary expense in terms of fuel costs.\n\u0026#8220The fuel isn\u0027t cheap and the cars run on it whether you are driving a stage or the road sections, said Bogie.

The results are amazing and they have clearly drawn inspiration from a iety of sources.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“I would like to congratulate all our finalists, Andrew Moore, James Magennis and Charles Leathem, who have each taken some of our iconic packaging and transformed it into a catwalk sensation, showcasing the raw talent of some of our stars of the future.”\n\nClaire Concannon, course co-ordinator from Belfast politan College, added: “Working with crisp packaging has been a very valuable learning experience for our ingenious students who have more than risen to the challenge. The judges had an almost impossible decision narrowing the entries down to just three finalists who all showed technical ability combined with creative flair and imagination. The finalists were then featured on the Tayto Northern Ireland facebook page with more than 2000 people voting for their favourite.\n\n“All three finalists should be very proud of what they have achieved and they have certainly made a lasting impact on the catwalk and attracted huge interest from those attending – it’s hard to believe that these are made from material more commonly seen on the production lines at Tayto Castle.\n\n“We would like to thank everyone who took the time to vote and for the many shares which helped to bring our students’ work to a wide audience.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nTayto crisps have been made at Tayto Castle, Co Armagh, since 1956 when Thomas Hutchinson spotted a gap in the market to make tasty potato snacks. The company remains family-owned by the Hutchinsons and is now run by Thomas’s children. Since its beginnings more than 60 years ago, Tayto has grown into an international business, supplying crisps and snacks produced in Tandragee to more than 40 countries across the world.\n\nDuring the last 12 years, Tayto has acquired iconic crisp and snack brands, Golden Wonder, Real Crisps, Mr Porky, Jonathan Crisp and Portlebay Popcorn through its parent organisation Tayto Group. Across the Group, more than five million packets of crisps and snacks are produced each day at its six UK factories.

education provided\u0026#8221. \n\n                \nOnce again, an impressive number of pupils in the cohort achieved five or more GCSE passes at A* - C. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nPrincipal Mrs A McCullough said the results reward the hard work of the pupils, the dedication of the staff and very positive parental support. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“It is also important to recognise the contribution of our partners in the Banbridge Area Learning Community, “ she said. “This partnership allows us to offer a diverse range of subjects which affords pupils a wider choice at KS4.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“This year’s set of results reinforces our reputation as a high performing, non-selective secondary school. \n\n“Rathfriland High School has provided opportunities and opened doors across a diverse range of further education and training which will allow these leavers to choose whichever pathway most suits their skills and talents. \n\n“I would like to congratulate our pupils on their success, perseverance and industry. \n\n“I would also pay tribute to the talented and professional teaching staff who play a pivotal role in these achievements.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Parents also provide crucial support for our young people and I wish to thank them. \n\n“The performance of some pupils is particularly worthy of note, Alexandria Harbinson, Geri Georgieva, Laura Adams, Emily Cantley, Mallory Lutton, Jessica Thomas and Kerry Martin.\t\n\n“Success such as this only comes about when pupils, parents and staff work together to ensure all children reach their potential.  \n\n“We celebrate all our pupils’ achievement at this time and wish them every success for the future.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n

on-board the Glider vehicles during the last days of testing before the service goes live on Monday. \n\nShadow running will see both Glider and  vehicles operating along the Glider routes for three days. Glider services are on schedule to launch on Monday 3 September on cross-city routes between West and East Belfast  and the city centre to the Titanic Quarter .\n\nWith Monday being the day the schools go back after the summer holidays – which always leads to an increase in traffic – many drivers are bracing themselves for delays along the main arterial routes in West Belast.\n\nRobin Totten, Translink’s Glider Senior Project Manager said they are entering the final phase of testing which will see most of the infrastructure, vehicles and off-board ticketing systems tested by their passengers before they go live on Monday. \n\n“During this final week of testing, passengers travelling on the East – West route will be able to travel on Glider on Thursday 30th August with a valid ticket or Smartcard,” he explained.\n\n“ services will continue to run the scheduled timetable, with Glider ‘shadow running’ more infrequently along the route, calling at Glider halts. \n\n“Glider services during these three days will operate half-hourly from approximately 7am to 7pm. Passengers who have a valid ticket or validated Smartcard will be able to use either  or Glider, if waiting at one of the new Glider halts.\n\n“We have trained around 60 helpers from Volunteer Now, who will assist Translink staff at halts during this final phase to support passengers to get familiar with the exciting new service and ticketing system.  The volunteers will also be in place for the initial introduction of the service to boost passenger confidence and ensure a smooth transition to the new Glider service.\n\n“We have also completed over 150 public information and engagement events along the Glider routes, meeting many community groups, disability groups, businesses and local stakeholders to show them how to use the new services and ticketing, this will now be the an opportunity to try the service for themselves.\n\n‘‘We are delighted that communities and stakeholders right across the city see Glider as a positive development, and are enthusiastic about the introduction of this iconic new service and the benefits it will bring for the city.\n\nTranslink have also published ‘how to use’ guides and short videos on You Tube to help direct and make the service easy to use for passengers.

What is important to us is a solution that is in the best interest of the people of Belfast, the employees of House of Fraser and our investors.\"\n\nCommerz Real would not give any detail on the identity of the retailers who have expressed interest in the site. The spokesman said: \"It is simply too early to communicate any details. First we have to have clarity about House of Fraser. We have been very satisfied with their performance and would like to further co-operate with them.\"\n\nCommercial property agents Lambert Smith Hampton, which manages lettings at Victoria Square, said it had no comment to make on the prospect of a new tenant at the House of Fraser unit.\n\nTycoon Mike Ashley bought House of Fraser out of administration for £90m earlier this month. \n\nTalks with landlords have resulted in around seven House of Fraser branches being saved from closure, including one in London\u0027s Oxford Street.\n\nHowever, there has been no confirmation about the fate of the Belfast store. \n\nHowever, one industry insider said he believed the unit would be easily filled in the event of a decision to shut it down. He said that Victoria Square was considered a desirable retail location as it was built only 10 years ago.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"cameras ready to roll on line of duty new series","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

We also sub-let offices to a range of tenants.\n\n\"In over 20 years, we had only one visitor who called and was fully aware of the history of the building as a boys\u0027 home.\n\n\"After 2010 we formulated plans to refurbish the building. \n\n\"However, in April 2015 these plans were thrown into the air by statements made by Mr Peter Robinson, then First Minister, calling for the building to be \u0027razed\u0027 more than 40 years after its period of notoriety.\"\n\nMr Black said that a series of protests followed and the new focus on the building led him to decide to put the redevelopment plans on hold.\n\n\"We no longer consider that retention of the existing building with the planned development is commercially attractive due to its history having been thrust back into

firm said Kincora should form part of official efforts to address the legacy of the Northern Ireland troubled past.\n\nKRW Law represents Richard Kerr, who alleges he was abused by \"very powerful people\" with links to Kincora and does not accept the conclusions of the four-year Historical Institutional Abuse  inquiry.\n\nThe inquiry dismissed claims that senior politicians, civil servants and businessmen were complicit in a paedophile ring that operated at the home in the 1970s and for which three staff members were jailed. \n\nPublishing the HIA findings in January, inquiry chairman Sir Anthony Hart said of Kincora: \"It was not a homosexual brothel, nor was it used by any of the security agencies as a honey pot to entrap, blackmail or otherwise exploit homosexuals.\"\n\nThe retired judge added: \"It is now time to finally lay these unfounded myths to rest.\"\n\nBut a statement from KRW said: \"On his  behalf, KRW is considering issuing legal proceedings over failings in the Kincora investigation by way of a judicial review.\n\n\"In addition to proposed legal proceedings, KRW will argue that the Kincora scandal must be considered as part of the legacy of the conflict.\"\n\nThe 2,299 sq ft property is listed by Frazer Kidd estate agents.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland customers facing third energy price hike with","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC |

However, its unregulated electricity increase is higher than the regulated Power NI increase of 13.8%, announced earlier this month. SSE Airtricity needs to explain this difference to its customers.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest traffic and travel","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Here we look at what the restrictions will mean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n– What is being banned?\n\n\nDrinks with more than 150mg of caffeine per litre, like Red Bull, Monster, and Relentless, will be affected.                    \n\nOne regular 250ml can of energy drink contains around 80mg of caffeine – equivalent to almost three cans of cola.\n\nMany popular energy drinks now come in 500ml cans.\n\nSales will be restricted to either over-16s or over-18s, depending on consultation responses.\n\n\n– What are the concerns?\n\n\nThere are fears children’s health and education are being harmed, with the drinks linked to behavioural issues and poor classroom discipline.\n\nMany also have very high amounts of sugar, contributing to tooth decay and obesity.\n\nStudies have shown regularly consuming large quantities of caffeine can result in increased blood pressure, sleep disturbances, headaches and stomachaches.\n\nCampaigners have also criticised how much children can get their hands on with just pocket money, with four cans of generic 250ml energy drink available for as little as £1.\n\n\n– Why is it relevant to Britain?\n\n\nBritish children consume energy drinks way above the European average, contributing to emotional difficulties and tiredness, public health minister Steve Brine has said.\n\nNearly 70% of UK children aged 10 to 17 years old consume energy drinks, according to the Government’s childhood obesity plan.\n\nAnd those who do so are drinking on average 50% more than the EU average for that age group.\n\nJenny Oldroyd, deputy director for obesity, food and nutrition at the Department of Health and Social Care, has previously warned: “Around a quarter of adolescents are consuming more than three energy drinks in one sitting, so it’s that high level of consumption that concerns us.”\n\n\n– Why has the issue gained prominence?\n\n\nA boom in the energy drinks market, high-profile calls from figures such as TV chef Jamie Oliver, and the relatively low cost of some types compared with general soft drinks.\n\nWhile many major retailers already do not sell to under-16s, just 21% of the UK grocery market, including corner shops, are signed up to voluntary restrictions, No 10 said.\n\nUK energy drink sales jumped by around one-fifth  between 2012 and 2017, with total sales estimated at £1.65 billion last year, according to

Those who haven\u0027t had a repeat test have either chosen not to take up the offer, or have an identified reason for why a test is not appropriate for them at this time.\n\n\"As expected, the majority of results of the repeat tests have been reported as normal.  A very small number of women have been referred to colposcopy for further investigation. \n\n\"The PHA and HSCB are unable to release specific numbers or further details to ensure that patient confidentiality is maintained.”\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37255967.ece/182eb/AUTOCROP/w300square/car2.jpg","title":"walking with dinosaurs at the sse arena photos","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

It happened on the Glenshane Road, not far from the house he had set up with Sinead in Maghera, halfway between their family homes in Newbridge and Ballerin, near Garvagh.\n\nA transport planner in Swatragh who married Sinead in July last year, he had been told just weeks before his death that he was going to be a dad, and friends said he was ecstatic.\n\nAfter passing away several days after the collision, Sinead, a dental nurse in Antrim Area Hospital, donated his organs for transplant, and she was later told they had saved lives in three major operations.\n\nAs she tried to cope with her grief, Sinead was preparing to give birth to her baby, who was due on July 2.\n\nShe said: \"They were going to let me go 10 days before bringing me into hospital but I didn\u0027t want to be there around the time of our first wedding anniversary on the 14th. So I asked if I could go in earlier.\"\n\nSinead said she tried to focus her attention on the baby, but she had a photograph of Shaun beside her all the time.\n\nSeventeen hours after Sinead went into the maternity unit her labour started, and Ellen made her entrance into the world 15 minutes later as her mother received encouragement from sisters Marian and Clare.\n\n\"Everything was fine and when I held Ellen Rose in my arms it was a great feeling. She was just gorgeous,\" Sinead added. \n\n\"I don\u0027t know who she looks like. I think there\u0027s a bit of both me and Shaun in there somewhere but she changes from day to day. I\u0027m just pleased that Ellen is healthy and doing so well. Sean would have spoilt her rotten. He was fantastic with children. He doted on all his nephews and nieces and they all adored him.\n\n\"He was very excited at the prospect of being a father. And we discussed a couple of names, though we didn\u0027t know if I was having a boy or a girl.\n\n\"Shaun knew that the name Ellen was a strong possibility because his late mum was called Helen.\"\n\nSinead says Shaun\u0027s relations have been extremely supportive of her and the latest addition to the family.\n\nFive days after what would have been the Mullans\u0027 first wedding anniversary in July, Sinead introduced her baby on social media. And she also talked movingly about the pain of losing her husband.\n\nSinead described Ellen as \u00276lbs 11oz of perfection\u0027 and she appealed for friends to share stories about her dad.\n\n\"As hard as it is to talk about Shaun, I want Ellen to know everything about her daddy, so all PG stories are welcome,\" she wrote, adding that she knew how much Shaun would have loved his daughter.\n\n\"That makes it all the harder. My head and my heart are full of mixed emotions. I would love to hear Shaun talk back to me to give me some advice. I know he wouldn\u0027t want me to feel so down and would want to make it right.\"\n\nSinead said her daughter is a dream baby. \"She\u0027s sleeping right through the night already,\" she added. \"She\u0027s very mellow.\"\n\nEllen has captured the hearts of Shaun\u0027s former team-mates at his football club. Sinead took her to a recent wedding of one of her husband\u0027s friends.\n\nAnd a colleague who was there said: \"Ellen had supposedly big and tough Gaelic footballers cooing all around her. She\u0027s lovely. She would have been the apple of Shaun\u0027s eye.\"\n\nEllen won\u0027t remember a thing about it, obviously, but she\u0027ll get her first taste of Gaelic football\u0027s big time on Sunday. Sinead says her baby\u0027s name was picked out of a raffle for two tickets for the All-Ireland final.\n\nSinead\u0027s brother Matthew bought the raffle tickets for his new niece at his GAA club in Newbridge. Initially it was thought that Sinead could take someone else, as well as Ellen, to the final.\n\nBut she has been informed that babies who go to Croke Park for sell-out games still need a ticket of their own even if they are in the arms of a parent.\n\nSinead and Ellen have an important \u0027fixture\u0027 the day before the final.\n\nFor that\u0027s the date of the christening, and she\u0027ll be wearing a very special gown for the ceremony.\n\nThe proud mum added: \"I\u0027ve had it made from material from my wedding dress and from the shirt that Shaun wore on our big day.\n\n\"We will head down to Dublin on Sunday morning. It\u0027ll be a busy weekend,\" said Sinead, who insisted that she\u0027ll be maintaining a diplomatic neutrality during the showdown between two teams who aren\u0027t exactly huge favourites in the Oak Leaf County.\n\n\"I\u0027m just going for the day out,\" she laughed.\n\nShe says that she\u0027s still missing Shaun desperately, writing online of the tragedy that engulfed her.\n\nShe wrote: \"I would never wish this upon anyone but wish it wasn\u0027t us.

The choice is his.”\n\nThe comments came as Mr Field said he will employ “the best legal minds” to dispute party rules which say he cannot return to the party after resigning the whip.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Field, who has served as the MP for Birkenhead for almost 40 years, was told by party chief whip Nick Brown that his decision to resign automatically meant he was no longer a member.\n\nLabour sources confirmed that by resigning the whip Mr Fieldhad “automatically opted to resign from the Labour Party”.\n\nMr Field told the Press Association that he would be making a legal challenge against the move.\n\nHe said: “It was a very friendly meeting, he’s a good colleague, but the sad bit of news in it was that he thought the Labour Party rule book was clear, that if I resign the whip I couldn’t be a Labour Party member.\n\n“I told him I was sorry to hear that obviously, that I would actually get the best legal minds I could on the job and that I would dispute that.”\n\nThe one-time minister for welfare reform, who was charged by Tony Blair to reform the welfare state by “thinking the unthinkable”, sensationally resigned saying that the party was now governed by “a culture of intolerance, nastiness and intimidation”.\n\nIn an interview with the Press Association he said: “It’s been a pretty big and tiring step that I’ve taken, I don’t regret it, I think it is important.\n\n“I’m not a gesture politician, I do this, I hope with others, to effect change and I think that process has actually started on this.\n\n“The people of Birkenhead are sovereign in this matter, I would hope that providence willing, to be the Labour candidate next time.\n\n“If not I will be the Independent Labour Party next time.”\n\nMr Field said the saga was “one of the saddest” in his long career.\n\nThe longstanding Labour man added that talk of a by-election was “another game, for another day”.\n\nHe earlier stressed his resignation of the whip over the anti-Semitism crisis was not part of a plot to bring down the Labour leader.\n\n“I hope and I believe Jeremy will lead us into the next election and it is not true I’m a constant critic of Jeremy,” said Mr Field.\n\n“That isn’t true. I believe he has the right to take us into the next election because he has won two leadership contests.\n\n“The idea this is part of a plot or anything else is simply crazy. It is because I think he will lead us into the next election that I think these issues are urgent.”\n\nHowever, Mr Field added that he felt Mr Corbyn’s thanks for his service was “as though I was resigning from a whist club” and pointed out that he had been a member of Labour longer than his leader.\n\nThe Birkenhead MP also denied claims that he was jumping before he was pushed, having lost a no-confidence vote within his constituency Labour party after backing Brexit.\n\nHe said: “I have been through all this before when I have been deselected and I am still the Labour party candidate.\n\n“I wish to be the Labour party candidate at the next election and, if I am not, I shall stand as an independent Labour candidate.\n\n“The people who decide this are not a small caucus of 30-odd people but the 70,000 electors of Birkenhead.”\n\nResponding to claims by Labour MP Chris Williamson that he had made “grotesque slurs with no basis in reality” about bullying within his constituency Labour Party that had been “previously resolved”, Mr Field was scathing.\n\n“If they have investigated it and concluded it is all fictitious they have never told me,” he said.\n\n“I have been writing and copying in the chief whip saying this is still going on, this is new material for you.\n\n“It is just untrue for an unknown Labour Party spokesman to say that.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"what the papers say september","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

What’s the safest way to replenish the stock of fish in a mountainous lake popular with anglers?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.push\n\n\nUtah Division of Wildlife Resources  provided the answer by way of a video no-one knew they needed to see, but which has pulled in the views on Twitter.\n\n\nFun fact: We stock many of Utah\u0027s high-mountain lakes from the air. The fish are tiny — anywhere from 1–3 inches long — which allows more than 95% of them to survive the fall. \n#Utah\n \n#TroutTuesday\n \npic.twitter/kotDe91Zzw\n\n— Utah DWR  \nAugust 21, 2018\n\n\n\n\nSince it was posted online more than a week ago, it has generated thousands of likes, shares and comments.\n\nBut what’s happening? Above a lake, the belly of the plane opens to release a cargo of fish and water.\n\nThe trout are so small – between one to three inches in length – that the fall from the plane doesn’t hurt them. \n\n“Think of it as a high diver diving into a deep pool of water,” said Utah DWR on Twitter.\n\n\n \npic.twitter/EXtDwn0a3k\n\n— Hans Olsen  \nAugust 22, 2018\n\n\n\n\nAnd it’s kinder to have them travel by air to the mountaintop rather than by road because that journey can be longer and more stressful on the fish, according to officials.\n\nAlthough they initially state that 95% survive, the true figure is between 95% and 99%. \n\n\nTransporting the fish by ground takes a lot longer, and it\u0027s much more stressful on the fish. The survival rate is much higher from the air — usually between 95–99%.\n— Utah DWR  \nAugust 22, 2018\n\n\n\n\n“These are high mountain fisheries,” Utah DWR explained on Twitter. \n\n“People who are hiking and camping often enjoy fishing during their trips. We stock these lakes to provide fishing opportunities for the public.”\n\n\nOne of the most interesting videos I’ve seen lately.

The fund is administered by Council on behalf of the Derry and Strabane Rural Partnership, one of ten Local Action Groups working across NI.\n\nThe Derry City and Strabane District Council area has been allocated a total of £7.54 million up to 2020 to improve economic prosperity in rural areas. The Rural Business Investment Scheme is open to new or existing micro or small businesses and social economy enterprises involved in the non-agricultural or non agri-food sectors based in rural areas.

Enhancing connectivity and supporting rural enterprise and investment are essential to the success of the local economy and are key priorities of the Strategic Growth Plan for the City and District.\n\n“This scheme offers the opportunity for small rural companies to avail of the support they need to take their business to the next level. I would really urge business owners to go along to the workshops to find out how they could benefit.”\n\nChair of Derry \u0026amp Strabane Rural Partnership, William Lamrock said: “This is the fifth call for this round of funding and we are delighted that the scheme is already having a positive impact on rural business with up to 69 new jobs being supported to date through the scheme. We want to equip rural companies with the additional skills and infrastructure they need to successfully build their business and perform more effectively in the local and global markets. This will significantly benefit the local economy and create the right environment for further growth and business development within our rural communities”\n\nFor further details of the scheme and the workshops visit \nwww.derrystrabane/rural\n or to book a workshop email \n[email\u0026#160protected]\n or phone Derry City and Strabane District Council on 02871 253253 Ext 6917.\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"derry mla extends best wishes school teachers staff students new academic year","story":"\nA Foyle MLA has extended her best wishes to school teachers, staff and students returning to their schools after their well-deserved summer break.\n\nSinn Féin education spokesperson Karen Mullan was speaking as schools prepare to welcome students back for the new school year:“I want to wish everyone returning to school teachers, staff and students the very best of luck for the year ahead.\n\n“This is an exciting time of year and it offers our young people the chance to reunite with friends and get back into their routines.

Building on the success of last year’s event, SuperValu has introduced new categories to help capture the good work done across the whole spectrum of Northern Ireland society.\n\nLast year Derry man, Nathaniel Hunter was named joint second place whilst teenager, Jamie Harkin, took the joint third place, both winning SuperValu shopping vouchers and a framed certificate.\n\nNathaniel was awarded for his quick thinking and reactions when a pleasant stroll along the beach turned into a rescue drama for himself and his wife when they realised three children, aged 10, 11 and 12, had been swept out to sea. The coastguard had already been alerted and were on their way, but Nathaniel knew there was no time to lose, dashed to get a buoyancy aid and raced into the water, swimming out to the terrified kids.\n\nAnother young man followed and brought the closest child to safety whist Nathaniel swam on, getting hold of one youngster and throwing the aid to another. A strong swimmer, he brought them both back to the beach were they were treated in hospital but lived to tell the tale. Nathaniel was praised by the coastguard and of course the families of the young lives he saved that day.\n\nJamie also from Derry, had a story of extreme courage and kindness in the most challenging of circumstances. Poignantly, this exceptional young man was nominated by his mum Trisha, who had recently passed away but the family took the tough decision to proceed with the SuperStars nomination in their mother’s honour. Seven years previously Jamie was diagnosed with blood cancer Hodgkin’s Lymphoma.\n\nHis late mum told of how, before, during and after an unsuccessful organ transplant Jamie never complained. He went on to set up a wonderful support group called Jamie’s Journey in a bid to give hope to other young people touched by cancer. During his exams, the brave young man, whilst taking regular hits of morphine due to the pain, battled on and gained 10As and A*s in his GCSEs. Like many, the inspiring young man is a Star Wars fan, and after winning every fan’s dream prize of a custom light sabre, he selflessly raffled it to raise funds for charity.\n\nDue to popular demand, the deadline for entries has been extended by two weeks to Friday 14th September.\n\nStephen Bogle, SuperValu Brand Manager, said: “With entries flooding in from right across Northern Ireland, we are one step closer to finding this year’s SuperValu SuperStars. The level of interest has been fantastic and we’re giving people one final chance to nominate the people they feel deserve their moment in the spotlight and the cash prize.\n\n“We have introduced new categories this year which are, ‘Young SuperStar’, ‘Fundraising SuperStar’, ‘Unsung SuperStar’, ‘Community Group SuperStar’, ‘Social Enterprise SuperStar’, ‘SuperValu Action Cancer SuperStar’ and the ‘Overall SuperValu SuperStar 2018’.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\n“So, as well as identifying kids and adults who have done something remarkable or selfless we are rewarding the work done by people in the social enterprise sector, in community groups and we have introduced a special award for SuperValu colleagues who work tirelessly all year raising funds for Action Cancer.”\n\nFinalists will attend a prestigious ceremony in Titanic Hotel on November 22nd, hosted by TV personality, Pamela Ballantine, and each will receive SuperValu vouchers. The overall SuperValu SuperStar will walk away with £1000 for themselves and a £1000 donation to a registered charity of their choice.\n\nJudge and host of SuperValu SuperStars, Pamela Ballantine, said: “I\u0027m thrilled to be part of this amazing initiative which rewards those who are doing good in communities right across Northern Ireland. There is a lot of incredible work being done by individuals who work at social enterprise companies and community groups, as well as adults and kids, that goes completely unrewarded. We hope to shine a light on just some of these people and I can’t wait to meet all of our finalists on November 22 in the Titanic Hotel.”\n\nStephen Bogle, continued “Often in our society people don’t get the recognition they deserve SuperValu SuperStars will celebrate the contribution real life SuperStars make in our communities. Through this exciting initiative, we are proud to provide a platform to honour people and their organisations whose selflessness, commitment and determination make this such a great place to live.\n\n“We’re calling on everyone to get involved - if your friend, teacher, nurse, family member, neighbour, work colleague or someone in your community deserves recognition, this is your chance to give them their moment in the spotlight.”\n\nIt’s easy to nominate your SuperValu SuperStar – just log onto \nwww.supervalu\n and fill in the nomination form.\n\nSuperValu SuperStars media partners are The Sun and U105 and is sponsored by Denny, Action Cancer, Robinsons and Dove.\n\nFor further information and to nominate your local SuperStar, visit \nwww.supervalu\n.

One lady I’m dealing with who is looking for a house in the Waterside sent her application at the start of March.\n\n“Since then her situation has gotten worse as she was taken into hospital with a suspected heart attack brought on by the pressures of living in the environment she’s in. More evidence has to be sent, and neither the first or second part of the application have been looked at.\n\n“She has been told by NIHE that they don’t know when the points will be added and these points are the difference between her getting housed and not.”\n\nHe said the Housing Executive is in desperate need of more resources as two or three people are having to work through a ‘heavy case load’.\n\n“There seems to be a backlog with all these cases lying on somebody’s desk and this has to be cleared. That is then impacting the most vulnerable people here in Derry.”\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\nThe NIHE website states in special circumstances applicants may have needs which mean they require intensive care and support. \n\n“This need may be met in a specialist housing scheme,” it states. “Where additional support or care services are provided or in general housing where a tailored support and care package has been arranged.\n\n“A detailed assessment of support and care needs will be carried out where necessary. Where a specialist scheme is considered appropriate, applicants will be placed on a separate, non-pointed waiting list.\n\n“Where support and care can be provided within general housing, applicants may be awarded additional points under the health and social wellbeing category.”\n\nHowever, there have been issues processing applications in a timely manner which occurs when the Housing Executive has to manage cases from other Housing Associations or referrals from a Health and Social Care Trust which have to be assessed at its Regional Office.\n\nA spokesperson for the Housing Executive acknowledged that it has been experiencing ‘temporary’ delays in assessing complex needs cases.\n\nShe commented: “The Housing Executive manages applications for social housing under the Housing Selection Scheme.\n\n“The vast majority of applications and transfer applications are assessed by our local office staff with no delay. However, there are a limited number of cases that require applicants with intense care and/or support needs – complex needs – to be assessed by Regional Office staff. This includes transfer applications from housing associations identified as requiring complex needs assessment, as well as direct referrals from the Health and Social Services Trusts.\n\n“It is difficult to determine timescales as there may be several agencies or departments that we must consult during the assessment process.\n\n“The Housing Executive can confirm that we are experiencing a temporary delay in assessing complex needs cases in our North Region office. We apologise this may be causing distress to some applicants, and are working to have this resolved as quickly as possible.”\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"newtown all the pictures from the get newtown moving event","story":"\nGet Newtown Moving last Saturday 18th August, 2018..Pictured are Newtown Rocks!

Following the failure of management to respond to this offer, the unions have been left with no choice but to proceed to a consultative ballot on industrial action.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoThis is a historic mark of shame for the council as this is the first time that all four unions representing the workforce have jointly balloted for action.\n\nIn a statement issued yesterday the council said that it was disappointed to learn that the trade unions had issued the press statement without giving pre-notice.\n\nIt says: \u0026ldquoThe statement issued by the Joint Trade Union Side came as a surprise, not least because the council had been in discussions with the unions up until Friday, August 24, where it was agreed by both sides that a meeting would take place on September 3, to be chaired by the Labour Relations Agency.\n\n\u0026ldquoWe were disappointed then to see the unions issue a pre-emptive statement on Bank Holiday Monday that we were given no notice of, nor were we contacted to respond to its contents.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoTrade Union representatives have been part of the job matching process for every post, except one where they declined the invitation to take part.

Such was the demand that people were even contacting me on Saturday night to see if we had any spare tickets, he said.\n\nLocal priests who attended the mass were Fr Gerry McCloskey from Ardglass and Fr Brian Brown of St Patrick\u0026rsquos in Ballynahinch.\n\nChurch of Ireland Dean Henry Hull from Down Cathedral travelled on the coaches with the pilgrims and tweeted after his experience \u0026mdash \u0026ldquoSafely home after a very blessed and uplifting day in Dublin #PapalVisit.\n\nDespite the visit being viewed a difficult one as Pope Francis was being called upon to address the many instances of institutional abuse and clerical sexual abuse of children and women in the island\u0026rsquos recent history, parishioners were still excited to see and eager to listen to the words of their spiritual leader.\n\nDownpatrick man Jackie Breen, who attends St Patrick\u0026rsquos Church, says that the experience of seeing his spiritual leader will stay with him for a lifetime.\n\nHe made sure to make the visit special for his family by personally attending the earlier Festival of Families events on Thursday and Friday, attending the Croke Park concert with his wife Tracey and daughter Lucy and then the Phoenix Park mass on Sunday with his son Dylan.\n\n\u0026ldquoPope John Paul gave us the blessing of peace in Ireland when he spoke here and that was also\u0026nbsp seen in Europe a few years later and I believe that Pope Francis has left us with the special blessing of hope and healing in his visit, said Mr Breen.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a message of hope and healing not just for Catholics but for all Christians.\n\nHe added that the entire Festival of Families and the Pope\u0026rsquos words helped to underline how crucial the role that families have in global society.\n\nMcCartan Digney , says that he felt very emotional about the entire experience.\n\nHe travelled with his mother Louise to Phoenix Park and proudly carried the yellow and white Papal flag that she had when she went to see Pope John Paul at the youth Mass in Galway.\n\n\u0026ldquoEver since I watched a TV documentary about nine years on the 30th anniversary of Pope John Paul\u0026rsquos visit, I\u0026rsquove wanted to see our Holy Father myself and kept the flag for my chance and I couldn\u0026rsquot believe that I got the chance to do so, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt was very emotional from all the singing and the long walk there. There were tears of joy and tears of sadness\u0026nbsp when Pope Francis acknowledged for the first time the hurt that has been done, but it really needed to be said and it was good to hear the words from the head of our church.\n\nFor Mark Ferris from Drumaness and his partner Kathleen Oliver, their attendance in Dublin during the entire Papal visit was the highlight of a very religious week.\n\nEarlier in the week while holidaying in Portugal, the couple visited the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima.\n\nMr Ferris was a boy of eight when he last saw a serving pope in Ireland when Pope John Paul II visited in 1979.\n\nHowever, he watched the mass at Drogheda, estimated to have nearly attracted 1.3m people, on the television at home with his family.\n\nFor this visit, Mr Ferris says he was determined not to miss out.\n\n\u0026ldquoMy partner had arranged for us to go to Dublin for the Pope\u0026rsquos visit as a birthday celebration but I would have been there no matter what.\n\n\u0026ldquoThis experience was something that I would never will forget and well worth the blisters I have on my feet in walking the five or six miles to Phoenix Park.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoWhen the Pope did his tour of Dublin, we were really close when he pass by and I believe he looked directly at me.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe concert was absolutely brilliant as was the Mass and we really enjoyed the entire weekend.\n\nSouth Down MLA Colin McGrath also attended Sunday\u0026rsquos Papal Mass.\n\nWhile he represented the SDLP along with deputy Nicola Mallon, he travelled down as part of the Downpatrick and Lecale parish group.\n\nHe said that the event was notable for the number of young people who attended.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe atmosphere was electric and it was a special moment when the Pope arrived.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe overall theme of his visit was obviously \u0026lsquofamilies\u0026rsquo and it was great to see so many families there together too. There was a great connection amongst the Downpatrick Parish group with over 200 travelling together. \n\nHe added: \u0026ldquoPope Francis also sent a special message of forgiveness and healing for the Church\u0026rsquos involvement in difficult matters in the past which was important too.\n\n\u0026ldquoAll together, it was a fabulous event which will be remembered for a generation.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"}]
