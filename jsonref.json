Both of my children were born on air, my ex spouse went to prison on the show\u0027. Pictured: Phaedra with her ex husband Apollo Nida and their two sons together Ayden and Dylan         Parks claims she\u0027s \u0027happy\u0027 and \u0027excited\u0027 after finally hooking the guy of her dreams after a year long search of the \u0027man pond\u0027. But while Parks is coy about sharing the identity of her new hunk, DailyMailTV can reveal she\u0027s in fact dating handsome actor Medina Islam (pictured together) who is ten years her juniorSo what\u0027s next for the multi-talented Parks? \u0027Well, I have a new television project on the horizon,\u0027 she reveals.\u0027I can\u0027t mention it yet, but I\u0027m coming back to the small screen. It\u0027s a very popular show and you get to see me in a totally different light.\u0027With a possible new TV show on a horizon, keeping a schedule for Parks is somewhat of a feat in itself. Not only is she a busy mom-of-two, she is a partner in a hectic law firm in Atlanta, a celebrity and contracted model for Wilhelmina Models, and she also runs her own foundation for disadvantaged children and is heavily involved in community activism.But on top of that - and most unusually - Parks is a qualified mortician, embalmer and funeral director as well as a certified cremator, tending to people\u0027s dead relatives.\u0027I\u0027m keeping the dead beautiful and preserved for Jesus,\u0027 she explains.Not only is she a busy mom-of-two, she is a partner in a hectic law firm in Atlanta, a celebrity and contracted model for Wilhelmina Models, and she also runs her own foundation for disadvantaged children and is heavily involved in community activism.          Parks (second from left) hints in part-two of an exclusive interview with DailyMailTV, airing on Friday, that she has considered returning to The Real Housewives of Atlanta\u0027My life is very busy, I\u0027m fully booked, everybody knows I\u0027m a mortician and summer is the slow season.\u0027I\u0027m partnered with one of the largest funeral homes in Atlanta so I do a lot of bodies there.\u0027I also go to New Orleans and do some bodies there, you know, whoever calls me, I\u0027m a genius at it. I love it. It\u0027s my ministry. And so if you call me, I will come because that\u0027s my specialty.\u0027I love making people look life-like and giving people the proper sendoff.\u0027Parks reveals she was inspired to become a mortician after one of her friends was killed in New Orleans and began volunteering at a funeral home before going to school to get qualified.These days she gets special requests from people who know her from television to care for their loved ones in death and she claims to have buried a number of celebrities herself.She says she wears an elegant black dress, a hat and veil and black lace gloves with the fingers cut out so she can handle the bodies.   "},{"url":null,"title":"James Cracknell pictured stunning new woman side","story":"Share this article A source told MailOnline of the blossoming friendship: \u0027They have become very close and since his marriage break up there are few people who would deny him the support of an attractive young woman.\u0027The end of James\u0027 marriage to Bev has been amicable and friendly but there\u0027s always going to be regret and maybe loneliness when something like that happens so it\u0027s great he\u0027s going his own way.\u0027 Cracknell\u0027s new friend, whose family live in New York, is a member of the \u0027Cambridge Cougars\u0027, a university cheerleading team who support students at sports events. The Olympic gold winning rower - who became the oldest rower to win the boat race for Cambridge earlier this year - announced his split from Beverley in April, as first revealed by Mail Online. Beverley, 45, has remained in the family home in Chiswick, west London with their three children a son aged 15, and two daughters aged 10 and eight.

After the referendum the Government was very clear back then that Brexit meant Brexit and that we were going to leave the EU.\u0027Instead we had a range of third-party anti-Brexit organisations and positions that chose to go to the court to derail basically the whole Brexit delivery and also to tie the hands of politicians, the Government and Parliament.\u0027That is simply not acceptable and quite frankly the British public are sick to death of this, they want to see a government now, with renewed conviction, get out there and do exactly what it said it will do, which is now to deliver Brexit.\u0027This should not be about the semantics of Parliament or just votes in Parliament or proroguing Parliament.

She had a considerable reputation as a photographer but, in the years to come, it seems to me, we will cherish her still more warmly and regard her work even more highly. The black-and-white pictures from the 1930s and 40s – kids playing in the streets, old people keeping a watchful eye on the neighbourhood – have a lyrical grace and a rough-and-tumble tenderness. The kids are having a lot of fun – even if that fun involves someone getting hurt – and it’s fun looking at the pictures. They’re easy on the eye in the way that Anna Karenina is easy to read compared with Ulysses. Henri Cartier-Bresson was a decisive influence but Levitt seemed happy to survey the flow of life casually going about its unruly business rather than pouncing on instants of suddenly perfect visual geometry. Her photographic moments, as a result, contain entire childhoods, whole lifetimes of everyday disappointment and routine happiness: the kind of stuff we associate with narrative fiction rather than photographs.In the 1950s she began shooting in colour – not as a formal experiment but as a natural extension of the urge James Agee had observed in the earlier black-and-white work: “to perceive the aesthetic reality within the existing world”. When almost all of this colour work was stolen by a burglar she started afresh in 1971.This picture is part of a retrospective of Levitt’s work now on show at Arles photography festival. I like fondly to think that Levitt had photographed the lady in the marbled blue dress on the left before, Seven Up!-style, caught in a similar gesture of playful triumph – now that she’s old it might just be backache – when they were both young, in the 1930s. But the other woman, on the right, haven’t I seen her before too, at exactly the age she is now, looking on with that same attitude of rough-hewn, nosy resignation, in black-and-white pictures from before the war? There is, in other words, something timely and eternal about Levitt. So while her city has changed, has become, in many ways, a playground for the young and affluent, this picture also depicts a distinctively 21st-century scenario: Airbnb guests, with all their luggage, wondering when their host is going to show up. Help is, as they say, at hand it’s just that no one knows what form it might take.• Helen Levitt: Observing New York’s Streets is at Espace Van Gogh, Arles photography festival, until 22 September"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00e7be5ebad82db01750cfa72eebb354dff3b229/35_121_1212_727/master/1212.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c43a6965b32b11184ad2da9710f2a8d","title":"a feast for the photographers eye in pictures","story":"Colour has been a lifelong obsession for New York-based photographer Lucia Fainzilber, and her latest project, The Cookbook, explores nine different shades. “Each of these dishes,” she says, “presents a different combination of ingredients, all of which coexist in an attempt to create a harmonic feast for the eye.” Fainzilber, who is originally from Argentina, says the colours of New York are a big influence. “One of the things I love about living here is the variety of ingredients and ethnic food you can find.

But it is precisely because communications have changed so much that the main responsibility for avoiding information that discloses a plot line, the fate of a character or the result of a sports contest is shifting from media professionals to inidual audience members.Multiple devices, streaming services, binge viewing, from-the-couch conversations in real time via social media and liveblogs have changed the way we consume entertainment. One editor recalled to me a complaint that the death of a character in the US crime drama The Wire had been revealed in an article published 10 years after the episode had aired. The aggrieved reader was following the five-series story on DVD.A few weeks from public release of anything is too long to expect media professionals to protect you from knowledge of its outcomes. A day? It depends, was the view of several editors when I asked how they manage spoiler alerts. Factors to consider include the type of content, the significance of the particular detail, inherent newsworthiness and the time since the material first became available. For example, if it was released in another timezone and your readers are not likely to have an opportunity to watch it until that evening in their timezone, a review or recap might need particular care. Vigilance is always required, even with the selection of still images from a fresh episode. Although merely an illustration to accompany text, and officially supplied, the image may be enough to indicate to fans what has happened. A sign of a changing environment is what might be called the pre-emptive or teaser spoiler, such as the news that the writer of half of the first series of the TV drama Killing Eve, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, plans to write and play a character to be murdered by the assassin Villanelle (Jodie Comer) in a forthcoming series.Film reviewers have well established conventions to avoid spoilers, but I’m told that challenges do arise. For instance, when a whole film turns on a final-scene twist, how do you review it without discussing that? Promotional trailers for films seem at times to reveal more of its plot points than would reviewers.A TV convention almost as old as broadcasting is the “look away now” warning before fresh sports results appear on screen, so that those who want to watch later highlights packages can take steps to avoid premature knowledge. This courtesy still has its place, but a shrinking one in an expanding media world.One editor observed that readers consume sports coverage “sometimes as if it is news and sometimes as if it is a piece of art.

Yet 160,000 Conservative party members will land us, almost certainly, with yet another Etonian prime minister, the 20th in our history. Whether the UK ends up being led by Boris Johnson or Jeremy Hunt, one thing is certain: the winner will be the private school sector.Access to such an education is available to wealthy households, and only those with incomes above £120,000 send children in appreciable numbers to private schools. This walling-off of one section of society from another is damaging. The disparity in funding also creates unequal opportunities. In Engines of Privilege: Britain’s Private School Problem, by Francis Green and David Kynaston, the authors calculate that private schools spend about three times as much per pupil as the state does. When Mr Johnson makes a commitment to ensure fair funding across schools in England, he doesn’t mean levelling the state sector upwards to private school standards so that ordinary students can fairly compete with their richer peers in exams, for access to high-status universities and ultimately similarly attain fortunes in their work lives that reflect their abilities, not their parents’ income.Michael Gove, who served as education secretary under David Cameron, has suggested a desire to abolish private schools “by stealth”. There is good reason to ask why we permit a section of rich people to secede, in educational terms, from the rest of the nation. What is being purchased is social privilege. It cannot be right that the freedom to spend one’s money to buy a head start in life at the expense of everyone else prevails when the widespread antisocial effects of such practices are so obvious. The temper of the times is to resolve economic and social injustice. Private schools cannot be exempted from that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2093a8d1ea9a4d1d76a85d136eb3d1c698fd0886/0_350_7740_4644/master/7740.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f455145e495adfec172445b2da1afb84","title":"up on the roof pushing cricket to new heights","story":"A lack of space at one east London school didn’t prevent it from putting cricket at the heart of breaktime and giving children the chance to shineCricket matches have been played in some unorthodox locations: 5,730 metres up Kilimanjaro, underwater in Derbyshire’s River Derwent, and among the penguins of Antarctica.So perhaps pitching up on a school roof doesn’t seem so strange after all. When pupils at Hague primary school in Bethnal Green, east London, said they wanted to play cricket, there was a problem – the playground had very little space and no grass at all.“It was like a Victorian yard,” recalls headteacher, Judy Coles. So the school built a rooftop playground, complete with concertinaing cricket nets.Coach Soyfur Rahman was 11 when he arrived in England from Bangladesh 15 years ago. He spoke hardly any English and found the transition a “great shock” at first. He remembers with a smile the joy of playing on the roof. “I loved it,” he says. “I was always trying to hit the ball past the nets and off the roof.”He wasn’t the only one – he remembers that when England cricketers Michael Vaughan and Alastair Cook visited the school they also tried to hit the ball for six. No wonder the school insisted that a soft ball was used!Cricket helped the 11-year-old to integrate. He had played street cricket in Bangladesh and when he started playing the game at his new school he quickly began to learn English. “I was the only Bengali speaker in the team, so that made me learn English quicker,” says Rahman, who is now 26.“Listening to my teammates I started to pick up words. Thanks to cricket, I learned English quicker than other kids from Bangladesh. It also gave me a lot of confidence.”When the staff noticed that Rahman had a special talent, Coles helped him to get involved with local cricket clubs. He also received coaching from Chance to Shine, the charity that aims to give all children the opportunity to play, learn and develop through cricket.Rahman credits his success to the coaching courses run by the charity. “They really help coaches to get better and show us how to get the best out of the kids,” he says. “Whatever support I needed, Chance to Shine provided. Then Middlesex hired me to deliver what I’d learned.”He says the charity’s support of young people is transformative, and helps to put them on the right path. “Rather than hanging round on the street, they can play cricket and take a different direction in their lives,” he says.NatWest has been supporting cricket for almost 40 years. It works with Chance to Shine to help create opportunities such as Rahman’s, and keep programmes like this free of charge – something Rahman says is vital.“Among the south-Asian community here, money is a problem. And if you play club cricket the usual way you have to pay for membership, bats, pads, helmet, gloves, bags and shoes. That’s a lot of money, and would be a barrier for many people. But with Chance to Shine projects you don’t need to spend anything. It’s free. You can just turn up, have a game and go home.”For Coles, unearthing and supporting a talent like Rahman’s is life-affirming. Cricket has been her passion since childhood, when she sat at the boundary and proudly watched her grandfather play.She describes it as “an absolute pleasure” to watch children playing team games and developing their skills. “You get children who start not knowing one end of the bat from another and then become good players,” she says. “They develop such confidence.”She also gets parents involved, to make it a family affair. “None of us have great talent, but we have enthusiasm – and we want children to have fun,” she says.Coles says Chance to Shine is “really good at getting cricket into schools, particularly in the inner cities” and believes the charity’s team are “fantastic ambassadors for the game”.With the charity’s support, some of her pupils were invited to open up the London Stock Exchange with cricket legend Devon Malcolm. They have also been taken to see Test matches at Lord’s and the Oval.The school has built a strong cricket culture and the pupils are enthused by the sport – the girls are particularly passionate about the game. “You see them getting involved at lunchtime,” says Coles. “I’m really proud of that.”Rahman thinks that this summer will be the one where cricket really captures the mood of the nation. “With the work Chance to Shine is doing, and the World Cup and Ashes taking place, I think there will be more interest in cricket than ever before,” he says. “That is really positive.”For almost four decades, NatWest has supported cricket, with a mission to make the game easier for everyone to play and enjoy.A proud partner of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and the charity Chance to Shine, NatWest champions cricket at all levels – from grassroots support for local clubs and getting more people involved in the game to supporting current and future England stars and helping fans cheer on their teams, however and wherever they choose.With NatWest, cricket is a game that has #NoBoundaries.

Welcome to Ottawa – Canada’s bustling capitalMondayOttawa’s most notable building is its majestic gothic parliament and it’s one of the landmarks you can take in when exploring the city on foot. Try Ottawa Walking Tours, Ottawa Free Tours, or your own river- and canal-side wanderings on paths around Parliament Hill. For bygone tales of brawling French and Irish gangs, don’t miss the city history on show at the old stone Bytown Museum. Finish the day at ByWard Market, the hub of the city’s most happening central district and one of Canada’s oldest and biggest public markets. Shop the unique stores along the market streets and cobblestone courtyards. You can sip on a locally brewed craft beer and try a gourmet hotdog at Tavern on the Hill, with a spectacular view of Parliament Hill.TuesdayIf the weather’s fair then don’t wait to head to the Gatineau Hills. The Gatineau Park Visitor Centre will help you choose the right hiking trail and is located in the village of Chelsea, where the Nordik Spa-Nature vies with Le Pub Chelsea as the best place to unravel after a day in the hills. Which is better: a view of Ottawa’s twinkling city lights from a hot tub, or a craft brew in a gregarious country tavern? Best do both to check.With both central Ottawa and its most attractive park under your belt, it’s time to explore everything in between. This is best done by bike and RentABike has a good selection of tours and downloadable routes. Key options follow the city’s waterways: the Rideau canal loop connects attractive neighbourhoods such as Little Italy and The Glebe with waterfalls the longer Ottawa River paths provide grand city views.Before you head out, limber up at the free drop-in Parliament Hill yoga session (summer Wednesdays at noon). You’ll be among hundreds, so no need to worry about smooth moves – though PM Justin Trudeau has been known to pop by and greet participants. Try trendy Hintonburg for a delicious meal at Supply and Demand or Bar Laurel.At least one day in Ottawa should be devoted to its terrific national museums – they’re all free on Thursdays 5-8pm, though three hours is rarely enough. With Canada’s National Museums Passport, you can choose admission to any three museums for just $35.Guarded by a giant Louise Bourgeois spider sculpture, the National Gallery of Canada is memorable for its indigenous art. If you like this, then visit the ethnographic collections of the wide-ranging Canadian Museum of History, whose on-site Children’s Museum is in a class of its own for educational interactive play.There’s more education and play, along with painstakingly made dioramas of wildlife habitats, at the Canadian Museum of Nature. For a change of pace, try the Canadian War Museum, whose coverage of Canadian conflicts and military hardware collection is moving and engaging. There’s also the chance to continue your museum visit after hours – on specific Fridays the Canadian Museum of Nature turns the museum into an adult zone, with music and mingling.You could grab a nightcap at Copper Spirits \u0026amp Sights, the rooftop patio of the Andaz Ottawa Byward Market hotel, and watch the sunset.Enjoy Ottawa’s out-of-town attractions before the weekend crowds arrive. Parc Omega is a Canadian safari park with deer, elk, caribou, bison, bears and wolves – you can even feed many of them. There’s more action to be found at the Great Canadian Bungee, where North America’s highest jump (61 metres) and a giant zip-line are located beside a pleasant little beach and picnic spot (for non-thrillseekers). From June to September, you can also get your thrills white-water rafting – try River Run Rafting or Wilderness Tours Packages for organised trips on the Ottawa River. For a more vintage experience, don flying goggles with Ottawa Biplane Adventures, which offers open-cockpit city tours from its base at the Canadian Museum of Space and Aviation, itself a worthwhile aeronautical outing. Back in town you may round the day off with an After Dark Tour, a walking tour that recounts some seedy and grisly history before dropping you at the free Northern Lights show, a must-see nightly laser-light extravaganza at the parliament from early July to early September.Ottawa’s neighbourhoods bustle most on Saturdays. Breakfast on the Golden Triangle’s Elgin Street, visit the home of the city’s LGBT community on Bank Street, have lunch in Chinatown then head to the hipster frontier of Hintonburg to pick up repurposed souvenirs by local artists and craftspeople at Maker House, such as coat hooks made from an old ice hockey stick. It’s also from here that brewery tour operator Brew Donkey strikes out on fun five-hour weekend tours of local craft beer breweries in an old school bus.Sunday is farmers’ market day in Ottawa and the biggest option is the Ottawa Farmers’ Market in the Glebe, a blue-collar-gone-hip neighbourhood where old-school independent shops and restaurants thrive. Don’t miss Kettleman’s, a longstanding 24-hour place where you can watch and smell bagels being baked. The Glebe’s TD Place is where the Redblacks play Canadian football, Ottawa Fury play football (or rather soccer), and the Ottawa 67’s play ice hockey. Between them, there’s at least one fixture most weeks, often on Sundays.

That is all. My kofte usually come with cumin, cinnamon and garlic. This recipe’s seasoning is simpler because of its accompanying lentil sauce with sweet, golden onions, coriander and turmeric.The finely minced lamb is easy to shape into balls. You twist off pieces the size of a golf ball and roll them between your palms as if it was cookie dough. Like any fritter, patty or rissole, these will hold their shape better if you chill them for half an hour before you cook them.I cook mine twice: once in sizzling oil to form a glossy crust (if they don’t spit at you, the flame isn’t high enough), then again in a deep, rust-hued pool of sauce in the oven. There is much sauce – enough to make you reach for a spoon or a crust to clean your plate.Bean rissoles are stickier trickier to roll. Dust your palms with flour to stop the mashed beans sticking. You can use boiled and skinned broad beans or crushed tinned haricot but I like the flavour and texture of edamame, which I buy frozen. Whichever beans you use, they will need seasoning with garlic – and herbs such as coriander and chives or, for haricot, finely chopped thyme.In lieu of a sauce I make a sticky dip, glossy with honey and spiked with ginger and lime juice. The green patties are fried till they have a fragile, golden crust then plunged, hot from the pan, into the dip, as bright and shiny as lip gloss.Most frozen edamame is already cooked, ready to beat to a cloud of green mash with olive oil or butter or to scatter in a salad of iced noodles, mint and coriander leaves and matchsticks of cucumber.You could substitute new broad beans for the edamame, but be prepared to pod and skin a lot of beans in order to get 500g. Frozen beans are fine. Cook them in boiling, lightly salted water, then pop them from their pale, papery skins before mashing, seasoning and rolling them.Serves 4For the dipping sauce:honey 2 tbspsoy sauce 2 tbspmirin 1 tbsprice vinegar 1 tbspgrated ginger 1 tbsplime 1groundnut or vegetable oil for shallow fryingDefrost the edamame. Bring a deep saucepan of lightly salted water to the boil. Add the edamame and cook for 15-20 minutes till tender, then drain in a colander. Remove the parsley leaves from their stalks. Roughly chop the chives. Peel the garlic. Transfer the edamame to a food processor, add the parsley leaves, the coriander leaves and stems, the chives and garlic and reduce to a thick purée.Shape the mixture into 16 equally sized balls weighing roughly 40g each, flattening them slightly as you go. Place them on a tray and refrigerate.Make the dipping sauce. Put the honey, soy sauce, mirin, rice vinegar and grated ginger in a small saucepan. Slowly bring to the boil. Remove from the heat. Halve and squeeze the lime and stir the juice into the dipping sauce and set aside.Warm a thin layer of groundnut or vegetable oil in a pan. Place the fritters in the hot oil and fry gently over a moderate heat, for about 4 or 5 minutes, until the undersides are toasted, then turn and cook the other side.Serve hot, with the dipping sauce.Za’atar is the herb mixture I use most often. The soft, khaki-coloured powder, a mix of ground oregano, thyme and sesame, brings a musky warmth to sautéed chicken and grilled lamb, to roasted squashes and steamed grains. The za’atar I have now was brought back from Lebanon and is still redolent of the oregano and wild thyme growing on the hillsides. The mixes available here are fragrant too, but buy them in sealed packets rather than from open sacks where their magic is prone to disappear.Serves 4Peel and finely chop the onion. Warm 4 tbsp of the oil in an ovenproof shallow pan, add the onions and cook over a low heat for about 20 minutes until they are soft. Peel the garlic, finely crush and stir into the softening onion.Put the lamb into a mixing bowl, add the za’atar and shape into 8 balls. Place the balls on a tray and refrigerate for 30 minutes.Meanwhile, stir the ground cumin, coriander and turmeric into the onions and cook over a low heat for 5 minutes. Pour in the stock, bring to the boil, then stir in the lentils and turn the heat down to a simmer and leave for 20 minutes. Set the oven at 200Cgas mark 6.Warm the remaining oil in a frying pan, add the lamb balls and let them fry till the underside is golden. Roll the balls over and let them sizzle till golden, then lift them out and lower them into the lentil sauce. Bake the lamb and lentils for 25 minutes, then stir in a little fresh coriander and serve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93bda4381520f74ed4481812c1885fb5a9adee4d/0_251_4369_2622/master/4369.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=842db9e5bc2196da6e993a0a72a51691","title":"recipe that reminds me of home souvlaki somali bean stew","story":"Greek souvlaki, Somali bean stew, Indonesian omelette – dishes that take our cooks back to their rootsThe key to Somali cooking is xawaash spice mix – translated it means “the essentials”. It’s often described as in between ras el hanout and garam masala, which is how I think of Somali food: in between Arabic and Indian, with African thrown in. When you make it, it will come as no surprise to know Somalia was called “Regio Aromatica”, or the aromatic isles, by the ancient Romans.Xawaash is made family to family, so my mum’s is the one I make, although she sometimes adds turmeric to hers. You adapt it depending on what you have, but I’ve got a consistent recipe that reminds me of her cooking.My idea of home is tied in with my mum’s cooking. I was born in Kuwait. My mum was probably born in Ethiopia she was a nomadic herder. My dad is from the city, from Hargeisa in Somaliland. They moved to Kuwait, had children and then they separated and we came to London in 1985. Civil unrest had been rumbling in Somaliland, so we didn’t go back. Mum wanted her daughters to be educated, and Somali culture can be sexist, although it also celebrates strong women. I named my supper club after Arawelo, a fearsome Somali queen who led a women’s army. We lived in Harlesden, in north-west London, which had Caribbean and African shops. But Mum would also take two buses to get spices and things like fresh tamarind from the Indian shops on Ealing Road. I used to help her out in the kitchen when I was young but was rubbish at it. I felt that girls were expected to help with cooking but boys weren’t, so that pissed me off. When I left London I missed her food, so had to learn it for myself. Ful – we call it maraq digir – is a great way to feed a big family. Beans are cheap, and the xawaash is a good way of adding lots of flavour. People know about ful medames from Egypt, but the dish goes all the way down east Africa to Sudan. We would have that for brunch on Saturday, made with tinned adzuki beans, fried onions and lots of green chillies, fresh coriander, fresh tomatoes – and the xaawash spice mix. When my mum had less money she would get bones with tiny bits of meat left on. She was feeding so many – she’d make enough for 20 people a day. Us and our friends who’d be round, or people from the Somali community. We didn’t eat much English food, and of course I wanted fish and chips and pizza. Now I appreciate it all. My mum taught us to have a palate. If I go into a fancy restaurant, I don’t have to like it. Not because I grew up poor, Somali or as a refugee, or because I don’t understand western flavours. I just might not like it. But if you’re outside that world you can feel uncomfortable trusting your own judgment. It sometimes feels like the food world is for a particular class, a particular place, a particular kind of person who is a “foodie”. Everyone eats food, so I don’t know what defines a foodie. My mum is an amazing chef. She’s illiterate, she grew up as a nomadic herder, but has an instinctive way of making food that is good and tasty.

Once you can smell this, take it off the heat.Use a coffee grinder or pestle and mortar to grind everything down to a powder.If you want to make a big batch, just double the quantities, and it should last in an airtight container in the dark for up to 3 weeks. It can last longer, but the potency deteriorates – I use a lot of xawaash, so I get through it quickly.To make the maraq digir, whizz up the coriander, tomatoes and chillies in a blender. Sometimes I add fresh ginger to give it an extra boost. Put the mixture to one side.In a saucepan, boil the adzuki beans for about 20 minutes. (You can also use tinned fava beans.) Fry the sliced onion slowly in the olive oil until slightly caramelised. Stir in the xawaash spice blend. Fry a little longer, then add the coriander and tomato mixture, with some tomato paste. Add salt to taste.Leave to simmer for about 20 minutes, adding a little water if needed. Add the beans and cook for another 15-20 minutes, then mash some of the beans.I like it with feta and black olives and lots of olive oil on top. Serve with pita or naan bread, za’atar and olive oil.Arawelo Eats supper club in aid of the Leading Lights youth charity is on 27 July araweloeatsEver since I was little, I’ve craved new flavours. I always loved seafood, and this dish was my favourite. My mum or grandma prepared it on special occasions and it represents flavours from the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.When I was growing up in Mexico City, living by the coast was the dream. In the late 1990s, places opened in Mexico City that evoked the marisquerías, the seafood restaurants of Veracruz, which is the state where arroz a la tumbada comes from. They weren’t glamorous but 20 years ago they were cool. They were neighbourhood places where the seafood was amazing and brought in from the coast. There is one called Contramar that’s still going, and is one of my favourite places. We’d go a lot, for the food, and the son jarocho, the music of Veracruz. Without travelling, I could be taken to the coast. It doesn’t matter where I am, arroz a la tumbada will send me to Mexico and give me that feeling of being happy.There’s a lot of Spanish influences in our cuisine, so this is a paella adapted to Mexico. There are no rules for the seafood you use, as long as there’s a combination. Like lots of Mexican dishes, it’s created so people can adapt to what’s around. White fish, clams, crab, prawns – whatever you have is what’s perfect. Now that I live in London, I add fennel and dill. In Mexico we use parsley, coriander, Mexican oregano and epazote, a very aromatic herb that’s difficult to find here. Instead of long-grain rice I use arborio, which I think makes more sense, being closer to the Mediterranean. I feel very grateful that I’ve had many homes. My wife Natalie is half-Mexican and half-English, she was born and raised and studied in the UK. When I go away, I miss London. But I still sometimes miss Mexico, and it’s mainly because of the food. Tacos and tequila are easy to get now, but the flavour that always lifts me out of homesickness is smoky chillies. If I feel homesick I can now get or make the food I want. At the beginning when I moved here I couldn’t say this, but London is home.

Recaudo in Mexico is a special blend of spices, herbs and chillies, and like many dishes in Mexican cuisine, it is the secret of our abuelitas, our grandmothers.Place the tomatoes, onion and garlic on an oven tray, drizzle with rapeseed oil and bake in the oven for about 25 minutes.I recommend using a variety of good quality tomatoes seasonal local tomatoes during the summer in the UK are amazing, such as those from the Isle of Wight.While the tomatoes are in the oven, place the dried chipotle chillies in a small bowl, cover with boiling water and rest until they become soft. Once softened, remove the seeds. Reserve the soaking water.Take the tomatoes out of the oven and pour them with the juices into a blender, add the soft chipotle chillies, the salt and a little of the soaking water, if necessary, and blend to a very smooth paste. Set aside.For the rice, in a paella-like pan heat a tablespoon of the rapeseed oil and 3 tablespoons of the butter. Add the fish and prawns, season with a bit of salt and sear them until they get some colour on each side. It’s important to use a really hot pan and not to overcook them. Remove them from the pan and set aside.In the same pan add the remaining oil and butter and the sliced fennel, and fry slowly until it softens and caramelises.Add the rice and keep stirring. Once it is lightly fried, pour in the tomato-chipotle recaudo, add the stock a little at a time and stir frequently until the rice is fully cooked.Three-quarters of the way through adding the liquid, and just before the rice absorbs all of it, add the seared prawns and fish and let them cook through. The rice should be al dente. Season with salt and coarse black pepper to taste.Finish by generously squeezing the lemon juice over and add fresh dill leaves, a few sprigs of mint and parsley, and the tomatoes. Serve warm, making sure everybody gets some of the fish and prawns, as well as the fresh herbs and tomatoes. Enjoy with your family and pair it with a crisp, fresh lager or glass of wine. santoremedioThe recipe for my grandmother’s omelette reminds me of West Sumatra, where I was born, and my first seven years living there with her. She did all of the cooking. My parents were teachers and they worked every day, so my grandmother gave us all breakfast. Sometimes she would make this omelette. We were an extended, multi-generational family living in one house, so there might have been my young uncle or cousin having breakfast with us. It is quite a filling omelette, so we could choose to have rice porridge or this, but some of my boy cousins might have both! Or, we might take it for lunch with rice.Omelettes are quite universal. I debated when I wrote this recipe whether its origin is Chinese or Dutch. Probably in my household it would be the influence of the Dutch. Both my parents were educated in Dutch schools. My grandmother never went to school – she was rich enough to have teachers at home – but I am not sure where she learned to make this omelette. You never know with Indonesia. When I started to write my cookbook I didn’t know the origin of quite a lot of Indonesian food. Some seems to have come from the Arab countries, through India. A lot of our curries are Indian, and our snacks are very similar to Middle Eastern snacks like borek and falafel. With the Dutch we started making cake, and before the Dutch arrived we had influence from the Chinese. Fried rice was originally Chinese but now it’s famous as Indonesian nasi goreng.After my husband Roger and I got married in Indonesia we came to live in the UK. My children were born here, and this is very much my home. When I moved to the UK, I had to make adjustments to my cooking. I first came here in 1964, and from then until 1969 we did our shopping in Holland. Indonesian food was already being imported there but not to the UK. So I travelled a lot to Amsterdam, Rotterdam or the Hague. We’d go with empty cars and come back with the boots full. And there were quite a lot of Indonesian restaurants to visit there were only two in London.I never really got homesick for Indonesian food, because I’d cook it myself. I could never recommend Indonesian restaurants in London, so whenever friends asked, “Where is the good Indonesian restaurant?” I’d say: “It’s here, in my home.” When I was writing books – I’ve written 15 – I’d give parties as a way of recipe-testing. It was a good excuse to do both. I’d put it in my household budget: my party, an anniversary, Roger’s birthday, or just a party for wanting to give a party. You can’t eat everything yourself.I’m now staying in a care home. I’m not quite settled yet. I have a two-bedroom apartment, but hardly any kitchen. I can still cook for the two of us, me and Roger, and I can still give parties. And I can still make my grandmother’s omelette. I don’t think I put enough garlic in my recipe, so when I make it now for myself, I put a lot of coconut, and a lot of garlic and spring onions so it’s garlicky and oniony as well. I’m very fond of my grandmother and her food makes me feel at home. It gives me comfort, a feeling of, “this is what I’m used to”. HONThis is one of my grandmother’s treats for breakfast. It looks like a cake, and to make the omelette thick she used freshly grated coconut, grated potato or sweet potato. And she would add a dollop of her sambal lado to spice it up. I use sambal ulek when I make this omelette at home. It is made by crushing fresh red chillies with a little salt, using a mortar and pestle. It is available ready-made from Asian food stores and supermarkets.If you want coconut but can’t use fresh, you can use desiccated coconut. It’s a bit sweeter and drier, so you need to soak it for a few minutes and include a little of the liquid.Serves 4 for breakfast or as a light lunch with some saladshallots 2, finely slicedgarlic 1 clove, finely slicedsambal ulek 1 tsp or ½ tsp chilli powderfreshly grated coconut or grated potato or sweet potato 100gsalt ½ tspmilk or cold water 1 tbsp duck eggs 6peanut (groundnut) oil 2 tbspMix together all the ingredients, except the eggs and oil, in a large bowl. Then beat the mixture thoroughly with the eggs – it needs more beating than an ordinary omelette and should be quite fluffy.Heat the oil in a wok until hot. (I find a 25cm non-stick frying pan an easier alternative to a wok.) Carefully spoon the oil over the sides, or tilt and turn the wok or pan so the sides are well coated with oil. Pour the omelette mixture into the hot wok or pan, and while it is still liquid swirl it around so that the omelette is not too thick in the centre. Let it cook for 2-3 minutes. Turn it over carefully (it should be perfectly circular), and cook slowly for another 3-4 minutes until the middle, which of course is still the thickest part, is firm and the whole omelette is lightly browned. The edges should now be delicately crisp.Serve hot or cold, cut up into slices like a cake.From Indonesian Food by Sri Owen (Pavilion Books, £20). To buy a copy for £17.60, go to bookshopUntil I was 13 or 14, my grandparents owned a Greek-Cypriot restaurant called Dirlandas in Tufnell Park, north London. I was born upstairs and lived there for the first few years of my life. Even after we moved out, the restaurant remained the centre of our universe. My dad worked there, and during Christmas or Easter, when the restaurant was shut, everyone would congregate there to celebrate. It was a proper Cypriot taverna with tablecloths and plastic strip curtains. My grandmother would make stuffed vine leaves from scratch for the mezze. And, of course, it had grills where they cooked steaks, chops and souvlakia.That smell of meat over coals is so evocative but when my grandparents shut the restaurant in the mid-90s it disappeared from my life. Around that time, I became vegetarian. My dad had also given up meat and my mum didn’t eat much of it. But when I started working in food in my early 20s, I began eating meat again. One day, during a shoot for a Jamie Oliver book in Athens, someone was cooking souvlakia on the grills and it was like a slap around the face. Never before had a smell conjured up such strong images and emotions. It was like I was back in my grandparents’ restaurant.My grandparents on both sides moved to England in search of a better quality of life and better opportunities. My mum’s dad was an orphan and so poor that the people in his village outside Nicosia would feed him and give him shoes. When he got married to my granny, they moved to England and he got a job in a Wall’s sausage factory. The manager of the factory lent him the money to open up his first deli in Holloway, and he went from nothing to owning a few shops and houses around London. My dad’s parents moved over a bit later. Before they opened the restaurant, my granddad was a barber and my grandma a seamstress. They’re both still alive. My gran is 79 now and she still cooks for our entire family twice a week. My sister and I helped out at the restaurant, but mostly we got in the way. My gran would get us to fill the salt and pepper shakers, or pod peas and broad beans. Food was the centre of our world. It took me a while to realise that, actually, not all 19-year-olds read cookery books all the time or spend three hours making moussaka on a Saturday night when their friends are out getting drunk.My mum made a lot of Cypriot food at home. Any occasion was a feast. Now I’ve taken over that role. For Greek Easter this year, I had everyone round to mine and spent two days making flaounes, the traditional Cypriot Easter pastries, as taught to me by my gran. I love that I’ll be able to pass these traditions on to my daughter, Persephone – she has no choice!Not only do I want to document my family’s recipes, I also want to preserve a sense of our culture and traditions. In my generation, out of all my cousins, only one other person is interested in food. When my grandma finally passes away, who else is going to keep all these food traditions going?Home means lots of noise and chatter, and it always revolves around cooking. As a housewarming present , my dad bought me my own foukou, the motorised grill used for cooking souvlakia. It’s my pride and joy, and that smell is just amazing. It’s my childhood, it’s my grandparents’ restaurant.

Pick and finely chop the rosemary and thyme leaves and add to the pork. Peel and finely grate in the garlic. Season well, then stir in the olive oil and red wine vinegar and cover. Refrigerate and leave to marinate for at least half an hour, longer if possible. If using wooden skewers be sure to soak them in water first to stop them burning.If you are making chips (see below), get them on the go now.Get the sides ready. To make the mustard sauce, mix together the yogurt, mayonnaise, honey and mustard to taste. Season to taste, cover and set aside till needed.Chop the tomatoes and peel and finely slice the onion. Mix them together in a bowl and squeeze over the juice of the lemon. Finely chop the parsley and scatter over the top. Set aside until needed.When you are ready to cook, preheat a griddle pan to a high heat (or get your barbecue going). Thread 4 large skewers (or 8 small ones) with the marinated pork, being careful not to push the pieces too close together, so that they cook thoroughly all the way through. Cook the meat on the hot griddle pan for around 10-12 minutes, turning evenly, until they are charred and cooked through. Warm the pita breads on the side of the griddle or barbecue for a few minutes at the end. Serve everything together and let everyone build their own kebabs – but be sure to finish with a sprinkle of paprika.The cucumber is salted and drained, a small step but a key one, as it gives you an intensely creamy dip – it shouldn’t be at all runny.Serves 4-6cucumber 1sea salt and freshly ground black peppergarlic 1 small clovedried mint 1 tspGreek yogurt 500gextra virgin olive oillemon ½Start by draining the cucumber. Trim it and coarsely grate it into a mixing bowl. Mix in 1 teaspoon of flaky sea salt (if using fine sea salt, use ½ teaspoon), then spoon it into a clean, fine sieve. Leave it to drain over the mixing bowl for 1 hour, stirring occasionally to remove all the liquid.When it is ready, spoon it into a larger mixing bowl. Finely grate in the peeled garlic clove and add the dried mint and a good pinch of ground black pepper.Spoon the yogurt into the fine sieve. You don’t want to press it through, just to remove any excess liquid. When it’s drained, spoon it into the bowl with the grated cucumber, drizzle in 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil, squeeze in a little lemon juice to taste and mix everything together well. Serve finished with a little drizzle of oil on top and sprinkled with a little extra dried mint.This only makes a small quantity, enough for a few chips in the kebabs. If you want more, to eat alongside your meal, then double or triple the quantity.Preheat your oven to 230Cgas mark 8. Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil. Cut the potatoes into chips, around 1cm in thickness. Cook for 2 minutes in the boiling water, then drain in a colander and steam-dry over the hot pan.Place the chips in a large roasting tray, drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with sea salt. Use your hands to toss everything together, making sure that every piece of potato is coated in seasoned oil. Place in the oven for around 35-40 minutes, turning the chips halfway through, until cooked through, golden and crisp all over.From Taverna: Recipes From a Cypriot Kitchen by Georgina Hayden (Square Peg, £25). To buy a copy for £22, go to bookshopWhen I was a kid in Bombay, I tried growing a lime tree in a pot on a windowsill at home and it didn’t work out too well, yielding only one fruit. But now that I live in California, it’s much easier. In Oakland, where I live with my husband, Michael, all the focal points in our back garden are citrus trees – we’ve got makrut lime, bearss lime and the tiny Mexican key lime. I make a point of using limes in my recipes. In India, it’s the citrus you use when you want to add acid to a dish. And in a cobbler – a southern American dish I learned from my mother-in-law in Virginia – lime makes perfect sense with blueberry and ginger as a way of amplifying the flavour.The food I grew up with in Bombay was not very connected. My mother is Catholic and her family comes from Goa, whereas my dad is Hindu from Uttar Pradesh, so her cuisine was more tropical and heavy on coconut, meat and seafood, while his was more vegetarian. Most Indian kids I know were rooted in a single culinary region, but I never had that. I think it makes it easier for me now, as a food writer, because I never worry about things needing to be done in a certain way.My biggest influence was my grandmother on my mother’s side. She showed me a lot of techniques – teaching me to cut vegetables to the same size when making a stock, for example, so everything cooks in a uniform way.I started cooking aged 10 or 11 because I was sick of eating what they were serving at home. But there was an experimental side to it as well. It made me very curious and I’d wonder what would happen if, say, I used vinegar instead of lime. Around that time, I found out that I was gay. I was scared to live in India because I’d heard my parents talking about gay people getting arrested, so I wanted to move to a safer place, and my only way out was through science – chemistry and biology were my strong points. In 2002, I got a scholarship to a college in Cincinnati to study molecular genetics. Six months after moving to America, I came out.A lot of my classmates asked me for Indian food, but after a while I wanted to do things differently. I wanted to cook food that reflected my present as well as my past – and I started writing about this in my blog A Brown Table.California definitely feels like home now. But after 17 years away, does Bombay still feel like home? That’s a hard question. For 12 years I didn’t go back at all. Going to Bombay with my husband Michael for the first time was stressful, at least to begin with, because it brought back all those memories of why I left. I knew my family was fine with me being gay but there were friends and relatives who didn’t know. I didn’t want to hide anything, but thankfully we were there for a wedding and we got completely absorbed in it. The next time there was no wedding, and that was more challenging, but by then India was becoming much more vocal about gay rights, which made things a little easier.India has changed so much. The first week I’m there is fine, but after that I start to feel like I’m out of place. I feel like I’m a stranger in India. That’s when I realise America is more my home now.

It came down in the end to one shot. A free-kick, perhaps 20 yards out: score it and Algeria were through to their first Cup of Nations final since 1990 miss and they faced extra-time against a Nigeria team who had been improving as the game went on and, at that point, were looking fitter and stronger than their opponents.It was not that Mahrez has played badly. He has scored two goals and functioned efficiently in a technically gifted forward line. It was just that he had not had a match in which he had played an obviously decisive role.This, though, was his chance to be a hero – and he seized it. The strike was perfect, whipped left-footed round the wall and beyond the e of Daniel Akpeyi. It was the last kick of the game, “a wonderful free-kick from a genius player” as the Nigeria coach, Gernot Rohr, put it.Algeria had won and will face a Senegal side without the suspended Kalidou Koulibaly in the final. That, though, is only a small part of the story, much of which revolves round Algeria’s strange reluctance to believe in themselves and take advantage of their superiority.Here they had been much the better side in the first half, taking the lead through William Troost-Ekong’s 40th-minute own goal. But, as is their way, they then retreated and, rather than looking to press home their advantage, they sat back and spoiled. “We were too deep,” the Algeria coach, Djamel Belmadi, said. “There was not enough pressure on the opponents, due maybe to the fatigue of the players.”Still Nigeria had essentially been devoid of threat in the first half of the second half, struggling to get their wingers, so influential in the quarter-final against South Africa, into the game, when Oghenekaro Etebo’s speculative shot struck the arm of Aissa Mandi. Play carried on for well over a minute before there was finally a break and, to widespread bewilderment, a VAR review. The replay, though, was clear enough: under the modern interpretation it was a penalty. Odion Ighalo converted and suddenly everything changed: the tone of the game and the mood in the stadium.Initially it had all seemed calm. To one side were the Nigerians, two vast brass bands in green and white, one perhaps 1500 strong, the other around 500. To the other were the Algerians, 10,000 of them with their banners. In between were thousands upon thousands of orange and blue seats and then, in the centre, either side of the press box, a few thousand locals who had bought tickets in the expectation Egypt would be here. The 75,000 capacity Cairo International Stadium was perhaps a fifth full.Algeria and Egypt have a ferocious rivalry, as the 2009 World Cup play-off between the sides, and then the brutal Cup of Nations semi-final in Benguela a few months later attest. But when Rohr spoke before the game of Egypt as Algeria’s “Arab brothers” he was correctly defining the mood. The Egyptians in the crowd, at first, were clearly backing Algeria, who responded by joining in the chants and raising of lit mobile phones in the 22nd minute in recognition of Mohamed Aboutrika, the great former playmaker who wore 22 when leading Egypt to victory in the Cup of Nations the last time they hosted it, but is now in effect exiled from his homeland after being included on a terrorism watchlist.But that is where alliances and relationships start to become a little clouded. Three Algerian fans were arrested early in the tournament for carrying signs bearing messages relating to political events back in Algeria, suggesting a level of cooperation between Egyptian and Algerian authorities.When Ighalo equalised, though, there was an exchange of bottles between the Algerian and Egyptian sections. There was a rush to the fence between them and briefly it seemed something very serious might break out. As it was, everything calmed down quickly as security moved in.On the pitch Algeria came again. Belmadi spoke of their “great attitude and mental strength” but the tactical improvement since he took the job less than a year ago has been remarkable. As Rohr noted, Algeria are better balanced now than when Nigeria beat them in World Cup qualifying and here the plan to close the spaces for the wingers worked perfectly. The only issue was fitness but one last surge brought the winner.By the end the exchanges between rival fans were of applause. That, hopefully, bodes well for security around the final but there is bound to be some unease on the part of the authorities if, as expected, thousands more Algerians travel east for the game. At least, though, there may be a sense of occasion befitting a final – and there is no doubt that on form and ability Algeria deserve to be there."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32453c2e1ae114ff12fee78f3b6a48bdb7e5cc70/0_0_4866_2919/master/4866.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6e59f66b64a6f0f55fa658932d62cf7","title":"pamela adlon better things is about hope and love amid the darkness","story":"The star and creator of the comedy hit talks about life, TV, bringing up three daughters as a single mother in LA and making it big after 50This is fuckin’ inner sanctum,” says Pamela Adlon. We’re speaking over FaceTime, and this is a quiet morning in Los Angeles for her. Her writers are about to turn up and start working on season four of Better Things, the neat, witty and often beautiful comedy loosely based on Adlon’s own life. As soon as she’s finished ordering lunch for her team, and sage to cleanse the energy of the office – this is the West Coast, after all – she leaps up and launches straight into a virtual tour. She shows me the lanterns that make the place cosy, and an old black-and-white picture of her English mother wearing her Canadian Air Force uniform. There’s a record player and a shelf full of vinyl. “Look at this!” she yells, as we whizz past a piece of paper taped on to a door that reads CRYING ROOM. “You know, you just need a room where you can go and cry,” she shrugs. “We got these movie theatre seats, and it has chargers, and here is a little pedal bike and there’s an African chair I got at a flea market.” She makes me promise not to read the board on the wall behind her, where the plots are being worked out. “Stop it!” she shouts, grinning. “Cover your eyes!”Adlon spends a lot of time in this inner sanctum. She writes and directs Better Things, the show she created about Sam Fox, whom she plays, a single mother who is a jobbing actor raising her three daughters in LA, just like she is. (Its first season ran in the UK earlier this year the second, a low-key candidate for best comedy on TV, is about to begin.) Quietly brilliant, it is an unsentimental look at family life and working single mothers – blunt, warm, fascinated by the absurdity of trying to hold it all together. Which, it turns out, is exactly what Adlon is like in real life. At times, trying to keep her on track in a conversation can be like filling a leaky bucket. “That is probably not what you asked me. I tend to go off the rails,” she says at one point, segueing from a story about selling all of her possessions in her 20s to her mother being born during the Blitz.The show, which does not shy away from the difficulties of raising three young women under one roof, or looking after an elderly and increasingly dotty mother who lives next door, is often described as “raw”. “I like raw,” Adlon protests. “I prefer raw to ‘brave’. When people are like, ‘You’re so brave...’” She grabs a fistful of her legs. She has no qualms about appearing on screen in her pants. “I tell my girlfriends, that’s what real thighs look like. I’m like: brave, bitch! So brave.”Better Things is about finding the humour and the heart in orce, death, bad decisions, in not having enough time for your kids or your work, in having to grind to get by. “I think the theme throughout the show is, there’s hope and there’s love and there’s laughter, amidst all this dark shit, you know? There’s a flower growing up through a turd,” she explains, succinctly. “I like to feel hope, and I like to laugh at things that are dark. You need somebody in your life, if you’re having the worst possible fucking day, to laugh at you. To point at you and say, ‘Oh bro, that’s hysterical.’”In the past, Adlon has called Better Things “semi-autobiographical”. Today she is measured about the similarities between the show and her life. “Well, I have three daughters, I’m a single mom, I have an English mother, I’m an actor,” she shrugs – but she also admits that she has spent her whole life watching, writing things down, gathering material to use. Her eccentric English mother, played by Celia Imrie, loves being written into the series. “Because when I tell her, ‘Mom, you’re being extra sassy right now,’ she says, ‘You love it! You get more material for your show.’” She nods. “I can’t argue.”She was at the gym with her friend recently. “And she’s literally the most miserable person in the world. She starts talking, and she’s crying, and crying. And I turn to the woman next to me and I go, ‘You know why she’s crying? Cos her husband just left her. Two kids. She’s almost 50.’ And she’s working out, and she starts laughing hysterically, through her tears. Isn’t it hilarious?” She laughs. “I shouldn’t even tell you this, because I’m making it a scene in the show.” Another friend told her recently that she’d always assumed Adlon wasn’t listening to her. “And then she saw my show, and she said, ‘I realise you’re really listening.’ I’m surprised that people don’t tread more lightly around me.”Now 52, Adlon has been a professional actor since she was 10. She was a child star in a popular US sitcom The Facts of Life, and appeared alongside Lorna Luft and Michelle Pfeiffer as a wisecracking kid sister in Grease 2. For the most part, she says, she felt protected in those environments. But talking about those years brings back memories. There was an independent film and a scene in a swimming pool. “And the director said, ‘Wouldn’t it be funny if you dropped the towel for a minute, and we saw your butt, just for a minute?’ And I was 15 years old. I had to kiss a boy in that movie, too, and I hadn’t done that. And I remember being really uncomfortable and feeling scared, because what are the parameters? The kid actor looked at me and said, ‘An apple is an apple, a plum is a plum, a kiss isn’t a kiss without the tongue.’ And I was just gutted.”It was a shock to go from being famous and on television as a kid to being in her 20s, on unemployment benefits, having to sell her possessions. The loss of her record collection, in particular, still smarts. “Oh! Do you have to bring that up? I’m still upset. I can see the records,” she says. But she realised that, with her unique smoke and honey voice, she could earn her living another way. “I started hitting it in voiceover and animation,” she explains, which sustained her for much of her career her biggest voice job was as Bobby in King of the Hill. In the new season of Better Things, she has a character say, “I know you were Rooster on Ching of the Mill.” “It’s so stupid,” she says. “I didn’t even bother making up a new title.”Like Sam Fox, Adlon is a jobbing actor, and her work rate has been so prodigious that her CV has the heft of a weighty novel: “No job too big or small, is my motto, and every single job led me to where I am.” She spent several years as Marcy Runkle in Californication, the explicit, hedonistic Showtime series, where she played a foul-mouthed wisecracker who regularly shot off insults like “Die young and suffer, dickless.” When her eldest daughter, Gideon, was starting a new school, Adlon told her: “There’s gonna be people who watch the show, and it’s a show for adults.” She didn’t want the kids to watch it just because their friend’s mother was in it. “But what an innocent time that was! Because now the shit that kids watch on their phones and everything? Forget it!” She remembers a parent coming up to her, with her 12-year-old and nine-year-old in tow. “They said, ‘Oh Pamela, we watch your show, we love it.’” She cackles. “And I said, ‘You’re kidding?’ And she said, ‘No no, we love it.’ And then her little nine-year-old was like, ‘Yah, it’s really good.’ I looked at her and said: ‘The show is not for kids.’” She slips into stern parent mode. “I mean, how do you explain ‘stunt cock’ to your nine-year-old daughter?” she says. “Fuckin’ asshole.”Around the same time as Californication, Adlon was working closely with her friend and collaborator Louis CK on his series Lucky Louie and Louie. He later returned production and writing favours on the first two seasons of Better Things. Then allegations of sexual misconduct against CK surfaced in 2017, and Adlon found herself caught in the crossfire, her own show hanging in the balance through its association with him. She spoke about how “devastating” it was in an interview with the New Yorker, but the only condition of this conversation was that we wouldn’t bring him up today. One of the more peculiar aspects of the #MeToo groundswell has been women being asked to answer for men’s transgressions it seems reasonable to not ask her to do so again. Besides, Better Things did not exactly sink without CK, who was not involved in season three. When Adlon took sole charge, critics praised it for finding its voice and a new sense of invention.Adlon is a single mother she got married in the mid-90s, and orced a decade ago. Her ex-husband, the father of her kids, moved to Europe. “I don’t talk about him,” she says, in a rare closed moment, though she leans into the screen, and adds: “Really not convenient for drop-offs on the weekend, and stuff like that.” She always knew that she had Better Things in her, but it took her years to feel ready to go ahead and make it, in part because she was raising three young children alone.“I had to say no to a lot of things, because I did not want to take on more than I could handle,” she says. The final push came when she was working on a big budget, big network television show – she won’t tell me the name of it, but will say, “It was fuckin’ awful, a circling-the-drain, terrible, American television show” – and a Friday turned into a Saturday, and it was midnight, and they still hadn’t finished half of what they were supposed to. “Ice water went through my veins and it was like, ‘Don’t these people have families? What the fuck are they doing?’ That was the moment that I thought, I’m ready. I’m ready to do this.”Her three daughters, now 21, 18 and 16, are “incredibly proud” of her. “They see their mom being a boss and running a show, and hiring a ton of people, and how important this job is to so many people. It’s absolutely an unbelievable situation. To see their mom really make it big when she hit 50, after kind of just middling the line for so long...” This seems to go against the traditional Hollywood narrative, that women have an expiration date. “I think it’s still true, but it’s less true,” Adlon says. “I think that if you can make yourself viable, anything is possible.” She does, however, think she should have started directing sooner. “I wish I hadn’t just stayed in one lane for so long. That bothers me, that I was myopic in that way. Now I have six jobs, and I wish that I had kind of committed to doing that, instead of, oh, I only act.”Still, she is a firm believer in everything happening for a reason. There is an earth mother warmth to Adlon, and it’s not just the sage, or the crying room. She has taken her own industry experiences and used them to ensure that the patterns are not repeated. “All of those things really helped me,” she explains. “So for example, when I did Californication, there were so many young women who came on the show, and they had to do nudity, or do a simulated sex scene, or make out. And so I just made it my mission to try and soothe people and talk them through it and say, don’t do anything you don’t feel comfortable with, or don’t be ashamed, or love your body now, but don’t ever get pushed into doing something you don’t want to do.” The number one priority on Better Things, she says, is that “I would never ask somebody to do something that I wouldn’t do myself, and that they wouldn’t feel safe or comfortable doing.”Adlon is such a nurturer that by the end of our conversation, when she’s introduced me to her assistant Ryan, and we’ve had a chat about his life, and how seeing Adlon run her own show while also looking after her daughters made him call his own mother more, and Adlon has introduced me to her writers, including Patricia Resnick (“She wrote 9 to 5!” she yells, proudly), I find myself asking her how she stays so hopeful in a world that seems to discourage it at every turn.

By this year, 2019-20, the number had fallen to just 47.The figures were given in answer to questions by Richard Burgon, the shadow justice secretary. They also reveal that, between 2010-11 and 2018-19, MoJ funding for law centres through legal aid contracts dropped from £12.1m to £7.1m.The impact was caused by a double blow because removal of legal aid eligibility for many types of cases coincided with a financial crisis among local authorities, which have been forced to withdraw support for local law centres.Burgon, the Leeds East MP, said: “Deliberately undermining law centres in this way is yet another indictment of the Tories’ shameful record on justice.“The weakening of law centres and legal aid is part of the same austerity agenda that has inflicted such damage on working-class communities. These cuts leave people without the legal support they need to fight back against their services being slashed and their rights being trampled on. That’s not a by-product, but the actual aim of cruel Tory policies that restrict access to justice.”Burgon, who was visiting a law centre in his constituency as part of a campaign by the all-party parliamentary group on legal aid, added: “Labour is committed to investing in law centres so that communities can once again defend their hard-won rights and take on the dodgy landlords, unscrupulous bosses and other exploitative people in positions of power that benefit from the hollowing out of our legal aid system.”The party said it would build more law centres if it won the next election.Julie Bishop, director of the Law Centres Network, warned that several more law centres were in a “precarious” state and likely to close soon. She said there were about 40 independent law centres surviving in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, with at least 11 having closed since the 2012 Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders (Laspo) Act sliced about £950m off the annual legal aid budget.Bishop said: “A lot of smaller aid agencies and Citizens Advice bureaux have withdrawn from providing legal services. There’s been a real shrinkage.“We are anticipating that a couple of other law centres may close. Local authorities have been cut massively and they have withdrawn funding from the sector. People cannot get access to legal help and demand continues to grow.“We have 1.5 million people living in destitution. Law centres say they have not seen it so bad in terms of people’s situations after nine years of austerity.”The MoJ provided transitional funding for law centres following the Laspo cuts. Its figures record that the number of advice services increased in 2013 but then reduced significantly thereafter.In his written answer, the justice minister Paul Maynard said the MoJ was investing up to £5m to “deliver innovative services … offering support to people with social welfare problems like housing, including an expansion of early legal advice to determine the most effective solutions”.The Law Centres Network was one of the charities supported by the  in its Christmas appeal last year. Earlier this year the  revealed that more than half of all magistrates courts in England and Wales have closed since 2010.A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “Every person should have access to legal advice when they need it – that’s why the Legal Aid Agency keeps availability under constant review and takes urgent actions whenever it has concerns.“We spent £1.6bn on legal aid last year and in addition to the Civil Legal Advice telephone service, we are investing £5m in innovative technologies to help people access legal support wherever they are.”The latest figures, the department cautioned, may reflect consolidation where law centres may have closed offices but continue to deal with large volumes of legal aid work."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92d5535ab50465624f36bf28d264a574989dd928/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09f77098dc72bdc7095e7e498f285618","title":"hiking walking younger generation ramblers","story":"No longer just an activity for older people with sticks, rambling in the countryside is catching on with a new generationDeep in the English countryside on a golden midsummer evening, 16 young people have gathered to plot the night’s entertainment. Partially organised by word of mouth, partially through WhatsApp, we have arrived ready at the meeting point – the bottom of a windmill famous for featuring in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.It’s a friendly, chatty, hotchpotch crowd. If I squint, I think this might just be how the halcyon days of rave first came about. It might – except that I’m here with the Berkshire Young Ramblers and we’re going on a five-mile hike. Walking, I mumble unconvincingly, is the new raving ... isn’t it?Last year the trend forecasters WGSN predicted that hiking would become the biggest new fitness trend of 2019. Buoyed by fashion houses including Gucci and Louis Vuitton putting walking boots on the catwalk and a proliferation of young models – your Hadids and Jenners – posing in Californian canyons, style blogs declared hiking to be officially hot.That may have come as news for anyone spending their lifetime using their feet unfashionably, but the stats bear it out: while going out-out has undergone a generational decline, going to the great outdoors has seen a marked uptick among millennials.Social media undeniably creates homophilous bubbles of people, but the cultural shift has been perceptible – Instagram is filled with photos of beautiful craggy coastlines taken by an array of young, part-time hedonists: part-time hikers. My own feed features a fashion editor friend who spent her last pre-baby holiday climbing the peaks of Mallorca. A former editor of Vice at her happiest scaling Devil’s Dyke. Music journalists on mountains. An artist documenting their wild desert walks. A twentysomething club kid besotted with the Jurassic coast. My own amateur adventures into nature have become so frequent in the last three years that I’ve set up a separate Instagram account just to stop spamming my friends with endless postcards of endless vistas.User research confirms that walking has become a widespread hobby.Chris Lines, who has more than 20 years’ experience working with the outdoor brand Berghaus and the It’s Great Out There Coalition, says the surge of interest in the outdoors ties into broader consumer trends: we want to enhance our lives with greater experiences rather than more stuff. More memories, fewer hangovers. “The attraction has especially grown in the last decade,” he says, “because people want to get away from the hustle and bustle of an increasingly frenetic daily life in the city. Everyone is surrounded by technology and ‘on’ all the time getting outdoors is a chance to put that down and reconnect with nature. It’s a mental escape as much as a physical one – and it’s good for you.”Laura Doling, 25, is a keen champion. “Everyone talks about mental health a lot, but I think, massively for young people, it’s a great outlet to be in the hills in solitude,” she says. “Everything else becomes insignificant when I’m walking the world carries on and it slows everything down.” Doling grew up in Jaywick, Essex, which is regularly named as one of the most deprived towns in Britain. She graduated with a first in sports science and worked in healthcare before quitting to become a Royal Mail postwoman. After finding a community of like-minded young adventurers on Instagram, she engineered a job transfer to the Lake District and now spends all day walking the fells. Her following online includes brands keen to use her influence to encourage more young people to explore nature and get active.“I did the clubbing scene,” she says. “I don’t think it’s healthy, and I think it’s a waste of money. I can go out at a weekend and camp out in the hills, where you sit and have a decent conversation. It takes away from the superficial problem of worrying what you look like or what you’re wearing.”Doling’s friend Nic Hardy, who describes herself as Instagram’s hiking social secretary, agrees. An IT project manager from Sheffield, Hardy quit her job and sold her house to walk, trek, ramble and mountaineer full time. “I’ve pretty much sold all my stuff or given it away and kept a few sentimental items at my mum’s. I drive around in my estate car and have everything I need I’m 34 and I’ve never felt happier.” By flagging up her walks on Instagram, Hardy has forged a community of young walkers who regularly organise expeditions and learn from one another. “I don’t think I’ve ever met anyone who was awkward or not friendly and I’ve made so many lifelong friends.”That walking is meditative and healing is no secret. Where Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson offered literary treatises on its transcendental properties, scientific studies have confirmed that spending time outdoors in green spaces is good for you. Last month a paper published in the journal Scientific Reports found that people who spend two hours a week or more outdoors reported a greater sense of wellbeing. The month before, Forestry England compiled data from a string of studies to prove that being around trees improves mood and attention , and enhances stress recovery. News that walking in nature aids creativity is not new. The challenge is to get more people to realise that it’s easy – and belongs to everyone.“The industry is waking up to the fact that it needs to look and feel more inclusive and a lot more could and should be done,” says Lines. “Especially as the barrier to entry is so low – you just need to go out for a walk. There are no costs to that.”After all, you can only be what you can see and, subconsciously, plenty of us have grown up in families assuming that outdoor adventuring is, well, for white people. To that end, Lines works to lobby for grants to fund projects “designed to give young people a lifelong love of the outdoors, reaching erse communities that haven’t traditionally been targeted”. Berghaus, he says, already does some of this work. Meanwhile North Face has established an “explorer fund … to create access and equity in the outdoors”.But organised group walking isn’t for everyone. Plenty of us – by which I mean me – prefer a more ad hoc approach. Three years ago, after becoming free of flatmates for the very first time, I began walking home from everywhere in London and felt better, lighter, happier. A trip to Pakistan incorporated daily five-mile walks. A meander through the woods here, a three-hour stroll across the beach there followed.Last summer, after more than a decade of pinballing through gigs and grotty parties together, my best friend fixed us a dream holiday: a week of walking along the Normandy coast, a single backpack each. Dorks on walks we may be, but she – the more committed and inspiring of us both – insists it’s ridiculous to describe her as a “walker”.“It still sounds like something people in their middle age do. I’m never getting the sticks,” she says. “Going walking and getting into nature is just about getting away from the city. You’ve got to get far enough away from London to feel disconnected and get the views.”To paraphrase Jean Jacques Rousseau, it’s easier to meditate while walking. “When I stop, I cease to think my mind only works with my legs.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d7a06bbe33955b1614ec9c8b3d3ee8d13565c9d/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e556f3ea58d50c640d438eb40bddd7c1","title":"how to chew your food properly","story":"Digestion starts in the mouth so, to avoid overburdening your stomach, it is important to chew food well. A nutritionist gives some helpful adviceYou should chew your food until it is small enough to swallow easily, so your stomach does not have to work too hard. Digestion starts in the mouth.Saliva contains amylase, the enzyme that helps to chemically break down food. There is also mechanical digestion, the physical action of breaking down food. If food does not stay in the mouth long enough, it is not exposed to amylase to break down the carbohydrates – there is very little carbohydrate digestion in the stomach, and if food gets there without being properly digested, the stomach has to work harder. There are also some things the stomach cannot digest. If bits of food enter the top of your small intestine still quite whole, it can lead to bloating and discomfort.Rather than advising an absolute number of times to chew your food, I recommend people put their food or cutlery down between mouthfuls – then, when you have finished chewing and swallowing, pick up your cutlery and take the next mouthful. There is something that invites urgency when you have a fork full of food in front of your face, waiting to go into your mouth, which makes you think you need to finish your food more quickly. Just putting your cutlery down between mouthfuls can give you a sense of when the food has been chewed enough.Jo Travers, nutritionist at the London Nutritionist and the author of The Low-Fad Diet, was speaking to Tolani Idris"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ef4fa07b0d0dca4965e3c76d8c7225bf8f5e526/0_15_2356_1413/master/2356.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16b446f6d183b3f2fbe855b5e7935e12","title":"how do we tackle this contempt for honest reporting","story":"From Saudi Arabia to the UK, misinformation is fuelling hostility towards journalistsShortly after the BBC director general Tony Hall last week warned of increased threats facing journalists, notably in places such as China and Nigeria, protesters attacked a BBC news crew in Westminster.The fracas, in which supporters of Tommy Robinson, furious with his jail sentence stopped a live BBC news broadcast, was an almost perfect illustration of how, in Hall’s words, “reporting the news has never been more dangerous”. Not because the attack, largely carried out it seems by a man wielding a tripod, left anyone seriously hurt, but because such violence has spread to parts of the world where the freedom to report has for generations, been considered an inalienable right.During a two day Foreign Office-hosted conference, Lord Hall told of BBC staff being arrested or harassed around the world.A day later, a senior police officer in Britain’s biggest police force threatened journalists with arrest for printing government leaks of the Kim Darroch memos, a state of affairs more common in authoritarian states such as Russia.Threats such as this from the politan Police counter-terrorism chief, Neil Basu, thrive in a world in which the lack of faith in the media is allowed to increase.Many of the most dangerous countries, such as Saudi Arabia and Burundi, were not represented at the media freedom event in London. Abuses such as the murder of the Saudi columnist Jamal Khashoggi helped make 2018 the worst year on record for violence and abuse against journalists, according to Reporters without Borders.Some will argue that lobbing things or calling reporters names in a UK street is nothing to do with the sort of appalling violence and abuse Hall was referring to. But the decrease in trust in the media in the UK, the US and elsewhere in the west has engendered an atmosphere in which violence is increasing.Citing a George Orwell quote etched into the walls of BBC headquarters, Hall said: “We’re now in the midst of the biggest assault on truth – and therefore democracy – since the 1930s.” A decade which saw the rise of propaganda as well as fascism and in which “bad actors and repressive regimes” have “weaponised misinformation” has found echoes almost 100 years later, with political extremes on all sides blaming the messenger.Meanwhile, Robinson, the former leader of the English Defence League (EDL)whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, wore a T-shirt for his sentencing which claimed that he had been “convicted for journalism”. Robinson was sent back to prison for breaching a reporting restriction, and encouraging “vigilante action”. Even junior journalists know not to break the laws of contempt as no one benefits from a mistrial.The Society of Editors condemned Robinson’s claims as a “dangerous distortion of the truth”.Misinformation, or lies for want of a better word, is of particular danger to journalism. Lies also lead to physical rage. During the recent elections in India, the BBC saw an increase in viewers when it published reports calling out fake news stories it also identified at least 25 lynch mob deaths after fake rumours spread on social media.But nothing should diminish the horror of physical attacks and even murder, which is increasing around the world. The Foreign Office deserves credit for hosting last week’s conference and announcing a series of pledges to do more, but more concrete action would not go amiss. Co-host Canada has managed to impose sanctions on Saudi nationals allegedly linked to the murder of Khashoggi. Why won’t the UK?Rebecca Vincent, UK director of RSF, pointed out that although Khashoggi was mentioned several times, there was no move to do anything about the 30 journalists campaign groups say are imprisoned in Saudi Arabia.We live in difficult, dangerous times in which a president can call the media the “enemy of the people” and a protester in London can shout “hang the judge”. We all know how the 1930s ended. As he heard his sentence last week, Robinson flashed a V for victory sign."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2158d0b6faa35370784d3d42808438c4b1bad566/0_112_5125_3075/master/5125.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a64b00446609f03715813f8d75f82f1","title":"how can i tend my allotment without visiting every day","story":"I started to rent an allotment with great intentions, but it is now hopelessly overgrownEvery week a  Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper.I started to rent an allotment with great intentions last year.

The singing sensation takes us on a tour of Istanbul to explain how political turmoil feeds her work‘This is the hub of pop culture in Istanbul,” says Gaye Su Akyol. “This is where I was raised and where I live. This where my friends and memories are. And when politics made things difficult for musicians, this is where they ran to.”Turkey’s most intriguing psych-folk-rock singer and songwriter is providing a musical history lesson as she shows me around her neighbourhood, Kadiköy, an area of narrow streets, coffee shops, bars and clubs on the Asian side of Istanbul, across the Bosphorus from the main tourist attractions. She explains how the city’s music scene used to be centred over the water on the European side, in the Taksim area and the venues along Istiklal Street. “People came to meet and drink,” she says. “It was a cultural centre. But the religious government was not happy about the situation.”President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan wanted the area transformed, and for a mosque to be built in Gezi Park – a space, Akyol says, “where people could come together”. In 2013, those plans led to demonstrations, in which she took part, and to a violent police response that led to injuries and deaths, which led in turn to further anti-Erdoğan protests, regularly met with tear gas. It became impossible for musicians to work in Taksim. Some left the country while others moved to Kadiköy, a cosmopolitan area far more supportive of the music scene.But this summer, the mood in Istanbul has changed. We pass an old election poster for Ekrem İmamoğlu, the new mayor, from the opposition party CHP, who in June won a rerun of the previously annulled election, this time with a massively increased majority. It was a major blow for Erdoğan that was greeted with celebration. “People went crazy,” says Akyol. “This is very big. This is the start of things. Erdoğan said that if you lose Istanbul, you lose Turkey.”Tonight, Akyol is playing on home ground – in Kadiköy, at a large basement hall painted in black, with beer sellers stationed along the sides. Her four-piece band, led by her partner and guitarist Ali Güçlü Şimşek, are sporting dark glasses and dressed in black, priest-like robes, while Akyol comes on like an exotic butterfly, wearing boots and black shorts, with a bare midriff and transparent white wings attached to her wrists.The image may be pop but the music is anything but, veering from dark, brooding rock balladry, sometimes dressed up with twanging surf guitar, through to Turkish folk influences and tributes to her Turkish musical heroes. There’s a reference to the folk-rock singer Selda Bağcan, who was imprisoned in the 1980s, and songs by Erkin Koray, “the father of Turkish psychedelic rock”, and by the late rock singer and TV host Bariş Manço.Her compositions include the opening İstikrarli Hayal Hakikattir (Consistent Fantasy Is Reality), the title track of her latest album. Then there’s the singalong Develerle Yaşıyorum (I’m Living With Camels) and the angry Nargile, which includes the line: “Dig your grave deeper, your body is worthless.” She says: “The police once questioned me about the lyrics and I said it was general, not specific.” (A girl in the crowd tells me Akyol is “the most courageous artist in Turkey right now”.)It’s a musical fusion that, she says, reflects her upbringing. The daughter of the artist Muzaffer Akyol, she’s a social anthropology graduate and a painter (she sometimes exhibits her work alongside that of her father) who grew up surrounded by music. “My mum was a classical singer, while my dad listened to Turkish pop and jazz, and my uncle was a fan of Anatolian psychedelia and Led Zeppelin. Then when I was 10 my brother played me Nirvana – and that’s exactly what I was looking for at that age.”So how important was it to keep a strong Turkish element in her songs? The aim, she said, was to be “authentic and original. Music should reflect the pain and happiness of your culture.” She regarded herself as a political artist, but used metaphors in her lyrics “because if you use slogans, that doesn’t affect people. You should find your own way of thinking and using language.” And was this also a way of escaping the censors? “There may be a small percentage of fear in it. But it’s about finding a unique artistic way of saying things.”When asked to explain Constant Fantasy Is Reality, she answers: “It may sound cheesy, like new wave shit, but it’s not escapism. It’s going against escapism. We should dream together to make war against the evil, the fascists, the crazy guys around the world who are spreading like cancer.”Her concert was part of Vitrin, the Istanbul jazz festival showcase for contemporary Turkish music, which also included jazz-rock, folk and electronica. Festival director Harun Izer thinks the effect of the political climate on the city’s musical scene has been “positive because political turmoil and argument help young people to be more creative”. Akyol thinks of it rather differently. “If you put pressure on people, they’ll find a way to express their feelings.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab91bd2558f894d2d4188fcd8cd1410bc4384f03/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c29a29a2ca771a650f53b83ed592de24","title":"stop and search is ineffective so why is it on the rise podcast","story":"The first stop and search Jamal ever experienced was when he was 11 years old.

Tom Curran and Jason Roy are originally from South Africa, while Ben Stokes and Jofra Archer were born in New Zealand and Barbados respectively. In addition, Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid are the grandchildren of Pakistani immigrants and both belong to the Mirpuri community.While the team represents England and Wales, under English and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) regulations a player must be a British citizen, have been born in England or Wales, or have lived in either country for three years to qualify.The ECB changed their regulations last year, reducing the eligibility criteria from seven years in a move that was widely seen as allowing Archer, 24, the chance to play. Archer bowled the dramatic, victorious super over.Rees-Mogg’s fellow Conservative MP Ed Vaizey said that his colleague was guilty of “slightly misjudging the mood”, before adding that “while you’re on, the English captain is Irish”. Alastair Campbell suggested that “perhaps instead of making a silly Brextremist point, offer congratulations to the Irish captain, the NZ-born man of the match, and the Barbadian bowler who got it over the line”.Daniel Lawes, the founder and chief executive of YouthPolitics UK, tweeted: “Captained by an immigrant, batting led by an immigrant, fastest bowler an immigrant, leading all-rounder an immigrant, main spinner son of an immigrant.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e236e820f4607243b9ed8f2809e3bcccf9f7c29/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91345743835a2d3f3aa42fd4f7c1b495","title":"uk needs strategy to deal with industrial change tuc report","story":"Report based on thinktank research looks at automation and emerging green economyThe government must come up with a blueprint for dealing with the challenges that automation and the move to a low-carbon economy pose for UK industry, says a report by the TUC.The UK has an “appalling” track record on managing industrial change that benefits workers, customers, businesses and communities. But the sweeping changes that are likely over the next few decades must be treated as an opportunity to improve lives and “deliver better jobs”, according to the authors.Union leaders at the TUC said without strong guidelines and action at a local level, communities in industrial cities and towns could suffer.The report, based on research conducted by the New Economics Foundation thinktank, said the UK may be able to learn lessons from three places that had transformed themselves after going through difficult times: Bilbao in northern Spain, Eindhoven in Holland, and Iceland.The government has already outlined plans for each part of the country to have a “local industrial strategy” by early 2020, though critics have claimed previous attempts to reinvigorate struggling towns following major factory closures have been unsatisfactory.The TUC said these local strategies could play a vital role in ensuring a just transition to a green economy and making sure working people enjoy a fair share of the gains from the rise of automation.Speaking ahead of the report’s launch, which will be attended by the Bank of England’s chief economist Andy Haldane, Alice Martin, a researcher at the thinktank, said: “Given the critical juncture we are at with climate change and accelerating automation, leaving impacts on UK jobs and industries to the whim of global market forces will only deepen existing ides and inequalities.“It is important now more than ever that politicians take steps to understand the nuts and bolts of industrial change in practice, and how it can be shaped by the state, employers and unions representing the workers and communities affected.”Haldane, who is also chair of the government’s industrial strategy commission, is expected to endorse much of the report, which recommends steps for national government, local government and employers to take that would enable local industrial strategies to be successful.It said the core measure for success should be a supply of good-quality jobs, and that government, business and trade union representatives should sit on joint industrial strategy councils. Meanwhile, unions should have permanent places in local enterprise partnerships and on skills advisory boards.Several car companies have announced plans to close factories or shift production elsewhere in recent months. Some of the issues have been blamed on Brexit, but the rise in demand for electric vehicles has also had a major impact."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/199858d27fb8a3815025a7d17dda40ff59624513/0_145_2962_1777/master/2962.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c088026320bbcaba4c430594f0940206","title":"share your memories of the apollo 11 moon landings","story":"Do you remember where you were when man first landed on the moon?

The menopause – when a woman’s fertile period comes to an end – can be a traumatic time for many women. The drop in hormone levels can introduce both physical and mental symptoms that can have a significant impact on quality of life. Some women find symptoms so overwhelming that they even think about quitting their jobs.The writer, Rose George has shared her own experiences of the menopause in a  article where she also raised the question why so little is known about it: “I woke up fatigued, stinking and angry that something so common, something that affects millions of women, is still such a medical mystery. Why do we get hot flushes? We don’t know. Why is sleep broken? We don’t know. Why are we the only creatures to get menopause apart from two types of whales?

Here, he talks about his recovery from a problem that plagues the restaurant industryI first talked to Craig Strippel back in the spring on the day before he was due to run in the London Marathon. Anyone who signs up for those 26 miles has a kind of reckless determination, but for Strippel, who had worked as a head chef in Cornish hotels and restaurants for much of his career, the challenge had become a very singular mission. That mission had begun just seven months earlier when, aged 37, Strippel had been within one small step of taking his own life.Sitting in a cafe in London, he could recall that evening in September 2018 both as if it were yesterday and as part of another existence entirely. At the time he was working on his own in the kitchen at a hotel restaurant near Penzance. It had been a long hot summer and Strippel had, for as long as he could remember, been in the habit of trying to drown all the tiredness and stress of the kitchen in alcohol.“Working on your own in the summer in a kitchen is bloody hard,” he said. “There was just a kitchen porter and me. Most days I’d have a whole long row of tickets for orders. The kitchen was open 11am until 8.30pm. I could handle it all, but only if I never talked to anyone while I worked. I had a massive charcoal grill, two fryers, a fish fryer, two big hobs, a grill and an oven and I would be working the whole lot myself. I was getting £10.65 an hour.” When the kitchen eventually closed he would do his cleaning and get the ordering done and would be finished at 10.30pm. His mates were behind the bar and in front of it. It was always: are you having a drink tonight, Craig? Of course he was.The truth was that he’d have been drinking most of the day already. When he got in, a colleague would offer him a beer and he would probably have had three or four pints before the lunch rush began. He’d ask for a pint of wine for the cooking, but he only needed a splash of it for his crab linguine so he would drink the rest. People would tip him with drinks, so by the end of the week there would be eight or nine pints waiting. He only used drugs when he was drinking, he says. He’d take something to sober himself up enough so he could drink some more. Sometimes he lost two or three days in this way – he could spend £500 in a weekend, no problem – but mostly he just kept going to work he had a partner and three young kids at home.As with all addiction, Strippel thought for a long time that he could cope with it, then he knew for a terrifying fact that he could not. “The last summer it just got worse and worse,” he said. “I got to the point in September when I honestly could not see a way out. I went out drinking with my mates and I was saying to them, ‘Big party tonight because it is the last night I will drink.’”Strippel left his mates in the early hours and walked to a place along the coast. “I stood there and I wanted to jump but my legs wouldn’t do it,” he said. And then there was a kind of It’s a Wonderful Life moment. “A guy who was out fishing spotted me and shone a torchlight on me from his boat,” Strippel recalled. “He just kept the light on me, and I felt I couldn’t move.” The fisherman called the lifeguard and soon there was a helicopter, a lifeboat and police negotiators. After an hour and a half Strippel was talked down with the promise of a cigarette. Some of these statistics have been fuelled by a working culture which, through the 1990s and 2000s fetishised extreme pressure and made the kitchen seem like a war zone. The suicide of Anthony Bourdain last year, the chef who did so much to create that high-adrenaline charge around cooking, provoked a lot of soul-searching. Bourdain had conquered a heroin and crack-cocaine addiction he had never given up on a love of booze: “You see me drink myself stupid on my show all the time … When I indulge, I indulge.” There has since been a series of confessionals from high-profile chefs, who have acknowledged the potential self-destructiveness of that mythology. David MacMillan of Joe Beef – who Bourdain called “the rogue prince of hospitality” – had made his restaurant a byword for excess of all kinds. “The community of people I surrounded myself with ate and drank like Vikings,” he said. “It worked well in my 20s. It worked well in my 30s. It started to unravel when I was 40. I couldn’t shut it off.” Now, after a period in rehab, he has become an evangelist for greater duty of care in the heat of the kitchen.Tom Kerridge, of the Hand and Flowers, has been frank about a similar personal reckoning. “Alcohol had gained a grip,” he said on Desert Island Discs. “I was drinking colossal amounts. I would always be the last man standing, driving it on. At the end of service I would order a pint of negroni, just as a starter … I have completely destroyed alcohol for myself. I’m untrustworthy with it.”One result has been a generational shift, even among alpha-males who run kitchens. When Gordon Ramsay, another prime mover in that previous culture, made a heartfelt documentary in 2017 about the destructiveness of the cocaine trade – after a young chef he had worked with fell to his death after taking the drug – he talked about efforts to outlaw the “food industry’s dirty little secret”. Neil Rankin of the pit-barbecue pioneer Temper suggested bluntly in a Facebook post that Ramsay’s fondness for long-hours culture hadn’t helped: “Oh fuck off Gordon. Try doing something positive rather than glorifying kitchen abuse, telling chefs today they have to work the stupid hours that you did (and probably hated) and now saying everyone’s on drugs. Things are looking up for chefs. We’re trying to treat them like adults, partners and employees for the first time in decades and give them a future beyond burning out at 30.” Ramsay recently acknowledged the changing roles: “There’s a responsibility we all have to ensure that there are areas of support for when people stumble and struggle – and that includes in the workplace … and that includes me.”The statistics – and stories like Strippel’s – suggest that across the industry there is still plenty of work to do. Like many chefs, Strippel drifted into the kitchen. He had a live-in job as a commis chef at 16. One of his early jobs was as a kind of troubleshooter, pitching up in failing kitchens in his whites, checking out the fridges, raising standards before moving on. The real sleep deprivation – and the compensatory drinking – kicked in when he worked as a senior chef, starting at half five in the morning and finishing at half past one five days a week.“There are probably side effects with every job,” he says. “But with chefs it was usually drugs and alcohol. I would have the weekend off and I was living in Warminster, near the barracks, so there were always squaddies around. I made a lot of friends who weren’t friends.”When he moved to Cornwall he worked for a while with Rick Stein in Padstow – “probably the most laid back of anyone I worked for” – and then jobbing around various hotels. I wonder if he was infected by that Bourdain “life on the edge” mythology.He says he recognised it, but it wasn’t the main reason. “The money was really good to start with,” he says. He was getting £32,000 a year at that senior chef job and only a few hours of free time to spend any of it.The day after the suicide attempt Strippel called Addaction, a charity that helps addicts one-to-one. He went to his first AA meeting. And he called into work to explain why he wasn’t coming in that day, or any day. Though he had sometimes gone awol over the years, no employer had once asked if he needed help.Strippel was never a runner before he stopped drinking. But not long after his crisis his eldest son asked if he would join him in a charity 10k. He ran it in an hour and it almost killed him, but he was hooked and started running the coast paths every day. “I have got that care inside of me, I care about myself again.”When I spoke to him before the marathon he suggested that he couldn’t ever work in a kitchen again, but three months later he had changed his mind about that and felt strong enough to take a job at Mackerel Sky, the noted fish restaurant in Newlyn. He was going to work as a kitchen porter to begin with, just to see how it felt. “I need to work,” he said, “and this is Cornwall so there aren’t that many options. It’s all I can do.” He was hopeful it would be fine. “It’s a minute’s walk away and my shifts end at 8.30pm.” He would be sure to head straight home, he said, because he liked to get up early these days for a run.He had other marathons in mind, New York, Paris, Boston, now he knew what was involved. Before London he had never run more than 16 miles. On the day itself it was at about that point that his legs went, he told me, but a girl running alongside him insisted: “Your brain is telling you that you are done, but your legs don’t have to believe it.” Strippel had heard that particular voice in his head once before. The final 365 yards down the Mall were the longest he has ever contemplated, but there was not only an end in sight, but also a new beginning.In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.

Only the Kiwis could have coped so graciously with the manner of their defeat in the most riveting final this tournament has ever witnessed. At the end of it England emerged as World Cup winners for the first time. It is hard to believe how they managed it. We had better start at the end.The game had been gripping throughout. But in the final over it had more twists and turns than a Hitchcock thriller. England needed 15 runs to win from the last over, which was bowled by Trent Boult. Ben Stokes was on strike with two wickets remaining.The first two deliveries produced nothing. Stokes hit the fielders and declined to run the crowd, at least the majority of them, groaned. Stokes hit the next ball over midwicket for six. Nine runs were now needed from three balls.Now comes the twist that few scriptwriters could ever have conceived. Stokes heaved again and the ball sped to midwicket. Martin Guptill swooped and sent it back to the wicketkeeper’s end to which Stokes was sprinting to complete a second run. He ed desperately for safety the ball struck his bat and was consequently redirected towards the pavilion. There was a frantic pursuit but no Kiwi could stop it.In these circumstances the etiquette is that the batsmen should not run, which was observed by the two England players. But once the ball had crossed the boundary the umpires had no alternative but to signal that six runs had been scored. Two had been run plus the four overthrows. Three runs were now needed off two balls. Stokes hit to long on and Adil Rashid was run out at the bowler’s end seeking a second. No matter. Two needed from one ball. This time Stokes intentionally patted to long on calculating that they could scramble two runs. A perfect throw came from Jimmy Neesham and Mark Wood was nowhere to be seen.And so the match was tied and we moved to the super over, cricket’s equivalent to the penalty shootout. Out came Stokes again along with Jos Buttler. Once again Boult had the ball. England mustered 15 runs. So now New Zealand, on the verge of victory 20 minutes earlier, needed 16 to win the World Cup. Out came Neesham and Guptill. Jofra Archer was given the dubious honour of bowling, quite a compliment for the novice. A wide was followed by a mighty six from Neesham then a misfield and we were back in familiar territory. Three runs needed off two balls, then two from the last one. It was established that if the match was tied England would win on the relatively random basis that they had hit more boundaries in the match. Guptill hit to midwicket. Jason Roy’s throw was far from perfect but Buttler gathered it and ed for the stumps with Guptill a yard adrift. Somehow England could celebrate victory, yet no sane cricket fan in the ground could conclude that New Zealand deserved to lose. After this surreal hour they emerged with as much credit as England, maybe more, since the cricketing deities had been so cruel.Throughout New Zealand had been at their most resilient in what seemed destined to be a slow burning classic that must have enthralled an enlarged audience, whatever their age or gender. They have become the experts at defending small totals, which are supposed to be chicken feed in the modern era. Here they had to defend 241.They managed to reduce England to 86 for four in the 22nd over. Then it became trickier for the Kiwis. Stokes dug in MS Dhoni-style alongside Buttler. They repaired the damage with Buttler speeding along at a run a ball, which was faster than anyone else on the day. Stokes, by contrast, gritted his teeth and battled. For a while it looked as if this pair might guide England to a conventional victory as they added 110, but the New Zealanders grabbed every chance that came their way and refused to budge an inch. By the start of the final over of the game they were favourites.Naturally they would have preferred a bigger total to defend but earlier in the day England had been coldly clinical in the field with Chris Woakes and Archer on target from the start, exploiting a surprisingly green surface.Guptill has been in a drought but he delivered a couple of eye-catching boundaries. An upper cut over third man off Archer cleared the boundary, for six. This was followed by a crunching straight drive over the bowler’s head but this would not be Guptill’s day. He would soon be lbw to Woakes. Meanwhile Kane Williamson was batting as if a crisis, while not present, was just around the corner. After 22 deliveries he had just two runs.However the storm was weathered by Henry Nicholls and Williamson. The pressure eased the slips dispersed Adil Rashid was then summoned up as the Kiwis dutifully went about their business, passing three figures in the 22nd over.Eventually Liam Plunkett found the edge of Williamson’s bat and Nicholls was bowled via an inside edge for a plucky 55. Now the boundaries were few and far between, though none foresaw that this would be a decisive factor. Ross Taylor was given lbw to Wood and at the end of their innings New Zealand could not break free despite a few crisp strokes from Tom Latham.Yet 242 soon seemed a long way off. Boult’s first delivery to Roy was just about perfect and it prompted a huge appeal for lbw, which was declined by Marais Erasmus. A review was sought. The ball pitched in line but was deemed to be hitting the outside of the leg stump so Roy survived by virtue of an umpire’s call.At the other end Matt Henry kept beating the bat and then Roy would unfurl a majestic drive. But on 17 Roy was beaten again but this time the ball had brushed his bat.Out came Joe Root, usually the most reassuring of sights, but not this time. For Root, of all people, lost control. He heaved against Colin de Grandhomme and missed. The next ball was wider and Root tried to hit it hard, always a bad sign. A drive became a swish and he was caught behind. This stunned the audience it was like a great actor fluffing his lines on the grandest stage.Soon Jonny Bairstow was bowled off the inside edge by Lockie Ferguson, who was to produce something more sensational. Eoin Morgan thrashed outside the off stump the ball flew towards deep point, where Ferguson sprinted in before ing forward to hold a brilliant catch. It felt like a match-winning moment. Yet this was just the start of a bewildering, helter-skelter finale. What a day. What a ricochet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d77102cb677e055b646dfefdb7f1a819b25beff/0_79_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24feafafbd2443087bcc2fe8a0393016","title":"england win cricket world cup and for once the nation really was watching","story":"A slow-burn, horribly gripping, ultimately uproarious day at Lord’s. There has never been a World Cup final like thisPut out more flags. Unfurl the mothballed bunting. Prepare that unaccustomed victory dance. England have won a World Cup – and in the most extraordinary of circumstances.On a slow-burn, horribly gripping, ultimately uproarious day at Lord’s, England’s cricketers beat New Zealand to win the ICC’s 50-over trophy. It is just the third such triumph for the nation’s sportsmen in any major global sport in almost 90 years of trying. The men now join the women as world champions in this format, a trophy Heather Knight’s team won on the same ground almost exactly two years ago.Of course, they did it the hard way. There has never been a World Cup final like this. Chasing a target of 241 after New Zealand had batted first, England found themselves beached at times on a slow, nibbly pitch, their famously aggressive style suffocated by the conditions, and no doubt by the occasion, too, on a day when for once the nation really was watching.The decision to screen this final on terrestrial television was by the end something of a masterstroke. The famous Oval Ashes Test of 1882, the game that spawned the burning of the bails, was so tense that by the end one spectator had a heart attack and another chewed through his own umbrella handle.Well, this was its modern day counterpoint, as Channel 4 was blessed with the most dramatic of finishes, the kind of painful, brutal, tortuous game of inches that only cricket can provide. England lost wickets steadily in their run chase, but were driven on to a dramatic final sprint-finish by a wonderful innings from Ben Stokes, who laid to rest a few of his demons.Stokes was briefly the nation’s most recognisable cricketer last year, if only for having a drunken, violent night out in Bristol followed by a much-publicised day in court. Here he repaid the patience of his teammates many times over with a fine, hugely determined innings to take England to a last-ditch tie on the 50-over scores.And so we reached the the agony of that ending. With the Lord’s shadows lengthening after seven weeks of competition, 48 matches and 22,410 runs scored, the final match would end with each team facing six balls to decide which would become world champions. Somehow, reaching out across the codes, the nation’s cricketers had found a way to make it go to penalties. But then, this is England, land of bruised hopes and faded glory, a place where the desire to win global sporting tournaments is entirely out of kilter with the painful reality of falling short, of last ditch collapse, of cruel, arbitrary endings.In the stands the crowd was in a state of disrepair, sitting, standing, hugging, leaping, making strange noises. Stokes it was who emerged to face Trent Boult, New Zealand’s premier swing bowler.Stokes and Jos Buttler heaved and carved and ran hard. Fifteen from the over looked enough with England’s fastest bowler, the wonderful Jofra Archer, set to defend it. What a moment it was for Archer, whose presence in this team was only confirmed just before the tournament. And what pressure, too, for a man who qualified by virtue of his English passport and British father but who has also drawn some background snark about his switch of allegiance, having played for West Indies at junior levels.Archer kicked off with a wide, as the ground seemed to sag a little. His next ball was squeezed for two. The next went for a huge six. In the end New Zealand needed two from one ball to win. Martin Guptill thrashed it into the leg side, turned, and hurtled back for the second, but was run out by Buttler. England had won in the most bizarre fashion, victors by dint of having tied the super over but having hit more boundaries than their opponents throughout the match – vindication in its own way for the muscular, adrenal attacking style that has been their creed for the past four years.In the moment of victory the air seemed to rush up and out over the tops of those low-rise stands, into the soft blue of the north London sky. The England players ran and leapt, hurling themselves to the turf in a series of victory es. There is no template for this, no set way of celebrating an English victory dredged out of the shadow of so many World Cup failures.The last time England staged a World Cup in 1999 they were out of the tournament before the official World Cup song had been released.The disastrous 2007 campaign saw the captain Andrew Flintoff take off on a late pedalo ride into the sea off St Lucia, apparently convinced that by doing so he might stumble across Ian Botham having a party on a yacht somewhere in the Caribbean ocean. He didn’t find him.And four years ago England were crushed by New Zealand in Wellington, a defeat that seemed to mark the low point of their own frantic, trapped, oddly stiff attempts to compete with the wider world’s interpretation of cricket as a vibrant, joyful post-imperial thing.Four years of planning led to here, with the full weight of the England and Wales Cricket Board’s considerable pay-TV riches behind that elite group of players. A World Cup win is a vindication on many levels. For the players, whose names will now live in English cricket lore as the nation’s first ever 50-over champions, it is a triumph of skill, hard work and modernising brio.For the coach Trevor Baylis, a remote, shrugging sun-hatted figure who will leave this summer after the Ashes, the World Cup means he can claim to be the most influential figure in English white ball history. For the sport’s governing body in England, victory here represents a significant feat of high level planning and investment.As the trophy was presented in the evening sun at Lords it was the sense of relief that was notable above all. London had woken up to the clatter of rain, which had retreated, grudgingly, by 10 o’clock, but all day the sense of lurking jeopardy had remained, the feeling that England might yet fall at the last to a fine, gutsy and resourceful New Zealand team. The end was glorious. What English cricket chooses to do with this moment, how it can spread the game beyond its own shrinking frontiers, promises to be equally fascinating."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c007e4df838ce903e96a4f8346e662674ed4e358/0_173_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f3f6b2c081a1765a5b89bfcb5bcc8da","title":"lewis hamilton thanks supporters british grand prix","story":"Lewis Hamilton celebrated his victory at the British Grand Prix by revelling in the support he received at Silverstone across the weekend.The British driver expressed how much it had meant to him and how he had been inspired to deliver another outstanding performance for the fans at a race he said he will remember for ever.Hamilton won for Mercedes in front of his teammate, Valtteri Bottas, and after question marks over his Britishness earlier in the weekend he made sure he collected a union flag to wave from his car as soon as he could on his in-lap. Acknowledging the fans with the national flag had been important to him, he said.“It is the greatest single moment of any athlete in the world to wave their flag as the number one or with gold or whatever it may be in their home country,” he said.“It’s been the single most incredible feeling and most special moments an athlete can have. I come here and I look at all this incredible support. They always ask you how much does it lift you up and it’s a huge amount of energy but a lot of weight comes with that, a lot of responsibility.“People buy merchandise and flags and you just want to deliver for them so much.“I really just wanted to deliver and, when you achieve something like today and you see all those British flags, one day I will look back and have a picture of me in the car with that flag and I will always be able to look at that and smile until my dying day.”Hamilton became the most successful driver at the British Grand Prix, with his sixth win, surpassing Jim Clark and Alain Prost. He does not generally pursue records but admitted he would now take pleasure in a remarkable achievement.“Unless I stop and think of how many wins I have, I didn’t really know if I had four, five or whatever it was here,” he said.“To then hear that I have six and to be up there with the greats, I remember growing up watching this sport and watching a lot of the greats and meeting a lot of the greats, even working with one of the greats and now to be up there with them is one of the coolest things.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a0ec5ec3afba909a44d2a7b36c3ff8c7025e058/0_193_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b15c7a7039b000b6ec46782af3da99b","title":"new zealand v england cricket world cup final 2019 live","story":"England have won the World Cup.

So maybe just watch some of the action here:Here’s another video to savour (or to endure if you’re watching in New Zealand) covering England’s slightly shaky route to the final.And some more ...Anyway, to borrow from Barry Davies, frankly who cares? It’s all about England today, so let’s just say, for the sake of argument, that this is the best game ever. (And of course, New Zealand played an amazing part and were bloody unlucky.)The front pages look good. Several papers have managed their own tie with a Champagne Super Over headline. ’s head of UK news, Owen Gibson, guessed right on the Sun’s headline (back page at least).The claims for Sunday’s final to be the greatest game of one-day cricket ever played are stacking up. It’s hard to beat the super over format for drama but the game’s answer to the penalty shootout is always going to be quite rare. The 1999 semi-final between Australia and South Africa was tied and has to be rank alongside this final. The two best teams in the competition were deadlocked, with the Australians going through because they had beaten the Proteas earlier in the tournament. The climax of the semi – like Sunday’s final – came with a run out, albeit one of the most comic in cricketing history. Another way that Rees-Mogg might have looked at the England win was this run down of the multicultural mix of the team and concluded that it says a lot about what is great about Britain. Who says sport and politics don’t mix? Just when you’re enjoying England’s historic win, Jacob Rees-Mogg pops up to spoil the fun by claiming it as a triumph for Brexit (or something like that). His tweet that England “don’t need Europe to win” misses the point on a number of levels, not least that England’s captain is Irish. And he’s not the backstop either. Elliott Kime has written it up for your further reading.You can relive the win by watching our video here ...How about this stat? Not that surprising in some ways, but deeply satisfying all the same. Long live cricket! What a way to hand over the blog. Thanks Rob. This is Martin Farrer taking over in Sydney where the first full day of England’s reign as world champions is just beginning.I had a traumatic night following the match, having fallen asleep towards the end of New Zealand’s innings, then going to bed and waking up again to read on the blog that Stokes was single-handedly trying to drag England over the line. I managed to get up and watch the last over and super overs. Suffice to say I couldn’t get back to sleep after that ...And with that I’ll hand you over to the capable hands of Martin Farrer. Goodbye and thanks for sharing your thoughts. I can’t summarise better than this email from Abhijato Sensarma …This was the most poetic final fixture in the history of cricket the match had the most skilful cricket ever seen we witnessed the most thrilling tie, twice everyone experienced the most cathartic emotions at the end of it. Needless to say, this was the greatest ODI match of all time. Cheers to everyone involved in playing, covering and following this tournament. Long live cricket! Our man in Nelson reckons the Kiwis are taking the defeat quite well … Was this the greatest day of simultaneous live sport in the history of Britain? A few frazzled brains in  towers would attest to that. “Today should go down as an absolutely historic, mental, mind-boggling day,” writes Kanishk Srinivasan. “Not just in cricket, but all sporting history. I was watching the Wimbledon finals on my phone and this insane game on my laptop simultaneously. And England needed two runs from that last ball EXACTLY AS DJOKOVIC AND FEDERER WERE TAKING IT IN TO A TIEBREAK. I couldn’t breathe, and I was pulling my hair out, and frantically deciding which one deserves my primary attention. At the end of the day, I had to go take a 20-minute walk just to settle my nerves. That being said, well played England, and New Zealand absolutely deserved it as much as England (if not that teeny tiny bit more).” Amid all the euphoria, Simon Thomas has taken a moment to remember the late, great Dan Lucas. “Tell you what, Rob,” he writes. “Our much loved OBO guy, Dan Lucas would have loved this. And would have described it brilliantly. Miss you, Dan.” We all miss you Dan, and we’ll never forget you mate. The Queen is on Twitter, and tweeting her congratulations to the glorious champions …Theresa May is dancing again. It must be a momentous day … Even the suits behind the Cricket World Cup are in jovial spirits tonight …“Myself, my three daughters and cricket mad hubby … all of us die-hard Pakistan fans …. are currently in Paris where everyone is obsessed with some tournament called Wimbledon,” writes Natasha Shoaib. “Walking around Le Marais on Bastille day we wandered into an English pub for a pit stop during the final 10 overs, put on data and followed ball by ball commentary online. As neutrals we were supporting the Kiwis and were on the edge of our seats for the last hour of the match. What an incredible match and fitting end to one of the most exciting cricket world cups ever. The Kiwis have won our hearts … I will still wear my Pak green team shirt … but am getting the name “Williamson” put on the back!”Kane Williamson was given a standing ovation as he left his press conference after the final, his dignity in defeat a lesson to us all. “Just one of those things,” was his take on a loss as unfortunate as you can imagine. His reaction to learning he had been named player of the tournament summed him up … Kane, we salute you …The sun was out when England won the World Cup. It had just emerged from behind the freckles of white cloud and was shining low through the bright blue over the Grand Stand. The shadows stretched over the grass all the way to the wicket, the flags licked in the evening breeze, the pavilion glowed soft terracotta. The old place looked pretty as a picture, exactly how we see it in winter, when we are thinking back on the games we saw and the games we played in the long, warm days of summer. For the 11 men in this England team, the thousands in the ground, the millions watching on TV, that is how they will always see it in their minds in years to come when they talk about this match: the greatest World Cup final heck, maybe even the greatest game of one-day cricket ever played.Where better for England’s transgenerational trauma to end than the home of cricket, writes Andy Bull. Read his full story here.Jason Roy has a simple take on the day’s proceedings … Graeme Swann, unsurprisingly, was more loquacious …“What the bloody hell just happened?” writes Guy Hornsby. “I started the match in London, ended it up in Manchester, and I still can’t get my head around what went down. I don’t think I was even that tense when my daughter was born. I shed a tear – of relief – at the end, because I couldn’t take another ball. Then I forgot we actually won. And that’s first the first cricket game my two-year old daughter has ever watched. So tough on the Black Caps, but my god we DID IT. Thanks to all the OBOers and  writers. It’s been magic because of all of you. I may need a week off work. These guys have the Ashes in a few weeks.” Some of the emails from our loyal OBO community have been almost as good as the cricket today. The tales from far flung corners, the camaraderie and the pure love of the game have been quite something. Stephen Wilcox encapsulates the drama in three short sentences. “We left our B\u0026ampB in Ravenna with England guaranteed losers,” he writes. “At the end of the street we passed someone in a restaurant saying 3 from 2. And getting back after eating – this is worthy of an epic.” Great pub quiz question alert? What have Mark Wood and the Charlton brothers got in common?  man Richard Jolly has the answer …This was a match full of incredible moments, but for anyone who missed the greatest of all in the history of England cricket, here it is …Brendon McCullum knows what it’s like to lose a World Cup final, and he reckons New Zealand will be just fine after this devastating defeat…  They’ve got a wonderful leader in Kane Williamson and a great squad around them but you know, our country is going to be so proud of these guys and what they’ve done.Thanks Rob, and I join you just as Ian Botham is having his say on a wonderful game …  What great finale. Both sides had a dip in the middle in the tournament but came back and picked themselves up for a final. You couldn’t have asked for a better final. Congratulations to England but spare a thought for those Kiwis 12,000 miles away. It’s a long journey home when you come that close buy ultimately it wasn’t their day. We’ll keep the blog going for a while. Nobody leaves here until somebody explains what the hell just happened. Rob Bleaney is going to take over, because I am the personification of wibble. Thanks for your company and emails - not just today but throughout the tournament. Bye!“On a flight from Boston to Tokyo - the flight attendant made me shut down my phone when England needed 3 from 2 balls,” says Mike Fowler. “Took 10 minutes to acquire flaky inflight Internet, by which time I assumed it would all be over. Lived the super overs with your text and texts from friends back home. I think they were lining up a sky marshall to deal with me when I started cheering....”“Yeah, okay,” says Geoff Wignall, “but The Hundred will soon put all this in the shade.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6bc30ced0d763f63c293552eaaf946a398a59d6/0_0_3648_2190/master/3648.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa5dc5c5d67e2ba74a546c1816b4f477","title":"recreating europe review the lowry salford manchester international festival brexit","story":"The Lowry, SalfordFrom Henry V’s speech to Jona Lewie’s Stop the Cavalry, this illuminating production explores the ‘flawed family’ of EuropeWay back at the start of the Brexit wars, Rufus Norris and Carol Ann Duffy put together a play based on interviews with people – mainly leavers – about their thoughts on the referendum. Topical though it was, My Country: A Work in Progress felt like a vox pop, all shallow thoughts and contradictions, offering lots of noise and little insight. It’s a shame Ivo van Hove’s Re:Creating Europe wasn’t around at the same time because, although it has a similar multi-voice format, its analysis goes deeper.In a one-off for the Manchester international festival, it is performed script-in-hand by actors from Internationaal Theater Amsterdam with Juliet Stevenson, Christopher Eccleston, Adjoa Andoh, Lemn Sissay and Michael Morpurgo. Their source material ranges from John Donne (“No man is an island”) to Barack Obama (“We are heirs to a struggle for freedom”), supplemented by video footage that embraces everything from a Winston Churchill speech to Jona Lewie’s Stop the Cavalry.Morpurgo sets the tone with Phoenix of Peace, an introductory broadside in which he declares: “I am not impartial about Europe.” Like the show as a whole, his view is historical, highlighting the conflicts that brought the countries of Europe together in the first place – and what is at stake should ever they pull apart. He is not blind to the shortcomings of the EU, but alarmed by those who forget its history. “It may be a flawed family,” he says. “But it is my family.”From there, in a production that is as multilingual as the continent itself, we go from Victor Hugo prophesying a Europe no longer at war with itself to Stevenson adopting the tones of Margaret Thatcher to celebrate our common experience: “Our destiny is in Europe.” Laurence Olivier doing the St Crispin’s Day speech from Henry V on film is picked up by Eccleston, then completed in Dutch, as if to underscore our cultural connections even at our most gung-ho.It’s not a show for Brexiters, but, in admitting to complexity, it creates a richer, more nuanced – if belated – picture of our interdependence than the reductive simplicity of most public debate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/709e11f0e1eaa173ed1fe5ab0295bcb1d292557b/0_0_3162_4328/master/3162.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=067b024e08f0344712abd486dd89a36d 480w","title":"accounts posing as dominic raab and liam fox among twitter takedowns","story":"MoD, DExEU and DHSC lodged complaints requesting removal of fake accounts pretending to be associated with governmentTwitter accounts masquerading as official outlets for Dominic Raab and Liam Fox were revealed as among those the UK government succeeded in shutting down after complaining to the social media company.Details of complaints to Twitter by various departments about suspected fake accounts posing as original have been revealed by freedom of information requests from the , showing it has not always gone in favour of the UK government.The Department of Health and Social Care has tried and failed to close down an account, @NHoS which has 16 followers and appears to belong to a woman in the city of St Louis, Missouri.“We’ve researched the reported account and determined that it is not in violation of Twitter’s trademark policy,” Twitter told DHSC after the complaint was lodged.In other cases however, Twitter has suspended a number of accounts for breaching rules on impersonation after complaints lodged by the Foreign Office.One account, @UKAmbRichard, was pretending to be that of the UK ambassador to Turkey and appeared to have acquired some Twitter followers. Another, @SGSSIGov, appeared to be masquerading as the government of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, a British overseas territory in the southern Atlantic Ocean.Both complaints were made last year by the Foreign Office, which also complained successfully to Twitter in 2017 about an account set up by the Russian broadcaster RT as part of a commemorative project for the centenary of the Russian Revolution.The account, @BritshEmb1917, had been set up by RT and used an image of the Foreign Office’s official crest under a profile identifying it as “the official Twitter account of the United Kingdom in the Russian Empire”.In the UK, the Department for Transport took action twice last year against accounts pretending to be one of its branches. Twitter removed both accounts – @DVLAgov_uk and @DVLAgovuk2 – posed as associated with the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency, which maintains a database of drivers in Britain.The action against Twitter on behalf of Liam Fox was taken by his special advisers last year. The fake Dominic Raab accounts which the Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU) complained about were @DominicRab and @BrexitRaab.According to DExEU, Twitter instructed the user of the latter account to make it clear that it was a parody. The account was removed and then recreated but had lost all its followers.The Ministry of Defence has been particularly active. Last year, after MoD complaints Twitter removed @UKchiefofstaff, an account apparently pretending to be Gen Sir Mark Carleton-Smith, the army’s chief of the general staff.In 2017 Twitter suspended @gwilliamsonUK, an account named after the then defence minister.

Can you find it?”It’s not an easy task. There are dozens of prominent colourful flowers within arm’s reach of David. These dunes, on close inspection, are an eye-popping floral cornucopia. But at last I spot it: three gorgeous pink petals arranged around a central lobe of deep claret and yellow. It looks a lot like a spectacular insect.“Bee orchid,” says David. “Actually, there are two other species of orchid to your right.”One of them is easy: a fiery pyramid of scarlet florets named, prosaically, pyramidal orchid. The other takes a little longer as the flower is green. David eventually takes pity and points it out: a twayblade orchid, a tall spike of inconspicuous green flowers. Not all are so unobtrusive: August will bring the autumn lady’s tresses orchid, for example, with spirals of white flowers on stems up to a foot long. “We’ve got orchids here from April to September,” David tells me, “Fourteen or 15 species.”“You don’t know exactly?”We walk up a grassy dune and there, in the distance, is the Port Talbot steel works. I can read the giant Tata logo on the building. It might seem surprising that the 1,300-acre Kenfig national nature reserve, one of our most valuable patches of conservation land, is so near the industrial heart of south Wales. A bit like the British steel industry, however, this fragile wilderness is also threatened. David is himself an endangered species: there used to be five wildlife wardens here, giving guided walks, manning a handsome visitor centre, pointing out the orchids to less observant visitors like myself. Now only David and a small band of enthusiastic volunteers remain.We stroll along a long, low damp area, known as a slack, and find a huge orchid nestled in a bank: the flower stalk must be 18 inches tall and on top, not yet emerged, a juicy stack of imminent flowers. “Orchids hybridise like crazy,” David explains. “This one has got elements of a spotted orchid and also a pyramidal. That’s the problem. Some experts will split a species in two, others will lump them together.” He laughs. “So we have 14 or 15.”Something flies past, buzzing, and David is off up the path. “Get your camera! Quick!” We rush off to a flower-fringed area and stop. David points out a large pale bumblebee. “That’s a shrill carder bee – I haven’t seen one in years.”It is, in fact, Britain’s rarest bee, a creature known only from a few coastal sites in Wales and southern England. We linger a while, spotting two lizards basking on a wooden post and a pair of cuckoos who zoom briskly away. Then David decides to show me the reserve’s true rarity.We head back to the slack and, next to a cane jammed in the ground, there is a small inconspicuous orchid, beautiful on close inspection. “That is a fen orchid and it is only found here.”The story of this flower is remarkable. Back in the 1990s, when David first arrived at Kenfig, there were thousands, but year by year they declined. “I got quite paranoid,” he says. “It seemed like I only had to look at one and it would disappear.”By 2015 there were, he estimated, around 200 remaining – the entire British population. Then a new strategy of cutting the grass and even scraping the surface of the dune slack was begun. “The flower actually survives on shifting dune systems. It needed the disturbance.” Now numbers are back to over 1,000 and Kenfig attracts botanists from all over the world, the best time to see them being in June.I leave the place in awe of its delicate beauty. I’ve seen two species that are each rarer than the tiger or rhino and I’m a mile from the M4. I want to know what other unexpected gems this area harbours.At the nearby seaside town of Porthcawl I rent a fat bike (£10 per hour) and take a long, lazy ride along the sands – there are miles of them – stopping when the River Ogmore blocks my progress. Then I walk into the Merthyr Mawr dune system, neighbour to Kenfig. Almost immediately I’m spotting pyramidal orchids and lots of bees. A rabbit watches me from behind the blue spikes of viper’s-bugloss flowers and red-caped cinnabar moths flit ahead.By the time I get back, I’m itching to get into the sea, so I head down to Porthcawl Surf school (beginner’s lesson from £30) and grab a lesson as the tide goes out. Hugh Murray started the business after the 2008 financial crash left him jobless. It proved a shrewd decision as the beach is only three-and-a-half hours from London. “You can do it in a day,” he points out.With the sun bursting out, we head to the breakers. Hugh turns out to be a fine tutor. Within an hour I stand up on a moving surf board and ride a wave. Sadly Hugh, camera in hand, is momentarily distracted and misses the triumph, one rarer than any living creature in UK and unlikely to be seen again. Let’s hope the fen orchid and shrill carder bee fare better.• The trip was provided by Bridgend Tourism.

In his writings and media interviews, however, O’Rourke has dealt only with kin who lived too late to have fought for the south in the American civil war, or to have been slave masters.In an interview, O’Rourke said that he and his wife knew nothing about their ancestral ties to the Confederacy and slave holding until he was contacted by the . Amy O’Rourke declined to be interviewed.O’Rourke often talks about the Irish-immigrant roots of his father, the late Patrick Frances “Pat” O’Rourke. One of Pat’s great-grandfathers, Bernard “Barney” O’Rourke, immigrated from Ireland, apparently in the 1860s. He lived in the midwest, worked on the railroads, and had no connection with the antebellum south.O’Rourke has also acknowledged his Welsh-immigrant great-grandmother, who arrived in the United States in the early 20th century.O’Rourke said he visits Ancestry about once a year but has never researched any kin besides those on his father’s Irish side. To look into the rest of the family, O’Rourke said, would have taken “time I don’t have”.But one of his grandmothers, Mildred Jasper O’Rourke, came from an old, southern family. Her great-grandfather, Andrew Cowan Jasper, lived in Kentucky in the early 19th century. The Federal Slave Census of 1850 lists him as owning two young women, one 22 years old and the other 17. Census enumerators during the period recorded owners’ names, but only the gender and ages of enslaved people.In 1856, Andrew Jasper moved from Kentucky to Kansas territory with his family and the enslaved women. He died a year later, and his estate was probated. The enslaved women, who by then were 27 and 23, were identified in the estate papers as Rose and Eliza.The executor of the estate hired an appraiser to price Rose and Eliza – at $800 a piece. The two were then put out for hire, and the executor spent $5.05 to buy them work clothes. During the next few weeks, the enslaved women earned Jasper’s widow and children $29.58. Calculating the 60 hours per week of labor they probably did, that comes out to about $4,000 in today’s dollars.The executor organized a “crying sale”, today known as an estate auction. Among the items liquidated were plows, horses, cows, calves, rifles, a grindstone – and Rose and Eliza.O’Rourke said he was moved to learn of the two women whom Jasper enslaved.“Amy and I sat down and talked through this,” O’Rourke said. “How Andrew was able, through his descendants, to pass on the benefits of owning other human beings. And ultimately I and my children are beneficiaries of that.”The realization has affected him deeply, he said, adding: “I don’t know if I’ve got the words for it.” O’Rourke later elaborated on this in a post on Medium, writing: “We all need to know our own story as it relates to the national story, much as I am learning mine.”O’Rourke also has antebellum southern ancestry on his maternal side. His mother is Melissa Williams O’Rourke, and Melissa’s father – O’Rourke’s grandfather – was Robert Lee Williams Jr, after whom Beto was named.The family was from Georgia, and Robert Lee Williams’s grandfather – Beto’s great-great-grandfather – was Columbus Marion Williams. Columbus joined the Confederate forces when he was 16, along with his 44-year-old father, Frederick Samuel Williams.O’Rourke’s wife, Amy Sanders O’Rourke, also has Confederacy and slaveholding roots. Her great-grandmother, Margaret Fieulle, was surnamed Levy before she married, and her grandfather was Richard B Levy. Richard hailed from a family of Presbyterians, many of who became Episcopalians after the civil war.The Levys were planters in Tidewater Virginia, starting in the 18th century. A 1798 probate record, available online, memorializes an argument among the extended family over who would inherit several enslaved people: “one negro man called Peter”, “a boy called Darsy”, “a girl called Sally”, a “negro man called Ned” and “one other called Moses”.Richard B Levy fought for the Confederacy and was with Robert E Lee at his surrender at Appomattox in 1865. A few years later Richard moved to Longview, Texas – a city that would experience five lynchings between 1888 and 1919, and a white-instigated race riot that ended with the black side of town burned down.During the Jim Crow era, the United Daughters of the Confederacy founded a chapter in Longview and named it after Richard B Levy. The UDC’s mission was to preserve laudatory ideas about the antebellum south – including the Confederacy and slavery – among future generations of white people.To that end, the UDC distributed books to school libraries that justified white supremacism, and they erected scores of celebratory monuments throughout the south. In 1911, the Richard B Levy chapter placed a statue of a Confederate soldier in downtown Longview. Thousands of people attended the unveiling and, according to historical accounts, roared with delight when “Dixie” was sung. Margaret Levy pulled the canvas off the statue.More than a century later, it still stands in Longview. The Richard B Levy UDC chapter is still listed with the IRS as a non-profit organization.Countless Americans could share similar family stories – if they knew them. Almost 2 million white people in the antebellum south owned 4 million slaves. Today the number of descendants of slave owners runs in the tens of millions, encompassing people living throughout America, with political leanings that  the spectrum from right to left.But few white people have explored this uncomfortable side of their genealogy: they “mostly want to distance ourselves from it”, said Thomas deWolf, who directs the organization Coming to the Table. It promotes explorations of genealogy, and interracial communication, among the descendants of white enslavers and African American enslaved.DeWolf, who is white, is author of Inheriting the Trade: A Northern Family Confronts Its Legacy as the Largest Slaveholding Dynasty in US History. His Rhode Island ancestors, who brought thousands of slaves to the Caribbean and the American south from west Africa, are the subject of the book.“Most people think that ‘reparations’ means writing checks” to people living today, who were never enslaved, DeWolf said. But, he noted, the word is rooted in “repair”.For Coming to the Table, repairing America’s slave holding past includes white people working for structural change: eradicating racism from the justice system, for example and abolishing racial inequalities in public education.For DeWolf, doing genealogy work, and telling the particular histories it unearths, is a precursor to structural repair. Americans need to “gather together in the grief of it all”, he said. He quoted his cousin, Katrina Browne, who testified in June at congressional hearings for HB40, a House bill, which, if passed, would create a commission to study the issue of reparations: “It is good for the soul of a person, a people and of a nation to set things right.”O’Rourke said he agrees.

Authorities said they had tracked down all the passengers on the bus the man took to Goma from Butembo, one of the towns hardest hit by the disease.“Because of the speed with which the patient was identified and isolated, and the identification of all the other bus passengers coming from Butembo, the risk of it spreading in the rest of the city of Goma is small,” the health ministry said in a statement.The virus has killed more than 1,600 people in Congo and two others who returned home across the border to neighbouring Uganda. Health experts have long feared that it could make its way to Goma, which is located on the Rwandan border.The health ministries in Congo’s neighbours have been preparing for months for the possibility of cases, and frontline health workers already have been vaccinated.The confirmed case announced late Sunday in eastern Congo involves a pastor who became ill last Tuesday. He then left Butembo on a bus, and arrived at a health centre Sunday showing symptoms of Ebola, the health ministry said.Violent attacks against health workers and treatment facilities have greatly compromised efforts to combat the epidemic in Butembo.Eastern Congo is home to a myriad of armed groups, and Mai Mai militia fighters are active near the hardest hit towns. Health teams have been unable to access violent areas to vaccinate people at risk of infection and to bring infected patients into isolation.Other times the violence against health teams has come from residents who do not want their loved ones taken to treatment centres or buried in accordance with guidelines aimed at reducing Ebola transmission.While the experimental vaccine is believed to have saved countless lives, not all Congolese people have accepted it. Some falsely believe that the vaccine is what is making people sick, in part because people can still develop the disease after getting the shot if they already had been infected.Associated Press contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/055e527e119c945b78ceda930dbd652f8a69c440/0_76_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb8a174ee6abae02b35090a4888c36d3","title":"india calls off moon mission minutes before launch liftoff cancel chandrayaan 2","story":"Nation’s first attempt at a landing on the moon put on hold due to ‘technical snag’India’s moon mission, destined for the uncharted south pole, has been put on hold less than an hour before take off, following a technical glitch.The mission, which was scheduled to launch at 02:51 local time from Sriharikota space centre, north of Chennai, is India’s most ambitious to date.At 56.24 minutes from launch, the countdown stop was frozen and a media feed from the control room was cut off. Shortly afterwards, the Indian Space Research Organisation confirmed that the launch had been abandoned for the day.“A technical snag was observed in launch vehicle system at T-56 minute. As a measure of abundant precaution, #Chandrayaan2 launch has been called off for today,” the agency tweeted.A revised launch date will be announced later, it added.The mission has another 10-minute back up window in which it could launch on Tuesday. Chandrayaan-2 is India’s first attempt at a surface landing on the moon - a feat achieved by only Russia, the US and China. If successful, it would also be the first mission to conduct a surface landing on the little-explored lunar south pole region, where scientists hope to collect information about the moon’s mineral and chemical composition, and search for water.The four-tonne spacecraft is equipped with a lunar orbiter, a lander and a rover that is designed to spend two weeks analysing the moon’s surface.The mission comes amid a renewed global interest in moon exploration. In January, a Chinese spacecraft became the first to land on the far side of the moon, while in April, the Israeli spacecraft Beresheet, the first privately funded mission to the moon, crashed after an apparent engine failure.India’s space programmes have been hailed by nationalist prime minister Narendra Modi as a marker of the country’s rising status as a global power. In March, Modi announced the successful test of the country’s first space weapon, an anti-satellite missile. The missile test was criticised by Nasa, who warned it had created dangerous orbital debris.Monday’s attempted launch follows Chandrayaan-1, India’s first lunar mission in 2008, which helped confirm the presence of water on the moon, but did not land on the lunar surface.As well as Chandrayaan-2, India is developing a plan to launch a manned space mission by 2022."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Annual reports from country\u0026rsquos 11 prisons released under Freedom of Information ruleMost common cause of narcotic poisoning among youngsters under 13 is methadoneEast coast growth and climate challenge supply system little changed since 1893T\u0026aacutenaiste says claims of disinformation on North and Brexit came from \u0026lsquoreputable\u0026rsquo bodyNone of the six claims were brought by TDs or Senators, commission confirmsHarris to propose re-establishing regional structures similar to old health board systemTrump says four US congresswomen should \u0026lsquogo back\u0026rsquo to \u0026lsquoplaces from which they came\u0026rsquoCity council extending parking zones to take in more streets in addition to sharp fee riseWater-stressed east coast has high population density and least surface water availableCommissioner in charge of largest US police force says policing has to have \u0026lsquoright number\u0026rsquoPlans for water jets at Liffey Street pedestrian scheme scrapped by City CouncilMost payphone calls are to domestic violence and homeless shelters, says ComRegSmall studies show brothers and sisters of abused often feel guilt, anger and despairTop EU nominee repeats strong support for Border backstop as \u0026lsquoabsolutely necessary\u0026rsquoMore than 300 motorists argued signs were inadequate in appeals to NTA about being clampedIncident occurred on Sunday evening when his vehicle went off the road at Kilpadder SouthUN peacekeeping veterans say Government could honour army by \u0026lsquolooking after them\u0026rsquoFlanagan asks industry to \u0026lsquoact hastily\u0026rsquo to cut premiums before judicial review of payoutsAmid calls for sacking as morale hits \u0026lsquorock bottom\u0026rsquo, Paul Kehoe stands over track record"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3956365.1563118039!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cold front from iceland coming with weather set to be wet this week","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe increased cloud cover will increase the chances of occasional showers.

Mr Byrne is ‘very, very down’, his father Jim has saidAn Irishman jailed in the US while trying to secure citizenship is preparing to spend weeks behind bars after refusing to sign a form that would have allowed his deportation to Ireland within days, according to his father.Keith Byrne is “very, very down” but is refusing to sign the waiver that would have seen him put on a plane back to Ireland within 48 hours, his father Jim has said.Mr Byrne spoke with his son on the telephone on Saturday. He is being held in the Pike County Correctional Facility, in Pennsylvania after he was detained by US immigration officials this week.“He is very, very down,” Mr Byrne said after talking to his son. “He keeps apologising for having put his family in such straits, saying it is all his fault. He blames himself. He said he made a stupid mistake 15 years ago and he is paying for it now.”Keith (37) from Fermoy, Co Cork, was arrested by US Immigration and Custom Enforcement (ICE) officers in Montgomery County, outside Philadelphia, while travelling to work - a painting and decorating business he has built up over the last five years - on Wednesday.The father-of-three’s family say he has been living and working legally in the US since 2007 but lost a recent appeal against a refusal to grant him residency because of two separate charges of personal use of cannabis on his record from when he was younger in Ireland.“It was only a stupid error he made - he got fined, for God’s sake,” his father Jim told The .“And, now, he is paying the ultimate price.”Officials asked Mr Byrne in prison to sign a form in recent days which would have him deported to Ireland within 48 hours, but he refused and will have to remain locked up until he is seen by a judge, his father said.He expects this could prolong the process by two or three weeks.“Keith has a hell of a lot to fight for - he has an awful lot to lose,” he added.Mr Byrne has phoned his father every weekend since going to the US in 2007 - “I’ve often cursed him on a Sunday for phoning me when the match is on.” - and was always “happy and jolly” about the life he had built for himself and his family, his father said.Being forced to return to Ireland would “devastate” his family and “destroy” his business.“He was getting on great. He gave his first party in his new house for the 4th of July this year - he was living the American dream really,” he said.“He had spent a lot of time on the house, he was sending me pictures of all the work he was doing to it. He didn’t expect this. He had high hopes he would get a Green Card. A friend of his who was there 15 or 16 years eventually got a Green Card and that really boosted Keith.”Mr Byrne’s father said he was worried about his son having to return to Ireland.Mr Byrne’s mother Mary was in a car accident late last year and is still getting hospital treatment for her injuries.“This is the last thing she needed. She is not taking this well,” he said.Mr Byrne’s family in Fermoy are to meet with local TD Sean Sherlock on Monday.Mr Sherlock has called on Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney as well as the Government to “urgently” intervene to seek Mr Byrne’s release and return to his family.“His case highlights the precariousness of Irish people who have settled in the US, who have no legal status but who are contributing to society,” said Mr Sherlock.“It is vital that his case is raised at the highest political level to seek to have him released on humanitarian grounds.“He poses no threat to anyone. His wife and children are beside themselves with worry. A political intervention by the Minister for Foreign Affairs would certainly assist matters at this stage. “Mr Byrne’s family contend that he was never an undocumented immigrant, and when his visa expired he alerted authorities with a view to regularising his situation."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3956599.1563139877!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government plans biggest restructuring of hse in 15 years","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Health Simon Harris is to bring proposals to Cabinet on Wednesday to re-establish six regional healthcare structures around the State, which will have high levels of autonomy. File photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe Government will give the go-ahead this week for the biggest restructuring of the Health Service Executive (HSE) since it was established almost 15 years ago.Minister for Health Simon Harris is to bring proposals to Cabinet on Wednesday to re-establish six regional healthcare structures around the State, which will have high levels of autonomy.The change will essentially result in a partial return to the old health board system that was in place before the HSE came into being on January 1st, 2005. The move towards such a fundamental restructuring reflects Government thinking that the HSE is not fit for purpose, as it has become too large and bureaucratic.Sources said yesterday there was a need to devolve the services more to the regions, and that would mean setting up a modern iteration of the old health boards. The corollary would be, the sources said, that the HSE would become a much smaller and slimmed-down organisation, with responsibility for governance, oversight and national management of the service.This change was recommended by the all-party committee that published Sláintecare, the blueprint for the future of the health services. It is also understood to be a priority for the new HSE chief executive Paul Reid. There were 11 regional health boards throughout the State until the HSE was established in 2005. The organisation, with a staff of 100,000, was conceived to reduce costs and increase efficiency by ending duplication across the country. However, the centralised organisation proved to be unwieldy, cumbersome and not flexible enough to adapt to local need. It was also politically unpopular. Since 2011, a process of partial regionalisation has taken place with the creation of nine community healthcare organisations (CHOs). With a geographical spread, they have had responsibility for all non-hospital services including primary care, social care, mental health, health promotion, screening and vaccinations.However, hospital services have been clustered into six hospital groups around the country. Their regions do not coincide with the borders of the CHOs and in some cases hospitals from one hospital group area are spread across CHOs. Mr Harris has previously criticised the situation where the CHOs and hospital group regions are not geographically aligned. The new structures will include all services, hospital and non-hospital, in each region. MappedNo details have as yet been disclosed as to how the regional set-up will be mapped. If they are to roughly follow the areas covered by the hospital groups, it would mean separate organisations in Dublin Leinster the North-West Mid-West South-West and South-East. The establishment of the HSE represented the biggest restructuring of a public entity since the foundation of the State. Structures, work practices and processes had been so different in the health boards that it created difficulties in delivering services on an integrated basis. A new system called PPARS, which was designed to integrate personnel, payroll and related systems across the HSE, was abandoned in 2005 after its initial estimated cost of €8 million escalated to some €150 million, including €60 million in spending on external management, technology and consultants. In 2009, the HSE initiated its first restructuring with the appointment of four regional directors. The Fine Gael-Labour coalition which came to power in 2011 had undertaken to dismantle the HSE and replace it with a new model based around universal health insurance. However, that policy was jettisoned in 2014."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3955182.1562956162!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"renewed putsch looms in germany s far right afd party","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAlexander Gauland (left) and Björn Höcke have differing visions of the AfD. Photograph: Getty More than 100 members of Germany’s populist Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) have warned that the party is in danger of being hijacked by its far-right flank.In an open letter, leading AfD officials warned that regional leader Björn Höcke, party head in the eastern state of Thuringia, is aiming to take over the party, shift even further right and squeeze out remaining conservatives and liberals.“The AfD is not and will not be a Björn Höcke party,” the letter said, saying they reject the “cult of personality” around the regional leader some members have compared to Nazi propaganda leader Joseph Goebbels.Their letter was a response to Höcke’s star turn at a regional gathering of AfD nationalists and “patriots” last weekend. As about 800 supporters cheered and waved German flags, Höcke called into question the contribution of immigrants to Germany’s post-war economy.“The policy of open borders practised for decades . . . this irrational migration policy . . . has bled us financially as if we had lost another war,” said Höcke, who has risen to prominence by happily courting controversy.Last year he narrowly avoided being ejected from the party after suggesting that Germany’s “stupid” efforts to remember and learn from its Nazi past had “crippled” the country.Now he is at the centre of party attention again thanks to his nationalist “Flügel” flank, which has taken control of regional parties in at least five federal states.Last weekend Höcke defended his “Flügel” as a casual organisation with “no membership cards or numbers, just patriots who don’t want to give up on this country”.It was not his “Flügel”that is trying to ide the AfD, Höcke insisted, but others in the party – including the national party leadership.Listening to his speech was one of those leaders: Alexander Gauland, Bundestag co-leader in Berlin. He is no no stranger to provocation, describing the 12-year Third Reich as “a pile of bird shit” on an otherwise glorious panorama of German history.But at last weekend’s gathering Gauland, for years a dominant figure in the party, warned nationalist AfD members to watch their words or endanger a looming election breakthrough.Ahead of three autumn elections, polls show the AfD running neck-and-neck with the ruling Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in Saxony, in first place in Brandenburg and second place in Thuringia.The AfD was not created “to create a space in which everyone can say everything”, said Gauland, predicting that embracing crude, nationalist language would scare away more moderate voters.It remains to be seen if Gauland can survive the latest uprising in the party. After already toppling two leaders in its six-year existence, Höcke appears to be gearing up the AfD for a third putsch. On Friday it emerged that he had agreed a political pact behind Gauland’s back with his Bundestag co-leader, Alice Weidel.A leading far-right ideologue within the party, Götz Kubitschek, said on Friday that Weidel had realised that the party “cannot shake off Björn Höcke and his network without causing damage”.“All are in agreement that calming things down in the party is one of the most important tasks,” wrote Kubitschek in a blog post.Founded in 2013 as a Eurosceptic party and bailout critic, the AfD narrowly avoided entering the Bundestag parliament that year. In 2017 it became the strongest opposition party, beating the Free Democrats (FDP), Greens and Left Party.Crucial to a revival in its fortunes was growing public unease in Germany over the 2015 influx of more than one million refugees – and a series of violent attacks involving asylum seekers.The last two years have been marked by a stream of departures of more conservative and liberal figures in the party. Höcke’s “Flügel” grouping inside the AfD has reached out to the xenophobic “Pegida” grouping behind Monday-night marches in Germany. It has also allied itself with the Germany branch of the “Identitarian Movement”, which opposes globalisation, liberalism and multiethnic societies."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3956431.1563125036!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ursula von der leyen sets out stall ahead of crunch vote","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUrsula von der Leyen promises much more intensive dialogue with MEPs. Photograph: Getty“It’s going to be a close call.”Ursula von der Leyen has no illusions about Tuesday’s vote in the European Parliament. The last 12 days has propelled Germany’s quiet-spoken defence minister into a political maelstrom since EU leaders at the European Council proposed her as president of the European Commission, seemingly out of the blue, as a compromise candidate to succeed Jean Claude Juncker.The first she knew about it was a call on the Monday night, July 1st, of the extended summit – “if the commission presidency job was offered, would she take it”? She didn’t hesitate, although admitting to being awestruck at the prospect, but she had always wanted a crack at a commissioner stint.Now she has been offered the top job. Back to Brussels where she was born and had gone to school, back to the multilingual environment she loves.The process of ratification by MEPs that normally takes at least a month, has been shoehorned into barely two weeks, amid a fierce tussle between the two institutions.Her nomination is part of a deal between EU leaders that is dependent on their being able to whip their MEPs into line: the council presidency to Belgium’s Charles Michel parliament presidency to a Socialist. Both now in place, but the troops are not so pliable.It was easier in the old days when her party, the centre-right European People’s Party (EPP), and the Socialists and Democrats dominated the parliament. As she writes her speech for Tuesday and prepares a programme of priorities, she has spent many hours meeting, wooing the groups one by one.On Saturday night there was an “off the record” extended meeting to soften up the sceptical journalists.Now, however, there are more new MEPs than ever, no two-party majority, and a proliferation of new parties. Up and coming liberals of Renew Europe and Greens all want a say, not just in who fills the job but in the commission’s agreed priorities for the next five years.And there are ruffled sensibilities, notably in the Socialists and Democrats, over the leaders’ refusal to go with their nominee under the parliament’s Spitzenkandidat system. \u0026nbspThe German Socialists and Democrats are particularly unforgiving about the rejection of their man, Dutch commission vice-president Frans Timmermans. And they are unlikely to vote for her despite a plea from their party leadership.She needs the votes of 376 out of 750 MEPs – that is possible with EPP, some Socialists and Democrats and RE votes. But would it be enough to give her legitimacy? Surely 400 would be necessary?No, a source close to her says she is adamant: “an absolute majority is an absolute majority”. Besides which, abstentions and absent votes already count as no votes. “Any kind of virus is dangerous for me,” she jokes.Could she accept a majority which was secured only with support from some of the Eurosceptic forces in the parliament, like the Polish Law and Justice members of the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group?\u0026nbspYes, but there “cannot be a compromise on the rule of law”, she is said to have insisted to the group when she met them.She will not say whether Timmermans, back as first vice-president as part of the leaders’ deal, will get the same job of\u0026nbsprule-of-law enforcer that so antagonised Warsaw and Budapest. But she wants to depersonalise the issue and reduce the “fierceness” of discusssions.She is also reaching out the parliament as a whole, promising to revamp the broken Spitzenkandidat system, backing the Macron-supported idea of “transnational lists” in elections – a prospect viewed with much unease in the smaller states – and promising to look at giving the parliament some right to initiate legislation.MEPs have complained for years that the commission’s “sole right of initiative” has deprived them of an essential feature of a true parliament.She promises much more intensive dialogue with MEPs, the co-legislators, and is said to admire Michel Barnier’s close relationship with the parliament which she sees as a model for future exchanges.On priorities she has also been pressing the right buttons for MEPs: Climate change migration reform, particularly the so-called Dublin regulation the digital economy a minimum wage the rule of law and gender balance. On Brexit she remains committed to not reopening the withdrawal agreement.And it’s not enough to tick the boxes. On climate change there is a delicate political line to tread. An “equilibrium”, she is understood to call it, between the principle of extracting a price for CO2 through an emissions trading system that needs reform and ensuring a level playing field for industry and small to medium-sized enterprises. She also wants to avoid “carbon leakage” of jobs, compensating those most dependent on coal, like the Poles.\u0026nbspIt’s not an easy balancing trick – the Greens have added her lack of climate ambition to their objections to the method of her selection as justifications for opposing her. The ECR appreciates her “softer” line on the rule-of-law confrontation, but is wavering. The hard left will vote against her with the hard-line populists.A refusal by the parliament to back Von der Leyen would take the union into uncharted waters – especially given that other parts of the post’s package are difficult to unwind – and the difficulty of finding another candidate who could rally sufficient support from national leaders.A delay would complicate the appointment and ratification of the new commission and exacerbate the crucial challenge of agreeing a new multiannual budget in time. Observers suspect, however that she will make it on Tuesday, albeit perhaps not with the 400 votes her supporters would like."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3956418.1563122902!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"maureen dowd alexandria ocasio cortez going after wrong target","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez: engaged in  a tangle  with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that poses a threat to the Democrats’ ability to beat President Donald Trump next year. Photograph: Anna MoneymakerNew York TimesI was feeling on edge. Writing a column that sparks an internecine fight among the highest-profile women in the Democratic Party is nerve-wracking.So I went to the gym. Alex Toussaint, the digital Peloton instructor inside the little screen on my spinning bike, had some wisdom for me – the kind of New Age bromide dispensed in spin classes everywhere:You climb the mountain to see the world. You don’t climb the mountain so the world can see you.I only wished AOC was cycling alongside me to hear it as well.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ensorcelled me from the start. I loved the bartender-makes-good Cinderella story, the shake-up-the-capital idealistic dreams, the bravado about how the plutocrat president from Queens wouldn’t know how to deal with a Puerto Rican girl from the Bronx.And I imagined the most potent feminist partnership in American history: Nancy Pelosi as sensei, bringing her inside game, and AOC, the Karate Kid with a wicked Twitter game.But instead, the 79-year-old speaker and the 29-year-old freshman are trapped in a generational and ideological tangle that poses a real threat to the Democrats’ ability to beat Donald Trump next year.Pelosi told me, after the AOC squad voted against the house’s version of the border Bill and trashed the moderates – the very people who provided the Democrats the majority – that the squad was four people with four votes. She was talking about a legislative reality. If it was a knock, it was for abandoning the party.That did not merit AOC’s outrageous accusation that Pelosi was targeting “newly elected women of colour”. She slimed the speaker, who has spent her life fighting for the downtrodden and who was instrumental in getting the first African-American president elected and passing his agenda against all odds, as a sexist and a racist.AOC should consider the possibility that people who disagree with her do not disagree with her colour.The young lawmaker went further, implying that the speaker was putting the squad in danger, asking why Pelosi would criticise them, “knowing the amount of death threats” and attention they get. Huh?‘Defensive posture’AOC pulled back and said she wasn’t calling Pelosi a racist. But once you start that ball rolling, it’s hard to stop. (You know how topsy-turvy the fight is when the biggest defenders of Pelosi, who has endured being a caricature of extreme liberalism for decades, are Trump and the Wall Street Journal editorial board.)The AOC crew threw down the gauntlet in a recent opinion piece in the Washington Post by the Intercept’s Ryan Grim. He wrote that when Pelosi and other Democratic mandarins try to keep the image of the party centrist, they are crouching in “the defensive posture” they’ve been in since the Reagan revolution.Corbin Trent, a spokesman for AOC and co-founder of Justice Democrats, the progressive group that helped propel her, told Grim: “The greatest threat to mankind is the cowardice of the Democratic Party”, with the older generation “driven by fear” and “unable to lead”.Message: Pelosi is past her prime.And then there’s the real instigator, Saikat Chakrabarti, AOC’s 33-year-old chief of staff, who co-founded Justice Democrats and Brand New Congress, both of which recruited progressives – including AOC – to run against moderates in Democratic primaries. The former Silicon Valley Bernie Bro assumed he could apply Facebook’s mantra, “Move fast and break things,” to one of the oldest institutions in the country.Wrong vs badBut Congress is not a place where you achieve radical progress – certainly not in ided government. It’s a place where you work at it and work at it and don’t get everything you want.The progressives act as though anyone who dares disagree with them is bad. Not wrong, but bad, guilty of some human failing, some impurity that is a moral evil that justifies their venom.Chakrabarti sent shock waves through the Democratic caucus when he posted a tweet about the border Bill comparing moderate and Blue Dog Democrats – some of whom are black – to southern segregationists in the 1940s.Rahm Emanuel told me Chakrabarti is “a snot-nosed punk” who has no idea about the battle scars Pelosi bears from the liberal fights she has led.“What votes did you get?” Emanuel said, rhetorically challenging AOC’s chief of staff. “You should only be so lucky to learn from somebody like Nancy who has shown incredible courage and who has twice returned the Democratic Party to power.“We fought for years to create the majorities to get a Democratic president elected and re-elected, and they’re going to dither it away. They have not decided what’s more important: Do they want to beat Trump or do they want to clear the moderate and centrists out of the party? You really think weakening the speaker is the right strategy to try to get rid of Donald Trump and everything he stands for?”In the age of Trump, there is no more stupid proposition than that Nancy Pelosi is the problem.

ten students get less ddd a level leave university top","story":" 69 per cent of students with DDD at A-level went on to graduate with either a first class or upper second degreeUniversities have been warned over degree class inflation as an analysis reveals that seven in ten students who get less than DDD grades at A-level go on to graduate with top degrees.  Of the 3,025 students who went to university last year after achieving less than DDD, 69 per cent went on to graduate with either a first class or upper second degree.  This is seven per cent higher than the previous year, and a 73 per cent increase since 201011, according to a major report published on Thursday by the Office for Students (OfS).    Those who left school with less than DDD last year were four times more likely to graduate with a first class degree compared to seven years ago, the data showed.  The watchdog noted in its report that it had observed the “greatest increase in attainment” in degree outcomes for those who left school with less than DDD in their A-levels or the equivalent.  The Education Secretary urged universities to take “rapid action” so that degree class inflation is “stamped out”.  He called the figures “disappointing”, adding that they “risk compromising the public trust in the high standards of our universities”.  The Education Secretary urged universities to take “rapid action”Damian Hinds said that quality in higher education must be protected “at all costs” and called on the regulator to demand that universities with unjustified rises provide evidence of what they are doing about it.     The OfS analysed the degrees awarded by 148 universities in England between 201011 and 201718.  It found that four in five of all students (79 per cent) now graduate with either a first or upper second class degree, up from 29 per cent seven years ago.  Almost a third (29 per cent) are awarded a first class degree compared to 16 per cent in 201011. After controlling for factors such as students working harder and improvements in teaching, the OfS said that 13.9 per cent of the increase in first class degrees remained unaccounted for.  The higher education watchdog has previously threatened institutions with sanctions, including fines or even de-registration, if they fail to take action over the issue.Institutions found to be artificially inflating their grades can be hit with sanctions by the OfS, including fines or even stripping them of their status as a university. Secondary legislation will be passed later this year to beef up the regulator\u0027s powers and allow it to levy fines of whichever is greater out of £500,000 or two per cent of the university\u0027s income.   Susan Lapworth, director of competition and registration at the OfS, warned that concerns over grade inflation “threaten to devalue a university education in the eyes of employers and potential students”. She said that the OfS will contact universities with the most significant and unexplained increases in degree classification.A committee of vice-Chancellors and other sector leaders reviewed ways to tackle grade inflation and published a “statement of intent” in May which set out their plans to tackle the issue.They agreed that “strong and decisive action” was needed to tackle perceptions that degrees are being “dumbed down”.Chris Hale, director of policy at Universities UK, said: “It is important not to forget that students working harder, improvements in teaching, investment in academic support and widening participation initiatives are also all leading to legitimate grade improvement and such improvements are to be celebrated,” he said.Anti-abortion campaigners target Catholic services with petition for Theresa May after MPs vote to

Revellers launched themselves in the fountains amid scenes of unbridled ecstasy seen all-too-rarely in British sport, let alone cricket.This World Cup has brought the sport back with a bang. Long before Ben Stokes\u0027 late salvo, two seven-year-old strangers had provided compelling proof of that.As little Dylan Barney\u0027s father and grandfather joined 5,000 revellers gathered around a 20ft screen for the most dramatic of World Cup finals, the youngster, in full mini England kit, grabbed his plastic bat and ball before beckoning over another child sitting nearby.Some England fans celebrated by taking a dip in the fountainsIn the shadow of Nelson\u0027s Column, the pair exchanged bowls, bats and shrieks of joy for an hour, other children eventually joining in, scampering after loose balls. Dylan\u0027s new pal, Mohammed Karad, his father explained, had flown in with his Indian family from Kuwait.Communication between the two new friends was conducted only in the language of cricket.For the pair\u0027s fathers, watching on proudly, the World Cup has done its job. Yesterday\u0027s landmark for English cricket - which can now be mentioned in the same breath as feats by the nation\u0027s footballers in 1966 and rugby\u0027s equivalent in 2003 - has resuscitated future prospects.London cabbie Ryan Barney, 33, explained how the last seven weeks had got his son, Dylan, hooked. He said he and other parents across the land owed Eoin Morgan a debt of gratitude.I think we\u0027ve safeguarded cricket forever, said Mr Barney, watching on as his young son pretended he was Jason Roy at the crease.At the start of the Word Cup, I bought him the shirt, but I didn\u0027t know he would fall for the sport quite like this. He\u0027s been to a couple of games and he loves it. We were waiting outside St John\u0027s Wood station with a \u0027we need tickets\u0027 sign earlier but had no joy, I\u0027m so glad we came here instead.Mo\u0027s father, Abdul, 38, an Indian businessman based in Kuwait, added: I flew in with my son because we wanted to see India in a final. It wasn\u0027t to be but we love being here. Cricket is uniting everybody. It\u0027s a great atmosphere.Trafalgar Square - the scene of bleary-eyed celebrations by the likes of Andrew Flintoff in 2005 after an 18-year Ashes hoodoo was brought to an end - was the most appropriate of arenas to announce the sport\u0027s second coming.Since those Ashes were broadcast on Channel 4, some 14 years ago, TV audiences have been in decline and county ground attendances have tumbled.  The England and Wales Cricket Board\u0027s is bidding to arrest the decline by setting up workshops in schools. The World Cup halo is already paying off, with officials announcing last week they had engaging one million children aged five to 12 with the sport.There has been criticism that the seven week World Cup format is slow to capture imaginations, but there was standing room only at the International Cricket Council\u0027s designated fan zone yesterday for the painfully tense finale.On the steps of the National Gallery, fans sang choruses of Hey Jude and Sweet Caroline, but the crowd, aged from eight to 80, from a mixture of backgrounds fell eerily silent as Ben Stokes\u0027 salvo fire the match to a tie.When England eventually won by the finest of margins a roar erupted to rival any previous sporting gathering held here. Tense fans watched on as Jofra Archer secured England victory in the super overSylvia Robson, 71, from Taunton, said: It\u0027s absolutely magical. I cam remember 66, and this is no different. My daughter is pregnant. I might suggest she calls her little one \u0027Stokes\u0027.Phil Tufnell, the former England spin bowler, had opened the arena on the Saturday, and promised a packed crowd, but yesterday the numbers exceeded expectations, with security officials recording a footfall of 18,000 over the course of the day.We\u0027ve never seen anything like this in cricket, said Lesley Upton, a 67-year-old volunteer who has recently overcome breast cancer treatment. She said the uplifting atmosphere had helped her come to terms with her personal trauma.I did the Commonwealth Games in 2014 and absolutely loved it, the pensioner, of Chartham (CORR), Kent, added.But in 2017, in May, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. This came in on my emails around the same time, saying would I like to apply. I thought \u0027well, that will give me a goal\u0027. I\u0027ve just had the all-clear for two years. You have to think positive. This was my goal and it means a great deal just to be here, meeting lovely people. It\u0027s so clear the youngsters are coming through.Her son, Steve Upton, 44, added: You imagine football in the same situation. It just wouldn\u0027t be fun. This is just the best.Anti-abortion campaigners target Catholic services with petition for Theresa May after MPs vote to liberalise lawsArguments between coaches and players settled with technology as

people about trade should be taught on the national curriculum, said Liam Fox MP, the International Trade Secretary, as he announced the world’s first international trade training scheme. The two year scheme is open to people of all ages, those who have no previous government experience, or a degree, and has a starting salary of £30,561.“I think certainly education about trade should be in the curriculum because we are a trading nation,” Mr Fox told The . “I think as we develop an independent trade policy getting any youngsters to understand about the value of trade, as well as the opportunities that it might bring in terms of careers would be a good thing.”Candidates will spend time working with a sector team in the UK, for example in oil and gas, before taking up a placement abroad in locations such as New York, Beijing or Dubai. Liam Fox MP, International Trade Secretary, at the launch event for the world’s first training programme to recruit tomorrow’s trade negotiators.“I didn\u0027t want a scheme that was only graduate based because there may be lots of youngsters who could perfectly adequately take up a career working in a department in exporting,” Mr Fox said. “My feeling is that because we haven\u0027t done trade for over forty years, it may not be something that, in schools, youngsters are orientated towards.“I wanted to make it a wider opportunity, more meritocratic. Britain didn’t build its trading empire on A levels.”But applicants must have “passion and aptitude” for trade, Mr Fox added, as the programme hopes to create a “talent pool of trade policy and promotion experts” as Britain leaves the EU.“I want to create a cadre of young people who don\u0027t see the world ending at the southern border of Europe, but that there is a great big world in which Britain can truly blossom,” he said.Anti-abortion campaigners target Catholic services with petition for Theresa May after MPs vote to liberalise lawsArguments between coaches and players settled with

marathon competitor disqualified running extra mile wrong","story":"Tom Fairbrother was disqualified after crossing the finish line When Tom Fairbrother crossed the finish line of his first ever ultra-marathon eight minutes ahead of his closest rival, despite having taken a wrong turn and run an extra mile, all he felt was relief that he had survived the gruelling test of endurance.But that relief soon turned to anger when, after being photographed and interviewed as the winner, he was told that he was being disqualified because he didn’t complete the course.This was despite assurances from Race to the Stones organisers that he could still take home the trophy from the non-stop 100k Race even though he had taken a wrong track.“Obviously the whole experience has left a bitter taste,” Mr Fairbrother wrote on his blog.“To have run my first ultra… plus an extra mile, gone through the embarrassment of being announced as the winner, then removed, and ending up with nothing to show for my efforts (finish time, result or prize) is a great shame.”Organisers have insisted that it was a miscommunication and they thought he was back on the set course ready to complete it when they spoke to him and told him to get over the finish line.Tom Fairbrother crossing the finish line Mr Fairbrother, a recovering bulimia sufferer who aims to raise awareness of eating disorders in sport, has described how he was exhausted as he tried to complete the longest run of his life when he came to a fork in the trail at 57 miles.He thought the arrow was pointing right and went down a chalk trail which eventually came onto a road. When he could see no signs he realised he was lost.“But I had followed the arrows and there were no obvious points where I missed a turning,” the 31-year-old wrote. He got out his phone and Googled the finish line, which was 5.7 miles away. Having already run 57 miles he knew that this would  mean that he would actually cover 63 miles, one extra than required for the 100k, but decided to  push on. Mr Fairbrother ended up on a main road and with a “frazzled” brain and legs it was only the adrenaline which pushed him on. At one point a driver pointed offered to drive him back to the trail, but he refused for fear that he would be disqualified.At 61 miles he got a call from his fiancée Coralie Frost, who was with the race organisers who were concerned about his whereabouts.“Once I told them what had happened, they said I just had to get to the finish,” Mr Fairbrother said.“I specifically asked the question: If I cover the full 100k, and cross the finish line, can I still win the race, or will I be disqualified?“The answer was yes, so long as you have covered the distance and get back to the finish line first, you will be the winner. What a relief! I had a surge of happiness and determination as I ran the last two miles safe in the knowledge I was okay.”Mr Fairbrother was interviewed post race as the winnerHe entered the finish area from the wrong direction and had to turn around and cross the line, believing that he had won his first ever ultra in 8:35:15.The race CEO congratulated him, checked he was OK and “seemed impressed that I had run a mile further”, Mr Fairbrother said.He posed for photographs and gave an interview, but five minutes later organisers asked to see the tracking information as his time was under review.He was informed that despite running the extra distance and gaining no advantage from going off course he was to be disqualified.Organisers insist that the signage was correct and he had simply taken a wrong turn. He did not call their dedicated line for those who find themselves off track, which will allow experts to guide them back with GPS.Tim Pigott, a physiotherapist, was awarded first place for finishing in 8:43:54.He posted a picture of his trophy on social media, adding: “It needs noting that there was a person ahead of me but he made an epic route error ending up going along the main road- it’s a trail race- and was DQ’d - his performance up to this point was seriously impressive and I’m gutted he didn’t get the race and finish he deserved.”Mr Fairbrother, whose race fee was refunded, said that it would not be his last ultra-marathon, but added he “probably won\u0027t be coming back to Race to the Stones.”A spokesman for Threshold, which organised the event, said: “We appreciate it must have been very disappointing for the leading runner to have gone off course and missed out on the victory yesterday.“After speaking to Tom after he crossed the finish line it became clear that he had taken a wrong turn and guided himself directly back to the finish via mapping software on his phone. Unfortunately this means he didn’t run the official 100km course. Once we realised that he hadn’t completed the comprehensively signposted route we explained to him he would unfortunately be disqualified.”They said that the signage had been checked and no errors had been found. Anti-abortion campaigners target Catholic services with petition for Theresa May after MPs vote to liberalise lawsArguments between coaches and players settled with technology as tennis catches up with other sportsAllowing criminals not to declare convictions is \u0026#39a kick in the teeth\u0026#39, say victims\u0026#39 groupsComment: It is vital we do all we can to support ex-offenders who are genuinely trying to turn a corner and live free from crimeNHS hospitals increasingly charging disabled patients to park, investigation finds as minister pledges investigationTwo thirds of packaging in a family\u0026#39s weekly shops is not recyclable, investigation findsComment: We can all make small changes to save the planet, but it\u0026#39s through government and industries coming together that we can make a real difference Trade should be taught on the national curriculum, Liam Fox MP saysA party like no other in English cricket history, and everyone was invitedChildren to be taught how \u0026#39fake\u0026#39 news spread through echo chambersBoy slips through Heathrow Security to board British Airways flight to Los AngelesBen Stokes goes from villain to hero in one glorious dayLouis Theroux: Surviving America’s Most Hated Family, review: a rare misstep from this normally pin-sharp documentarianPrince Harry and Duchess of Sussex appear at star studded Lion King premiereMoD receives four compensation claims for sonic boom damageComment: We can improve mental health, save money and boost the economy all in one goScotland Yard terror chief Neil Basu left isolated over Press threat on cable leaksChef has \u0026#39scalding hot liquid poured down trousers\u0026#39 in alleged bullying incident at luxury hotel Tories set up \u0026#39membership hotline\u0026#39 amid fears members are not receiving ballot papers Pensioner killed by a quad bike being driven on pavement as residents complain the issue has existed for yearsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/04/04/15/daniel-craig-james-bond.jpg","title":"bond 25 female james bond lashana lynch woman trailer release date","story":"IM Subscribe NowIM Subscribe NowCreated with Sketch.IM  Subscribe NowIM  Subscribe NowSubscribe NowSubscribe NowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Try Independent Minds free for 1 monthSee the optionsCaptain Marvel star will appear in next outing alongside Daniel CraigClick to followThe Independent CultureBond 25 is said to introduce a female version of the spy.According to reports, British actor Lashana Lynch will be introduced as the new 007 in the next instalment in what is being described as a “pivotal” scene.A film insider told Mail on Sunday that she’ll\u0026nbspbe tasked with tracking Daniel Craig’s character and bringing him out of retirement for a new mission.Lashana Lynch will reportedly play first female 007 in Bond 25 (MGM)The reports suggest that Bond will try to seduce the female Bond, who will resist his advances.Bond 25, directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga, has been co-written by Fleabag’s Phoebe Waller-Bridge.It was revealed this week that Christoph Waltz will reprise his role of Spectre character Blofeld after the actor was spotted on the film’s set in Pinewood Studios.Created with Sketch.The women who could play Bond Show all 21Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Lynch’s breakout role came in recent blockbuster Captain Marvel.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Supply-side shocks include events such as a sudden rise in the cost of imported raw materials or components, or disruption to the supply chain, which raise companies’ costs.“I remain concerned about the vulnerability of households to a downside surprise in income or employment, given the very low savings rate,” said Mr Vlieghe, who sits on the BoE’s interest rate-setting committee.\u0026nbsp“Vacancies, while high, are no longer rising. In fact, over the past months, vacancies have experienced a rate of decline that is modest but has nevertheless not been experienced since 2012. So it is not clear that the labour market is tightening further.”Official data, which measures vacancies in rolling three-month periods, shows consecutive declines since December.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.England\u0027s captain Eoin Morgan, left, celebrates with teammate Joe Root after winning their Cricket World Cup semi-final match against Australia at Edgbaston in Birmingham.

Voting got under way in Britain early on Thursday in elections to the European Parliament - a contest the country had not expected to hold nearly three years after the Brexit referendumAn abrupt departure from the EU may dent businesses’ confidence and therefore their willingness to hire, Mr Vlieghe said. Companies’ response to a no-deal Brexit also depends on how prepared they are for such an outcome, he added, noting: “It is difficult if not impossible to expect businesses to incur the substantial costs to be fully prepared for a scenario that the government says it does not want.”Both contenders to become Britain’s next prime minister have said they hope to negotiate a new agreement with the EU but that they would be prepared to leave without a deal if that was necessary to meet the 31 October deadline.Businesses’ actions will be one of many things the BoE will look at before deciding what to do about interest rates if Britain crashes out of the EU, Mr Vlieghe said.\u0026nbspBut he concluded that the central bank is more likely to keep rates on hold or to reduce them than to raise them in response to “temporarily higher inflation that would result from the weaker exchange rate and possibly tariffs”, and that a cut to close to zero would be his own preference.\u0026nbspThis puts him in the same camp as his fellow Monetary Policy Committee member Silvana Tenreyro, who said earlier this week that a cut in interest rates following a no-deal Brexit would be “more likely than not”.\u0026nbspApart from a smooth Brexit and a no-deal one, there is a third possibility, where a new deal is not agreed later this year but a no-deal departure is also avoided temporarily, Mr Vlieghe said. The economic damage from this outcome would fall somewhere between the first two scenarios.“That would likely involve ongoing headwinds to the economy from uncertainty, while avoiding the disruptive supply-side impact of no deal,” he said.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He was listening to music on his phone using Spotify, and watching films on Netflix, but he was struggling to buy textbooks or find them in the library when he needed one. Surely, he thought, it must be possible to access books in the same way I access music, film or data? Easily and cheaply, anywhere, any time. But, he realised, there was no subscription service for books. Thus was born Perlego (Latin for “I read through” or “I scan”), the Spotify of textbooks. Van Malderen even went on to write his thesis on the subject, “Why the Old Textbook Model is Broken”.There is a scandal, verging on a scam, in the realm of textbooks. Since 1982, the price of textbooks has risen at three times the rate of inflation. Some figures depict a tenfold increase. As if students didn’t have enough trouble already with tuition fees. They would be justified in feeling it’s a rip-off, up there with secondary ticketing for gigs and flights to Madrid when there’s a Champions League Cup Final on. Perlego aims to make learning accessible, without perhaps killing off libraries completely. “Students can still go to the library to study,” says its CEO and co-founder Van Malderen.Gauthier Van Malderen, 26, was born in Belgium, lived in Henley-on-Thames as a kid, and was an undergraduate in economics and management at Bocconi University in Milan. His dad is in banking and his parents expected him to go into finance. “They nearly had a heart attack when I mentioned textbooks online.” They’ve swung around since. Van Malderen the younger is really responding to student need. When he was still an undergraduate he noticed that most students were using notepads so he set up a business producing very classy notepads, called\u0026nbspIconic Matter (“made by students for students”) with advertising from big companies at the bottom of the page, selling them in Belgium, Switzerland and Morocco. He made enough money out of that scheme to launch Perlego, together with backing from the founder of Zoopla, Alex Chesterman.There are a couple of open access websites where you can download books for free, such as OpenStax, funded by Bill Gates – but it’s non-profit, and Van Malderen is on the side of writers as much as readers.\u0026nbsp“If you’re going to produce high quality work, then it would be nice to get paid.” Van Malderen is sympathetic towards professors. “They don’t want students to have to pay through the nose. They don’t ‘adopt’\u0026nbsptextbooks anymore” (ie\u0026nbspmaking them required reading). In the context of universities trying to open up access, the question of affordability becomes more crucial than ever.We see ourselves as complementing rather than replacing traditional institutionsThe other possible avenue for impecunious students is, of course, theft, not so much nicking books from the library, more using piracy websites. Sitting at a laptop in his offices in Holborn, Gauthier showed me how he could illicitly download the pdf of a classic textbook, Corporate Finance: Theory and Practice, entirely for free. “No wonder publishers are having a hard time,” says van Malderen. “There is a vicious spiral effect. They lose 28 per cent\u0026nbspto piracy, 30 per cent\u0026nbspto second-hand sales.” In short, at present, publishers, authors, and students all end up feeling ripped off.Apparently 88 per cent\u0026nbspof students don’t see piracy as a crime. Van Malderen thinks legal can be cooler. “We can show them the convenience of having one space – a one-stop shop – where you can get all your books. And no one gets ripped off.” The average spend on textbooks in the UK is £439 (medicine will cost a lot more than English) in the US it’s $1,200. The cost of subscribing to Perlego is £12 a month.Perlego also hosts all those public domain books, like The Odyssey and Das Kapital. “The culture has changed,” Van Malderen says. “It’s like music – you don’t want to own the book anymore.” Perlego is a streaming service. You don’t download, you read the book page by page online, on your phone if you like. It’s a “mobile-first learning experience”, as Van Malderen describes it. You can create your own library, like a playlist. And unlike the books in the university library, you can legitimately scribble in the margins and underline sentences, personalising the text.You can become part of a network of readers, with input from other students, so you can compare notes, and get comments from professors too. It’s a virtual seminar that feels like it could make the real, traditional learning environment redundant. “We see ourselves as complementing rather than replacing traditional institutions,” says Van Malderen. “We’re just aiming to make learning more efficient.” It’s like reading, plus social media, where you can “follow” other readers if you like. There is potential for “lifelong learning” too. 25 per cent\u0026nbspof Perlego subscribers are not students, but professionals (or would-be professionals) seeking to upgrade.How do you plan Wimbledon? It’s all about attention to detail‘If we get one person to give up cow’s milk, we’ve made a difference’Why women don’t need a science degree to be successfulAccording to the aggregate data Perlego has collected, psychology is the biggest growth area in higher education, which is good for psychology professors\u0026nbspand publishers to know. But the main intellectual advantage of the online system is that, whatever subject you’re studying, you can always dabble in something else – you’re not restricted to the books specified in your course. “For example,” says Van Malderen, “I was doing economics, but say I wanted to branch out into political science or philosophy, it’s right here”. It’s a whole online library rather than just a bunch of textbooks.A declaration of interest: I teach at Cambridge. I know from personal experience that one thing that always drives students mad is how to put in references at the end of their essays. I’m not one for making recommendations, but I think the next time a student asks me how to do it (and I know it’s going to go wrong somehow), I might say, “Have you tried Perlego?”. All you have to do is skip to the references section, highlight, copy, then paste. Full marks.

Supply-side shocks include events such as a sudden rise in the cost of imported raw materials or components, or disruption to the supply chain, which raise companies’ costs.“I remain concerned about the vulnerability of households to a downside surprise in income or employment, given the very low savings rate,” said Mr Vlieghe, who sits on the BoE’s interest rate-setting committee.\u0026nbsp“Vacancies, while high, are no longer rising. In fact, over the past months, vacancies have experienced a rate of decline that is modest but has nevertheless not been experienced since 2012. So it is not clear that the labour market is tightening further.”Official data, which measures vacancies in rolling three-month periods, shows consecutive declines since December.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.England\u0027s captain Eoin Morgan, left, celebrates with teammate Joe Root after winning their Cricket World Cup semi-final match against Australia at Edgbaston in Birmingham.

Voting got under way in Britain early on Thursday in elections to the European Parliament - a contest the country had not expected to hold nearly three years after the Brexit referendumAn abrupt departure from the EU may dent businesses’ confidence and therefore their willingness to hire, Mr Vlieghe said. Companies’ response to a no-deal Brexit also depends on how prepared they are for such an outcome, he added, noting: “It is difficult if not impossible to expect businesses to incur the substantial costs to be fully prepared for a scenario that the government says it does not want.”Both contenders to become Britain’s next prime minister have said they hope to negotiate a new agreement with the EU but that they would be prepared to leave without a deal if that was necessary to meet the 31 October deadline.Businesses’ actions will be one of many things the BoE will look at before deciding what to do about interest rates if Britain crashes out of the EU, Mr Vlieghe said.\u0026nbspBut he concluded that the central bank is more likely to keep rates on hold or to reduce them than to raise them in response to “temporarily higher inflation that would result from the weaker exchange rate and possibly tariffs”, and that a cut to close to zero would be his own preference.\u0026nbspThis puts him in the same camp as his fellow Monetary Policy Committee member Silvana Tenreyro, who said earlier this week that a cut in interest rates following a no-deal Brexit would be “more likely than not”.\u0026nbspApart from a smooth Brexit and a no-deal one, there is a third possibility, where a new deal is not agreed later this year but a no-deal departure is also avoided temporarily, Mr Vlieghe said. The economic damage from this outcome would fall somewhere between the first two scenarios.“That would likely involve ongoing headwinds to the economy from uncertainty, while avoiding the disruptive supply-side impact of no deal,” he said.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Villanelle’s new vulnerability invites us to question what it is exactly she wants from Polastri. First time around she was toying with a more worthy adversary, but why now? Polastri, by contrast, is frayed around the edges, a terrible wife to her husband Nico (Owen McDonnell) and an even worse intelligence agent to her boss Carolyn Martens (Fiona Shaw). The script is still tight and the jokes are still there, as are Villanelle’s accents, outfits and abrupt killings, but without the will-theywon’t-they energy of the initial plot, it is harder to care.226 Years and YearsYears and Years, then, is favoured by some wit, a cornucopia of fab talent and promising characters. The dominant one as we continue our quest into the 2030s and beyond, will be Vivienne, or Viv, Rook, played brilliantly by Emma Thompson. As a bit of a long-term Emma-sceptic I was actually startled by how good she is in the role of the epitome of everything she has spent her life hating and campaigning against, for Viv is a horrifically nasty businessperson turned populist politician with the most terrifying of views. Viv Rook makes Ann Widdecombe look like, well, Emma Thompson at an Extinction Rebellion sit-in.Joseph is almost never out of shot, whether seen from afar, contemplating a bottle of strong cider in a playground, or in visceral close-up, clutching his doner to his face.

The police are there to save us from ourselves but can only do it if they are subjected to constant scrutiny. It’s exhausting work, policing the police.The footage is glorious, especially the side-on tracking shots of the birds and the hunting, where it is as if the cameramen were able to set up a rail along the ocean. Most spectacular of all is the sequence of a glacier collapsing into the ocean, where 75m tons of ice being sloughed off in less than 20-minutes. But at times Our Planet feels a little unfocused. Attenborough’s last big BBC series, Dynasties, won almost unbearable amount of emotional resonance through its focus on animal families.

OK, not much competition, but still... Despite the po-faced title, you realise very quickly that it’s not yet another drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch or yet another attempt by Laura Kuenssberg to explain the inexplicable, or yet another show with the public arguing about stuff they don’t understand.

Dando’s friends, family and the producer and director of the film have made a fitting and balanced tribute to her, something she deserves. I can’t really add anything to that.Home is a rather gentle, unobtrusive variation on the sitcom theme – but one that is built on a quite a bizarre premise. The twist is that a family who returns to Surrey from a holiday touring around France discover a Syrian refugee stuffed in the back of their SUV. Not only that, but, after a few moments of blind terrified panic about a suicide bombing, they eventually adopt him like he’s stray cat that’s just wandered in.Michael Jackson has long looked like a burning tire yard.

And so we find ourselves sitting next to Henshall in his (prominently featured) Volvo V70 estate, sharing his thoughts, intercepting suspects and being driven off the road by unidentified enemies.” “It is both a revisionist – and frequently batty – take on the caped milieu and a winningly knotty mystery. And it surely is the first big-budget superhero tale more indebted to Wes Anderson than to Stan Lee.” “Yet again the Williams have woven a brilliantly tangled web, helped in no small part by Karyo’s quietly arresting central turn” “There’s really been nothing quite like Catastrophe on our screens before, and it deserves its cult status for the quality of everything the production team do, not least the stunning cinematography in this finale. Thanks, all. I’m glad Catastrophe died happy. 1826 Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil (BBC2)“For anyone who’s not altogether sure how British politics turned so suddenly into a rolling dumpster fire from which all exits are blocked then Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil is a necessary public service to explain exactly, and exactly how needlessly, we all came to be here.”“West believes Valjean to be “the greatest hero in all literature”, and he plays the part with all the care and intricacy such a character deserves.” “You see, saint or sinner, prince or pauper, we are all part of one race, the brotherhood of man. And the saintly and regal Danny Dyer stands as its finest ambassador.” 2126 The Secret Life of the Zoo (Channel 4)“This documentary goes behind the shrubbery to show off these animals and their s. The humans are a pretty exotic bunch too, judging by some of the lines they come out with.”2226 A Year of British Murder (Channel 4)“The programme-makers must have done much to win the confidence of so many friends and families, as they went through unspeakable personal pain but they repay that confidence with an understated and powerful film.” “Despite what some feared, the casting of Cumberbatch doesn’t simply flatter Cummings – the A-lister is too good a chameleon for that. But, inevitably, as he scrawls out his campaigning brainwaves on a whiteboard, there is a touch of that deductive maverick Sherlock in his portrayal of this scruffy, balding political saboteur.” 2426 The Paras: Men of War (ITV)“From the outset the production is elevated by its sensitive handling of the men – and the Paratroopers remain exclusively male – involved. These kinds of programmes have a tendency to fetishise toughness, lingering on assault courses and weaponry.”2526 Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland (BBC2)“Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland is a meandering look back over his life, career, and national identity – a “Proustian wander through Scotland”.

Gone is the ignorant Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) of the original in favour of a hardened badass who returns to the moon, accompanied by a group of space marines, to take on the alien queen. How many years between sequel and original? SevenIt wasn\u0027t until the arrival of Austin Powers sequel The Spy Who Shagged Me that Mike Myers\u0027s comic creations were fully wedged into the hearts of film lovers. If the original was the perfect introduction to Austin\u0027s groovy world, the follow-up was an altogether funnier, bigger and more quotable affair. How many years between sequel and original? TwoCapping off not only your own franchise but a decade-long series consisting of 22 films is no mean feat – and yet Avengers: Endgame balanced all the playing pieces to do so with gargantuan success. How many years between sequel and original? Seven437 Back to the Future Part II (1989)The first sequel to Robert Zemeckis\u0027s Back to the Future is an amusing adventure that sees Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) travel... well, back to the future, to prevent his own son from sabotaging the family legacy. How many years between sequel and original? FourIt was the addition of both Michelle Pfeiffer and Danny DeVito – as Catwoman and the Penguin, respectively – that made Tim Burton\u0027s sequel Batman Returns an even more memorable watch than the original. How many years between sequel and original? ThreeEach instalment of Richard Linklater\u0027s Before trilogy is as good as the last. But, if there is a peak, it surely arrives with number two – Before Sunset – which reunites would-be lovers Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) nine years after they first met in Before Sunrise (1995). How many years between sequel and original? NineThere\u0027s a blistering chase sequence midway through The Bourne Ultimatum involving Matt Damon\u0027s amnesiac spy and journalist Simon Ross (Paddy Considine). It\u0027s adeptly directed by Paul Greengrass – here at the top of his game – and is all the proof you need that the original trilogy improved with each new film. How many years between sequel and original? Five837 Bride of Frankenstein (1935)Depicting Mary Shelley\u0027s classic creature as a pleasant guy just looking for a companion, Bride of Frankenstein is one of the greatest monster movies, let alone sequels, in cinema history. How many years between sequel and original? FourBatman Begins may have been the perfect origin story for the caped crusader, but nothing could have prepared film fans for the classic its sequel would become. Christopher Nolan intelligently crafted The Dark Knight into one of the greatest follow-ups ever made, with several standout action sequences and an untouchable performance from Heath Ledger as the Joker. One for the ages. How many years between sequel and original? Three1037 Dawn of the Dead (1978)George A Romero ditched the entire cast of Night of the Living Dead for its first sequel, Dawn of the Dead, which showed the effects of the zombie apocalypse on a much larger scale than depicted in the black-and-white original. One of the most entertaining horror films ever made.  How many years between sequel and original? 10The glory you feel watching Hellboy II: The Golden Army comes from the knowledge that you\u0027re watching a studio allow Guillermo del Toro to do whatever the hell he wants. A scintillating oddity of a follow-up that surpasses the 2004 original within minutes. How many years between sequel and original? FourNot so much an improvement on the first as one that rips up its rule book completely: Sam Raimi took the character of Ash (Bruce Campbell), who viewers first met in influential 1981 horror The Evil Dead,\u0026nbspand placed him in the heart of what is essentially a slapstick comedy. How many years between sequel and original? SixAfter the lacklustre fourth instalment, Fast \u0026amp Furious 5 was the reinvention the series desperately needed. Bringing in Dwayne Johnson as the bad guy was a genius stroke and the final set-piece – a car dragging a bank vault through the streets of Rio – remains as entertaining as anything the long-running series has ever done. How many years between sequel and original? 10The Godfather Part II set the highest benchmark for what sequels should be, but so rarely are – a crucial chapter in a saga. The film won Robert De Niro an Oscar for his efforts, playing the same role Marlon Brando won an Oscar for two years before. This, alongside another film on this list, is one of two sequels to ever win Best Picture (keep scrolling to find out the other one). How many years between sequel and original? Two1537 The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)The fact that Sergio Leone had barely any money to make The Good, the Bad and the Ugly – the third film in his Man With no Name trilogy – fortuitously led to the casting of the relatively unknown Clint Eastwood. Leone\u0027s film, beautifully soundtracked by Ennio Morricone, is a masterwork that proves less is more: its most classic dialogue-free scenes derived from the fact that Leone had no time to shoot dialogue. How many years between sequel and original? Two1637 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004)Gone was the warm glow of Hogwarts in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Alfonso Cuarón\u0027s adaptation of the JK Rowling novel proved the franchise could win widespread acclaim, as well as ticket receipts, if put in the hands of interesting directors. How many years between sequel and original? Three1737 How to Train Your Dragon 2 (2014)Could How to Train Your Dragon endure as one of the most beloved yet underrated franchises of all time? Quite possibly – and its first sequel, which features breathless flight sequences and animation to marvel at, is solid evidence of this. How many years between sequel and original?

How many years between sequel and original? One1937 Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989)If Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade isn\u0027t better than series opener Raiders of the Lost Ark, it\u0027s certainly as good.

EightPerhaps it was down to relief that Iron Man 3 was so revered by critics (lest we forget Iron Man 2 is one of Marvel\u0027s biggest duds).

Three2437 The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003)The second sequel to ever win Best Picture is all about the payoff.

How many years between sequel and original? TwoNobody could have predicted quite how breathlessly entertaining Mad Max: Fury Road would be.

How many years between sequel and original? 36There has never been a bad Mission: Impossible film.

Two3137 Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan (1982)By placing the emphasis on character as opposed to action, Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan righted the wrongs of the classic TV show\u0027s first big screen adventure, a dud that was released in 1979. The result is a staggeringly improved follow-up.

How many years between sequel and original?  SixIt would have been easy to chalk up 10 Cloverfield Lane\u0027s acclaim to the fact it was a secret up until a month before it was released.

How many years between sequel and original? SevenWhen Taika Waititi took the keys to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, he walked away with one of its greatest films: Thor: Ragnarok.

SixSure, the third and fourth instalments might have the emotional payoffs, but –\u0026nbspthanks to a series of standout scenes (the traffic cone pileup, anyone?) – it\u0027s Toy Story 2 that stands tall as the best of Pixar\u0027s sequels. How many years between sequel and original? FourRidley Scott\u0027s Alien may be an acclaimed horror film, but sequel Aliens – directed by James Cameron – is a stone cold action classic.

How many years between sequel and original? SevenIt wasn\u0027t until the arrival of Austin Powers sequel The Spy Who Shagged Me that Mike Myers\u0027s comic creations were fully wedged into the hearts of film lovers.

FourBatman Begins may have been the perfect origin story for the caped crusader, but nothing could have prepared film fans for the classic its sequel would become.

Jake went down again and again and she just remained still for him.”Created with Sketch.Underwater Photographer of the Year Show all 45Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Winner: Behaviour and overall winner. I worry that this image will refuel the public\u0027s imbalanced perception of sharks but as an image capturing behaviour it has drama, adrenaline, grace, beauty and finality. That\u0027s a very rare combination in one image. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Winner: Wide Angle. The first moment I viewed this image I knew it would be a strong contender. For me it\u0027s the symmetry of the Humpback and the balance between the er and calf. Everything about it is in perfect alignment. The shape of the tail in relation to the four corners of the frame, not to mention the position of the free er and calf. Superb imagery at its very best.  Many congratulations Francois. - Martin Edge (Judge)    Winner: Macro. Fabio’s use of long exposure and panning has turned a classic portrait of a Sepiola into an unforgettable one. The sharp and ghosted images of the bobtail squid balance pleasingly in the frame and combined with the outstretched tentacles give the feeling of the cephalopod lunging for its prey. An innovative and most deserving category winner. - Alex Mustard (Judge) It is hard to imagine what it must have been like to have experienced such a large scale natural spectacle as this but this image, perfectly composed and timed, gets close. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Winner: British Waters Macro. A mantra of mine is \u0027It\u0027s not what it is. It\u0027s where it is\u0027 and this long clawed Squat lobster is in a perfect position to make a memorable image. The author, instead of \u0027blasting\u0027 it with light, has gone in the opposite direction by restricting the strobe into a snooted spotlight in order to illuminate just the features of the lobster and the dainty sea loch anemones. It\u0027s an example of \u0027Isolation lighting\u0027 at its very best. A great deal of uw photographers invest their time in what they want to illuminate. This is an example which in my opinion illustrates features that they do not want to illuminate, hence the punchy black background and the soft delicate hues of dark sand, facial features topped off by the sea loch anemones. - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: Marine Conservation. The problems of plastic pollution and ghost fishing are both illustrated by this struggling loggerhead turtle. I am happy to learn this inidual was lucky enough to survive this deathtrap thanks to the photographer - Alex Mustard (Judge)What a chin, what a forehead, what a character. This picture has portrait written all over it, and such a fascinating species ideally suited to this close focus wide angle approach. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Winner: Portrait. Superb impact from the very first moment it was presented. Perfect composition within the image frame and the understated colours. To top it off the authors comments above say it all... a Smiling Happy Angel\u0027s Face. One of my favourites from the entire competition. - Martin Edge (Judge)  Winner: Up \u0026amp Coming. Beautiful split shot with both a perfect under and over split. A very strong favourite with all the judges and one of the best examples I have seen of this type of image for some time. Just Superb! - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: Black \u0026amp White. It must be 11 out of 10 for this groundbreaking image. Conception, interpretation and perseverance coupled with black and white’s ability to concentrate on the key elements. It gets better with each viewing. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Grey seals are a perennial favourite in UPY as one of the UK\u0027s star wildlife attractions. This upside-down portrait is quirky and cute and easily won the affections of the judging panel. Great to see an overseas photographer coming to the UK to show us how it\u0027s done! - Alex Mustard (Judge)Winner: Compact. This image was a very popular choice between the panel. Ideal for a split rendition. What makes this a winner for me, not withstanding the double exposure is the sympathetic balance of light \u0026amp colour connected  between the top half and bottom of the image frame. - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: British Waters Compact. Does British ing get any better than a fun encounter with a grey seal pup? This youngster’s relaxed and curious face is captured perfectly by Martin, making us all want to be there too. - Alex Mustard (Judge)Winner: British Waters Living Together. Images tell stories but well thought out and executed ones speak volumes. This is such an example which feeds the eye with tales of the seaside on summer days, lively marine spectacles and excited human interaction. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)1545 Isles of Scilly, UKWinner: British Waters Wide Angle. Photographers often feel competition shots must be packed with new tricks to win. At UPY we always appreciate classic technique when it raises the bar of what has been done before. Rob\u0027s full technicolour wide angle scenic reveals the richness of UK seas with an elegant simplicity that is incredibly challenging to pull off in British conditions. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Winner: Wrecks. So simple yet so powerful the additional lighting of the turret and the main er perfectly positioned. This was a very strong category this year with a deserved winner and it\u0027s refreshing to read the acknowledgement to Leigh Bishop\u0027s pioneering work. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) The iconic silhouette of a seahorse is a graphically powerful picture. Here Zarina has raised that to another level with the addition of a red filter to her snooted strobe, reminiscent of a rim-lit animal at sunset. - Alex Mustard (Judge) All the judges found this to be probably the most distressing image to view but its uncompromising message must be seen by as many people as possible. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)As a subject we have seen our fair share of these colourful characters but this one shone through and the eggs almost look as if they have been inidually lit! - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Superb image with a perfect line across the split. Good exposure both above and below the water line and such an ideal subject to cap it all off. Excellent work. - Martin Edge (Judge)This is an excellent example for this category. It takes a tried and trusted angle but completely lifts it by using the fabric. It becomes more than an image a concept, a transition, a rebirth. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)2245 Isles of Scilly, UKThis image stood out on many levels. Composition, colour vibrancy and contrast combined with an unusual angle kept us coming back to it and helped it rise in the rankings with each viewing. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Perfect control of angle, light and focus. This was always up there with all of the judges. A clear favourite just like Nick Park’s genius creations. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) I\u0027ve seen many images of eel and shrimp around Indonesia, however you have taken this two steps forward. 1) With your excellent idea to snoot the eye and 2) with your backlight on the shrimp. You can expect many photographers to practice your technique in the months to come. Congratulations for your vision. Very well thought out and executed. - Martin Edge (Judge)    It’s not what you’ve got, it’s what you do with it. The split may have been elusive but well worth the effort. This is a deceptively subtle excellent delivery. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)I have witnessed this behaviour from the surface with its high velocity \u0027testosterone and tonnage\u0027 and I remember thinking how happy I was to be in the boat. To have the presence of mind to time this shot whilst one\u0027s senses are being bombarded is heroic in my view. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) What an amazing moment. From the expression on the face of the unicornfish fleeing for its life, to the hunting pack of sharks, especially the leader with its mouth snapping open that fan out diagonally across this composition. And that is without considering what a great challenge it is to shoot these images of split second action, in the dead of night, underwater. - Alex Mustard (Judge)  There is so much energy in this image. If you look at it long enough you can begin to see just a hint of movement of all the fish around the coral. The colours are realistic and this top down shot works well.  - Martin Edge (Judge)A jaw-dropping wide angle scene with sharks, rays and mountains. A winning combination in the Up \u0026amp Coming category. - Alex Mustard (Judge)3045 Loch Long, Argyll and ButeThis is a subtle image with light and detail that are a delight to explore. The sunset, trees and underwater scene combine to create a wonderful feeling of the place. We particularly like how the composition allows the line of the shore to be continued underwater by the seaweeds.  - Alex Mustard (Judge)Photographing pike underwater is one thing but finding your own underwater artistic stamp is quite another matter. With this particular image the author has done just that! By using a slow shutter speed of 18th sec and a panning technique from right to left gives the impression of movement whilst the pike is pin sharp. - Martin Edge (Judge)Arthur’s image scores with both its foreground and background. The deadman’s fingers soft coral make an attractive foreground, enhanced by the crab sheltering within, and the striking sunbeams create beauty and atmosphere in the background. I also love the feeling of depth created by the legs of the jetty reaching up for the surface. - Alex Mustard (Judge)In recent UPY competitions UK macro images have lacked their overseas counterpart\u0027s flair and imagination but this magnificent shot raises the bar for everyone else to follow. World class from the UK at last. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Memorable photographs of people underwater are deceptively difficult and require both the photographer and model to be at the top of their game. The simplicity of the composition works to highlight the delicious details in the girl\u0027s pose. - Alex Mustard (Judge) This is a timeless scene that communicates a detailed story. The cavern, the silversides sheltering, the tarpon hunting and the er kneeling reverentially, taking it all in. It is a fabulous use of black and white to tell this story of shadows and light. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Sometimes it is the small detail which contributes so much. The white of the eye and the row of teeth in what could be construed as a smile convey mischief and menace in equal measures. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Once again Tobias you have succeeded in capturing one of the most photographed wrecks in the Red Sea and photographing it in a completely different way. You push the boundaries of wreck photography and I congratulate you for your vision and forward thinking of new ideas. - Martin Edge (Judge)  Perfect composition and framed against the stark black background. However it\u0027s the contrast of white on black which attracts the eye again and again every time this particular image popped up to greet us. The colour of the nudibranch was sufficiently bright enough to raise our senses again and again as it proceeded through the competition.  The soft delicate treatment of the snooted flash is also very well managed. - Martin Edge (Judge)    This shot puts you right in the picture and records a special encounter in a very special place. Every element contributes and the lucky or intended curve of the split creates great spatial depth. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Symmetry, graphic simplicity and for once in UK waters a black background which contributes to a positive outer worldly delivery. A mould breaker. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) I see and judge many images of the sockeye salmon but this is one of the best. The alignment of the two salmon not to mention the composition within the frame.  The surgy peak of the action is in perfect symmetry with the window which provides the viewer with topside influences of the trees against a vivid blue sky. There is so much image depth in this example. - Martin Edge (Judge)    Such a delicate image yet so full of emotion. There are times when there are no more words needed. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)UPY loves seahorse photos! Especially when they capture a fleeting behaviour, such as this. But we hadn\u0027t realised during judging that this was a new species of seahorse, nor did with know the incredible backstory behind this picture, we just loved the moment. - Alex Mustard (Judge)  Whether or not you like fashion photography underwater you would be hard pressed to see a more beautiful combination of complimentary colours and a very elegant pose. A very well executed image. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)A portrait must leave you in no doubt. Simple lighting, illuminating all that is needed, captures this character. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Winner: Behaviour and overall winner. I worry that this image will refuel the public\u0027s imbalanced perception of sharks but as an image capturing behaviour it has drama, adrenaline, grace, beauty and finality. That\u0027s a very rare combination in one image. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Winner: Wide Angle. The first moment I viewed this image I knew it would be a strong contender. For me it\u0027s the symmetry of the Humpback and the balance between the er and calf. Everything about it is in perfect alignment. The shape of the tail in relation to the four corners of the frame, not to mention the position of the free er and calf. Superb imagery at its very best.  Many congratulations Francois. - Martin Edge (Judge)    Winner: Macro. Fabio’s use of long exposure and panning has turned a classic portrait of a Sepiola into an unforgettable one. The sharp and ghosted images of the bobtail squid balance pleasingly in the frame and combined with the outstretched tentacles give the feeling of the cephalopod lunging for its prey. An innovative and most deserving category winner. - Alex Mustard (Judge) It is hard to imagine what it must have been like to have experienced such a large scale natural spectacle as this but this image, perfectly composed and timed, gets close. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Winner: British Waters Macro. A mantra of mine is \u0027It\u0027s not what it is. It\u0027s where it is\u0027 and this long clawed Squat lobster is in a perfect position to make a memorable image. The author, instead of \u0027blasting\u0027 it with light, has gone in the opposite direction by restricting the strobe into a snooted spotlight in order to illuminate just the features of the lobster and the dainty sea loch anemones. It\u0027s an example of \u0027Isolation lighting\u0027 at its very best. A great deal of uw photographers invest their time in what they want to illuminate. This is an example which in my opinion illustrates features that they do not want to illuminate, hence the punchy black background and the soft delicate hues of dark sand, facial features topped off by the sea loch anemones. - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: Marine Conservation. The problems of plastic pollution and ghost fishing are both illustrated by this struggling loggerhead turtle. I am happy to learn this inidual was lucky enough to survive this deathtrap thanks to the photographer - Alex Mustard (Judge)What a chin, what a forehead, what a character. This picture has portrait written all over it, and such a fascinating species ideally suited to this close focus wide angle approach. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Winner: Portrait. Superb impact from the very first moment it was presented. Perfect composition within the image frame and the understated colours. To top it off the authors comments above say it all... a Smiling Happy Angel\u0027s Face. One of my favourites from the entire competition. - Martin Edge (Judge)  Winner: Up \u0026amp Coming. Beautiful split shot with both a perfect under and over split. A very strong favourite with all the judges and one of the best examples I have seen of this type of image for some time. Just Superb! - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: Black \u0026amp White. It must be 11 out of 10 for this groundbreaking image. Conception, interpretation and perseverance coupled with black and white’s ability to concentrate on the key elements. It gets better with each viewing. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Grey seals are a perennial favourite in UPY as one of the UK\u0027s star wildlife attractions. This upside-down portrait is quirky and cute and easily won the affections of the judging panel. Great to see an overseas photographer coming to the UK to show us how it\u0027s done! - Alex Mustard (Judge)Winner: Compact. This image was a very popular choice between the panel. Ideal for a split rendition. What makes this a winner for me, not withstanding the double exposure is the sympathetic balance of light \u0026amp colour connected  between the top half and bottom of the image frame. - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: British Waters Compact. Does British ing get any better than a fun encounter with a grey seal pup? This youngster’s relaxed and curious face is captured perfectly by Martin, making us all want to be there too. - Alex Mustard (Judge)Winner: British Waters Living Together. Images tell stories but well thought out and executed ones speak volumes. This is such an example which feeds the eye with tales of the seaside on summer days, lively marine spectacles and excited human interaction. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)1545 Isles of Scilly, UKWinner: British Waters Wide Angle. Photographers often feel competition shots must be packed with new tricks to win. At UPY we always appreciate classic technique when it raises the bar of what has been done before. Rob\u0027s full technicolour wide angle scenic reveals the richness of UK seas with an elegant simplicity that is incredibly challenging to pull off in British conditions. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Winner: Wrecks. So simple yet so powerful the additional lighting of the turret and the main er perfectly positioned. This was a very strong category this year with a deserved winner and it\u0027s refreshing to read the acknowledgement to Leigh Bishop\u0027s pioneering work. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) The iconic silhouette of a seahorse is a graphically powerful picture. Here Zarina has raised that to another level with the addition of a red filter to her snooted strobe, reminiscent of a rim-lit animal at sunset. - Alex Mustard (Judge) All the judges found this to be probably the most distressing image to view but its uncompromising message must be seen by as many people as possible. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)As a subject we have seen our fair share of these colourful characters but this one shone through and the eggs almost look as if they have been inidually lit! - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Superb image with a perfect line across the split. Good exposure both above and below the water line and such an ideal subject to cap it all off. Excellent work. - Martin Edge (Judge)This is an excellent example for this category. It takes a tried and trusted angle but completely lifts it by using the fabric. It becomes more than an image a concept, a transition, a rebirth. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)2245 Isles of Scilly, UKThis image stood out on many levels. Composition, colour vibrancy and contrast combined with an unusual angle kept us coming back to it and helped it rise in the rankings with each viewing. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Perfect control of angle, light and focus. This was always up there with all of the judges. A clear favourite just like Nick Park’s genius creations. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) I\u0027ve seen many images of eel and shrimp around Indonesia, however you have taken this two steps forward. 1) With your excellent idea to snoot the eye and 2) with your backlight on the shrimp.

I knew we had to get the hooks out or she would have been in big trouble. I went for a few es down to see how she’d react to me being close to her.”When the animal stayed calm, he approached and took out the hooks.The manta stayed completely still in the water,” he said.“It’s pretty incredible behaviour if this is what happened,” said David Boyle, lecturer in marine biology at the University of Plymouth. “It’s not uncommon for animals – generally mammals – to interact with ers but for one in distress to seek out assistance would be novel indeed.”Manta rays are believed to be some of the most intelligent creatures in the ocean. Unlike stingrays, they don’t have an external spike and are generally harmless to humans.Experts believe the injured eye would have become infected, leading to blindness and possible death.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It doesn’t have clear targets it doesn’t have the same ministerial interest it doesn’t have the funding and it’s not prioritised so it doesn’t necessarily have the resources, so I think that’s the department’s challenge.“That’s why outsourcing is part of its modus operandi. That’s one way in which it can try and manage all this capacity – to give the task to somebody else.”Mr Bolt raised concerns about difficulties for visa applicants and for other\u0026nbspimmigrants to access the services of private firms who have commercial contracts with the Home Office, such as Sopra Steria, a French firm that took over\u0026nbspin-country visa processing\u0026nbspin November.The Independent revealed last month that the company had raked in millions for providing what lawyers branded a “substandard” service, which had forced some applicants to pay high fees and travel hundreds of miles to submit\u0026nbspapplications on time.\u0026nbspMPs and lawyers subsequently called for an independent investigation into the outsourced system, raising “extreme concerns” about Sopra Steria’s “capacity and ability” to run the service.Speaking after an event\u0026nbsporganised by the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Visas and Immigration on Thursday, Mr Bolt said: “When you hear that people have difficulty accessing Sopra Steria or any of the other outsourced commercial contracts, what is the Home Office doing to ensure that what they’re providing is actually\u0026nbspmeeting the terms of the contract?“In earlier contracts, one of the challenges was whether the contract had been properly funded, so there’s been an attempt to try and do things slightly on the cheap. And then it always feels rather reluctant to press the provider, because they realised they’ve got the provider over a barrel.“The question is, does it retain sufficient visibility of what’s going on and sufficient control over it? And to what extent is it accountable for what’s delivered?”A report published by Mr Bolt\u0026nbspin 2016, which aimed to understand how the Home Office was going to assess the effectiveness of the\u0026nbsphostile environment policies, found there were “no real measurements in place to collect, analyse and evaluate” the measures.But the chief inspector questioned whether the department had “the capacity to do anything about it” because they were “short of resource generally, meaning everything is under pressure” – likening the situation to “changing a tyre as you’re driving down the motorway”.“Across all of the Home Office, its business is bigger than its capacity to manage. It’s constantly having to make decisions about priorities, and getting dragged off to do things. That for me is one of the key issues – whether it’s got the bandwidth to cope with everything,” he added.A Home Office spokesperson said:\u0026nbsp“We welcome the independent scrutiny of the chief inspector and take his comments, criticism and recommendations very seriously.\u0026nbsp“We are committed to delivering an immigration system that is fair and delivers value for money for the taxpayer and the inspector is a crucial part of that work. It is only right that the department and ministers give full consideration to the recommendations made in ICIBI\u0026nbsp(independent chief inspector of borders and immigration)\u0026nbspreports, which can be complex and wide-ranging.”Asylum and Immigration\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

First of all, the pound is likely to drop significantly against other major currencies, as happened in the aftermath of the 2016 referendum.‘Many thousands’ of jobs lost in no-deal Brexit, minister warnsThis will rapidly increase the cost of imported raw materials and components at the same time as businesses have to deal with disruptions to their supply chain as the free movement of goods and services ends abruptly.Additional tariffs will further add to the cost of doing business as will non-tariff barriers such as customs checks, additional paperwork and quotas.Some businesses, such as those which rely heavily on sourcing parts from across the continent, will become unprofitable and inevitably have to lay off staff or even shut down completely.We have a number of forecasts of what this might mean for employment.In December, academics at the University of Sussex predicted that a no-deal scenario will cost 750,000 UK jobs, including 150,000 in London and over 80,000 in the northwest of England.Analysis by Cambridge Econometrics commissioned by the mayor of London forecasts 87,000 jobs lost in the capital by 2030 out of a nationwide total of half a million.Across the EU, around 1.2 million jobs would be lost, according to a recent paper from the University of Leuven. It concluded that Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands would be the worst affected by a no-deal Brexit, with Dublin losing 50,330 jobs or 2.6 per cent of its entire workforce.This week the Northern Irish government sounded the alarm with a warning that the country would lose 40,000 jobs after a no-deal Brexit, primarily as a result of disruptions to trade with the Republic.While there is considerable variation in the predictions, all certainly support the business secretary’s assertion.The Bank of England’s Gertjan Vlieghe pointed to a further problem on Friday: that British workers,\u0026nbsphighly indebted and with low levels of savings, are ill-equipped to deal with the sudden slump in the labour market that Brexit may bring.“I remain concerned about the vulnerability of households to a downside surprise in income or employment, given the very low savings rate,” said Mr Vlieghe, who sits on the BoE’s interest rate-setting committee.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The socialists did not rule out voting for her, but have basically laid out a programme of things she needs to agree to to get their support.\u0026nbspTheir demands – it’s a very long list – include an investment programme, opening accession talks with Albania and North Macedonia in 2019, and reform of EU foreign policy. It’s not quite clear how serious they are about all the policies, many of which have been knocking around for ages.The liberal group, which is now called Renew, has also sent a similar letter.Von der Leyen needs 374 votes in the 751-member parliament to win: without the support of the socialist and the liberals – the latter of which have kept quiet for now – she has to rely on Eurosceptic groups to vote for her.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Japan\u0027s Megumu Yoshida and Yukiko Inui compete in the duet technical artistic swimming event during the 2019 World Championships at Yeomju Gymnasium in GwangjuHot air balloons fly over the city of Igualada during an early flight as part of the European Balloon Festival in Igualada, Spain.

Preconceived notions and ignorance require therapy and conversion.”\u0026nbspThe Aguda, an LGBT+ rights group, called for Mr Peretz to resign.What is \u0027gay conversion therapy\u0027 and why is it so dangerous?Benny Gantz, head of the Blue and White party, the main opposition, said: “Any statements about conversion therapy cannot be legitimate in Israel in 2019. The Blue and White government will promote equality, tolerance and acceptance of the other.”According to World Israel News, he added: “The right of every person to live according to his faith, opinion and inclination is a cornerstone of Israeli democracy and we will defend it with all our might.”Mr Peretz described how he had acted when a gay person told him about his sexual inclinations.“First of all, I embraced him. I said very warm things to him. I told him, ‘Let’s think. Let’s study. And let’s contemplate.’“The objective is first of all for him to know himself well ... and then he will decide,” Mr Peretz said.He later tried to clarify his comments, saying he did not mean gay children must be sent to conversion therapy, the Jerusalem Post reported.Nitzan Horowitz, who leads the left-wing Meretz party, said the therapy was dangerous and risked leading young people to suicide.Mr Peretz also provoked anger last week when he compared intermarriage between Jews and non-Jews to a “second Holocaust”.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Moreover, our three countries are deeply troubled by the attacks we have witnessed in the Persian Gulf and beyond, and by the deterioration of the security in the region.“We believe the time has come to act responsibly and seek a path to stop the escalation of tensions and resume dialogue. The risks are such that it is necessary for all stakeholders to pause and consider the possible consequences of their actions.”In a clear warning of the consequences if Tehran continues to flout the terms of the deal, the E3 said: “While we continue to support the JCPOA, its continuation is contingent on Iran’s full compliance, and we strongly urge Iran to reverse its recent decisions in this regard.”Trump ‘pulled out of Iran nuclear deal to spite Obama’, Darroch saidTrump’s threatening of Iran is outrageously hypocriticalIf it hopes to avoid war with Iran, America must ignore its instinctsBritain risks being dragged into wider confrontation against IranThey added: “Our countries have recently taken several diplomatic initiatives to contribute to de-escalation and dialogue, for which signs of goodwill are urgently needed from all sides … In search of a resolution we will continue our active engagement with all interested parties, in the interest of the preservation of international peace and security.”Speaking ahead of the Foreign Affairs Council meeting in Brussels, Mr Hunt said: “The Middle East is already one of the most unstable regions in the world, but if the different parties were armed with nuclear weapons it would represent an existential threat to mankind. I will do everything in my power to prevent that from happening.“Today I’ll be building on the leadership shown by the UK, alongside France and Germany, as we do what it takes to maintain the nuclear deal, and to work to encourage Iran back into compliance.”Mr Hunt spoke at the weekend with Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif, who demanded the release of the oil tanker Grace 1, currently being detained in Gibraltar on suspicion of busting UN sanctions on Syria.“As I said to the Iranians this weekend, the detention of the Grace 1 was a Gibraltar-led enforcement of EU Syria sanctions,” said Mr Hunt. “Action had to be taken, and this was nothing to do with the oil being Iranian.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There’s no shame for me. There’s no shame for any of us,\u0027 says Mounir BaatourClick to followThe IndependentMounir Baatour’s office is cool, the steady thrum of the air conditioner offering a welcome break from the blistering summer heat that has descended upon Tunis. Past noon, little moves outside. The streets are empty and even the city’s ubiquitous cat population has slinked off to the shadows.Despite the temperature, Baatour, the first openly gay man to run for president in a Muslim country, remains focused upon the task ahead.The road leading to the November poll is unlikely to offer a smooth ride. Homosexuality itself isn’t illegal in Tunisia. However, practising it is. This distinction has allowed Baatour, a lawyer, to register the pressure group\u0026nbspShams. Along with others, the group campaigns for a repeal of the colonial French\u0026nbsplaw\u0026nbspproscribing sodomy.Likewise, legal\u0026nbsprestrictions criminalising\u0026nbsp”outrages against public decency” are often used to persecute the country’s LGBT+ population – these\u0026nbspremain firmly with the sights of Baatour and other rights campaigners. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOn top of this, the police force appears eager to exploit existing edicts allowing, for instance,\u0026nbspenforced anal examinations to be used as evidence of sexuality. This is buttressed by a judiciary and political establishment long practised in the art of looking the other way.Created with Sketch.Best photos from Pride 2019 around the world Show all 45Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In February, a young man from the coastal city of Sfax received an eight month\u0026nbspsentence for engaging in homosexual acts after reporting being raped by two other men. Other stories of official abuse are legion. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“I am openly gay,”\u0026nbspBaatour\u0026nbspsays. “I came out 20 years ago. I was jailed for three months for sodomy in 2013. There’s no shame for me. There’s no shame for any of us.”Baatour, his association and his relatively fringe Liberal party are children of Tunisia’s revolution. In the years immediately following 2011, a number of gay rights groups emerged, led by Baatour’s own Shams, calling for a repeal of\u0026nbspanti-homosexual laws.However, even here, Shams’ tactics have given rise to ision, with a coalition for LGBT+ rights issuing a statement\u0026nbsplast year distancing themselves from Shams and its president. Baatour attributes this schism to his openness to potentially normalising relations with Israel, a suggestion considered anathema to many on Tunisia’s left.Perhaps ironically, the same period during which many of these groups arose also witnessed an explosion in Islamism across Tunisia, with the moderate Islamist Ennahda party vying with the radical\u0026nbspAnsar al-Sharia\u0026nbspfor the political souls of Tunisia’s religious majority.When you put gay people in jail for three years, what, do they come out straight? No\u0026nbspAnsar\u0026nbspal-Sharia was outlawed in 2013, and support for Ennahda appears to have ebbed since the groundswell of popular support that saw them achieve a plurality vote in the country’s first free elections in 2011.But across many sections of Tunisian society, values typically bend towards the traditional. In August, conservative demonstrators of both genders took to the street to protest a\u0026nbsppresidentially mandated report\u0026nbspurging greater inidual freedoms and equality across the genders. \u0026nbspAs far as homosexuality is concerned, those conservative sentiments cut deeper. A June 2019 survey by the polling institute Arab Barometer reported that just 7 per cent of Tunisians condoned homosexuality. It’s a sentiment reflected within the rhetoric of some of Baatour’s populist rivals for the presidency. Law professor Kais Saied\u0026nbspis\u0026nbspa close second in the polls – he has\u0026nbspsuggested\u0026nbspthat encouraging the spread of homosexuality within the country is a foreign plot. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspAlleged rape victim imprisoned for homosexual acts by Tunisian court“I think we need to have a debate about homosexuality in Tunisia,” says Baatour, who identifies as Muslim but doesn’t practise.“I’m not talking about promoting homosexuality, just about decriminalising it. Gay people don’t do anyone any harm. They should be free to do what they want with their bodies. If, as Kais Saied has said, homosexuality is a sickness, then – even if I accept that – I have to ask, why are you putting sick people in jail?“When you put gay people in jail for three years, what, do they come out straight? No. So they must return to jail for a further three years and then for the rest of their lives.”Though what Baatour is proposing might seem radical, it is not without precedent. In arguing his case, Baatour points to the country’s first post-independence president, Habib Bourguiba, who in 1956 introduced landmark laws outlawing polygamy and introducing a code of women’s rights that stands to this day.LGBT activists arrested at unauthorised pride march in Cuba“All of that at the time was controversial, a lot of people said it was against Islam. However, Bourguiba had the political will to impose it. In 1956, Tunisia was more conservative than it is now, but people came to accept it and still do.” \u0026nbspHowever, while accepting that much of the attention on him focuses upon his stance on LGBT+ rights, Baatour is keen to stress that his candidacy is about more.He wants to address many of Tunisia’s underlying ills, from the state enterprises that continue to haemorrhage money, to the vast scale of the country’s informal economy, to the environment, which remains a priority.But above all, he says, is his commitment to promoting civil liberties and the rights of the inidual.Whether or not he is successful remains to be seen. However, for Baatour, the fight alone is worthwhile. If anything, he says, his campaign forces the other candidates to address the lack of progress on civil liberties and inidual rights within Tunisia.Baatour leans forward, “I will place this at the very heart of my campaign.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As he himself said, his job had become “impossible”.But this whole episode has been utterly depressing, and there is plenty of blame to go around.Perhaps Sir Kim was a little loose in his language, but no diplomat could ever expect his confidential notes to senior figures in London to end up on the front of the papers.The tributes since his resignation certainly suggest that this was the first time he’d put a foot even slightly wrong in his entire career.And the President — who is a friend of Britain — should have realised that when it comes to diplomacy, the shoot-from-the-hip style he uses on social media can have consequences.No newspaper complains about a leak, but whoever undermined Sir Kim by releasing his not-quite-diplomatic cables should reflect on the damage it has done to not just our international standing but to the Foreign Office’s ability to do its job.As for the Boris “row”, it’s unedying to see his detractors weaponising this sorry saga against him.Whatever he had said on the TV debate, Sir Kim’s position was already sadly untenable.Moving forward, the Special Relationship must remain special.Our links with America are stronger than one ambassador, from security to our shared culture.But we must never be complacent about the ties to our closest ally.YOU can see why Labour has turned on the journalists behind last night’s Panorama investigation into the party’s dreadful handling of anti-Semitism in its ranks.The programme was damning from start to finish. It details the most extraordinary levels of racism in all corners of the party and a total refusal of the leadership to do anything about it.Indeed the party appears to have actually tried to strangle worthwhile investigations at birth, and to have actively interfered in the disciplinary process.Corbyn’s useful idiots have predictably turned on the whistleblowers – ironic, considering Labour’sShadow Chancellor once handed a petition to No calling for better protection for those brave enough to call their employers out for bad practice.Hypocrites, the lot of them.It may not be the case that Corbyn himself is a racist, but goodness, he does seem to attract an awful lot of them — and be too thick or ignorant to notice they’re there.The party’s rotten, from top to bottom.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

One Lord was described as a “notorious bullying pervert” by a Westminster worker.The verdict was that the prevailing culture and behaviour in the House of Lords “has not been conducive to an open and supportive culture to ensure all those working there are treated with dignity and respect”.Worse, the report concluded those staff on the receiving end of bullying and harassment generally did not complain because they thought nothing would change, or feared reprisal.Clearly, the House of Lords has issues. But it’s nowhere near as bad as the House of Commons. The second report, by Gemma White QC into inappropriate conduct in Westminster, concluded MPs’ staff face “unacceptable risk of bullying and harassment”.It found sexual harassment in Parliament is seen by young staff as a “necessary evil”they want to progress. Witnesses describe speaking out against any abuse as “career suicide”.Even though both reports state only a small minority of MPs or Lords behave in unacceptable ways, this has been tolerated for too long and shining a light on it will bring about change.What’s clear to me, both from reading the report and working at the House of Lords, is that this is a generational issue. The House of Lords is full of older people stuck in a time warp.Many of them live in a world where it’s still acceptable for women — often females of a lower status to them — to be patted on the bottom or on the head.The House of Lords can feel a bit like a boys’ boarding school, or Hogwarts. It’s populated predominantly by old white men, many of whom lead a le insulated from the real world.That said, the worst behaviour I witness is usually in the library, where Lords often retire after lunch and which rings with the sound of ear-deafening snoring and, I am sorry to say, farting.The only time I’ve ever seen anyone being actively rude was when one Lord commanded a member of canteen staff to get him a bag of crisps. He was so close he could have reached out and got it himself.I’ve also been on the receiving end of the odd condescending comment, such as when a Lord looked me up and down and said: “You’re dressed rather casually.” I was wearing Stella McCartney trousers at the time, so not exactly jeans.Crucially, though, I wasn’t wearing a dress. So I looked him up and down and said: “Dressing casually is better than dressing badly” — and that was the end of that.It must be horrible to work in an organisation where you feel inferior and can’t speak your mind — and,you do, people either shrug or shut you down. The report about the House of Lords suggested it should be mandatory for all employees to go on a “how to value people” course. Some people might see it as unnecessary — but we send West Ham staff on them and they are good.But that’s not the only change required. There’s neither enough women, nor cultural ersity. The only way that will change is by electing a more erse chamber.In the meantime, I hope this report does not diminish, in people’s minds, the important legislation work the House of Lords does and the role it plays in holding the Commons to account. I hope these reports don’t stop people from remembering what an important institution it is.As Spider-Man said: “With great power comes great responsibility” — and as one who sits in the House of Lords, I know I am not the only one who feels it is a great responsibility.BIG news.

Poll after poll suggests No Deal Boris would win with an outright majority — at their expense.The public is sick to the back teeth with Theresa May’s dreary defeatism and Brussels’ bullying. Remain voters want this sorted, too.Elections are always risky. But a Tory Party still dithering and paralysed on the biggest issue of the age is the greatest risk of all.

But she dismissed the public infighting over the Panorama investigation as a “soap opera”.It comes as two whistleblowers featured in the BBC programme said they now plan to sue the party.Sam Matthews and Louise Withers Green have instructed high profile media lawyer Mark Lewis to act on their behalf because they believed the party had defamed them in its response to their claims.Labour continues to complain about the documentary, which claimed that senior figures - including Jeremy Corbyn ’s communications chief Seumas Milne and general secretary Jennie Formby - had interfered in anti-Semitism investigations. Addressing the Durham Miners’ Gala on Saturday, Mr Corbyn said the documentary had contained “many, many inaccuracies”. However, in an interview with BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show, Ms Thornberry said the party needs to face up to the fact that it still has a problem with anti-Semitism. “I think that we shouldn’t be going for the messengers, we should be looking at the message. I think that is what is important,” she said. “Nobody can pretend that there isn’t an ongoing problem within the Labour Party about anti-Semitism, about our processes for dealing with it.” However, Ms Thornberry also criticised deputy leader Tom Watson for attacking Ms Formby while she was undergoing treatment for cancer. “I wish he wasn’t attacking somebody who is going through chemotherapy. I think that is a mistake,” she said.  “She is the general secretary of the Labour Party but we know that she is very ill. I think it is completely inappropriate to personalise this.” Her comments followed an angry tirade from Unite union general secretary Len McCluskey, who said Mr Watson “and his pals” should “f****** well be ashamed of yourselves”. To cheers from the crowd at Durham Racecourse, he declared: “Jennie, our message to you is that the Durham Miners’ Gala stands with you.” “I don’t care about the soap opera, I care that I have a Jewish member of staff, who when she goes to family weddings, can’t say who she works for, even though I fight on this issue a lot, she cannot say who she works for or what she does, because she doesn’t want to spend the rest of the day defending herself,” Thornberry told BBC One’s The Andew Marr Show. Others who spoke to Panorama are also understood to be considering contacting Mr Lewis to represent them in libel actions.

United political parties do better than ided ones. And with a general election potentially around the corner, Corbyn’s rallying cry was embraced at a huge brass-bands-and-banners Durham Miners’ gala, dwarfing the crowds at royal weddings or Glastonbury. Yet until the Labour leader devises a way to pull his party together, should a unity strategy be possible under Corbyn, vicious backbiting throws a leline to Johnson.  Even though voters view him as a self-serving, irresponsible, untrustworthy buffoon, rather than the Churchillian figure that this vain, preposterous huckster admires in his mirror. Labour’s European injuries are temporarily patched until any election. By belatedly embracing a fresh referendum, the party committed to demanding a people’s vote to block a damaging Tory Brexit shambles or the catastrophic no-deal nightmare of Johnson’s fevered fantasies. Anti-Semitism is the gaping wound still to be cauterised. Bitter disputes over how deep the poison runs and the action to cleanse Labour of the racist stain is pitting one-time allies against each other.

Mr McCluskey did not mince his words in branding the Deputy Leader an effing disgrace for publicly criticising a party general secretary, Jennie Formby, enduring chemotherapy for breast cancer.

Kim’s regime is now asking factory staff to pay up, and receive a certicate of loyalty in . But one report claims that the people are not happy with the plan. The source said: “Some people think it is ridiculous how the authorities are ignoring their livelihoods while trying to raise money to keep dead bodies from rotting.”    News outlet Radio Free Asia reported: “There was a ceremony to award certicates for the Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il Fund to factory representatives. “They gave the certicates to party members and workers who donated money to show their loyalty. “It will be used to help with the upkeep of the Palace of the Sun.” "},{"url":null,"title":"theresa dances night away abba","story":"NewsTheresa May dances and sings to Abba hits at posh black-tie music festivalVIDEO EXCLUSIVE: The partying Prime Minister is already celebrating freedom with her infamous moves at the £-a-head Henley Festival - after she was forced to leave someone  to mop up BrexitShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video theresa-busts-move-bjorn-again-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFor three years she has imprisoned herself in the Toriesapos Brexit civil war. But Theresa May has finally thrown off her shackles with a weekend at Wimbledonaposs Royal Box, the Cricket World Cup final - and dancing and singing to her favourite Abba hits. The famously robotic Prime Minister, who leaves office next Wednesday, let her hair down at a black-tie music festival after she was forced to hand over the reins of her failed Brexit deal. With Boris Johnson preparing to take No, she enthusiastically danced the night away to Take a Chance on Me, Money Money Money and Mamma Mia at a show by cover band Bjorn Again. Mrs May and husband Philip even bopped to a cover of Van Halenaposs  hit Jump in the grandstand at Oxfordshireaposs Henley Festival - where one-evening tickets cost up to £. She was also spotted where at the festival throwing shapes to Dancing Queen - which famously soundtracked her walk on stage at the  Tory conference.    The PM and husband Philip arrived at the Henley Festival on Saturday evening and were spotted heading to the aposMoet Champagne Lawnapos, where a bottle of bubbly costs £. While some music festival-goers would be lumped with a burger stand, a witness said she dined at the Terrace Restaurant - where the £-a-head set menu includes slow-cooked duck egg and a pistachio sponge with passion fruit cream. She then headed over to the headline concert by Bjorn Again, who formed playing Abba covers more than  years ago in Melbourne. Mrs May - who had bodyguards nearby - danced and sang enthusiastically to tunes including Money Money Money with husband Philip and unknown friends.    The second female Prime Minister even sang along to the lyricI had a little money, itaposs a rich manaposs world - before breaking into a frown. She also sangyou put me to the test! If you let me try! to Take a Chance on Me - after she lost her majority in the  snap election and saw her Brexit deal voted down three times in Parliament. And she sang why why, did I ever let you go! as the band played Mamma Mia - weeks after having to give up the job of Prime Minister.  The band also played Dancing Queen - and even gave Mrs May a shout-out. Downing Street have not yet commented on whether the Prime Minister and her husband paid for their tickets, or were guests of the festival. The Henley Festival bills itself as an exclusive boutique black tie festival where art and gastronomy share equal billing with music.  This yearaposs event near her Maidenhead constituency featured Boy George and Jessie J on a floating stage by the River Thames. It was part of a glitzy weekend  for the PM and husband Philip - which included watched the ladiesapos singles final from the Royal Box at Wimbledon. And the pair were pictured again today at Lords to watch the Cricket World Cup final between England and New Zealand.  The PM danced on-stage to the Abba hit at last yearaposs Tory conference after a video of her dancing awkwardly with school pupils in South Africa became a viral hit. In a farewell interview on Friday, she said she was leaving the job with pride at having been PM, but disappointment at failing to see a Brexit deal through the Commons. She also said I sacriced my job - hours after a Cabinet minister warned No Deal Brexit could put thousands out of work - and claimed the UK is not polarised over leaving the EU.

He seemed destined to defy his ordinary beginnings as the son of an immigrant raised in a terraced home in the Greater Manchester  suburb of Burnage. Yousef’s father Ghaleb left his home in Beirut  years ago with nothing. He moved to England hoping for a new and better le. He and his we Debbie had high hopes for their bookish, bespectacled son Yousef, who passed the entrance exam for the elite Manchester Grammar School, one of the nation’s most successful. But that all ended in March this year, in a death which showed a disturbing culture of kne crime among youngsters who have social privilege, reports the Manchester Evening News.  Aged , Yousef must have felt intimidated when he first walked the cloistered corridors and looked up at the pictures of MGS alumni, like Oscar-winning actor Ben Kingsley, Nobel-prize winning chemist John Polanyi and England cricket captain Michael Atherton, amid a long list of celebrated writers, historians and musicians, many of them knights of the realm. This was a world away from Beirut, the place he proudly considered his spiritual home, all his short le. Greater Manchester was supposed to be safer place to grow up than Beirut. Unlike the majority of pupils at MGS whose families paid the £,-a-year fees, Yousef was given a bursary because of his parents’ relatively small income, and grew up close to the Fallowfield school. Without that financial help, he would not have been able to attend. Academically, the young Yousef thrived in his early years at MGS, routinely getting top grades and, like many aspirational boys at the school, dreamed of studying medicine. He was excelling at his A levels: maths, economics, chemistry and biology.  And, while no-one suggests his school was in any way at fault, there is a tragic irony in Yousefaposs story. Many parents might imagine that a place at an expensive private school would be the surest way of protecting their son or daughter from bad influences and bad choices. How many parents would fear their child would never come home while socialising in Hale Barns, one of the wealthiest parts of Greater Manchester  But thataposs precisely what happened to Yousef Makki. Privileged boys with double lives Following a three-week trial, a -year-old boy, identied for legal reasons as Boy One, has been cleared of murder, manslaughter and a conspiracy to rob said to have led to Yousefaposs death, while a second -year-old, known as Boy Two, has been cleared of conspiracy to rob and perverting the course of justice.  The verdicts mean no-one is criminally responsible for Yousefaposs death. However, the trial that led to this conclusion revealed that Yousef and the two boys - who he was with on the night of his death - were living double lives. Like many teenagers Yousef experimented with cannabis. As did Boy One and Two. Had the experimentation ended there, Yousef might still be alive, and the other two might never have appeared in a crown court on serious charges. But there was also a disturbing fascination with knives. Boy One repeatedly filmed himself playing with knives, listened to tracks that celebrated knives and kne crime, and looked at knives on Instagram.  Boy Two filmed himself brandishing a flick-kne, and sent the video to Yousef. aposBanterapos about knives and stabbing featured in Yousefaposs banter with both boys. In the trial that followed his death, Boy One admitted that he aposliked to carryapos a blade, he said to avoid being mugged. Boy Two said he carried one to aposfit inapos, despite the fact neither boy lived in a high crime area, or fitted the social profile of a youngster particularly at risk of gang or kne crime. They claimed Yousef had a kne too, though he isnapost here to defend himself. As Boy Oneaposs barrister put it, it was about acting tough aposon the streets of Wilmslowapos, adding: “Whataposs going on with this generation of children with the advantage of good families and a good education and clearly materially well off   They appeared to have led double lives, living out idiotic fantasies.” It all came to a head on March , when the trio were hanging round in Hale Barns, smoking cannabis. Grainy CCTV from a shop picked them up. Yousef shadow-boxing, the two others showing off the flick-knives they had bought online,  the trio having idled up to the car park on bikes, all three of them apparently stoned. Had this been a poorer part of south Manchester, the scene - knives, bikes, cannabis - could easily have seen them branded as gang members. Except this was Hale Barns. Boy One was on £, bike, and the shop they were outside was the high-end grocery chain, Booths, rather than a corner off-licence.  From the car park of Booths the trio rode to get £ worth of cannabis at a rendezvous on Sunbank Lane. And what happened there was was the trigger for Yousefaposs death - and the event that would leave his two friends facing serious charges. Boy One ended up being beaten up by two of the alleged drug dealeraposs mates. The prosecutionaposs claim that this was after Boy One had tried and failed to rob the alleged dealer, having conspired with Boy Two to do it, a version of events that was rejected by the jury. In his defence, Boy One said the motive for the attack on him was because he had been wrongly blamed for an assault on one of their associates.  And he claimed that none of his friends helped him when he was attacked, his prized bike thrown over a hedge. Yousef had merely watched, he said, while Boy Two had run off.  minutes later, Yousef was bleeding to death at Gorse Bank Road, Hale Barns. Boy One, describing the moments before Yousef was fatally injured  - by his flick-kne - said there was a confrontation after he told Yousef and Boy Two that he was going home. “I just wanted to find my bike so that we are all on good terms. I wasn’t having it. I really wanted to go home. I started to get more adamant, more angry so I said f*** off I’m going home.” “Then I believe Yousef got a bit annoyed and called me a p**sy. I got annoyed at this. I was the only one standing there who had got a beating while one of your friends runs off and the other one just watches.”  Asked how he felt at being called a p**sy, he said: “I didn’t think it was fair. I said how am I a p**syI’m stood there taking a beating whilst you two have done nothing  This is when I have pushed Yousef. It was just out of frustration. It was just with an open palm. It wasn’t like full force. It was more I’m not in a mood, leave me alone, go away.” Boy One said Yousef ‘got a bit annoyed about that’ and punched him, with one blow landing on the right side of his head. “I was just kind of a bit confused. I wasn’t really expecting it, Boy One went on. And then I have looked up and Yousef is quite annoyed at me at this point. I believe I saw him, he had taken his kne out and he looked like he was going to hit me again saying ‘come on, come on’. Claiming that he ‘just didn’t want to get beaten up again’ and that he felt ‘quite on edge’, Boy One went on.  ”I have started to take a kne out of my pocket,” he said, describing how he removed the blade from the right pocket of his gilet. He said he couldnapost remember whether the blade was out of his flick-kne, saying it happened in a matter of seconds and that Yousef was less than a metre away. Asked what his intention in producing the kne was, he replied: “I donapost know, I just, just to warn him off, trying to get him to leave me alone.” So how did the blade end up in Yousefaposs chest, penetrating his ribs, going into his heart  Did Boy One know  “Not really, he told his trial. I do not know what I did. I don’t know how it all came together ... I really didn’t think it was anything at first. I didn’t think I had stabbed him. “I kind of stood back a bit and walked away and then Yousef pulls out and says’ you’ve stabbed me.  In the  seconds afterwards Boy One discarded his kne in a hedge, before bumping into a private security officer, Michael Bowman. Bowman was paid to patrol the leafy avenues, and had seen a commotion about m away from his car. I need your help, my mateaposs been stabbed, Boy One said. Yousef lay by a tree, blood pumping from his chest wound onto the grass verge. Boy Two made two  calls at once - one from his own phone, the other from Yousef’s blood-stained device, which the dying teenager struggled to unlock. My mateaposs been stabbed yeah, he needs an ambulance here now. Heaposs going to die, please hurry up, hurry up please. Hurry up bro, Boy Two told the operator. Boy One took off his manbag, his bubble jacket and sweatshirt, and pressed the jumper to the wound. But when police arrived he lied - he would later admit perverting the course of justice. Bare-chested, pacing up and down, he told them that the person responsible was in a VW Polo that had driven away from the scene, suggesting people had come from Stretford to Hale to aposrob usapos.  There had been a VW Polo, but it was the VW Polo the alleged drug dealer had driven to the rendezvous near the airport  minutes earlier. Police and paramedics arrived at the scene and a hunt was launched for the kneman. Boy Two said heaposd been looking at his phone at the moment Yousef was injured. How long do you think this process will take  he asked the officer. Boy Twoaposs mother later drove down to the scene and ferried her son home. There, on the island in the middle of their kitchen, the police body-cam footage showed Boy Two praying and at times tearful. How can someone just come around and stab him  How can that happen ” , his mother said. Meanwhile the search was continuing for the men in the invented VW Polo - and Yousef Makki was drawing his last breath despite desperate attempts to save him.  Thoracic surgeon Ragheb Hasan happened to live near Gorse Bank Road where Yousef was injured - he went out to help when he heard sirens. While Yousef lay motionless on a stretcher in the back of the ambulance, the consultant made a ‘clam shell’ incision across his chest and began emergency heart massage. This continued all the way to Manchester Royal Infirmary. Yousef, who had dreamed of saving lives as a heart surgeon, had suffered such a devastating injury to his own heart that he was declared dead at the hospital. aposWhereaposs your shank  Show meapos Boy One and Boy Two have both admitted possessing a kne, and will be sentenced for it later this month. The depths of their obsession with knives was one of the most disturbing elements of the case. The court heard allegations that, a year before Yousef was killed, Boy One gatecrashed a party at a £m mansion in Hale Barns.  This was an event with security at the gated entrance, attended by children from Manchesteraposs most prestigious schools, including Yousef Makki. Witnesses described how, when a fight broke out, Boy One punched another boy before stepping back and pulling out a blade from his waistband, appearing to take pleasure in the way the room fell silent in terror. In a selfie-video shown in the trial, Boy One filmed himself with a machete in the mirror of his bedroom and sniggered as he made violent stabbing motions towards a boy on his bed, the point of the blade coming just a few centimeters from his target’s face. The other boy responds by making stabbing movements towards Boy One with his own kne. Both laugh.  Another clip showed Boy One using a lit firework to light a splf before tossing the banger over his shoulder, exploding near a car. The soundtrack was a drill tune by Next Up. Among the lyrics is this line: “Back out my shank and dip it, ballistic Push in my shank and twist it.” Shank is slang for kne. Three weeks before Yousef died, Boy One shot another video where he appeared to make slashing movements across the throat of someone in the distance with a machete before poking the blade into a mattress. The only reason police were able to see these telling clips was thanks to Yousef’s family handing detectives the usernames and passwords to his social media accounts. In one of the clips Yousef is heard saying to Boy One, who he would later have a fatal confrontation with: “Whereaposs your shank. Show me. Iaposm not a**ed…. You little pr**kapos. You are a snitch lad. You bell Fed. Boy Two was also involved in this kind of aposbanterapos.  Police uncovered a telling Snapchat conversation between Yousef and Boy Two after a falling out featuring words like ‘trapper’, a slang term for a drug dealer. Donapost hate on what Iaposm doing,” wrote Boy Two. Yousef: Donapost be messaging man. Like ur gonna be a trapper. Ur not.. Jus shut up fam. Talk too much never do Niz. Actions speak louder than words. Iaposll talk to u when ur normal again. Pussio. Ur getting stabbed when I see u. Swear down. Iaposm gonna kill u. U p*ssy.

Isla Williams suffered bite marks just milimetres from her right eye when it happened at the Winterton Agricultural Show close to Scunthorpe. She had leaned forward to stroke the dog when it happened. The toddler needed five hours of hospital treatment and bandaging after she was attacked by a Japanese Akita.  Parents Megan Lester and Danny Williams were horried by the mauling - and now say they want to raise awareness of the dangers animals can pose.Megan told Grimsby Live : I figured the dog would be friendly with it being at a show full of kids and surrounded by a lot of people, so I said Isla could stroke it.She was only a few yards away from me.    Isla is very good with dogs - we have a large Labrador, so she knows what to do and what not do.

Isla is a dog lover and has always been aware and cautious, she was not out of control or unsupervised, it was a horrible situation but no dog should pay for a situation that it didnapost ask to be in.  It is our hope that through this, people can realise just how lucky Isla was and be made aware that a busy environment and lack of knowledge is not a good mix and this situation can be prevented in the future. Megan added: Weaposre lucky Isla is okay and we hope that it doesnapost happen to anyone  at a show or any other sort of event. Winterton Show organisers said there had not previously been any problems with dogs at the event in the past and a full investigation would be launched to prevent similar incidents happening again. Earlier this week, Winterton Agricultural Society chairman Nigel Ogg said: The whole of the show committee were deeply saddened to hear about the incident on Saturday involving Isla. We have never had any problems in the past with any dogs at our shows.

The -year-old runs the dictatorship with an iron fist and since coming to power after the death of his dad in December , he has secured his grip on the country through the ousting and killing of generals and rivals. In the first six years as leader, he ordered the executions of at least  people, according to the Institute for National Security Strategy, a think tank arm of the National Intelligence Service. In , Kim Yong-jin, the deputy premier for education, was killed in front of a firing squad after showing “disrespectful posture” in a meeting. An investigation by the New York Times last year found how Kim rules with extreme brutality. Prisoners are starved, forced to work, tortured and raped. Reproductive rights are denied through forced abortions and infanticide.    And Kim learned from his dad, Kim Jong-il, how to maintain power, and he learned from his dad, North Koreaaposs first leader, Kim Il-sung. Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said: Kim Il-sung’s rule was based on ruthless rights abuses, including frequent use of enforced disappearances and deadly prison camps to inflict fear and repress any voices challenging his rule. The man is dead, but his brainwashing and horric abuses live on. Kim Jong-un is following right along in his grandfather’s footsteps.  Kim Il-sung established an authoritarian government that crushed dissent, abducted foreign nationals from South Korea, Japan, and where, and disappeared hundreds of thousands into a hidden system of remote gulag work-camps. Kim also developed a cult of personality by demanding absolute loyalty to him as the embodiment of the state, and systematically eradicated independent media, free trade unions, and any other sort of independent organizations in North Korea. Kim Il-sung ruled North Korea from  until his death in . Senior leaders within the Korean Workersapos Partyattempted to overthrow Kim in September .  were put to death. During his rise and consolidation of power, Kim created the songbun system, which ided the North Korean people into three groups. Each person was classied as belonging to core, wavering, or hostile classes, based on their political, social, and economic background – a system that persists today.    When years of famine ravaged the country in the s, those people living in marginalized and remote communities in the north were hardest hit. Kim Il-Sung punished real and perceived dissent through purges that included public executions and enforced disappearances. North Koreans who have left the country within the last two years told Human Rights Watch that even now, friends, neighbors, and family members can still disappear at any time. A  Commission of Inquiryon human rights in North Korea appointed by the United Nations Human Rights Council found that the North Korean government strategically uses surveillance, coercion, fear and punishment to preclude the expression of any dissent. It further stated that public executions and enforced disappearance to political prison camps serve as the ultimate means to terrorize the population into submission.

Richard, a primary school teacher, says it initially appeared Michael was on the mend after his gruelling  hour surgery, overcoming temporary paralysis and recovering his strength. But circumstances changed around seven weeks later. Richard said: He just started being a bit dferent. He could not move anymore and he became paralysed again. It slowly got worse and worse.  Doctors realised Michael was suffering from hydrocephalus, a build up of fluid filling the cavity where the tumour had been removed from his brain stem, which controls multiple vital bodily s.  Richard said: Every time the pressure built up on his brain he would become paralysed and he would lose more and more movement until the point he was just not conscious. Twice he nearly died they didnapost think he was going to make it through the night. As recently as January all he could do on a good day was twiddle a finger - he was trapped in his own body. Richard said Michaelaposs cognitive abilities were unaffected by the injuries to his brain, but he was eventually left unable to swallow, smile or breathe properly on his own. He said: Itaposs been absolute hell. The first six months when I was off work it was just awful. If I didnapost have the support from my work I donapost think I would have lasted half as long. I have been close to suicide a few times, that was when I thought we were going to lose him. It was a case of wellheaposs not going to be around itaposs just not worth going on. Now Michael has made steady improvements but still cannot talk or smile, has not eaten solid food for nine months and uses an assisted communication device to speak for him.

It had a more substantial message, with a darker tone that revealed a little more about the artist’s raison d’etre.    It read: “Here to save the world from self destruction. Humanity is dead and I am the saviour. See me in streets.”While the people of Grimsby were mulling over what this could all me, an eagle eyed art sleuth noticed a Twitter profile claiming to be run by the mysterious street artist.As well as images of the two artworks, the profile included a clarication of the second note. aposSee you in the streetsapos wasnapost in invitation to brawl or riot, the artist said, but a suggestion to watch out for more pieces of street art.  A now deleted post had the artist claiming to be behind a skeleton model that was found hanging from a noose last September. That controversial display also featured police tape in front of bones, which itself had set Liberiwritten on its forehead and was bearing a necklace featuring the pound sterling symbol. Borrowing the spooky guerrilla tactics of Max Headroom and Anonymous, they then uploaded a video of a shadowy figure wearing a white mask. Grainy digital artacts and a heavily-synthesised voice added to the drama. “To the people of the world,” the figures say. “The time is now.

Heaposd done a ten week course in accounting and been toughened up by his con-artist father who boasted “I cheat my boys every chance I get. I want to make aposem sharp.” Yet just  years later John D, Rockefeller, born appropriately in a town called Richford, New York, had become Americaaposs first billionaire.  He founded Standard Oil with his younger brother William and the eventually commanded a monopoly controlling  per cent of all Americaaposs oil. By the time John died in  - three years short of his centenary - he was the wealthiest man of his time and arguably of ALL time. His assets equalled .% of America’s TOTAL economic output - thataposs  billion dollars in todayaposs terms. So John D Rockefeller was more than four times richer that Bill Gates is today.    He retired in his late s and spent the final  years of his le enjoying the trappings of success, notably through a string of remarkable properties such as Kykuit, a six-storey home he built on the vast Westchester County estate and a -room holiday home called The Eyrie on Maine’s Mount Desert Island. He also had a huge mansion on West th Street in New York – the site now occupied by the Museum of Modern Art which, was co-founded by his granddaughter, Abby Rockefeller. In the s his son, John D Jr, also built the famous Rockefeller Center comprising  skyscrapers in Manhattan.  John Jraposs son David became a powerful banker.But the tycoon’s true legacy was the remarkable philanthropy that saw him give away more than  billion to worthy causes, ranging from medical research to education. He is said to be the biggest medical benefactor in history. His flagship company was broken up in  but the Rockefeller family – which today has  members - is still worth more than  billion and has interests around the globe.We look at some of the shocking secrets of the super-rich Rockefellers. William Avery Rockefeller, John D.’s father, posed as a “deaf-mute peddler” to sell miracle potions and herbal remedies. Nicknamed “Devil Bill,” he also posed as an eye and ear specialist named Dr. William Levingston.    He had children with both his we and mistress, the latter woman living with the family as their housekeeper. Nelson Rockefeller John Daposs grandson, was a businessman turned politician and Governor of New York from -.

Rockefeller Center security were said to have found him dead at his desk. But later reports issued a correction the -year-old actually died a townhouse, where he was having sex with a -year-old aide. Nelson’s family contested this, but a longtime aide confirmed the affair. Dr Richard Rockefeller, son of David and nephew of Nelson, devoted his le to philanthropy, rather than banking or politics. Tragically, he died aged , when his plane hit fog and crashed outside Harrison, New York. The  flight had taken off from the nearby Rockefeller estate. Winston Churchill almost wrote the Rockefeller story. The future Prime Minister wrote more than  books, earning the  Nobel Prize for Literature.  But in the s, the Rockefellers asked Winston to write John D.’s authorized biography. But he wanted a , advance. Even the wealthiest family in the world wasn’t willing to pay it, so they hired a Columbia University historian instead. In , Nelsons fth son traveled to New Guinea. Michael C Rockefeller,  was photographer and trustee of the Museum of Primitive Art an hoped to bring an indigenous art collection back to New York. When his boat overturned, however, he tried to swim to shore and get help but despite a two-week search, he was never found. Although his official cause of death is drowning, many think he was eaten by a crocodile or shark. Some rumours suggested he made it to shore. And a month later, a Dutch priest spoke with men from the Otsjanep tribe, who admitted they killed a man who matched Michael’s description. They even showed the priest some bones. Rumours circulated that he had been eaten. John D. Rockefeller Sr.’s great-niece killed herself and her two daughters.

What will happen when the world’s population grows at a faster rate than the production of food  Fearing that millions of people could die of starvation, the recently graduated agronomist set out singlehandedly to find a solution. Moving from his home in Iowa, he set up camp in an abandoned agricultural research centre in Mexico’s Yaqui Valley, determined to use his scientic knowledge to tackle the scourge of world hunger. What he did next would change the future of humanity and has been credited with saving over a billion lives worldwide. And he would later be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of his contributions to world peace through ensuring the world had enough food.  “More than any other single person of this age, he has helped provide bread for a hungry world,” the Nobel committee said in presenting him with the Peace Prize in . “We have made this choice in the hope that providing bread will also give the world peace.” Norman arrived in Mexico in , desperately worried about what he predicted would be millions of people dying of malnutrition and starvation because there would soon not be enough food to go around. “These places I’ve seen have clubbed my mind - they are so poor and depressing,” he wrote to his we, who he had left behind in Iowa. “I don’t know what we can do to help these people, but we’ve got to do something.” The scientist, who had studied forest and plant pathology at the University of Minnesota,  had taken up a challenge set by the Cooperative Mexican Agricultural Program to improve wheat production, sponsored by the Mexican government and the Rockefeller Foundation.    He was supposed to work in the south of the country, where wheat had to be sown in spring and harvested in autumn. But he wanted to experiment with a dferent climate, which would also let him sow in autumn and harvest in spring, so decided to base himself in the disused and overgrown Yaqui Valley Experiment Station, even though he didn’t have permission to work in the region. It meant that as Norman set about planting dferent ieties of wheat, noting their traits and crossing the good ones in an attempt to produce a new iety which resisted disease and had a better yield, he had to survive without electricity, sanitation or running water. He admitted in a later book about his le that “ often appeared to me that I had made a dreadful mistake in accepting the position in Mexico”. But his persistence paid off, and within a few years he had developed new a dwarf wheat iety that could produce large amounts of grain, resist diseases, and resist lodging — the bending and breaking of the stalk by the wind that often occurs in high-yielding grains. Through further tests, he worked out how to maximise their yield - how far apart to plant them, how deep, with how much fertiliser, and how much water they needed.    In the s he set about travelling around the world to convince the countries he knew needed to increase their food production, such as India and Pakistan, to start planting his new breed of wheat. At about the same time the world started waking up to the prospect of food insecurity. In  an explosive book, The Population Bomb, by biologist Paul Ehrlich, warned that populations were growing more quickly than food supplies, predicting that “hundreds of millions of people are going to starve to death”. It was also predicted that most of the population of the entire Indian subcontinent would be dead before . That they didn’t, and the world has managed to keep food production in line with population growth, has been credited to Norman and his tireless work to help developing countries increase their food production. He started in Mexico itself, where within years farmers were harvesting much larger yields of wheat, especially because the new plant allowed two crops to be grown per year in dferent agro-ecological zones. Then, during the s, he worked closely with scientists in Pakistan and India to improve wheat productivity and food security in South Asia.  Thanks to Norman’s efforts, between  and  the wheat yields of developing countries trebled - averting the starvation disaster Ehrlich and other scientists had predicted. Similar work followed on corn and rice, and was dubbed the “green revolution”. He also contributed to efforts against deforestation, developing the “Borlaug hypothesis” to argue thatproduction could be increased on existing farmlands, then deforestation would decrease as they would be less need to clear woods to create new farmland. And in the early s, as African countries began to experience famine, he set up the Sasakawa Africa Association to increase production of other crops, such as sorghum and cowpea, again helping to save lives. It is believed that about half the world’s population today goes to bed every night after consuming grain developed by Norman.

Yakutsk, in Siberia, is sweltering in C heat. It is a far cry from the heights of winter, when it can drop to dangerously low temperatures. Yakutsk is built on permafrost in eastern Russia, but is bizarrely hotter than Yemen. The unusual heat wave in vast diamond-rich Yakutia region, with straddles the Arctic, sent locals scurrying to the “world’s most unusual beach” - a glacier, to chill on the ice. This “hidden gem” lies in a deep valley some  miles south of Yakutsk surrounded by pristine pine forests and lush green meadows.    Others dashed to the closer city beach on the Lena River which just three months ago was rock solid with ice so thick that heavily-laden lorries use it as a winter roadway. But colourful Buluus glacier - almost four square miles in size - proved more refreshing, according to locals. ‘This is for real, your eyes are not failing you, it’s ice,’ wrote local woman Zhanna Myasnikova as she shared pictures of herself enjoying the refreshing day at the glacier. ‘The Buluus glacier is a fantastic place to be in the middle of summer when the air heats to over C.    ‘By the end of summer the ice melts a bit, but comes winter and it gains strength again. ‘This is a thousand-year long fight between ice and fire.’ Another local called Aitalina posted: Where  would you find a place with so many contrasts  “The feeling of breathing cold air, touching chilly ice and drinking amazingly tasty cold water from the glacier on such a hot day is unforgettable.” Yakutia - officially known as the Sakha Republic - covers a swathe of Siberia and geographically is almost as large as India.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead golf club champions","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowRoss Sinclair, pictured above left, is the  Lochgilphead Golf Club men#s champion.The handicap champion is David Sinclair, above right, and "},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

Peter O#Neil edged out Penrice in race one, but Penrice would take his revenge in race two and it was all to play for in the final encounter.

Sam would be the victor followed by Andy and a consistent Keith Stanford third.For the youth class it was a day of mixed fortunes and consistency would be the key, with Jordan Graham coming out on top ahead of James Forrest and picking up a superb third overall was Rhys Brown.Pre- action would see committee man and track builder Grant McClure and his Maico, with three decades of riding under his belt, become the overall winner ahead of Callum Wilson on the superbly prepared Honda.The Twinshock under cc event would be a three race win for the flying Calum Kilgour and his cc Yamaha ahead of Jim Grieve, who would have some bike issues but would bring home his Honda in second fighting off a very persistent David Lawson and Gordon Peterson but it would be Gordon that would hold the third place trophy with some consistent riding.The Twinshock open class event would be a spectacular sight as cc Hondas and Maicos battled their way around the bracken.In race one there was a very small gap between first and second place and a similarly small gap between third. Brian Alexander would take the win from Craig ‘Smitch’ Smith, and John Crawford would come home in third with a notable mention to the very unlucky Paul Chiappa who had his fair share of misfortunes throughout the day, as his seat was torn from his bike at the top of one of the steep climbs. The overall would end up the same as the first race with Brian, taking the win from Craig Smith and John Crawford bringing the big Honda home in third.In the over s class it was a triumphant day for John Lamont with three resounding victories. Johnny Rutherford was second, a great result for the club sponsor, with David Watson bringing home the Honda with some consistent rides.For the group three races Robert Bell took the honours from Allan Shields and Bryan Colligan, all of these riders deserving a notable mention and with some very similar lap times and some quick racing in trying conditions.The clubman class was great to watch, with some fast up-and-coming riders such as Peter Rennie, Callum Laird and Stuart Wilson all angling for the win. Rennie would take the overall from Laird in second and  Wilson in third.The evolution class was again the Paul and Tom show. In what must have been the fastest racing all day, it would be Paul #PJ# Johnston who would take overall honours with three wins and Tom Grant would take the runner-up slot followed home ably by a consistent Roy Potts taking the third place.In the final block of racing it would be a win apiece for Jordan McDonald, Shaun Robertson, and John Kenny, but it would be the ever improving Shaun Robertson, ing from injury, who would take overall honours from a rapidly improving John Kenny in second and #Mr Consistent# Karl Livingstone in third.Results:Group Pre- class:  Grant McClure  Callum Wilson.

Apart from the cones on the street, we never had any issues with bad parking or disturbance from people attending the event.ldquoI could hear some music on the evenings but I liked the atmosphere and it certainly wasnrsquot a nuisance. We did attend the family ride on the Sunday, and while there was plenty of mud, I thought theyrsquod done a great job creating such a big event in its first year in Innerleithen.With the proposed plans to redevelop the old mill to create the Mountain Bike Innovation Centre, Tom added: ldquoI think its exciting times to be a resident in Innerleithen and I hope events like these continue to grow and do well here.ldquoI remember when Innerleithen was a poor cousin to Peebles and Glentress as an MTB and tourist destination, and I think itrsquos the hard work of local people who have brought Innerleithen to the fore. Most people are excited about the prospects and possible future developments here, and Irsquod hate people to get the wrong impression of the overall community support based on the reported views of a few people who were disturbed in the eventrsquos first year.ldquoHaving said that, I hope the organisers take on board the negative feedback and incorporate improvements into any future events.

Niels resides in Calornia where he plays golf on the college circuit but he was raised in Campbeltown where his mum still works in the local hospital.He has been a member of Machrihanish Golf Club for  years since the age of four. Always a very promising junior, Niels announced his arrival in style at the championship on Saturday.His round began rather innocuously with a bogey five at the world-famous first hole. However, he followed that bogey by birdieing the second, third and fourth holes to take him to two-under-par through four.Another birdie on the eighth took him out in  shots, three under par.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"letter open letter to dog owners","story":"While responsible dog owners take care to ensure their dogs are under control at all times, there are still a number who do not # and seem unaware of the potential consequences of their actions.There has been a disturbing rise in the number of sheep and other livestock attacks, and we are hoping to enlist your help in raising awareness of dog #worrying# which will, in turn, assist the authorities, farmers and land-users.If a dog worries livestock on any agricultural land the owner, or person in charge of the animal at the time, is guilty of a criminal offence.Section  of the DogsAct  defines #worrying# as:Such incidents cause distress to the animals and often lead to them being injured and or killed.

It is better than some human beings are treated ndash that is the sad truth.Mr Farnsworth was presenting an annual report on the racecoursersquos performance over the last financial year.The Beast from the East snow storm, an outbreak of equine influenza, and a long spell of dry weather all contributed to what he described as one of the worst years the course had been through in his memory.A number of key fixtures were cancelled and profits fell.In December, four horses died during one day of racing at the course but a subsequent review by the British Horseracing Authority ruled that the course and race organisers were not at fault.Councillor Gordon Mackett asked Mr Farnsworththe racecourse had been affected by animal welfare concerns.The course manager said: ldquoWe did have a horrible day when there were four fatalities however, these were all completely separate incidents.ldquoIn a sport like this you will get injuries and fatalities from time to time. It is horric for the people involved.Mr Farnsworth said that the public were becoming more aware of incidents like these through social media which, he said, ldquofuelled the debate around animal welfare.However, he said there had been no indication that it had had an impact on events at Musselburgh, which saw record crowds at its Easter Day racing this year and another sell-out Ladies Day.His report to the committee revealed that the racecourse had reported a loss over the last financial year after it paid over pound, of legal costs relating to the ongoing process by East Lothian Council to find new third-party operators to run the course.Councillor Kenny McLeod questioned why the costs were being met by the course and not the council itself.However, depute chief executive of the council Alex McCrorie told the councillor that the costs were charged to the racecourse because when the new operator was procured it would be the racecourse that benefitted.He conceded to Mr McLeod that, without the legal costs being taken from the coursersquos funds, it would have been in profit last year.East Lothian Council replaced the previous governance committee which oversaw the running of the course with a new committee last year after relations between members of the old committee badly deteriorated and the British Horseracing Authoritythreatening to suspend its racing licence.The new Musselburgh Racing Associated Committeendash which is made up of four elected councillors and two representatives of the racing industry, currently members of Lothians Racing Syndicate ndash has been overseeing the hunt for a new operator.However, the BHA has only granted temporary licences and extensions under the new committee as it continues to monitor its performance.Mr Farnsworth said that the introduction of the new interim committee had caused some problems too.

I have heard many dferent versions of this tale, and most recently come across one version in a book by Taffy Thomas, who is a renowned storyteller. Here is my version of the story, which I have titled lsquoThe Riddle Rulersquo:IT WAS to be the final race of the tournament. The two knights had been equally matched, and now they would race each other for the prize of a gold cup filled with gold coins.There was an air of excitement as the crowds gathered for this race. Sir John and Sir Harry arrived together, each mounted on their stallions. Sir Johnrsquos horse was called Lightning, while Sir Harryrsquos horse was named Spear.They were equally matched, both knights had won an equal amount of races, and both had won against each other. There was no favourite, everyone knew this race would be very close.The atmosphere was electric with anticipation.Then the kingrsquos storyteller leaned over to whisper in the kingrsquos ear: ldquoYour majesty, this race is the last of the tournament. I feel it should be a race with an extra challenge, so that the crowd are better pleased.The king agreed, but asked the storyteller what he thought the extra challenge should be.ldquoThe race should be a test of the knightsrsquo wits as well as their riding ability, replied the storyteller. ldquoSet them a riddle rule and see how they solve it.ldquoAnd what is the riddle rule to be  asked the king.The storyteller smiled: ldquoDeclare the rules of this race to be thus: the horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and coins for its owner.And so the king declared the riddle rule just before the beginning of the race: ldquoThe horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and gold for its owner.There was a murmuring amongst the spectators. The knights looked at each other, thinking.When the starter flag was lowered and the king cried ldquogo, both knights stayed at the starting line. ldquoYou go first, said Sir John to Sir Harry. ldquoNo, after you, said Sir Harry to Sir John. But neither knight was willing to leave the start line lest they be deemed to be first.Soon there were boos and clapping from the crowd, but the prize was too great for either knight to risk going first.ldquoThis race is no fun, said the king to the storyteller, annoyed now that hersquod agreed to the change in rules.ldquoGive them until this afternoon to find a way to race, replied the storyteller, ldquothere is a way but they must discover it. It will challenge their wits and also their riding skills.And so the king stood: ldquoThe race is postponed until pm this afternoon. The knights must find a way to race to the riddle rule, otherwise the prize will be forfeited.For the rest of the day there was an excited buzz as people began to discuss possible solutions to the riddle rule with the knights.ldquoWhy donrsquot you agree to cross the finish line together  was one suggestionldquoBut then they would be equal first and the prize would be lost, commented another.ldquoBesides, said Sir John, ldquoI do not trust Sir Harry not to pull his horse back at the last moment. ldquoI do not trust you either, said Sir Harry.The deadline was fast approaching and no solution to the riddle rule had been found.ldquoPerhaps being first is more important than winning the gold, said an old woman.The knights looked at each other, thinking about this. Then they both said ldquonaw and shook their heads.It was  minutes before the race and a child came up to the knights and said: ldquoI have an idea. Everyone looked down at the child and laughed. How could a poor child know the answer when the knights themselves and all the spectators were scunnered But the storyteller was walking by and overheard the laughter. ldquoChildrenrsquos wisdom is not to be laughed at, he scolded them.And so the knights asked the child for the solution.The child said two words to the knights.In a flash, the knights got mounted and prepared to race. When the starter flag was lowered and the king shouted ldquogo, both Sir John and Sir Harry raced as fast as they could, each being desperate to be first across the finish line. Their riding skills were well challenged by this race.Who won does not matter in this story. What matters are the two words that were said by the child. They were the answer to the riddle rule, and so made the race possible.What were those two words If you havenrsquot already worked it out then re-read the story carefully.

We are all engaging more online, but the conversations are getting shorter and colder.ldquoThese conversations would be more positive and productivewe could host them in a social context.ldquoWhatrsquos needed is a lsquoFaceFaceBookrsquo where the digital world is used to increase the physical interaction.They have suggested that a large screen cover the back of the building behind the stage that could act as a cinema screen, a digital backdrop to a theatre show and a space for presentations and gaming competitions.Although it is only in the very early stages of planning, the concept was well received by the community council, with member Ferhan Ashiq saying that he was ldquovery impressed with the bold and innovative idea.The community council has the option to either lease or buy the Town Hall from East Lothian Council, and this decision has not been officially made yet but will be the next step that is taken, discussing a business plan and the terms of the transfer with the local authority.The approach is laid out in the strategy, which states that the community council will ldquoreview the best practice from where and arrange research visits to similar facilities.

History is the way we view and see things that happened in the past. That view is limited by a number of factors. The availability of surviving records and evidence is one.The vast majority of what happened in the past is inevitably lost to us. This is true even for our own personal memories. So history is the small tip of the iceberg of events and times gone by, brought to the surface by the survival of some accounts more than others.And these records are never unbiased. Often historical records and evidence are purposely partial, influenced by ideology and personal allegiances. But all are biased in some way, as the limited viewpoint and interests of those recording events is based on their experience or motives.As a result, we can only see historical events through a narrow keyhole, with most characters and goings on out of view. Itrsquos the common people who are most always invisible in history. Our own ideological preference and belief in what is important will then affect how we interpret the limited evidence we have.This is why history is often subject to furious debate, and rightly so. Irsquod say itrsquos almost impossible not to allow our own perspectives, interests and values to influence the way we interpret the broader meaning of historical events and their signicance for contemporary society.Such a debate is being had in East Lothian just now, as to the name of the new town to be built on the Blindwells site, between Prestonpans and Longniddry and just to the north of Gladsmuir and Tranent.The name can be romantically translated to mean lsquohidden springsrsquo and it was across this once-marshy ground that the Jacobites crept stealthily at night to mount a surprise attack on the Redcoats on September , . That famous battle lasted  minutes and was a victory for the Jacobites, and the launchpad of Bonnie Prince Charliersquos march into England.Consequently, the Scottish Battlefields Trust has submitted a petition, as reported in the Courier last week, to name the new community Charlestoun and build a statue of Charles.When I was at school, he seemed a dashing and heroic figure. The songs and stories about him are infectious and I totally understand how the stories told about him have created a romantic and thrilling image.But then I studied the topic in more depth, at both university and afterwards. The period has suffered from the romantic treatment but there are fascinating stories of loyalty and sacrice to a man who, in reality, saw the common people chiefly as cannon fodder for his personal and family ambitions.It is for this reason I feel there are enough name places and statues to aristocratic and powerful men whose main historical role was to make and wage war, evenhe has a famous and romantic reputation.This is not to say we shouldnrsquot remember the fascinating history of the area, including that fateful day of battle when the Jacobites crossed the land.But itrsquos how we commemorate it and who we include. What makes the Jacobite period truly fascinating is the tapestry of stories of the many people involved, on both sides. It was a brutal time, in which there was certainly deep loyalty on both sides, but there were many other reasons why people found themselves on one side or the other. It was a brutal civil war, brought on by the aspirations of the exiled Stuarts.Do we commemorate the memory of the man who caused that war or do we commemorate those who were caught up in it  Is it really the case thatwe do the former we do the latter  Irsquom not convinced.There are other stories to consider of course for the site. There was coal mining there for generations. The lives of mining families, men, women and children who toiled in horric conditions, still remains mostly unheralded by history. Maybe itrsquos not lsquoromanticrsquo enough. Likewise with farming, which was a constant economic activity in the area for generations.There was also another unusual underground activity on the site after the early mine closed. Smugglers made an illegal whisky still deep down in the mine shaft once it was disused. It took a while for the customs men to realise East Lothian had an illicit whisky-making enterprise deep below ground in the old mine workings. When they finally raided the mine, they found the still, but no sign of the makers of the whisky.

This was evident in the child-friendly aesthetic of Disney-like toy soldier unorms, comedygoose-stepping and Les Dawson-style musical timing ndash performed by men all clearly in robust health despite their advanced years, with the beetroot hue on their faces indicative of a burning internalpassion.Indeed, the jubilant onlookers could have lit cigarettes off the marchersrsquocheeksthey had so wished, an act perhapssymbolicof the undying torchflameof unionist fervourpassed on through countlessfuture generations.On evidence of this annual celebration of inherited reality tunnels, it will surely not be long until Orangefest ndash first and last held in  ndash makes a triumphantto George Square.

Ayrrsquos textile, wool, linen and shoemaking industries thrived for centuries afterwards. Crown funding provided by the Convention of Royal Burghs led to a lighthouse being built on the River Ayr in , a quay in  and also paid for much-needed repairs to the harbour and High Tolbooth. The CRB then installed street lighting for all ndash but little did they know that  years later a shameful display of open rebellion would cast the town back to the dark ages!After the procession in Glasgow, it was no surprise to hear that one of these so-called Bravehearts ndash many sporting battle re-enactment outfitsndash ended up on social media spouting a crude torrent of foul language, accusing a small gathering of pro-unionists of being female genitalia with unionist affiliations.And unlike the Orange Order, who have always worked closely with the council and police, the AUOB organisers apparently refused to apply for a licence or take out public liability insurance, claiming their ldquopeaceful rallies havenrsquot experienced any issues that required such legalities! Clearly then, it is somehow perfectly acceptable for nationalists to shout loudly about womenrsquos genitals in Ayr ndash but heaven forbid you are a loyal servant of Her Majesty doing the same thing in Glasgow while simply trying to maintain Order!And finally...YOU might be aware of yet another march that took place on the same day ndash Pridein London.

Such artacts are on display at the Peoplersquos Palace, and  Gallowgate only adds to the collection.In other ways  Gallowgate marches to its own tune, eschewing copycat menus. Its offering manages to be original, yet it fits its setting and location: simple, unfussy dishes, forgotten classics, such as corned beef hash, at reasonable prices that are realistic for its neighbourhood.Everything that reasonably can be is made in the kitchen, apart from the sourdough bread from the Freedom Bakery, and only ace bakers could better that. But the kitchen cures its own salt beef, we discover, as we kick off with the meaty, peppery salt beef fritters perched on frills of amiably mild sauerkraut, napped by punchy Reuben sauce and melting cheese.  Gallowgate clearly isnrsquot immune to cooking trends though. On todayrsquos specials menu therersquos caullower, pale-roasted, in a tumble of mint leaves, pea shoots, soft soaked raisins, toasted pine kernels, and grated Manchego cheese with perhaps a bit of sherry vinegar in its dressing, an idea I intend to steal for home cooking purposes.Boiled gammon and buttered cabbage with spring onion mash  Itrsquos got to be well done, or itrsquos dull. But this ham is a dream, not too salty, with a pale pink blush, it disintegrates in the mouth. The scallions, and a generous dosage of butter, make the mash unctuous the cabbage, Savoy Irsquod say, glistens with even more butter. No complaints from me on that last point.For pound, our hot salt beef sandwich is a steal. Our second chance to taste the succulent, well balanced cured beef, to appreciate just how well that Freedom Bakery bread with its tangible, but not overly chewy, crust works brilliantly in this context. Pickled cucumber spikes the meat and bread with vinegary sharpness while creamy horseradish lubricates it. Out of curiosity we have ordered a side of vinegar peas, another historical homage: back in the day they used to be sold to the Barrowland crowds from a whole in the wall eatery next door. Actually, these are broad beans, and a couple is enough for me, but they come with more sourdough and a pat of French butter. For pound, wersquore not complaining.Our servers are jolly and their enthusiasm for the deep fried custard, which turns out to be more like a doughnut with a custard core, is infectious. But wersquore more smitten with the rhubarb and ginger crumble, its deep layer of stem ginger-spiked fruit, its knobbly, crunchy topping.The people who opened  Gallowgate seem to get old Glasgow, its mood, its character, it value.

It has featured in films like Bonnie Prince Charlie, with the unlikely David Niven in the role in , The Master of Ballantrae with Erroll Flynn , Highlander and even the Bond movie The World is not enough. Itrsquos a staple of dozens of Bollywood movies too, soyoursquore visiting and see a group of dancers in brightly-coloured dhoti practising their steps yoursquove come to the right place.The castle was a stronghold of the Clans Mackenzie and McRae from the th Century before it was destroyed, in , by the Royal Navy in the Jacobite rebellion. Three ships anchored up and bombarded the castle and the clansmen and their Spanish allies for three days, reducing the place to rubble and taking dozens of prisoners. It lay as an empty ruin for more than  years until John MacRae-Gilstrap bought the pile in  and set about restoring it. So what you see today is a modern-day rendition although, fortunately, sans breeze blocks and polystyrene. It is now owned by a charitable MacRae family trust and the , visitors a year undoubtedly provide the upkeep.Scotland surely must have more castles per acre than any other country, and certainly per head of population, with around  and counting ndash more than the population of Aberfeldy or Drumnadrochit ndash although some are no more than relics of the past, hardly a stone upon a stone. Therersquos not agreed definition of a castle ndash every Englishmanrsquos home is one after all ndash but itrsquos generally accepted that it has to be a fortied structure built in the Middle Agesby a ruler or noble. One who was generally carnapcious, didnrsquot get on with his neighbours and had hundreds of serfs of clans people to provide the wherewithal, a bit like Historic Environment Scotland today.The latest castle to come up for private sale is Bardowie, eight miles from Glasgow, an A-listed, eight-bedroomed property with a walled garden, tennis court, jetty and frontage to the eponymous loch, which is a mere puddle in water terms. It was built in  and was a stronghold of the Galbraiths and passed on to the Hamiltonrsquos of Bardowie.Its more recent history is that it was owned by Jack Black ndash not the Rock School star or it would be no more than sandstone dust now ndash but the other one, the one who charges thousands to make motivational speeches. He used to be a social worker in Glasgowrsquos East End so he must wake up every day, even before he makes up a pithy epithet, to thank his lord he escaped the snotty weans and junkies.To quote the guru: ldquoThe greatest gt in le is the ability to think great thoughts and have the strength to take action so that those thoughts become reality in this wonderful and abundant world.Er, moving on it seems that Jack sold the castle at the end of  and the present owner is Glasgow vegetable dealer Alex Faithfullthrough his company Bardowie Holdings.

It was King David  who introduced them and encouraged Norman and French nobles to settle here, in an attempt to establish royal power throughout the country.Robert the Bruce must also take credit,thatrsquos the proper term, for what became known as ldquoslighting, that is capturing castles and destroying their fortications, which he did systematically, after wresting them from English control and presumably slaughtering the survivors. He even destroyed his own ones, at Ayr and Dumfries, Roxburgh and Edinburgh rather than allow them to be retaken by the English.When gunpowder was invented and guns and cannons evolved in the th century the design of castles changed, to the look we expect today, bombardment resistant walls, letter box gun ports and s to mount artillery.

And Mr Wilson always knows when it is going to get bad, a day or two after the heavens open.There had been no history of flooding on the property on Eastfield Avenue, where Mr Wilson has lived for  years. What changed  The Hawthorn Estate was built.Murray Wilson in his cellar, picture by Colin MearnsJust up the a brae from his semi are neat rows of tightly packed new-build white homes. This used to be a grassy, partially wooded hill. Now it is asphalted over.Everybody knows this is where the water comes from. Mr Wilson, clutching a small plastic container, explains how. ldquoThis is dye, he says. ldquoWorkers came and poured in to drains up in the Hawthorn estate. And, sure enough, it eventually turned up here.The hill acted ldquolike a sponge, Mr Wilson says. ldquoIt was a natural green belt. I never thought there would be houses on it because it was a slope.Barratt was the builder. They have been trying to fix snagging on their drains for years. Things, Mr Wilson says, are getting better. The flooding is not as extreme was it once was.FULL STORY:Thousands of Scots in legal limbo as roads unadoptedThe local council, South Lanarkshire, has not been, so far, impressed. Officials have sucked their teeth and told Barratt they will not ldquoadopt the roads until the drainage problems are solved.How Mr Wilson pumps out his cellarWhich means that a decade after the white houses went up, the roads, Hawthorn Way and Hawthorn Avenue, are still the responsibility of the builder, not the council.These streets are among hundreds in Scotland stuck in a legal limbo between developers and councils.Mr Wilson is also in a kind of limbo. He does not want to sell his home. But he could not do so evenhe did.ldquoThere would need to be a home report and they would see all this, he says, waving at goods stacked on pallets to keep them dry. ldquoThe floor has all eroded through the water. ldquoThe new Hawthorn EstateBut Mr Wilson has sympathy for neighbours whose streets are not adopted. In England similar issues have hit house prices and left whole communities with substandard services. In Scotland - where there are thought to be some , new homes on streets still to be adopted - the issues has barely been recognised.Mr Wilson says: ldquoThroughout Scotland there are lots of people who buy a house and think everything is fine, the drainage is fine and the road is adopted.ldquoBut then - lo and behold - it turns out they are not because they have not submitted the proper drawings or it is not fit for purpose.FULL STORY:Thousands of Scots in legal limbo as roads unadoptedThere is hope of a resolution in the Cambuslang case. Gordon Mackay, Head of Roads and Transportation at South Lanarkshire Council, told The Herald ldquoWe are in dialogue with Barratt Homes and Scottish Water in an attempt to have them resolve the outstanding deficiencies in the drainage system that would allow Hawthorn Way and Hawthorn Avenue to be adopted. We are currently awaiting confirmation that necessary remedial works have been satisfactorily completed.Hawthorn EstateDavid Scott, managing director, Barratt West Scotland said: ldquoWe are working with Scottish Water and South Lanarkshire Council to resolve offsite works to improve the drainage, which will hopefully be completed by year end, allowing the local authority to take ownership of the roads affected.

So more than ,likely to be with an adoption problem.\"Ever since  Scottish councils have taken over privately built roads from housing developers - as long as they meet standards.Public sector insiders stress that adoption can be a long and drawn-out process as roads officials pressurise developers to get their streets up to scratch.Cash-strapped councils already have a huge backlog in roads and lighting repairs and do no want to take on extra work and costs that should have been done by private builders.Getting precise figures on how many people or homes are affected by non-adopted roads is almost impossible.That is because dferent councils count the issue in dferent ways. Glasgow, for example, as of , had  development sites were roads were not adopted. Neighbouring East Dunbartonshire had  developments with around  homes. Falkirk, again as of , had one road that was still to be adopted  years after it was built.This is on top of the many pre- private roads already scattered across Scotland - where homeowners are expected to pay the upkeep.Stewart Turner, of the Ayrshire Roads Alliance, chairs the Society of Chief Officers of Transportation in Scotland. He said: \"Owners of private roads may request that their road be adopted by the roads authority and provided this road joins the public road and it is to a standard acceptable to the roads authority, then it would be adopted.\"Also roads authorities may ask the frontagers of private roads to make improvement and they may,they consider appropriate, contribute to this cost. \"Throughout Scotland the ious Roads Authorities have a dferent approach to this power.\"However taking into account the Roads Authoritiesrsquo primary responsibility to maintain the public roads then it is considered important that the available resource is directed to the public roads. Additional financial resource would be required to improve the extensive private road network.\"Mr Sutton has been in a y correspondence with the Scottish Government over what he sees as its failure to keep track of the scale of the issue.A spokesman for the government said: \"We do not collect information on roadsrsquo adoption status, as that is a matter for local authorities, who are responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of roads they have adopted.\"Un-adopted or private roads are the responsibility of housing developers or private home owners, who should consult their relevant local authority on adoption arrangements.\""},{"url":null,"title":"sophy-ridge-andrew-marr-sunday-politics-scotland-review","story":"First to come a cropper was Sky News journalist Niall Paterson, standing in for a holidaying Sophy Ridge. The Scot, from Alloway, had clearly not read Sunday Breakfast Show Presenting for Dummies.We know this because at ., an hour before the show was due to start, he had spilled ketchup down the front of his trousers. How did we know  Because a helpful colleague had posted a video of Paterson frantically trying to clean the stain.The lesson of the story was: thou shalt not have breakfast while wearing your on air outfit. It was his birthday, too. Happily, there was a change of fortune on the way with guest Gina Miller gting Paterson a scoop. Miller was the businesswoman who ensured the UK parliament had its say before the Brexit process could begin. She was now ldquoreassembling her legal team, which made them sound like The Avengers, to fight any attempt to prorogue parliament to force through a no-deal Brexit.A letter had been sent last Thursday to Boris Johnson, she revealed, telling him that suspending parliament would be an abuse of a Prime Ministerrsquos powers and as such would provoke legal action.The face on which egg had been liberally smeared belonged to Neil Basu, the assistant commissioner of the politan Police, who suggested journalists could be prosecuted for publishing leaked documents. The Sunday papers were outraged, and television then picked up the baton, with almost every guest asked to choose a side between the plucky, freedom defending media or the police. No-one chose the latter.The weekrsquos other main story, the continuing row over antisemitism in Labour, was chewed over again. On Sophy Ridge on Sunday, Dame Margaret Hodge said she felt ldquodevastated on watching the Panorama programme featuring eight whistleblowers from the party. Why not just quit, Paterson asked. Dame Margaret said her relationship with Labour had been like a marriage: while the last three years had been terrible, she had had  years of complete happiness.Paterson continued the marriage theme by saying that finding out your other half was antisemitic might be considered reasonable grounds for orce.Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry was in a similarly mournful mode on The Andrew Marr Show. ldquoNobody can pretend that there isnrsquot an ongoing problem within the Labour Party about antisemitism, about our processes for dealing with it, she said.: Scottish Labour attackedLike Dame Margaret, she thought it was wrong to set lawyers on the whistleblowers. ldquoWe shouldnrsquot be going for the messengers, we should be looking at the message.On Marr, the editor of The Spectator, Fraser Nelson, said Labour was in a state of civil war, split between Jeremy Corbyn and the membership on one side and Tom Watson and MPs on the other. ldquoThey are going to go at each other all summer.

Given she had now accepted no-deal Brexit as an option, having previously voted against, Marr wanted to knowthis was an elegant pivot towards reality or a screeching careerist U-turn. In the dayrsquos most unsurprising answer, Ms Rudd said it was the former. She had changed her mind because the circumstances had changed. Marr then reminded her that she had once said another referendum was preferable to a no deal.

Could Marr take it that she would not serve in a Johnson cabinet ldquoIrsquom fighting for a Cabinet for Jeremy Hunt. While that is still the case I donrsquot think we should speculate on the alternative candidate.Marr then teased her with a Tweet from MP Nick Boles, which said: ldquoSo she will let Boris Johnson drive her home after all ndash so long as itrsquos in a ministerial limo. Mr Boles had later softened, saying that Ms Rudd brought ldquohumanity to government and that he hoped she stayed, whoever won. ldquoHersquos a generous spirited fellow, Marr agreed.It was left to Gordon Brewer on Sunday Politics Scotland to cut through the static and find out something that mattered to the majority of people watching.: Supplies cannot be guaranteedHis main guest was Michael Russell, Scotlandrsquos Constitutional Relations Secretary, who said that in the event of a no deal Brexit he could not guarantee the supply of essential medicines.Arrangements had been in place for a March  departure, but London had yet to finalise its preparations for October , he said.Not that he wanted that to be the major takeaway from politics this weekend.

Itrsquos too much. I know that now but itrsquos a bit late.He is, though,chairman of his hometown football club, Cowdenbeath FC, but admits there is ldquono pleasure in the role, adding: ldquoIf you look to see the record of Cowdenbeath... you will see that this is another burden I have to carry around with me.He also says that everyone is entitled to a defence, but admits there is a downside to his position: ldquoIf you believe in the legal system, you believe that everyone is entitled to a defence. Then you canrsquot pick and choose.ldquoYou canrsquot say, lsquoWell, Irsquoll defend somebody who does this, but Irsquom not going to defend somebody who commits a sexual offence or a mass murder, or whatever, because thatrsquos just not right.\"You take on somebody whorsquos accused of crime and you defend them in respect of that crime.But he admits to finding it ldquodficult sometimes due to how up-close-and-personal his position takes him to mans inhumanity to man.One of his most successful defences was that of former gangster Paul Ferris, who in  was found not guilty of all seven charges against him, including that of murdering Arthur Thompson Jr.He also defended Mitchell, who in  was sentenced to le imprisonment for murdering his -year-old girlfriend, Jodi Jones, and Tobin. Now , he will die in jail, having been convicted of the murders of Angelika Kluk in Glasgow in , Vicky Hamilton in  and Dina McNicol in .Tobin also features in the Crime Files series, in which Professor Wilson, who grew up in Carluke, maintains the killer is also infamous Barras dance hall murderer Bible John.Findlay says: ldquoI do worry. I worry about what is happening during a trial. I tend to take work home with me, and after a trialthe client has been convicted then I worry that perhaps I could or should have done better.\"But during a trial you do see some pretty horrendous things. Manrsquos inhumanity to man is pretty endless and you just have to harden yourself and look as it as best as you can as a piece of evidence.ldquoBut some things I have looked at can be quite distressing, involving dead children and so on.As a seven-year-old in the s, it was reading about Manuel that lead him toward his career. The US-born serial killer, who moved to Uddingston, Lanarkshire, was convicted of murdering seven people across Lanarkshire and southern Scotland between  and his arrest in January , but is thought to have murdered two more.Earlier this year, Findlay narrated an audio book detailing the le of Manuel, who was taken to the gallows at Barlinnie in  after one of the most sensationalist trials in legal history that saw him sack his lawyers and conduct his own defence.When the -hour audio book, Manuel: Portrait of a Serial Killer, was released, Findlay said: \"The Manuel case fascinated me since I was a child. As a seven-year-old I read every word that was reported.\"The challenge of representing someone faced with so many serious charges is one of the reasons I became a defence lawyer.\"Findlay also says during the programme that the increasing use of science by prosecutors in court cases is a \"very real concern\", in part because some can form views by watching TV.He says: ldquoOne problem is, members of the public get a lot of their science from CSI: Miami and New York and all these kind of things. And thatrsquos not real. But thatrsquos the impression you get.ldquoPeople think itrsquos as simple as that but, of course, itrsquos not.

And it could soon be that would-be wizards wonrsquot be clothing themselves in wool at all as the company looks to make a switch away from animal fibres to plant-based or synthetic wools.Cashmere wool is a fibre obtained from special types of goats, rather than wool from sheep and lambs. Company director Keith Murray said that it was becoming increasingly problematic to source high-quality strands as much of the wool which claims to be cashmere is too poor quality to be sold in the UK.The firm has been cutting the amount it uses for a number of years, and now agreed with Peta that it was time to phase it out entirely.Mr Murray said: ldquoPeta get a bad rap, but they are decent enough people. They showed us their research and we have made a conscious decision that we wonrsquot go back to using cashmere.ldquoWe use British wool and it has to be the best quality possible, so it doesnrsquot make sense to use low-quality wool claiming to be cashmere any more.Lochaven, which is based in Stewarton, was set up by the Red Cross after the Second World War for employment of disabled former servicemen and over the years it has became part of the Haven products charity. But it lost its charitable status and the loss of a major customer saw it enter receivership in .Mr Murray, who previously specialised in helping distressed companies, noticed signed photos of the cast of Harry Potter during a visit to the factory, and found out Lochavenrsquos connection to the series. The firm had never marketed the products, and after a takeover, which saw all jobs saved, Mr Murray proceeded to take them down that road.Now Lochaven supplies garments to Warner Bros, which sells them via its website, and in upmarket retailers throughout Europe and Japan.The official Wizarding World theme park in Orlando began stocking Harry Potter knitwear in  ndash and dressing its staff in their outfits ndash and the Harry Potter studio tour at Leavesden studios in London followed in , then Diagon Alley Orlando and the Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Osaka, Japan, opened in .

This was a substantial commitment but was vital for Scotland’s long term interests, preparing ourselves for the challenges of an ageing population. We’ve recently extended free personal care to cover all those who are assessed as needing it, no matter their age.MSPs also charted a dferent course when, following a change of administration in , parliament voted to scrap tuition fees in Scotland, restoring Scotland’s long and proud tradition of free education.Similarly, the decision to abolish prescription charges brought to an end what was little more than a tax on ill health. The NHS of course is the greatest, and most valued, example of a universal service where care is provided on the basis of need and not ability to pay. Our health service, like others across the world, faces challenges. But it is a real achievement of the Scottish Parliament that we have resisted the marketization moves south of the border while ensuring that under the current government Scotland’s AE departments are the best performing in theUK.On other occasions, the Parliament has led the UK in making bold policy choices, such as the ban on smoking in public places. Our Climate Change Act includedthe most ambitious emissions reduction targets of any legislature in the world and, as Health Secretary, I was heavily involved in the campaign to introduce a minimum unit price for alcohol, which we knew would play a key role in tackling Scotland’s unhealthy relationship with drink – another world leading measure.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"As the Scottish Parliament prepares to celebrate its th anniversary, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on both its journey and her own.\"  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on  years of the Scottish Parliament viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"It took a decade of hard work to make this policy a reality and I am personally very proud of the campaign, working with stakeholders, to persuade MSPs to back minimum pricing, as well as overcoming a legal challenge that went all the way to the Supreme Court.I am personally committed to making sure every child and young person in Scotland gets the best possible start in le. We have already delivered an increase in free, high quality childcare for all three and four year olds and extending entitlement to eligible two year olds and will increase it further before the end of this parliament.Scotland has also become a much safer society under devolution. Recorded crime has fallen to some of the lowest levels seen since the s. In particular, non-sexual violent crime has fallen substantially, thanks in no small part to the excellent work of the Violence Reduction Unit, which was established over a decade ago with cross-party support and is now being copied across the UK.In recent years, new powers have come to the Scottish Parliament and with those powers come increased responsibilities for MSPs to deliver for the people ofScotland.Income tax policy is now a key feature of the annual Scottish budget. We’ve used these new powers to introduce a fairer income tax policy, with most people paying less tax than they would south of the border – while continuing to raise revenue to support investment in the economy and public services.Last year Parliament passed the wide-ranging Social Security Act, paving the way for devolution of a number of benefits, as well as creating a number of newbenefits such as increased carers’ support allowance and best start grants for families with young children – and a new social security agency to deliver them. This new agency has a culture of dignity and respect at its heart and early feedback from service users has been overwhelmingly positive.I also appointed the first gender balanced Scottish cabinet and we are encouraging more women to stand for parliament, and bring a better balance to ourpublic le.Over the course of the Scottish Parliament consistent action has been taken to ensure communities have the opportunity to own the land they live and work on.Many communities have benefited from the right to buy that now covers rural and urban communities.Of course, the foundation of our country is a strong and resilient economy. That’s why we have slashed or abolished business rates for , premises –saving almost £. billion for our small businesses.We have invested in our infrastructure with all governments building new schools and hospitals and, of course, the iconic Queensferry Crossing.And, to help make sure we have the workforce we need for years to come, we have delivered just over a quarter of a million Modern Apprenticeships in the lastdecade.In April this year, new legislation to tackle controlling and coercive behaviour came into effect, giving Scotland some of the most robust domesticabuse legislation in the world.I’m also proud of the many steps we’ve taken to make Scotland a fairer society, including the introduction of equal marriage rights – attending one of the first same-sex weddings in Scotland is a memory that will stay with me for a long time.And we all worked together over many years to help Glasgow successfully host the  Commonwealth Games. This helped to inspire Scots to get more active,delivered new facilities and put Scotland on the world stage. It was a sight to behold.My final achievement is perhaps harder to quanty. There is no doubt that the re-establishment of Scotland’s parliament has profoundly changed our political culture for the better, with our nation’s lawmakers much more accessible to those they represent. It has also enabled us to have conversations we wouldn’t have had and to debate our own future, with the  independence referendum generating an increase in democratic engagement.Looking ahead, we now face the signicant challenges posed by Brexit which, of course, Scotland’s people and parliament overwhelmingly oppose. Given the long-term damage that Brexit will cause to Scotland, and the material change in circumstances this represents, I believe it is only fair that people are given the choice of whether to become an independent country. Indeed, the current SNP Government was elected on a clear manesto commitment that people should be offered that choice should Scotland be taken out of the EU against its will. Polls consistently show that people living here believe the decision on whether to hold a referendum should be a matter for Holyrood and not Westminster. Twenty years after it came into being, that is an important measure of the way people in Scotland view the Parliament and one that the new UK Prime Minister would do well to heed."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July ,  at : pmHighlands and Islands MSPs Jamie Halcro Johnston has joined Conservative colleagues in welcoming news that plans to introduce a sleeper service between Caithness and the Central Belt are gaining momentum.

And I understand that it is very unfortunate that this problem, while unrelated to the air traffic controllers’ industrial action, has coincided with it. However, that is not much consolation to frustrated users of the service.“The issue here is that this is a leline service and there are no alternatives for people who simply have to fly. Local people and businesses in the Northern Isles need a reliable service, and we simply cannot afford local service-levels to be reduced. We accept that we have to live with unavoidable weather events, but the recent disruptions have been workforce-related.“HIAL is a Scottish Government-owned organisation and one of the reasons for that is a recognition that it provides a strategically critical part of our transport infrastructure in the Highlands and Islands. It’s way past time for ministers to take a long hard look at the situation and reassure us that they are prepared to intervene on behalf of the travelling public.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The United States of America is a figment of our imagination. Russia is as real as the fake news that pours out on to the internet from within its fictional borders.However real they might seem, nation states belong in the realm of ideas, not tangible things, and John Lennon’s Imagine had it the wrong way round.OK, I admitTheresa May, Boris Johnson or whoever was to send a distinctly real British Army Challenger tank on to my front lawn and invite me to reconsider the non-existence of the United Kingdom, I most definitely would, might even start singing Land of Hope and Glory. Or at least try to, it would quite quickly descend into mumbling what I’d be hoping sounded like the words. But, thankfully, using the military to ensure the loyalty of its subjects runs counter to ideas about what the UK is all about. And ideas – such as, of course, nation states – can be powerful things. Good ideas have saved countless lives, just as bad ideas have ended them.Being ideas, countries can change and are probably always doing so, albeit usually in subtle, small ways that are barely noticeable but become apparent as time marches on. Some politicians today talk about British or Scottish values. In my book, this is a “categorisation error” and I’d much rather we talked about “democratic values”, but whatever values are held today in Scotland or the UK, they are very dferent to Victorian ones.There is no particular patch of planet Earth that must always be a liberal democracy – a haven of free speech, the rule of law and human rights – just as nowhere is eternally fated to languish in the grip of despotic rulers who think punishing people they don’t like with a lethal dose of nerve agent is a reasonable way to behave.So it is really important to keep up the pressure on whatever nation you happen to inhabit to move towards the light of freedom and away from sinister ideas that seem to have been re-emerging from the shadows in recent years.Here’s William McNeil, of the “hipster fascist” movement, Scotland for Generation Identity, attempting to explain to The Scotsman this week why his group did not promote a hateful, white supremacist ideology. “Anyone making this claim, intentionally or not, refuses to understand Identitarianism. It is not about skin colour, nor is it about anyone being better than another. All peoples have a right to preserve and promote their group identity in their homelands.”In case you don’t know, Generation Identity’s leader in Austria, Martin Sellner, exchanged emails with and accepted a donation of €, from Brendan Tarrant, the Australian charged over the murder of  people at two mosques in New Zealand in March. Sellner insists he doesn’t believe in violence, but clearly Tarrant was a fan.There are no dferent human “peoples” or races, these are ideas entirely invented by racists. Tarrant killed people at random simply because they were Muslim just as Isis killed Salford taxi driver Alan Henning – despite the pleas of Islamic scholars to spare the le of someone who went to Syria to deliver aid. Both Isis and Tarrant bought into the idea that their victims were so defined by their religion or their nation that they could be killed for that reason alone.For some self-described patriots, nationality plays just as strong a part in defining a human being as race does for racists or religion does for the most fanatical of religious bigots .In his short poem Patriot, the late Norman MacCaig – I first wrote that he was a “Scottish poet” but then decided to delete that bit – offered a dferent vision:My only countryIs six feet highAnd whether I love it or notI’ll dieFor its independenceThe Person’s Republic of Ian Johnston wholeheartedly agrees and, however tall we are, most of us know we are an inidual – insert the funny line from Monty Python’s Le of Brian here – even those prone to seeing others as nothing but the faceless members of some group of millions of people. Despite all this, I am happy to say that countries – even though they are just ideas – are very important. I’m also happy to pay my taxes and do all the things you are supposed to do as a citizen of the UK. However, nations are important as a unit of democracy, perhaps the fundamental unit of democracy. They help human beings organise themselves into large groups in which their rights as iniduals are protected. That’s what countries should do anyway. How big that group is, what territory it controls or who is a member should not be the main concern.But medieval ideas about nation states still persist.In the not-so-good-old days, kings who led armies to conquer were heroes. Those who questioned their power too much were traitors whose heads would likely end up on a spike. With no genuinely legitimate claim to power – the hereditary principle not being one – loyalty had to be enforced on pain of death. This is still true in today’s tyrannies.In countries that are liberal democracies, where iniduals agree to put people into power, knowing they can be removednecessary, strict penalties for treason are not necessary. As a criminal offence, it has all but died out in the UK. And yet, amid the passionate debates about Scottish independence and Brexit, bitter accusations of treason have been thrown about quite a lot.

And she’ll make a thing of the fact that she’s able to achieve these visits without the help of the Foreign Office.“The Foreign Office isn’t just for Westminster, it’s for the United Kingdom. Would they have tried to do that with [David] Trimble and [Martin] McGuinness [the leaders of devolved power-sharing in Northern Ireland]  Of course they wouldn’t.“My view is that it’s completely unnecessary and it simply creates a sense of grievance, and anyway she’ll get the visits, because the people on the other side of the Atlantic will be anxious to know what she’s about.”Campbell led the Lib Dem Home Rule Commission, reporting on the need to overhaul the UK’s constitution in .An update shortly before the independence referendum helped build momentum towards the creation of the Smith Commission in the wake of Scotland’s vote to stay in the UK, which resulted in signicant new tax and welfare powers being devolved to Edinburgh.The Lib Dem peer now sits on the steering committee of the cross-party Constitutional Reform Group, which has put forward its own proposals for a “new Act of Union”.Campbell said that after  years of devolution in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, England “needs a constitutional convention”.“The English have to decide what they want,” he said, going on to question the piecemeal approach to local devolution south of the border. “English local government – you need a PhD to understand it.”He revealed that Baroness Bryan, who is developing Labour policy on a “People’s Constitutional Convention” that Jeremy Corbyn says will lead to a federal UK, has met with him and examined the Constitutional Reform Group’s proposals.But Campbell said she faces a “pretty tricky job” with just nine months left to produce a report, and a single researcher supporting her.He called for Westminster to be “much more open minded” to a major overhaul of the constitution, but defended the Lib Dems’ refusal to take part in Scottish Government-organised citizens’ assemblies on new powers for Scotland unless independence is parked.“[The constitution] needs a root and branch approach,” Campbell said. “For that you’ve got to have co-operation on both sides of the argument.“If Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP say it’s independence or bust, then that makes it very dficult, but you can nonetheless say, park your independence for the moment, we understand that’s what you’re about, but we can have a sensible and logical discussion about how we improve the relationship ... The problem is that Joanna Cherry gave the game away because she said it’s leading to independence.”The Lib Dem peer said there was a “legalistic” case for the UK Government to retain devolved responsibilities ing from Brussels after Brexit, which are at the heart of the row between Edinburgh and London over claims of a “power grab”, and which saw the two governments face each other in the Supreme Court over rival Brexit legislation.But he is critical of how the UK Government went about resolving the dispute.“There’s a legalistic argument that Britain joined the EU, and Britain leaves the EU. Therefore those powers which were ceded to the EU come back to Britain … but they were so dog in the manger about it, and that of course was Theresa [May]. You can’t have seen Blair being so dyed in the wool about it.”And Campbell said the decision of the UK Government to press ahead with Brexit legislation without the consent of the Scottish Parliament, in breach of the Sewel convention, set an “uncomfortable” precedent.“We don’t have a written constitution in this country, people say. Well actually, we have a half written constitution becauseyou think about it, a huge amount of what we regard to be constitutional law, it’s by statute.“I think the marriage of statute and convention has been shown to be a rather uncomfortable one, particularly in the context of Brexit. Sewel is a very good example of that.”With critics in the SNP, Labour and the Conservatives all calling for the role of the Scotland Office to be reviewed and potentially abolished, Campbell defended Dover House.“There are strong administrative reasons for saying yes, and there are strong political reasons for saying no,” he said about eliminating the Scotland Office.“You can make the argument that, OK,there is a proper relationship between Edinburgh and London, then no, you don’t need it.“But you can equally make the argument thatthere is someone in London who’s in the tent … then you have the opportunity to influence events.”An SNP spokesperson said: “It is entirely legitimate for Scotland’s First Minister to speak to the views that she was democratically elected on, but withdrawing Foreign Office support did not impede on the plans of the First Minister’s visit to Europe.“Andthe Tories’ position is now that Scotland shouldn’t be afforded the same level of representation as the rest of the UK, then they are making our case for us – it shows how we need to be independent.“The Citizens’ Assembly will be an entirely independent body – a position that has been made clear by the Scottish Government and the co-convener of the Assembly. There remains plenty of opportunity for the Lib Dems to rediscover their liberal and democratic values and to support the assembly, however as it will be made up of citizens, the decision of any party to opt out will not impact on its success.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

If gted they may even go on to contribute with useful research and technological ideas so unlike are present green, ignorant and wholly ill-informed flock in thecouncil chamberAn area of industry which has not been looked into with any proper statistical information is thisof Agriculture. This industry produces more green house gases than the all of transportation. In fact, it is several times greater than transportation. The catch  scenario is this industry has had no regulation or legislation is regard to reducing greenhouse gases, infact, due to population growth, the pollution created by agriculture is vastly on the increase. Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well. It is a dilemma which will become more relevant as the population increases.I can assure you these bairns weren#t pushed into anything. They were toldthey wanted to go they had to complete a form. One of mine wanted to go, the other didn#t. One asked a question at the Town Hall and I am very proud # not that she had to protest # but that she had the courage to do so, and silence many there.Well done young folk # out of the mouths of babes as they say.It hardly takes any courage to join a protest, especially one being encouraged and congratulated onby so many folk! The courage comes from not following the crowd herd and forming an independent and educated view. Jumping headlong onto the bandwagon is easy, understanding the science and striving to do something about it the hard bit. Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid.Especially a meaningless strike from school, what child would not love a day off among mates  No doubt the pig ignorant and stupid will be so impressed. A bit like supergluing yourself tp a bus or train, outstanding!!!I didnt say it took courage to join a protest, I said it takes courage to speak at the Town Hall. Andit was about time off school, they all would have gone. Please have more respect for our bairns and young folk.And these bairns are, for your information, studying the stem subjects at school.It is not a case of having respect for the bairns, Johan Adamson. It is just a case of having absolutely no respect whatsoever for those who politicise them and drive them like sheep. Primary children used in a political strike!! Repulsive behaviour, you should be ashamed, so socialist, child exploitation is the words that come to mind.They had to complete a form, primary children! What next, form a political Union and become militant  Little Orwellian sheep bleating for the Pigs.These were AHS pupils Ian, not primary pupils, and no one has politicised them.Educated them yes, but then I forgot you have the monopoly on climate change education and stem subjects.The organisers were I think over , so young adults.The fact is I will always criticise revolting behaviourand ignorance and I am not referring to the children.Yes I do believe sixth year pupils are capable of organising thisWhy do you assume Ian that these bairns are not studying stem subjects and that only you know about climate change then Ian Infantile comments  Pot kettle springs to mind.Now just who printed these forms the children had to fill in  Which teachers OKed the strike and arrange for Brae and Aith schools also took part, as well as bairns from the Sound Primary School and organised and paid for transport  I do not believe that was AHS sixteen-year-olds for one second.Whether by accident or design this provides a very convenient fig leaf for the council#s lamentable performance on child poverty.Much was made of the #children#s march# at the SIC#s education committee meeting today however in a news report about the part of the same meeting that dealt with the council#s child poverty action report, it was clear that the council have done next to nothing since the Shetland Inequalities Commission reported in March .know. All these admirable young citizens are guilty of is taking a stand based on commonly accepted information. I could ask what special knowledge does Ian think he has that allows him to lord it over them# but nerves fail me.On Ian’s earlier point, it is self-evident thatwe need some people with a high level of competence in STEM subjects who can take critical stand on matters scientic. Gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included! Learners on this path can also become alert to common logical fallacies. Even those who like Ian, with a preference for physical sciences, can benefit. Happily don’t need to be much of a scholar to spot an ad hominem attack. With all due respect for Ian’s past achievements in the physical sciences, it would be nicehe could make his points without belittling others #kids included. That’s a normal standard “of decency and tolerance” btw.I so agree with these word #gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included!#. You do so hold yourself in such regard high Peter, now go glue yourself to a train or bus to prove your point!But just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of- #Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better!# It went on for five minutes without stopping. And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse ”.And what are you doing Ian to save the planet And what would you suggest the AHS and the SIC do Ad Hominem attacks # playing the man not the ball # are often used by those who don’t have much of an argument to begin with. Instead of dealing with whether the young people have a point or not, generous-spirited Ian opted to have a go instead.Logical fallacies show lazy thinking, masking an absence of creativity and independent thought. Ian’s trollswipe above looks Ad Hominem in approach st first, but he is also using the Tu Quoque Fallacy. This is where you accuse the opponent of hypocrisy to avoid answering their charge. Self-effacing Ian thus avoids addressing the possibility of his own hubris or lack of self-knowledge.Should I have made things easier for him and asked what his actual beef with the climate protestors was  He says “Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid”and demands that everyone should be able to answer “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ” before taking a view. Perhaps he will educate us by answering his own question # sticking to terms that demonstrate tolerance and decency of course. Nuclear Free Council, Declair Climate emergency,climate justice what a load of utter bunkum. Especially stop allowing political activists to exploit our children.I put forward the question : Is nuclear power the only solution to stop greenhouse gas emissions and the only way to stop climate change progressing further  It may be the worse case scenario in terms of our power demand solution, but what are the alternatives to our demand for energy without causing further environmental and ecological damage to the planet by in using fossil fuels or cleaner alternatives like wind or solar   It has been suggested the Sahara Desert could be used for solar energy to power Europe, but how much land would be required and could this be expanded  The alternatives to fossil fuels may be cleaner, but how would this affect global weather patterns or the depletion of species due to the destruction of natural habitats being replaced for energy production Very sadly the SG SNP has committed to wind energy with its catastrophic environmental damage and only intermittent supply, but that is the policy of the scientically ignorant and utterly stupid.Thank you for your comments, Ian. I fear humanity will have no choice but to go nuclear for its energy production in the future.Alternative resources, like wind or solar, may be the short term answer, but as mentioned, the downside to this is the large amount of land which will be required with the ability to vastly expand as demand increases. What would be the environmental damage and the destabilization of le on the planet have in the long term with such technologies  There is also the issue of economics dictating progress on future energy production, and would this be counter-productive due profits taking priority over progress and the reduction of the pollution into the environment  I agree with your comments Ian, in regard to nuclear based energy production. However, like many issues to do with progress, something catastrophic will have to take place before we realize we should have acted sooner.There it is again, the abusive and arguably ignorant use of that word “stupid”. Having reread all contributions above it seems Ali denies there’s a problem by saying there are dangerously low CO levels, John distracts by arguing the council should care more for child poverty, and Ian disparages, disparages and disparages again. Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet Ian’s singular approach is getting between him and his key message. I’ve long been puzzling as to what makes the good doctorso determined to overuse petty insult so freely, but it would be helpful to know just whathis specic problem with climate change protests is. If he could but answer his own Ice Age question to Brian , his motive might become a little clearer. And apologies in advance to Ianhe has already made his point and I’ve missed it, but it wasn’t me who thought it smart to surround it with invective. Wouldn’t it be just lovelyIan could contribute tolerantly without using putdowns  It’s almost as though he needs them to build himself up# Oh. Hold on# Eureka!#Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet # What a plonker, Peter, just cannot resist going political. Is thisLabour or SNP talking, he often points in both directions or is he now Green Maybe the characters on here who hate the idea of young people protesting about climate change should head down to the school and start shouting some of this stuff over the wall.But, then again, that might make them see . . . well . . . insane.Folk writing to the paper to have a go at the protesters is one of the most depressing contributions to local public debate imaginable.Hopefully, though, the usual naysayerswill only encourage them to do it more.There#s nothing wrong with anyone, of any age, having an opinion on whatever they like, and expressing it. But in their own time, only.The problem with this is that participation in this protest was permitted and facilitated,not encouraged by the education authority, which by default is an endorsement of the opinion being expressed in the protest and the timing method by which the protest was made, by the education authority.Education authorities and schools are supposed to be impartial, by granting #authorised absence# status to a politically motivated protest, that impartiality is now seriously called in to question and a dangerous precedent has been set.There was no reason other than a cynical publicity stunt for this protest to take place during the school day. If those still at school feel strongly enough to organise a protest like adults do, that#s fine, let them, but also like adults, it#ll have to happen in their own time, or they suffer the consequences of #unauthorised absence#, for it to be taken seriously.If they want to play in the big bad world, they play by the big bad world#s rules, not by special favours like this was.Only a few nutters are #impartial# about climate change these days.Do you mean that civil disobedience would have been better Well said Mark! The evident concern trollingis intended to deligitimise the voice of young people who, lets remember, are meant by right to have a say in matters that concern them. Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens. Therefore no one involved in supporting the reported protest has done any wrong, other than in the eyes of seemingly knee-jerk reactionaries who may well be hiding their true motives. Artfully comparing these identiable young people to Orwell’s unthinking farm animals, in order to subvert their point# well it more than lacks sensitivity and compassion. It is desperate, pitul and contemptible in equal measure. It may well also fall foul of observing normal standards of decency and tolerance that contributors to these pagesare meant to adhere to. Those joining the protest were not “stupid”, as has been claimed above. The overuse of that intolerant word may be though. I note you mention #Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens.# now could you explain how taking time off school and striking for the declaration of aclimate emergency makes the child an active and responsible global citizen  I rather feel they are being played by our Greeny ignoramuses and SNP political propagandists!

There was a lot of unnecessary waffling and needless aggression but you got there. So, in the incredibly unlikely event of a, totally safe, nuclear power plant being built in Shetland you’d still want it as far away from where you live as possible. Fair dos.Instead of nuclear power or gas have you ever put any thought into wind power  I’ve heard that they don’t cause any carbon pollution at all, so they’d be ideal. They’re very pretty too and scientic. Like an actual windmill, I’m a big fan.Sadly Ray, you are being misled. take Viking for example.

Obviously the climate changes over time. What he is conveniently avoiding are the questions around cause and appropriate response.Please do not make up speculative little stories porkies Peter. Farage is not my hero, however, I find him infinitely preferable to Corbyn and Salmond, however, here is not the place to digress further.Will Hell freeze over before Ian tells us what he presumes the protestors are ignorant of  Answering the question he posed Brian is not too mammoth a task for him surely. I suspect he is trying to dodge it for a reason.Read and weep Peter. If your intellect stretches that far. !! In the most simple of Science, It is set out below. The protestors are ignorant of the very most basic understanding of carbon capture and the prevention of climate change. Trees!! Only the very most utterly stupid, like yourself cannot see the wood for them!It is not clear the protest had a position on biomass, however Ian has firmly stated the need for those taking any position to be able to answer #how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age #Ian has thus far excitedly cited three articles, none of which reference any ice age. The first: #Tree planting ‘has mind-blowing potential’ to tackle climate crisis#, has Professor Crowther emphasising #it remains vital to reverse the current trends of rising greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning and forest destruction, and bring them down to zero# this is needed to stop the climate crisis becoming even worse and because the forest restoration envisaged would take - years to have its full effect##Reafforestation, necessary as it is, isn#t no silver bullet, nor a speedy enough solution, though many on the protest would likely love to plant some trees.The second and third articles focus on biomass, which is contested.To help Ian make his point, does he mean the Cryogenian, the second last ice age or the Little Ice Age  Again, other than to spread scorn and belittle, what is Ian#s actual point Sorrymy point is beyond you Peter. My question # “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ”That would require a thesis at post-graduate level to answer. Hardly space here! My point was that these children simple to not have the science to have a considered and informed opinion based on knowledge. The science is actually simple, I suggest you look it up and read it.Lest anyone thinking of studying the sciences, physical or social, be put off, Ian’s approach to advancing a scientic argument is far from typical. Thomas Kuhn made a very useful contribution by proposing that as a science advances some innaccurate claims will inevitably be made and indeed built on, but will later be corrected as sufficient contrary evidence emerges. Hawkins himself corrected some of his own foundational work. A settled consensus generally emerges over time through reasonable and reasoned dialogue and argument in which peer reviewed sources, research evidence and the thinking they provoke are made apparent.This is perhaps one reason why the Shetland Times asks contributors to observe normal standards of decency and tolerance for the opinions of others. It helps to bring forth the truth.It is, however, more than unusual for anyone taking themselves seriously to make a strong central scientic claim then refuse to back it up, clary it’s meaning or intent# unless of course Ian is proposing rhetoric, cant and distracting insult are now sciences, in which case top marks are due to the happy fellow.What a load of pretentious twaddle. You have outdone yourself here Peter. The word Science simply means knowledge, no more no less. It is just as simple as that.Whilst he remains intent on running away from clarying and substantiating his own point, here is an easier question for Ian: Why does he call Greens lunatics  There must be some point of disagreement between him and them, in his own head at least.That would be self-evident Peter. Read up the following. Bio-Fuels, palm oil plantation. Diesel fuel promotions, particulates. Germany non-nuclearpolicy,brown coal burning. Shetland exports clean gas imports polluting wood chip. Tree planting reverses CO build up, wood chip more polluting than coal burning and deforests huge areas. The EU % of renewable, Biomass .Greenies promote non-nuclear. more people killed in wind farm accidents in Uk than nuclear ever has. All the above would indicate a somewhat lunatic approach from the Greens. Now we have, using helicopters to survey Viking Energy sites as peat too unstable for tracked vehicles to reach, unbelievable!!! I hate to say the cult of #Greta Thunberg#,depression, eating disorders, and anxiety attacks,Asperger’s syndrome, high-ing autism, and OCD. She also suffers from selective mutism and self-harm. The sacricial lamb of the Greens across Europe. The inspiration behind the school strikes!!!!! Nowthat#s not lunatic, what is Ian’s position on global warming is either well grounded or is, well, hot air. He knows how this goes. Either he has a reputable theorist publishing an article in a reputable journal, or even a weblink to a news story referencing such, or he doesn’t. Because some vested interests have bought and paid for their own pet scientiststhere may be dferent opinions regarding whatever his as yet unclear point was with his unnamed and undated second ice age. If he really wants to be taken seriously he should put up or# consider his alternative.C’mon Ian, one reference to one reputable scientist backing up whatever it is you so obviously don’t want to say. You know you can do it.I am would be intrigued to opinions relating to climate change due to agriculture and what would be the answer to providing food but reducing or stopping climate change due to agriculture. I may be wrong but I believe agriculture produces  times more greenhouse gases than all of transportation put together, but this has, conveniently, been avoided by the media and scientic community. There is a terrible dilemma between producing food to this of attempting to reduce green houses gases and the progressive climate change taking place Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough and we are confused.One minute providing grants to preserve Shetland#s peat carbon store, and the next proposing digging acres of it up, releasing all that carbon, to build Viking.Giving out paper straws in McDonalds with juice in a plastic cup .I mind askingabout planting trees on my croft. They said #oh we dont want these clumps of trees any more, not our landscape#, when I had always thought tree planting was good.Such a mixed message. Why dont we have a green rating system like we have for our washing machines. You could rate biomass, nuclear, windfarms from construction to operation in terms of green to red, so we would know where we are in the scale with our choices.Any way, still have a patch of high hill that would be great for a mini woodsI referenced Greta with a very heavy heart, a truly exploited child whose background would fire concern with any child specialist in the UK, psychologist or Social worker.Sorry, Johan, who isn#t #taking climate change seriously# Theresa May and the Tories are taking it very seriously, indeed, passing Mrs May#s unilateral # net zero# plan into law. The Treasury says it will cost over £ trillion , enough to fund the salaries of , nurses for  years.Too little for Greta Thunberg and her #Extinction Rebellion pals, apparently.This will find its way on to consumers# electricity bills, including those in fuel poverty, a clear majority of homes in Shetland #  percent, before the recent price hikes.The Shetland Labour Party that I grew up with was concerned with alleviating poverty, not creating it. They were not interested inwinning #Green Blue Peter Badges# for futile, bourgeois bagatelles like#tackling climate change#, without any hope of success.Britain, far less, Shetland, can achieve nothing alone.The only candidate to exhibit concern for Shetland#s poor is Ian Scott.Im confused. You state that the Tories are proposing  net zero and then you say Labour creating poverty.I am very seriously concerned about fuel poverty everywhere and especially in Shetland. I hope that there are no price hikes in our fuel bills, this is something we need to resist, and I also hope more help is forthcoming for retrofitting better heating systems and more insulation to improve housing quality.Please do not try to tell me what I believe.Johan, I don’t recall you ever mentioning fuel poverty before. Do you support or oppose “ net zero”, which was done in knee-jerk response to the campaigns of Greta Thunberg and her pals “Extinction Rebellion” Only, you have been supporting Ms Thunberg’s “climate emergency” campaign at local level, have you not Mrs May’s , nurses salaries for  years isn’t “emergency” enough for them, they want more.You can huff and puff as much as you like, the cost will find its way to the fuel poor, increasing their number.I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Greta Thunberg AND the fuel poor, whom you have now mentioned for the first time.Mr Scott has been arguing for Shetland’s poor since long before he became a councillor.No John I have not been supporting Greta#s campaign locally and yes I have mentioned fuel poverty before and I think I can support greener politics and the poor. It is an important point tho, how we are going to pay for it all. I heard somewhere the Tories are going to pay for it from the proceeds of G.Johan, I responded to your comment above that Greta Thunberg is right .You have also defended the Shetland schools strike “climate emergency” demonstration in this self, same thread.I quote: “Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough#..etc..”That sounds awful like you think Mrs May committing  years’ worth of , nurses salaries isn’t “taking climate change seriously enough” If you are now saying that you do not support Greta Thunberg and do wish to tackle Shetland’s lamentable fuel poverty, will you be making a clear, prominent statement to that effect in your campaign literature Including your and Shetland Labour’s proposals for solving the fuel poverty The twisting of my words is really uncalled for, and completely ignoring the main point of my post which is that we need a green rating system to stop you all arguing about what is green and what is not # but then you enjoy the fight too much and would poo poo any system anyway I suppose.Strange move of support from Wir Shetland to Ian Scott  You#re scraping the barrel, now, Johan, getting personal. After your Up Helly-Aa performance, your comment about #enjoying the fight# is, frankly,a bit rich.It appears you are not prepared to make the campaign commitment I suggested. That#s ok.I#m not supporting anyone yet as I haven#t heard from all the candidates. I merely pointed out that Mr Scott is the only one so far to have shown any real concern for Shetland#s poor. He needs to say more about that. Under the present arrangements #climate emergency# will dump on the fuel poor. They have votes, too, of course # more than  percent of the electorate.Good luck with your campaign.Given his concern for the fuel poor John Tulloch will presumably be supporting whichever candidate puts the cancellation of Brexit first and foremost in their manesto  The largest driver of upward pressure on heating bills over the past two years is the devaluation of the pound following the Brexit vote. Greta Thunberg had nothing to do with it. In the event of further declines in the value of the pound post prime minister Johnson increased hard Brexit probability, the suffering of the fuel poor will continue to worsen as the wholesale price of gas becomes relatively more expensive when purchased in pounds sterling.The  dilemma that John Tulloch posed to Johan Adamson could equally well be phrased thus: I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Brexit AND the fuel poor.I apologiseI have gotten personal. Be as naesty as du wants, I just cant fathom why you need to be so  Breakfast TV only this morning were talking about how the market is not working, people not changing utility supplier and these people paying more as a consequence.Its surely not fairyour contract runs out that they are able to leave you on a higher rate Action on fuel poverty needs to include tackling the inequalities in the market as well as action to make our houses warmer.Ok, Johan. I’ve made my points about fuel poverty and there’snothing I want to add.So forgive meI don’t digress into bickering about who has or hasn’t been “naesty”. Readers may judge.Good luck with your campaign.Yes, Ian can answer a question when he chooses to. And there is sense in some of what he says. Wind farms on peat, for example, happen when commercial interests chase subsidies, so it is up to governments to get the correct approach. Not all that blame goes at the Green’s door, and they are either correct to claim there is a climate emergency or they are not.On the climate emergency Ian’s thoughts can only be guessed at. They have something to do with an ice-age, which is appropriate as progress towards getting him to answer his own question is, as yet, glacial.A big problem inside these debates stems from some people get beguiled by fake scientic claims. This is why genuine people making genuine scientic claims are generally happy to back them up by referencing the work of the real scientists involved. This offers folk who may or may not be less expert than Dr. Ian Tinklersome protection from charlatans with an axe to grind. Again,Ian is serious, rather than just being a contraryIan, he will reveal his ice-age source s. Or would doing so would reveal his actual movitation  C’mon Ian, youknowyouwantto.I actually sent them to the Times. They failed to print them as perhaps regarded as irrelevant pertaining to the school strike. I will do so again so Peter can untwist his knickers.The book you really should read, Mr T., is The Uninhabitable Earth by David Wallace Wells. Things are far more precarious than you think.David Wallace Wells. I would rather believe scientic specialists in ious fields than blindly take the word of a Journalist, Brian. He appears to hold no scientic qualication of any type.

We still haven#t founda proper way of storing spent nuclear fuel, i can seethe repository at Sellafield being under miles of snow through the many ice ages to come before it issafe again.The nuclear nonsensewas never about cheap and safe electricity it was of course about weapons grade plutonium tons,produced here in Scotland alone,why that amount when a few tons could polish off the entire planet does anyone know Do we trust Boris and fruitcake farm with this ,aye right- their record speaks for itself! Maybe the bairns protesting about climate change holds a candle of hope up - -we are all going to need it.Graham Fleming, Thorium breakdown isotopes have short half-lives. Long term storage is nor an issue. Ask a standard grader that is beyond your understanding.Incidentally, the global stockpile of separated plutonium is about  tonnes. That is  tonnes too much, however Thorium reactors produce none at all. Sad you cannot get your facts straight Graham Flemming, so very SNP.Having read these pages for a long time Peter, it should be apparent by now that Ian is a dental surgeon by training and therefore qualies for Dr status.No need to have a PhDor any other bits of paper !Ok, well thanks to Ian, andthe Times did withhold the links as irrelevant to the school strike they maybe had a point. It was Ian that insisted to Brian Smith way back when that this issue was relevant, for whatever reason.I#m still not clear what Ian draws from these articles though, or why anyone would have to have this knowledge to take a view on the current level of threat, but I get that global warming isn#t about to lead to another ice age. I don#t recall the protest saying it would# It#s a welcome change to have Ian express himself without resort to petty insult though. Long may that continue. On his earlier point on science, however, I#m not sure most scientists would agree science means knowledge only, as Ian proposed, without including the search for it by using scientic methods.But here is the big unanswered question # whatever it is Ian take from these links # does he, or does he not, think we are facing a climate crisis  If we are then surely the kids are right to be concerned, especially as some government sponsored action on climate change is potentially green-wash.Slight problem with the colour test Johan.About % of men have problems when distinguishingbetween red and green .

The Loch Ewe farm has failed the required environmental standards for nearly  years. Mowi, despite virtually unlimited resources, were apparently unwilling or unable to make the necessary changes. broadcast in May.In January , the Scottish Parliament#s Rural Economy and Connectivity Committee agreed to undertake an enquiry into the state of salmon fishing in Scotland and in November  the regulatory body SEPA published proposals for a revised regulatory regime for the finfish sector.

However,Mowi can provide evidence through EIAplanning and SEPA regulatory structure that the relocated biomass will have reduced potential impact on wild migratory fish, then we would be prepared to support biomass relocation on a conditional basis.#*A spokesperson from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency , said: “It is really encouraging to see that industry is proactively choosing to consider more sustainable locations for fish farms, away from more sensitive waters where pressures on the marine environment are greatest. “SEPA’s new regulatory framework for marine cage fish farming, launched on  June, , combines more accurate modelling and enhanced monitoring to encourage a more sustainable approach to the siting of fish farms. “In practice, we anticipate this will lead to fewer fish farms in shallower, slow-flowing waters and more fish farms in offshore locations where the environment capacity can better assimilate wastes. The new framework is designed to actively support operators who are seeking to relocate to more sustainable locations, and through improved practices and the innovative use of new technologies, reduce their impact on the marine environment.#They went on to add: “Indeed, our new framework provides exactly the type of flexibility and outcome-focus Mowi outlines it is looking for.Within this new framework, we will consider each inidual proposal on its merits against the legal standards.We encourage Mowi and other operators to work with us and other interested parties to explore their innovative proposals under our new framework.We look forward to doing so."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Kara-with-100m-IM-Gold.jpg","title":"inspirational western isles swimmer kara hanlon wins four gold medals at international island games in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine July.And the -year old was not the only WesternIsles athlete to celebrate a podium place in the shadow of the famous rock, asmore joy followed in the pool and in the athletics stadium.Isla Budge won bronze in the -metres freestyle event, while in Thursday’s triple jump final Mary Macleod won silver and Heather MacKinnon took bronze.Eriskay jumper MacKinnon had won gold in the event in Gotland two years ago with a shorter jump than it took to win third this time around.Hanlon’s week of glory began on Monday whenshe retained the  metres breaststroke title she won in Gotland in .

Mr. Herbinson, a member of the th Royal Irish Rles Association paid tribute at the last resting place of his great uncle Sgt Robert Herbinson who was killed in action on August ,  in the Ypres Salient.Sgt. Herbinson had survived the slaughter of the first day on the Somme where he had performed gallantly under fire and subsequently moved with the remainder of the thDivision to the British sector in Belgium. The th RIR Association were on their annual pilgrimage to the WW battlefields, taking part in the July  ceremonies on the Somme before visiting other sites. Editor’s note: Robert Herbinson was born at Clonavon, Ballymena and is buried at Ration Farm Cemetery Annexe, Ploegsteert, Belgium and commemorated in Wellington Street Presbyterian Church. Ballymena Observer, September ,  - Miss Herbinson,  Hill Street, Ballymena, has been informed that her brother, Sergeant R. Herbison th Royal Irish Rleswas killed in action on Sunday, August th. Sergeant Herbinson was, prior to joining the colours, an employee in the Phoenix Weaving Factory, Ballymena.He was a member of the Ulster Volunteer Force and of Ballykeel LOL . His brother, Lance Corporal James Herbinson, Royal Irish Fusiliers, is serving at the front. A letter received from the Rev. A. Gibson, Chaplain to the Central Antrims, states that Sgt. Herbinson was killed while out on duty in no-mans land. He states:He was a most excellent soldier and a very good NCO and the regiment will miss him very much. He had done very fine work when the battalion went into action on st July and I have heard from his officers how nobly he did his duty that day. He was buried in a little cemetery near the firing line.Lt. W.B. Stuartwrote: Dear Miss Herbinson, I cannot tell you with what regret it is hat I am writing to tell you of the death of your brother. He was killed by a bullet passing through his brain so that I am glad to say that he suffered absolutely no pain. I have known your brother personally for nearly two years and I feel that I have lost a real friend as well as an excellent sergeant. I have never met anyone whom I trusted more than your brother. He was absolutely fearless and could always be depended upon to do anything.“Perhaps you have heard that he was recommended for bravery at the battle of the Somme, when, after three attempts had been made, he collected eight men of his platoon and was going to make another attack, when, luckily, he was stopped as the chance was hopeless. I was present at the funeral and he has been laid in a British cemetery just behind the firing line so there will be no dficulty in locating the grave after the war.

We see these projects as bringing a positive outlook to these areas during these times.”She continued: “We have our festival of fun event, which is on the th of August on Lepper Street. It’s our headline event, so it will be full of comedy, street theatre, music, dance, amusements, a roller disco – there is loads happening that day. Over the last few years there has been a lot of negativity around the bonfire so we’re working with Féile on this event as part of their wider Belfast ersionary programme.“It’s a good opportunity for young people to meet new friends, it gives them something outside of their school le and it helps to improve confidence and self-esteem. It’s brilliant for the young people themselves, but also then you see parents coming along who are so proud of what their child has achieved. I think bringing the likes of High School Musical to the Mac, which is one of Belfast’s best theatres, is brilliant. It’s a great opportunity for young people to be involved. It’s on our doorstep and a lot of young people might not have the chance to use it. Tickets are £, so they’re affordable for local families – no other tickets at the Mac are that price. We really want to encourage people to come and support their local young people.”"},{"url":null,"title":"10k for northern ireland civil servant offended by portraits of queen and philip peer","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The portraits were removed and the offended party, a Mr Lee Hegarty, was consulted on what should replace them.”“He suggested that the portraits of Her Majesty the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh should be replaced with photographs of, at best, the Queen meeting people during engagements in Northern Ireland,\" said Lord Maginnis.“One such photograph features Her Majesty the Queen shaking hands with the former deputy first minister, Martin McGuinness, at the Lyric Theatre in Belfast.“I do not mind that what I mind is that the case brought by the complainant was settled secretly and that the sum of £, was handed over, presumably for hurt feelings and distress.“This settlement was signed off by the then secretary of state, Theresa Villiers MP, on the recommendation, I am informed, of her permanent secretary Jonathan Stephens.“I have been told to look at the annual accounts to find out where the money came from – but it is not to be found. That should concern us.”After some time had passed after the issue of compensation was settled, Lord Maginnis said that last year Mr Hegarty was promoted to become accounting officer of the Parades Commission.He said this contrasted with what he described as the years of delay in compensating victims of historical institutional abuse in Northern Ireland. He said they had been “shamefully left out in the cold when it comes to their justiable claims for compensation”.“This is scandalous. It is an indictment of the Northern Ireland Office and of this government,\" he said.“We have lost all sense of reality when a portrait of Her Majesty can cause offence to a civil servant but we do not bat an eyelid when we deny closure and justice to unfortunate people who have been abused in the most outrageous manner imaginable.“I urge the Northern Ireland Office not only to restore the original portraits of Her Majesty and the Duke of Edinburgh but to expedite payment of the comparatively paltry compensation due to the people who are more deserving than this opportunistic civil servant who, surely, must now be compromised in his position in the Parades Commission because of his bigoted stance over the Royal Family.”The Northern Ireland Office said in a statement: “We will not comment on inidual personnel matters.”"},{"url":null,"title":"calls for northern ireland to mirror republic with minimum alcohol pricing","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He predicted \"illegal organisations\" will take advantage of the situation to smuggle \"cheap booze\" into the Republic.He said: \"I dont want a network that hasnt gone away involved in this.

The Inquest hearings took place over a twelve-day period last year.The British Army have claimed for the last  years, that Mr Bradley a -year-old IRA member, was armed when they opened fire on him close to the Bishop’s Field area of Creggan.

Durkan come after the latest public consultation attracted over  objections which he now believes will scupper plans for similar schemes in areas such as Rosemount and Bishop Street.Mr Durkan said the Department for Infrastructurehas been “extremely ham-fisted” in its handling of the consultation process.The parking scheme issue stretches back around ten years, with ious public consultations having taken place in that time. At one stage, it was expected to be introduced in  but had to be pushed back until .In  then Roads Minister Danny Kennedy gave assurances that, “in the absence of signicant objections”, the scheme would be in place no later than Spring .However, this week, after a consultation ended last April and a further information session was held in November, a spokesperson for the Department explained that the proposed Rossville Street Residents’ parking scheme received a large number of objections from the residents.Of the  responses received, there were  objections to the scheme.The DfI told the Derry News that key areas of concern coming out of the consultation included the number of permits allocated for visitors, access for family carers and concerns over costs.The Department has since confirmed that the resident and visitor permits would be free and that a special permit would be available for family carers, also free of charge.The DfI spokesperson added: “The Department acknowledges that there is still a need to manage car parking in the Bogside and is now considering how to progress matters.“Consideration is being given to advancing a smaller scheme within the Rossville area to include Abbey Park, Glenfada Park and Columbcille Court, possibly as a pilot. The Department would hope to commence consultation for a smaller scheme in September.“The Department will write out to all residents living within the limits of the original Rossville scheme as soon it is confirmed how an alternative scheme will be progressed.“The Department is not in a position to consider other schemes at this time.”StaggeringMark H. Durkan is worried that delays to the Bogside parking scheme will now hamper the roll-out of similar schemes.“The fact this is happening will now block progress on any residents’ parking scheme where in the city.“Bogside residents want a parking scheme so it must be the design of it that people are objecting to. It’s staggering that a much-needed parking scheme in an area where residents struggle and have been crying out for a solution to the problem of getting parked outside their homes during the day has been scrapped.“This scheme has been deliberated over for ten years and the department has brought proposals forward that have been met with such opposition. It begs the question, was enough done to liaise and interact with objectors, and could they respond in turn to these objections.“Bogside was identied as a key area, as was Bishop Street and the next was the lower Rosemount university area. But now it seems asthe department has pulled the plug on those schemes and there is no chance of progress.”Parallel schemesThe SDLP representative had enquired about the possibility of a similar scheme in other areas which are badly impacted by students such as Rosemount, and Abercorn Place and Terrace which are both affected by city centre workers.“These could have been done in parallel so that at least one scheme could be advanced. People in Rosemount are frustrated that they’ve been put on the back burner while this other scheme was being progressed, but they’ll be even more frustrated to see it isn’t being progressed.“Rosemount and Bishop Street will now be way down the line, the handling of this by the Department of Infrastructure seems extremely ham-fisted,” Mr Durkan added.The Rossville Street area Residents’ Parking Scheme would be the first such scheme for the City and involves over  residential properties mainly in the Rossville Street, Fahan Street, Little Diamond, Creggan Street and Chamberlain Street areas.A DfI publication in March stated that, proposals for the Scheme were first announced by the previous Minister for Infrastucture, and following informal consultations “there has proven to be signicant support from residents who are experiencing increasing dficulties parking outside their homes.”The Department wrote to all residents within the area and encouraged all interested parties to formally respond to the proposals before  April.If introduced as proposed, the scheme would have designated free of charge parking places for residents only between the hours of . am and noon and between . pm and . pm from Monday to Saturday inclusive.Visitors would have been able to park within areas designated for residents provided a valid visitor’s permit is displayed on the vehicle.

There needs to be swt action as an enhanced facility could alleviate the problem people are currently facing.A Department for Infrastructure spokesman said the current Driver and Vehicle test centre network was built around  years ago.ldquoMuch has been done to maintain and modernise the test centres in that time, particularly to meet the growing demand for vehicle tests. However, present and future legislative requirements, coupled with increasing and changing demands for testing services, mean that the current network is no longer sustainable, he said.ldquoAs such, we have been reviewing the network with a view to determining the most appropriate network of test centres to meet our future needs.

If Fascism hadnrsquot been beaten we would be living in a very dferent world today. ldquoWe would be living in fear of a regime which would not tolerate any descent. We are very lucky and should be thankful to those veterans who risked all and gave their tomorrow for our today.Cllr Hanna said the districtrsquos surviving veterans were small in number and well into their nineties, and that society owed a debt to them for their part in the battle to secure the freedom people enjoy today.He said he included the Merchant Navy in his proposal because many risked their lives on merchant ships to ferry supplies which helped win the war.ldquoThis was a cruel war where many lost their lives and I really hope we never have to face anything like this again. Those from Northern Ireland who fought and served during World War Two came from all sections of the community.ldquoBefore it is too late, I believe this council should acknowledge what these brave people did for us all by presenting surviving veterans with a silver poppy at a cross community service in November, said Cllr Hanna.He added: ldquoI hope that the council will support this motion as a mark of respect for the generation which has given us freedoms we take for granted.The SDLPrsquos Declan McAteer said he was ldquosomewhat dubious about the suggestion for the council ldquoto go out on a limb and procure silver poppy medals.ldquoI fully respect the sentiment of those wishing to identy with what is essentially a British symbol which wonrsquot by endorsed by all Irish men or women. The poppy, for better or worse, is associated with all conflicts that Britain was involved in from the First World War right through.ldquoI would say that perhaps thatwe do anything around this we

problems within the districtrsquos planning department have been laid bare in a Newry, Mourne and Down Council report which has been made public.The local authority mdash which is responsible for district planners mdash has revealed in its annual audit committee report that the current number of live planning applications in the system is just over ,.The confirmation comes after local politicians recently pointed to what they described as ldquoserious problems at council management level for not taking the planning backlog seriously enough.Politicians have expressed concern that planners are not responding to their telephone calls and emails, with people who lodge applications also concerned that they are not getting any information from officials.Elected representatives say while all the fault does not rest with planners, they are firmly of the view that there are simply not enough staff to deal with the huge volume of work.Concern has also been expressed that the planning department is having problems retaining staff to work in a department that receives the second highest number of applications across the Provincersquos  councils.Politicians say there is a need to ensure the planning department is running properly which the council explains in the new report is exactly what it aims to do.A major review of planning has already been undertaken and amendments made to the so-called scheme of delegation which is a set of rules which determines whether a planning application will be decided by the local authorityrsquos Planning Committee or planning officers.A critical look has also been taken at staffing structures in tandem with the arearsquos chief planner, with council officials conceding that while there are issues with staff turnover, positions are filled as quickly as possible.In addition, the council has admitted there is a communication issue within the planning department with the change that needs to happen something that cannot be achieved overnight.Signicantly, the new council report warns that failure to deliver timely planning decisions is a ldquorisk within the corporate risk register, with the number of live planning applications increasing, not decreasing, with the figure standing at , at the end of May.The report says an internal audit of the planningrevealed that there are a number of key controls absent from the local authorityrsquos planning system, in particular, its performance against legislative targets, the completeness and validation of documentation supporting applications and enforcement actions.The audit also points to a lack of clarity in respect of key performance indicators within the planning department and the lack of non-compliance by the local authority with its

leisure facility in Newcastle  ","story":"AMBITIOUS plans for a new community centre in the heart of Newcastle are expected to include an indoor water facility, it has emerged.Consultants have been appointed by Newry, Mourne and Down Council to complete a feasibility study on new leisure provision in the resort, with the current Newcastle Centre and adjoining Tropicana outdoor swimming pool the favoured site.Last October, the Recorder exclusively revealed that plans for a major new leisure facility in the heart of the town were back on the agenda, with consultants set to be asked to carry out a study of potential sites.Two locations were previously identied for a new multi-million pound leisure centre, with sports pitches at Donard Park the preferred option.However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St. Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School campus at Shanslieve Drive.Despite a number of attempts to secure the site and hopes that a deal could be agreed, it was bought by supermarket giant Lidl which recently secured planning approval for an ultra-modern new store.Recognising that Newcastle is one Northern Irelandrsquos premier tourist resorts, council officials are keen to deliver a new indoor facility which people can use all year round.Politicians are also keen for the local authority to take the lead and ensure a facility which has been talked about for decades is finally delivered in Newcastle mdash one that includes some form of indoor water facility.The council is keen to ascertain the proposed redevelopments costs for the entire Newcastle Centre site which includes the outdoor Tropicana pool and tourist information centre, the latter of which recently celebrated its th anniversary.Council officials want to know what the costs are so the scheme can be included in the local authorityrsquos capital development programme. They are keen to look at a mix of community facilities alongside some sort of indoor water leisure type facility which will replace the ageing Tropicana.In addition to plans for a new community centre, work is continuing on plans to secure a multi-million pound tourism bonanza for the resort through a series of innovative proposals.They are aimed at overhauling current tourist provision and signicantly increasing the number of overnight visitors to the resort as part of the City Deal initiative.A project board has been set up to help oversee the proposed investment initiative in Newcastle, with the local authority one of five councils paired with Belfast City Council, universities and the private sector who hope to bid for a share of a poundbn investment package to fund a series of future projects, including tourism.The local authority and its City Deal partners have committed poundm to help deliver a raft of schemes, with the remainder of the cash coming from the Treasury and Northern Ireland Executive. It is anticipated that the city deal initiative has the potential to help the councils create , new jobs over a -year period.City deals are designed to allow councils to take charge and responsibility of decisions that affect their area, do what they think is best to help businesses grow, create economic growth and decide how public money should be spent.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is hoping to secure poundm from the NI Executive and is committing poundm of ratepayersrsquo money to fund highly ambitious proposals in Newcastle aimed at shaping future tourist provision in the resort which form the core of its Mourne Gateway Project.Exciting proposals to signicantly enhance tourism attractions to draw international visitors to world class attractions in the resort include a gondola ride into the heart of the mountains and a visitor centre at the site of the old quarry at Thomasrsquo Mountain.Other proposals include an Alpine coaster ride enabling people to hurtle down the side of the mountain on a single track in a buggy, an indoor activity centre in Donard Park, elevated tree top walk in Tollymore Forest Park and a new visitor centre and bird hide at the Murlough Nature Reserve.The ious proposals remain at an early stage and continue to be developed, with the next steps involving the development of a full outline business case for the overall project..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ross selected for youth leadership programme  ","story":"A CROSSGAR teenager has been chosen to join the first group to begin a year-long international youth leadership programme which will culminate with a once in a letime trip to Los Angeles.Seventeen year-old Ross Farrell, a Year  student at Wellington College in Belfast, has earned his place on the IGNITE programme, a joint initiative between Belfast City Airport and Cinemagic, which will provide potentially le-changing opportunities for  young people over a five-year period.He was one of several students nominated by their schools who were then required to fill in an application form.Successful applicants were invited along to a selection day at the airport where they participated in a series of role-plays, team-building exercises and an interview.Jay Roewe, senior vice president of HBO, West Coast Productions, who is widely accredited for helping to bring Game of Thrones to Northern Ireland, met with the students at the launch of the programme at the airport.Michelle Hatfield, director of corporate services for George Best Belfast City Airport, said that over the course of the year, participants will collaborate with youth organisations, foundations, charities, representatives from other businesses in the private sector and also recognised names in the field of sport, film and politics.She added: ldquoWhilst the trip will conclude at a VIP gala event in Santa Monica, it is hoped that the lessons learned and the connections made by the young people involved will last a letime.Lord Mayor of Belfast John Finucane offered his encouragement to the young people participating in the programme.He said: ldquoIGNITE holds the potential to build the confidence, leadership and social skills of every young person involved.

Irsquom still in shock, she confessed.The highly-dedicated athlete didnrsquot start the competition that well, but she recovered well to lt bronze.ldquoI had a bad first shoot, which I put down to nerves. I then I had to work my way from the back over the next few circuits.Good shoots and strong running in the next three circuits is what helped to pull me up to bronze, she continued.ldquoMadeira was amazing. Stunning scenery and great food, most importantly.The weather was fantastic, the water was calm, pretty warm and clear, which was ideal, considering this was my first time swimming outdoors and not in pool.It was very much a learning experience for me too.No one is more surprised at Suziersquos success than Suzie herself, but she admits that she still has a lot to learn.ldquoIrsquom extremely surprised how well I have adapted to the sport. I knew it could play to my strengths eventually, but being new to it, I wasnrsquot expecting to be as competitive just yet. I still have so much to learn and improve on, which makes it exciting, she enthused.ldquoOver the next few months I will have to chat with coaches and make a decision on the event I want to focus on the most.I will continue training all five events, but I think my main aim will be the Triathle Worlds in October in Florida.Suzie now feels that the time is right to put her toes into local waters so that she can improve her swimming discipline.ldquoNow Irsquove had a taste of open water swimming, its time to brave the Northern Ireland waters, so I can perfect my technique and become more efficient at sighting and swimming round buoys, she continued.ldquoI will also be back in the gym building on my strength again. Itrsquos an important part of my training which I have to not over do during competition.ldquoI cannot wait for World Championships in Florida, she beamed,ldquoThe competition level will be fierce, so Irsquoll be going with no expectations.

It’s was a great experience meeting Brian Cox as well, he was really interesting and good at making the topics exciting.

I had hoped to work constructively with them and take their concerns on board.ldquoThose who were elected as Conservatives but have chosen to betray the faith that was shown in them by their constituents should have the courage to resign and face by-elections. They should defend their decisions at the ballot box.ldquoAn establishment stitch up between these councillors and Labour is not in the interest of residents of the Vale of Glamorgan. They have explicitly argued that they know best and that the public should be ignored.ldquoI will be proposing a minority Conservative administration at the Vale Councilrsquos AGM with a plan that delivers on the priorities of local people. I will challenge other councillors to back it.Earlier on Wednesday, Cllr Gray made a statement to Vale of Glamorgan Councilrsquos Conservative group to say he was resigning.In his statement, he said he had ldquoabsolutely no issue with the manner in which Cllr Bailey was elected as the new leader of the Conservative Group,But he said he is ldquoat least partially at odds with Cllr Bailey on three issues ndash the proposed lsquoclosurersquo of Llancarfan Primary School, the Dinas Powys Bypass and the incinerator in Barry.On the Llancarfan School proposal, which would see the primary moved to a new building in Rhoose, he said: ldquoI seconded a motion to have the executive reopen the issue consultation and this was ignored by the then cabinet but now that this dficult decision has been made I fear that any attempt to articially prop up Llancarfan School will take funding away from the budgets of Penarth schools which is something I will not tolerate.Cllr Gray said heremained ldquounconvinced that the proposed bypass around Dinas Powys, linking Cardf to Barry, ldquois an issue with a large base of support in my ward, and the efforts to give it even more prominence and funding would I believe be to the detriment of the residents of my ward.Vale council has been waiting for more than a year for Welsh Government to decide whether the Barry incinerator needs to carry out an environmental impact assessment before it can operate.Cllr Gray said any efforts to ramp up the councilrsquos rhetoric on the incinerator ldquowould do a disservice to those residents who are passionate about the subject.ldquoRaising  hope for headlines is not the reason I stood for local government and I donrsquot want to mark my success by how many column inches we are able to achieve on a wedge issue, he said.       ,params: .pushHe added:ldquoThe structures around the group that Vince is proposing seemed to be geared up to act as an opposition party and not to focus on the work of delivering core services for the benefit of the most vulnerable members of our society.ldquoI donrsquot expect everyone to agree with my decision and I donrsquot take this decision lightly ndash I am sure that there will be a great number of people who have an opinion on whether I have done the right thing or not.ldquoI need to remain true to myself and my belief in acting as a positive advocate for the residents in my ward ndash the issues that get me out of bed every morning to work hard for the residents in my ward are not the way the press views me but how I can make a positive dference to peoplersquos lives. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There was a lot of support for our clear Welsh Labour position backing a final say in a peoplersquos vote for the public on any Brexit deal.Following the mixed results in the local elections in England and Northern Ireland last week, there was much talk about Labour lsquobailing outrsquo the government. Let me be crystal clear on this ndash I will never lsquobail outrsquo the disastrous Tories on Brexit, and neither will the overwhelming majority of Labour MPs.We can resolve the situation, but not by any backroom stitch-up that would risk letting down both those who voted Leave and Remain. The only way forward out of this mess is to let the people have the final say on any deal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that. Under my leadership, thatrsquos exactly what would happen and whilst I do accept that there are dficult decisions to be taken, we have to take the public with us - not ignore their legitimate concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

People should be able to disagree with each other without resorting to abuse.Devolution is a journey not a destination.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people.

The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/nstreet1.jpg","title":"belfasts north street arcade to be redeveloped","story":"Posted on Tuesday  June  by John Mulgrew A former Belfast shopping arcade left derelict after being gutted in a blaze more than a decade ago could be brought back to le amid fresh development plans. North Street Arcade was destroyed in a fire in , which caused severe damage to the floor and glass roof. It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations. The plans to redevelop the arcade are included in a revised scheme called Tribeca Belfast – formerly Royal Exchange. UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. It has also been announced that architectural design firm Squire  Partners has been appointed to work on the amended proposals. The team from Squire  Partners will work alongside conservation architects from Belfast-based Consarc Design Group. Neil Young, chief executive of Castlebrooke Investments, said: “We are very pleased to be able to reveal our proposed amendments to our outline planning application for Tribeca Belfast, changes which we feel demonstrate that we have listened to feedback from the city. “We will continue to listen and today we have launched a voluntary public consultation process into these planned changes ahead of the submission of our application. Our community exhibition will provide an opportunity for anyone interested to see the new plans and we will be revealing more information about this in the coming weeks.” Murray Levinson, partner at Squire  Partners, said: “The mix of uses across the site – designed to attract a iety of retail, restaurant, cultural and workplace tenants – and the creation of new public realm, will ensure this part of Belfast will be active throughout the day and into the evening. Providing a large number of residential apartments with shared gardens, as well as a hotel, will create a new opportunity for people to live in the city centre.” And Graeme Moore, specialist conservation architect at Consarc Design Group, said: “Consarc Design Group is delighted that we continue to be involved with the proposals for Tribeca Belfast to offer our expertise in building conservation. As with the previous proposals, all of the listed buildings within this phase are to be retained, restored and adapted for a sustainable ongoing use within the masterplan, rooting the new development in the unique historical character of this part of the city centre.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/droad_1.jpg","title":"major new apartment building planned for dublin road","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew The Dublin Road in Belfast A new serviced apartment building could be developed along Belfast’s so-called ‘Golden Mile’ on the Dublin Road, it can be revealed.

Entries are now open for the  Deloitte Technology Fast  programme. The awards, now in their th year, rank Ireland’s fastest growing technology companies and recognise the indigenous technology companies that have demonstrated outstanding growth in turnover over the previous four years.

Peter Allen, partner at Deloitte, said: “For  years, the Technology Fast  awards have celebrated the success and growth of Ireland’s leading indigenous technology companies. “It is fantastic to be able to look back and see how some of the companies which appeared on the Fast  list in the early days have become global businesses and market leaders. “The likes of First Derivatives and Novosco, who were early stage tech companies when they first made the Fast , are now major employers and shining lights within the NI economy.” One of the few Northern Ireland companies to have topped the Fast , appearing in it  out of the  years since the ranking’s inception, is Newry-headquartered financial software company First Derivatives. Shane Mulholland, senior vice president of marketing and operations at First Derivatives, said: “We’ve been involved with the Fast  programme since it began and have found it to be not only great recognition of every stage of the company’s growth but also a chance to meet peers and like-minded businesses who are striving to be leaders in their own fields.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/brexit_123234324234_web.jpg","title":"no deal brexit could cost ni  jobs","story":"Posted on Wednesday  July  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland faces losing , jobs in a ‘no deal’ Brexit which could have ‘immediate and severe consequences for its position as an all-island and UK economy, a government paper has warned.

Once again, it raises serious concerns over the agri-sector in particular, meat in particular, and beef especially, in regards to “increased vulnerability to low cost non-EU imports in the GB or NI market”. Its not just the physical goods, though as it says Northern Irelands IT sector is facing the cost of exporting services increasing, by an average of .%.
