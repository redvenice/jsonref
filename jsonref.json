We spoke to the experts to find out. Q: If I’m displaying symptoms, do I still need to isolate?“The most important thing is to follow the law, so if you’ve got symptoms you have to self-isolate for 10 days in your home and it’s really important people continue to do this,” says Dr Shaun Fitzgerald, director of the Centre for Climate Repair at the University of Cambridge and a member of the UK government Science Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE). “There may perhaps be people who think: ‘Well, why can’t I go for a walk outside in the countryside if I’m not going to see anybody?’, and I completely understand that argument. But there are millions of people living in apartments and if they were to venture outside, they’d be sharing corridors and stairwells and touching multiple surfaces. We can’t have one rule for one and another rule for others. It’s about the risks to the wider society and my personal view is that the rules are proportionate and very reasonable. Especially when you compare 10 days of isolation with the lockdowns we’ve already been in – it’s a small ask comparatively.” Q: Is it really safe to socialise outside?“When we are outdoors, thinking about the airborne route of transmission, the level of concentration of any virus in our vicinity is much lower and so the risk is lower too,” says Fitzgerald, who also specialises in airflow research. “The amount of outdoor air that’s sweeping away any virus being emanated from a person is enormous, and we can’t begin to practically replicate that kind of environment within an indoor environment.” Q: Won’t opening the windows have the same effect?“Opening the windows is great if you’re indoors but it’s nowhere near as good as being outdoors,” says Fitzgerald. “Think about it, when you’re stood outside, it’s very rare that it’s perfectly still – there’s usually a very small wind and when you run the numbers and figure out the volume flux of air passing you that’s not virus-laden, it’s enormous. When you’re outside, there are fewer surfaces for you to touch which, for example, somebody might have coughed on. Surface touching risks are also lower outdoors because things such as the rain and ultraviolet light from the sun can deactivate the virus more easily than in a dark, indoor environment.” Q: How safe is outdoor swimming or group sports?“Outdoor sports are relatively low risk but I would encourage people to also think about their overall wellbeing, including mental health, when it comes to the risks you’re exposing yourself to as you enter into society,” says Fitzgerald. She adds: “This isn’t purely about the virus – we also need to think about the wider impacts of isolation, loneliness and a lack of socialisation. It’s about balancing those risks.” Q: How can we keep safe as we start to socialise in larger groups?“One of the challenges as we start seeing friends and family is that it’s incredibly difficult for people to maintain a social distance from loved ones,” says Rogers. “And if you have young children it’s very difficult to explain to them why they’re not allowed to crawl over everyone or play with the other children. If you’re meeting up with another household or group, try to plan it in an environment that is as safe as possible. Have those honest conversations now – people are more willing and likely to stick to plans that are made in advance.” Q: If we’ve had the vaccine, do the rules still apply?“The vaccines are amazing and one of the biggest scientific breakthroughs of a generation, but they’re not a silver bullet,” says Rogers. “Think about somebody who has had bypass surgery because their diet and exercise were poor. They can have that medical fix, but if they don’t change their behaviours, they’ll never realise their full potential. I see vaccines in the same way – they’re a powerful weapon we can deploy against the virus but they’re only going to reach their full potential if we wrap these other behavioural elements around them.” Q: How can we make our homes safer for visitors when they’re allowed to pass through to gardens?“Keep the windows open and if you’ve got two bathrooms, have one toilet for guests and one for the household,” suggests Fitzgerald. “If not, can you provide two towels – one for guests, one for others? Ventilating the house before and after your guests have arrived is key – ventilating before they arrive is helpful in case you happen to have an infectious person in your vicinity, therefore reducing the risk to your guests. Ventilating after guests have left is important because if one of them happens to be infectious, this will reduce the risk to your own household.” And remember, it’s not permitted for people to meet indoors until 17 May – when six people or two households will be able to come together. Q: Is there anything else we should remember?“While we’re still in this reasonably precarious state, the most important thing is to think: ‘It’s not about me, it’s about others,’” says Fitzgerald. “It’s about the wider community. Certainly in the first lockdown, we got the sense of real selflessness in society and we need to try to remember these measures aren’t just in place to protect you as an inidual, it’s about thinking of others. Particularly as we emerge from lockdown – since, the more compliant we are now, the quicker the incident rate is going to come down and the sooner society can start functioning again. So it’s really about trying to get out of this as quickly as we can, which means complying with the rules as much as possible.” This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

I didn’t think about the terroir of grape-growing, the nose of whisky or what wine to pair with raw tilapia. On sunny days, I just thought about the most enjoyable way to quench my thirst. Now, the clank of a metal bottle opener and the hiss of a cold Thatchers Cider opening is enough to bring me back to the Meadows in Edinburgh, for a post-lecture picnic with friends. Stretched out on the grass as the rays warm my skin, the air is filled with the smoky smell of barbecue. Summer walks have been made all the sweeter with a sip of cider at the end. Arriving at a sweep of beach, blanket at the ready, or settling at the end of a pier as the sun sets. The cool fizz of cider tickling down my throat while the sky streaks violet and hazy pink is an unbeatable feeling. On an emotional level, clinking bottles with a friend at the end of the day is the perfect reward. On a practical level, a couple of bottles of ice-cold Thatchers in your rucksack on the way to the sea cools your back – ideal. Cider is the taste of a barbecue with my family – the only way we were allowed to see each other in summer 2020. My dad cooked venison burgers for the first time, an attempt to impress me, the “food and drink writer”, making jokes about not wanting a bad review. Despite the burger buns being a bit frozen in the middle, I gave it 1010. The sun was shining, family was gathered, the cider was flowing and for a brief second it felt like normality again. The epitome of the “better times” we’re all looking forward to. I can’t always suppress the drinks writer in me and did have to note that the iron-y tang of venison burgers goes particularly well with the light sweetness of Thatchers Katy. On the slopes of the Mendip Hills, Thatchers grows 458 different varieties of apple in perfect conditions – more than 25 varieties of them are used for ciders. The autumnal rain, summer sun and lack of winter frost combine to create juicy, flavour-filled apples. They have a cider for every taste bud: sharp and cloudy, sweet and pink. As a drinks writer, I’ve sampled more ciders than I care to remember. Thatchers Katy is the choice for sunny days and balmy nights. While Thatchers’ other ciders are made from a combination of different types of apple, Thatchers Katy is made from just one type. Red as a fairytale apple and sweet as strawberries, Katy apples are the pride of the crop and first to be run through the mill. It’s what you want to be drinking to get that real thirst-quenching moment, with only a hint of sweetness that doesn’t overpower. It sits between sweet and dry, with a crisp finish, so it’s incredibly drinkable. Being an apple-based drink, it goes best with anything pork. But its lightness also carries well with salads and summer food. Think charcuterie boards laden with spicy salami, salty prosciutto, and garlicky mortadella. The slight sweetness to Thatchers Katy cuts through the saltiness of prosciutto beautifully. Hand-held picnic food – scotch eggs, sausage rolls, and pork pies – tends to be savoury-heavy, so goes down a treat with a sweet cider, paired best with a sunset view, of course. But it also mixes well with fruity dishes – a salad sprinkled with glistening pomegranate seeds and topped with ripe avocado. The delicate fizz works particularly well with the creamy squish of avocado. Meat and salad, barbecues and picnic food it’s as though Thatchers Katy was designed for summer. So, it’s no wonder cider is the British summer drink of choice it pairs naturally with grilled meat and fruity salads, it’s easy to drink, and that hit of sweet apple sings of good times. For me, cider evokes memories of barbecues with friends and family, sunsets over the sea and picnics in the park, and Thatchers Katy is my cider of choice this summer, for its strawberry sweetness and crisp finish. If you need me, I’ll be sipping a cold cider in the park, or on my way to the shore, two bottles clinking away and cooling my back. To better times.

The largest party was 24 people in one apartment, while the average gathering size was six people.UCD students living in residences who were found to have attended such gatherings were sanctioned with warning letters, fines ranging from €25 to €250 and a number of incidents were referred to be dealt with under the student discipline procedure.UCD Students’ Union president Conor Anderson said he had represented several residents at disciplinary hearings and he took the view that “to put the blame entirely on students is a little bit short sighted”.“It was not a good public health intervention on behalf of UCD to bring students back to campus residences. We’re talking about 19-21 year-olds living together on campus in the middle of lockdowns. I don’t know what the university expected,” he said.He noted the opinion of students on campus towards the public health guidelines was “ided” with “many in favour and compliant”. However, he said there were also students “who think the rules don’t apply to them or who don’t care, and who are willing to put their social life ahead of public health advice”.Trinity College Dublin recorded four unauthorised gatherings in the campus residences, with the number of attendees ranging between four and eight people. Students were required to pay fines of up to €200 and to write letters of apology.Maynooth University said that while residents were “advised of their responsibilities under the Covid-19 regulations and how to live as a household”, throughout the semester the campus patrol team had occasion to interact with groups 134 times for unauthorised guests in their apartments.The majority of these were for one or more guests in their apartment and 20 were for “gatherings”. The sanctions imposed for Covid-19 violations at Maynooth included breach of license to reside, making the person ineligible for on campus accommodation in future years.University College Cork received reports of eight parties in campus accommodation buildings for the same period. Forty UCC students were identified as having attended the parties, some of whom were involved in “multiple gatherings”. Several students were sanctioned by the university.National University of Ireland Galway (NUIG) did not release data regarding gatherings on campus residences as the campus accommodation is under the auspices of a private limited company, not subject to FOI. Dublin City University’s campus residences are also a separate commercial company.The Garda has issued its 20,000th fine for breaches of the Covid-19 regulations, including 3,500 fines handed out for organising or attending house parties."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Commitment from world\u0026rsquos biggest polluters comes days before virtual summit hosted by Biden on the issueClimate experts highlighted \u0026lsquofundamental flaw\u0026rsquo in letter to Coalition leadersAspects of Bill \u0026lsquonot scientifically well grounded\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquoentirely lacking in legal certainty\u0026rsquo"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker what s available in the republic of ireland and what else is coming","story":"It has been almost a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland.

It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine. \u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and expects to have its first results by April 2021. On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?In December the HSE published the provisional order in which people in Ireland will be vaccinated against Covid-19. After over-65s in care homes and frontline health workers, people aged 70 and older and other healthcare workers are next in line to receive the vaccine.\u0026nbspPeople aged 16-69 with very high risk conditions will then be\u0026nbspthe fourth cohort to be vaccinated.On March 30th, the Cabinet agreed to change the National Vaccination Programme to an age-based system, once those aged 70 years and older, people considered vulnerable and those with underlying conditions are immunised. The original programme involved 15 cohorts of people based on age and profession, with key workers prioritised.The vaccination of people aged over 85 began on Monday, February 15th. Those in the 70-84 age bracket began to receive their first dose on March 8th, alongside people aged 16-69 with very high risk conditions.The HSE has said everyone over the age of 70 should have received their second dose by mid-May.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"president michael d higgins at 80 what can we expect from the rest of his term","story":" President Michael D Higgins in the grounds of Áras an Uachtaráin. There is no doubt that Higgins’s presidency is and has been consequential, substantial and  significant. Photograph: Tony MaxwellIn a way, he seems ageless. The familiar voice with its characteristic intonations, the careful and deliberate bearing, the thousand-watt smile, the grave and complex speeches, the almost tangible connections he makes with people.In all, it seems such a fixture of our national life that it is hard to think of him getting older. But he is, of course, though he is ageing well. In a political career lasting half a century, this has been the most dazzling part of it.President Michael D Higgins turns 80 on Sunday, still in the first half of a second term interrupted by the pandemic and a lockdown that has weighed heavily upon him. “Frustrated” is the word most used about him in recent days.So as he enters his ninth decade, where does the presidency of this unique figure stand? Can it recover its previous vigour? And what will be the themes that mark the remaining 4½ years of his term?In the past three decades, presidential elections have turned into crowded bare-knuckle brawls. But they have produced extremely popular and effective presidents. Presidents Mary Robinson, Mary McAleese and Higgins carved out not just an unprecedented connection between the head of State and the people of the country, but each nurtured distinctive themes and promoted causes which both reflected and directed the currents of a modern, and rapidly modernising, Ireland.Unmistakably criticalThe first part of the Higgins presidency was notable for three strands. He was carefully but unmistakably critical of the austerity policies of the Fine Gael-Labour government in the post-crash period.Often he pushed the boundaries for a president for sure, but never quite overstepped them, though he frequently infuriated those in Government Buildings trying to deal with one political and economic fire after another.He continued and enhanced a sort of golden age of Anglo-Irish relations with the first State visit to the United Kingdom in 2014, following the Queen’s visit to Ireland during the McAleese presidency. And he stewarded the beginning of the decade of centenaries with nuanced, inclusive and original intellectual leadership of the 1916 commemorations. His rapturous re-election in 2018 reflected a wide approval for a successful first term.But since then – what? And more importantly, what next?Lockdown has been hard. Very hard, say some of them. “It has been very difficult for him,” says one close friend, “he is not getting feedback and engagement from audiences. He is not getting the applause either. It’s been terrible for him.”One of the secrets to Higgins’s remarkable energy for one his age is that he thrives on meeting people and responding to them. He is used to addressing roomfuls of people who love him, and want to tell him how great he is. Who would not miss that?“He has spent 50 years going around shaking hands with people,” says another source. Now, he’s not.”“He’s driving us all mad,” laughs one friend. “He rings all the time.” Another source says he is “in his study, always working, rings all the time”.The work goes on. The Áras supplies a long list of speeches and messages he has recorded for events he cannot attend. The “constitutional” work – appointing judges, signing legislation, and so on – continues, too.He seeks briefings on legislation he has to sign, officials say. He meets Taoiseach Micheál Martin, as per article 28 of the Constitution – “The Taoiseach shall keep the President generally informed on matters of domestic and international policy”. The meetings happen in the Áras.Other meetings and social events do not happen, though. The sort of rolling levee that was a feature of life in the Áras during Higgins’s first term – sources previously told The  that you could walk into a room in the Áras and meet “Bono or Tommy Tiernan or Yanis Varoufakis” (imagine trying to get a word in) – is no more. The garden parties, which had a heavy emphasis on bringing minorities and underprivileged groups to the Áras, are in abeyance. There will be no birthday party tomorrow. Most of the Higgins’s children, and the only grandchild, live outside Dublin, so “the President and Sabina will therefore be celebrating the birthday later in the year, when it is hoped that current Covid-19 restrictions will no longer apply”, the Áras says. The constant hustle and bustle of life in the Áras has been stilled.‘Invisible’Though his relations with Martin are said to be freer and more natural than with Leo Varadkar – the two have more in common, though Varadkar was punctilious in showing due deference to the President – there are persistent grumbles about Higgins in Government. “He should have been there at a difficult moment for the nation, to articulate what we’re feeling, to give us hope,” says one Minister. “But he’s been invisible.” Several other Government sources echoed the sentiment.This is a little unfair. Higgins has made a number of stabs at the task, in speeches and in symbolic actions, such as the Shine a Light event in April of last year. More than half the review of the year published by Áras is concerned with responses to the pandemic. But it is probably true that this has not really cut through with the public.“I think he’s a bit wary of doing a ‘Oh, we’re all in this together’,” says a friend. “Because of course, he knows we’re not.”The same person speculates that Higgins does not want to be too closely associated with the efforts of the current Government to tackle the pandemic. “Maybe because he can see the sign of the half-arse over everything they do,” the source says.There is an irony in Government politicians wanting to hear more from the President. They spent much of his first term – when he skilfully carved out a distinct anti-austerity position in intellectual if not political opposition to the government of the day – wanting to hear less from him.“We were always aware of him and afraid of what he might say,” says a veteran of the 2011-16 government, who is still there. “He’s strangely irrelevant now. You almost forget he’s there.”“Nobody has mentioned his name to me since I started,” says a person who joined Government last year.If the content of Higgins’s speeches is no longer a cause for concern in Government, their length is often a source of mostly good-natured comment among politicians – protocol dictates that a Minister accompanies the President on foreign visits – and officials.Department of Foreign Affairs gossips recall one during a State visit to Vietnam in 2016, where he went for an hour and 10 minutes. “Well,” says one source, “he has never taken a speech and made it shorter”.“Whenever he says ‘in conclusion’, you’d know there’s a lot more to come,” laughs one fan.Almost everyone who spoke about Higgins in recent days – even those in some aspects critical – did so in terms of admiration and, often, affection. “I think he is genuinely revered and loved at this stage,” says one person who has known and watched him for years. But though his public image is cuddly – and he is a genuinely warm and friendly man – Higgins’s irascible side has always been well known to officials, politicians and journalists. There have been numerous barbs at reporters whose questions he did not appreciate. But not just reporters, which most will see as forgivable. Staff have been bawled out on occasion. He is, says one admirer, “very, very sensitive to criticism”.Comedic episodesThe lockdown, say people who know him, has not relaxed his tetchy side. Occasionally, there have been slightly comedic episodes, such as when he has become frustrated with Zoom technology, and its ilk. The frustration has been visible and audible to other participants. In fairness, few have escaped such moments in the last year, or more.Surely his age will be a factor in managing the remainder of the second term? “We just don’t know,” says one source. After all, he is well past the age when most people have retired. In 2014, for example, Higgins fulfilled more than 500 engagements. It is hard to see him returning to that level of activity. He clearly has unusual energy for his age but a return to that level of activity is probably unlikely.“Can he keep going? Nobody knows,” says another source. “He probably doesn’t know himself. We’ll have to see. But he’s in good nick. He has loads of energy. He’ll be refreshed.”The Áras is tight-lipped on future travel plans. Europe destinations are likely. He has not met the French president, Emmanuel Macron, yet. But visits to Africa, Latin America or parts of Asia are less likely. The UN in September remains a possibility, but an uncertain one.One of the reasons why he makes long speeches, of course, is that Higgins has always had a lot to say. So what will he want to say in the remainder of his second term?The difficult part of the decade of commemorations lies ahead. The treaty, partition, the Civil War – the centenaries all fall in the next couple of years. Higgins’s own family experience – his father and uncle took different sides, with far-reaching consequences – will no doubt influence his approach.The tone of the debate in the Republic about the Civil War commemorations will have repercussions in the State, but outside of it, too especially given recent times in Northern Ireland. His hand has been steady in the past, it will need to be so again.Beyond that, friends say that he is thinking a lot about the post-pandemic society – the “build back better” idea that has at its heart the analysis that things were not fine before coronavirus and returning to the status quo should not be the goal. It is not hard to imagine Higgins warming to that subject. It’s also not hard to imagine clashes with this or future governments, especially as they (inevitably) see the need to reduce the budget deficit.“I think Michael D has an opportunity to lead that conversation – and it wouldn’t be like him to shirk it,” says a friend.There is no doubt that Higgins’s presidency is and has been consequential, substantial, significant. Finishing the job lies ahead of him. After a long life of political struggles, this will be the final act.“I think he’ll jump into it with great gusto,” says one person who is close to him. “He’s like a man jogging on the spot.”“I don’t see him slipping gently towards retirement,” says another. “I think he’ll be raring to go.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"republic uk and eu agree to tackle northern ireland unrest","story":"Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney was in London holding meetings with key political figures.  Brussels, London and Dublin agreed to work together towards solutions following unrest in Northern Ireland.The agreement was reached in a series of meetings on Thursday aimed at putting relations on a “constructive” footing after a difficult start for the North’s post-Brexit arrangements.European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic and his British counterpart Lord David Frost held a dinner meeting in Brussels intended to provide “a political steer for follow-up discussions that will take place between both teams”, said a commission spokesman.It came as the British and Irish governments agreed to a meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference (BIIGC) in the coming months to discuss issues of concern in Northern Ireland.“We haven’t agreed a date yet but certainly I think the governments are in agreement that there should be a BIIGC meeting and I think we’ll continue to talk about the appropriate time for that,” Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney told The . Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Brandon Lewis earlier this week dismissed the idea that the intergovernmental conference should meet to discuss recent unrest in the North, on the grounds that policing is among the powers devolved to Stormont. The intergovernmental conference was established under the Belfast Agreement as a forum for co-operation between the two governments on Northern Ireland. It has not met since Boris Johnson became British prime minister.Mr Coveney was in London holding meetings with key political figures including Lord Frost, in what Mr Coveney described as “a very good meeting . . . on a personal level” and “a good, honest engagement that explored in some detail some of the issues in terms of what’s possible and what’s not”.Brussels and London remain far apart on some issues, with Britain seeking flexibility while the commission has said pragmatic solutions can be found only if the Northern Ireland protocol is implemented fully. The European Parliament has yet to ratify the EU-UK trade deal, which is in place provisionally until the end of the month.

What’s perhaps less appreciated, though, is how much he enjoyed a gentle joke at his own expense.I discovered this for myself 15 years ago. In my role as the ’s front page cartoonist for the last 30-odd years, occasionally the subjects of my jokes will get in touch and ask for the original artwork. I’ve sent cartoons to prime ministers, celebrities and all manner of other public figures, but until April 2006, never to Buckingham Palace.That month, the Queen turned 80, and received some 20,000 birthday cards. I don’t often draw cartoons about the Royal family, but it felt appropriate to mark the occasion. And so I did, with this cartoon depicting two footmen perusing cards displayed on a mantelpiece in the Palace:I didn’t think much of it, though a reader got in touch to lightly admonish me for being disgracefully disrespectful in joking about the Queen’s age. Not long afterwards, however, I received a letter from the Palace, stating that they loved the cartoon and someone – I think the subtext was “someone very senior” – had requested I send the original. Enjoyably, I was able to tell the disgruntled reader that I was sorry they’d been offended, but if it was any comfort, the butt of the joke clearly felt otherwise…That moment was a thrill, but a while later I was invited to lunch at Buckingham Palace. It was me, five or six other people, the Duke and the Queen. I was petrified, as anyone in that position might be, but the nerves only lasted while we waited for their arrival. When they entered the room, the tension seemed to dissipate. I expect that’s the effect they have on a lot of people – in anticipation, they’re terrifying in reality, their great skill is putting a room instantly at ease.I was seated next to Prince Philip, who was exactly as you might imagine: funny, charming, relaxed, mildly cantankerous. Everybody else was served wine but, as was often his wont at lunchtime, he had a beer. I was a little jealous – I quite fancied a beer, too, but changing my order probably wouldn’t have been the done thing.Funnily enough, there was a boat stuck on a sandbank outside of Portsmouth that week – not unlike the recent Suez Canal logjam. The Duke, with all his naval expertise, was explaining at length just what the crew had done wrong, putting them straight on this and that, and generally proving that, even in his mid-80s, his maritime knowledge was undimmed.I also recall a wonderful rant about all the banquets he’s had to attend around the world. In some places, the Duke told me, the staff would even move his cutlery for him, and he found that infuriating. “I’m perfectly capable of moving my own fork when I want it,” he huffed. In a way, it would have been disappointing to lunch with Prince Philip and not hear him bluster.When lunch came to an end, I was asked if I would have coffee with the Queen. (I say asked at those sorts of events, who you speak to is largely based on instruction from staff.)In another room, as I gingerly drank a cup of black coffee, the Queen told me how the geese were ruining her lawn at Sandringham. I suggested she have William and Harry shoot them, which made her laugh. At the time, I hadn’t yet moved to Norfolk, which is a shame, as then I could have said: “We must have you to ours next…”The Queen later remembered my grandfather, VS Pritchett, to whom she awarded membership to the Order of the Companions of Honour in 1992, and seemed thrilled to have worked out that connection. I have been on a high ever since that day. I think I floated back to the office afterwards, but do remember bumping into a colleague in the street who asked if I’d been out to lunch. Had I ever…Throughout his life, Prince Philip was an enthusiastic supporter of cartoons. In 1949, he and the young Princess Elizabeth attended the Royal Society of Arts and listened to a speech by HM Bateman, the great Punch cartoonist, as he called for a national museum of cartoons. It must have left an impression since the Duke later opened the Cartoon Museum’s first permanent site in 2006, and was patron for over 20 years.He really did. He was a  reader, and while I made several jokes at his expense over the years – one, after he retired from public duties in 2017, was simply a plaque reading, “UNVEIL YOUR OWN DAMN PLAQUE” another, after his minor car crash the following year, showing a scrap metal dealer selling “Royal souvenirs” – he always seemed to like my cartoons.In 2018, when I celebrated my 30th anniversary on the paper, he even sent a short tribute.“Successful cartoonists do not only need to be able to draw, they have to think of subjects to illustrate,” he wrote. “Matt has shown that he has a genius for both, as well as the ability to think of wonderfully appropriate swipes at the idiocies of contemporary life.”It was already an amazing day, and I was already a big fan of the Duke, but the shock and honour of having him suggest he was even slightly a fan of mine left me a little lost for words. He was a man who knew the value of good humour, both to puncture the tension of a room and as a way of diluting the serious business of life, and he was a fine exponent of it.The country is far poorer for the Duke’s passing, but one way we might carry on his legacy is to keep on having a good laugh. He wouldn’t have wanted us to stay sombre for long.To own your own Matt print, visit telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178As told to Guy KellyMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"1000 vicars vow defy vaccine passport plans churches","story":"More than 1,000 vicars have indicated they will defy vaccine passport rules if they are implemented in churches, describing them as a “fundamental betrayal” of Christian belief.In an open letter to the Prime Minister concerning vaccine passport proposals, the church leaders said: “To deny people entry to hear this life-giving message and to receive this life-giving ministry would be a fundamental betrayal of Christ and the Gospel.“Sincere Christian churches and organisations could not do this, and as Christian leaders we would be compelled to resist any such Act of Parliament vigorously.”“For the Church of Jesus Christ to shut out those deemed by the state to be social undesirables would be anathema to us and a denial of the truth of the Gospel,” it added.The letter, which is signed by a mix of vicars, reverends, pastors and elders from a range of Christian denominations, also said: “There is also a legitimate fear that this scheme would be the thin end of the wedge leading to a permanent state of affairs in which Covid vaccine status could be expanded to encompass other forms of medical treatment and perhaps even other criteria beyond that.“This scheme has the potential to bring about the end of liberal democracy as we know it and to create a surveillance state in which the government uses technology to control certain aspects of citizens’ lives.“As such, this constitutes one of the most dangerous policy proposals ever to be made in the history of British politics...“We agree with those members of Parliament who have already voiced opposition to this proposal: that it would be isive, discriminatory and destructive to introduce any such mandatory health certification into British society.“We call on the Government to assert strongly and clearly that it will not contemplate this illiberal and dangerous plan, not now and not ever.”Signatories to the letter include Christian leaders from Baptist, evangelical, free church, Church of England, presbyterian and a range of independent churches from across the UK.The call, backed by more than 1,100 clergy, is being led by Rev Dr William Philip, senior minister at the Tron Church in Glasgow, who led the successful Scottish church leaders’ judicial review last month.Unlike in England, the Court of Session heard that a ban on church services in Scotland was unconstitutional and breached human rights. It marked the first legal victory against Covid laws.The open letter, which has also been signed by Rev David Hathaway, founder and president of Eurovision Mission to Europe, comes as last week the Government was warned by its own equalities watchdog that Covid-status certificate schemes or “vaccine passports” could be discriminatory.The Equality and Human Rights Commission is reported to have told the Cabinet Office that such a measure would create a “two-tier society” in the UK.A Church of England spokesman also warned against introducing passports, saying: The Church has adopted a clear policy of encouraging people to be vaccinated, but, other than in very exceptional circumstances, this does not justify limiting access to church services or organisations on the basis of vaccine passports.“Such an approach would run contrary to the principle of the Church being a home and a refuge for all.”A Department for Health and Social Care spokesman was approached for comment.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"crumbling faith no10s covid policies turning public conspiracy","story":"So which is it?

Is it actually the case (verbatim from the Prime Minister): “that the reduction in hospitalisations and in deaths and in infections has not been achieved by the new vaccination programme”? It depends on whether you listen to Boris Johnson before or after the middle of last week.Until Black Tuesday, when the Prime Minister, for reasons known only to himself and presumably the person (or people) who told him to say it, decided to trash his own Government’s greatest triumph – thus not only committing a bizarre act of political self-harm but, more seriously, attempting to undermine public morale and national pride – the British vaccine programme was seen as a modern miracle.It was an unprecedented achievement not just of scientific research, but of the dedication of medical staff, the public-spirited voluntary efforts of thousands of ordinary people, and the willing cooperation of the great majority of the population who made the rational, responsible decision to accept vaccination. Not only was what Mr Johnson said on that last fateful Tuesday damaging to confidence in this most crucially important Government policy, but it was factually wrong – as any number of public health officials and medical experts queued up immediately to make clear.What on earth was he thinking? And since he does not make pronouncements of this kind without consultation – what on earth were the motives of those presumed “experts” who must have advised him to make it? (Who were obviously not the ones who leapt into the arena to contradict him.) The context is important: the Prime Minister was comparing the impact of the vaccination programme with that of lockdown, claiming that the former was negligible (indeed, virtually non-existent) by comparison with the latter.Maybe this is the key. He was trying to rescue the viability of lockdown which might otherwise have lost its force in the great vaccine rollout exultation. That argument might have been convincing if he had said that, in the legitimate national celebration over vaccinations, we must not lose sight of the need to maintain those lockdown restrictions which are still necessary at present...blah-blah. But he didn’t say that.What he did say seemed to imply that no vaccination programme – however comprehensive – could provide a solution to the problem and a return to genuine (not “new”) normal life. And that is a direct contradiction to what was popularly understood to be the promise from the medical and scientific experts who told us – way back in the era when our lives were first taken away – that the only ultimate answer to this dilemma lay in finding a vaccine.Now we have not just “a vaccine” but a quiverful of them, all of which seem to be remarkably effective – more so than most of the vaccines used against other diseases (even though the broadcast media insist that every new variant may, just possibly, prove resistant, etc etc). Could this be part of the problem? Were the experts taken by surprise when this sudden avalanche of vaccines arrived on the scene so quickly that they felt in danger of losing control of the discourse – and their ability to hold down public expectations?The most charitable explanation of Mr Johnson’s comment, and presumably the advice that drove it, is that some of the people in charge believed there was a real risk that the optimism would get out of hand and the whole apparatus of regulation would collapse. In their panic, they urged him to say something that was misleading, illogical and self-defeating: in effect, encouraging vaccine scepticism and undermining the Government’s own “get the jab” campaign.But in the longer term, this unfortunate and gratuitous intervention could do greater damage than any immediate effect it might have on vaccine take-up. (In fact, this appears to be negligible: people are just as eager for the jabs as ever, partly because they have been told they might not be able to travel or get into the pub without them.)In the last week, I have heard more people express serious suspicion about the Government’s authoritarian motives than at any time since this whole crisis began. Because the Prime Minister himself seemed to fling the whole question of vaccine efficacy out of the window – when it had once been presented as the be-all and end-all of pandemic solutions – there is now grave disquiet among sensible, thinking parts of the population about where this is all going and what is driving it.What would once have been thought the stuff of cult paranoia is now commonplace conversation in socially enlightened circles. The most common refrain is to the effect that either the Government and its experts were lying then, or they are lying now: that there is something sinister about their desire to maintain a pretext for totalitarian measures.For what it is worth, I personally do not believe that there is a cabal of Maoists at the top level of the Government who wish to maintain repressive social controls forever. But I am finding it harder and harder to argue with the people who do. There is now a real sense that frightening the population into obedience is more important than telling the truth, and that faith in the Government’s promises – even in a crisis – is for mugs.There is one possible explanation which is less diabolical but equally destructive: that the Government has taken account of the fear that still prevails in the country and wants to address it. To those who tell the opinion polls that they do not want to be set free yet, reassurance is being offered.But anxiety is a natural (indeed, essential) part of the human apparatus. It cannot be extirpated but it can be inflamed to levels which eventually destroy the prospect of social well-being. Cancelling optimism is a dangerous game.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sweden tolls bell knight pacific tribe dances deity world marked","story":"Flags fell to half mast around the world on Saturday as people paid their respects to the Duke of Edinburgh and countries across the Commonwealth marked national days of mourning.Unable to attend the funeral due to coronavirus restrictions, royals and heads of state paid tribute to the Duke through statements and observing local customs.Sweden\u0027s King Carl XVI Gustaf, a distant relative of the Queen, and Queen Sonja sent wreaths to the Royal Family and released a number of photographs of the Duke from state visits to Sweden in 1956 and 1983. The Duke was made a Knight of the Order of the Seraphim by King Gustaf VI Adolf on 23 June 1954.For an hour at noon, a single bell tolled at Riddarholmen Church in Stockholm, the resting place of most Swedish monarchs, with the Duke’s photo and Royal Order of the Seraphim shield displayed inside.On Instagram, the Danish royal family highlighted the Duke’s Danish heritage and insignia. Born Prince of Denmark and Greece before renouncing his titles to marry the Queen, he chose to include the Order of the Elephant, Denmark\u0027s highest-ranked honour, on the altar at his funeral, alongside Greek insignia.Flags flew at half-mast at Amalienborg Castle in Copenhagen, the main residence of the Danish royal family, as well as at the Royal Palace in Oslo. Meanwhile all Canadian and Australian flags flew at half mast, both at home and abroad.The government of Canada was due to hold a service at Christ Church Cathedral in Ottawa without a congregation owing to coronavirus restrictions, with virtual tributes and performances instead marking the Duke’s long-standing connection to the country.In Malta, where the Queen and Prince Philip lived from 1949-51 while the Duke was serving on board HMS Magpie, part of the Royal Navy’s Mediterranean Fleet, a nine-gun salute was fired from canons above the Grand Harbour in the capital Valletta - one for each decade of his life. At the couple’s former home just outside the city, which is currently undergoing renovation before it opens as a museum, flowers formed as the George Cross and a wreath of poppies were hung on the door. Mourners left flowers and cards on the steps, many in the colours of the Union Jack. “You were a grandfather figure to the Maltese people,” read one note. “We will always keep memories of your visit to Malta close to our hearts.”But it is one tribe in Vanuatu, who regarded Prince Philip as a god-like figure, who perhaps held the liveliest tribute. They marked the Duke’s funeral with ceremonial drinking of the native plant Kava, dancing and speeches. His following among the tribe began in 1971 after he visited the Pacific nation and took part in some traditional rituals on the northern island of Malekula. It then evolved over the decades, with the two parties occasionally exchanging gifts, photographs and letters.The funeral service at Windsor was broadcast internationally and across major channels. Some viewers in Australia and New Zealand, where the funeral procession started between 10pm and 2am, stayed up all night to take it in.While a memorial service attended by Australian officials took place last weekend, mourners visited Government House in Canberra, the official residence of the Governor-General of Australia, to leave messages of condolence for the Queen, which would be sent to Buckingham Palace.Queen Elizabeth Stakes Day, one of Australia’s biggest horse races, also went ahead on Saturday with a tribute to Prince Philip displayed on a screen and some jockeys wearing black arm bands.The Falkland Islands held a memorial service a day earlier attended by members of the local government, military officials and residents at Christ Church cathedral in Port Stanley.Many attendees recounted their own memories of the Duke, who visited the overseas territory in the South Atlantic in 1957 and again in 1991, taking part in a horse race and fishing trip with residents at the time. Photographs of the two visits were on display at the church.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"exclusive northern ireland faces medicine shortages unless brexit","story":"Last month the UK delayed the implementation of some new sea border processes without EU agreement, prompting the EU to take legal action.From 1 January 2022, Northern Ireland will be tied to the EU’s policy on medicine supplies indefinitely.The case of the NHS supplies was why the DUP had “vigorously opposed any special arrangements which would alter Northern Ireland’s constitutional position as an integral part of the United Kingdom”.Lord Dodds said that “the provisions of the Northern Ireland Protocol mean we are always looking over our shoulder to the stuttering vaccination schemes being rolled out across the EU”.He said: “Covid-19 and the debate around vaccine supply has taught us an important lesson – that the EU will never be afraid to use the provisions of the protocol to gain an advantage against the UK.”Government sources said medicine supplies were raised in “constructive” talks between Lord Frost and Mr Šefčovič last Thursday.A government spokesman said: “The UK Government continues to work intensively with the EU to address outstanding issues with the Northern Ireland Protocol and minimise its impact on day-to-day-lives.“We are also working closely with industry partners and the NI Executive to help ensure continuity of medicines supply to Northern Ireland.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ex politicians have earn living need safeguards against gaining","story":"At stake are questions about the propriety of governance and the conduct of those in positions of power. Questions about conflicts of interest and ease of access to government by both current and former politicians and officials are also pertinent.Are the codes governing conduct sufficiently clear, applicable and adhered to? How well are they understood by those to whom they apply?When Eric Pickles, who chairs the body which oversees the Business Appointment Rules (ACOBA), appeared before our committee on Thursday, his frustration was palpable. After all, his organisation has only a narrow remit and limited means of redress. Therefore, it must be questioned whether the rules are sufficiently effective and robust.Of course, when a politician or senior official leaves public office, they need to earn a living. One day, when the electorate dispenses with my services, I shall be among their ranks. However, what is critical is that adequate safeguards are in place to prevent unfair advantage and personal gain by virtue of the office or position they held.The apparent double-hatting of civil servants with private jobs while working in public service in areas that seem to suggest a direct conflict of interest, meanwhile, is odd. It is right that the Cabinet Secretary has told officials to properly declare such things. However, it is difficult to understand why this was not already the case.There also needs to be a thorough review of propriety issues relating to the use of consultants and contractors in government. How effectively are any conflicts of interest managed? How quickly spins any revolving door?After estate agents and MPs, lobbyists sometimes have mixed reviews. For many, this is unfair. But how far does the Lobbying Act offer effective regulation? Are any key aspects of lobbying omitted?There are many questions to be posed, many lines of inquiry to follow. I have confidence that the members of the cross-party PACAC will ask and pursue them to the fullest degree. Yes, there will be considerable attention given to any former prime ministers who come to give evidence. Beyond that there are important considerations which have perhaps been seen as unglamorous and unfashionable.PACAC may not be the AC-12 of Whitehall, nor do we envisage encountering anything quite as exciting as in a television drama such as Line of Duty. However, it is at least a sense of duty that motivates our work, just as duty and service motivates the vast majority of those in public life.

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeAs any parent will tell you, it’s not easy to come up with pocket-­friendly meals that will please even the pickiest of eaters. So when I saw a book called Feed Your Family For £ A Week In A Hurry, I was intrigued – and sceptical. With two adults and two ever-hungry teenage boys to feed though, I normally spend four times that amount but was ­determined to give it a go. In the book, author Lorna Cooper works out an eight-week meal schedule, bulk buying and shopping around. I picked a random week’s menu and went to the supermarket to seeI really could feed us all for £ a head for seven days. What you think  Have your say below Sunday Oh dear. Let’s just say we don’t get off to the best start. My sweet potato nests – made by baking grated sweet potato then adding spinach and egg and baking again – get zero marks for presentation. The egg keeps sliding off the top and by the time the white is cooked, the yolk is rubbery. But cheered by the p cost, I’m not giving up yet. Lunch is a definite improvement. The cheese and onion pasties are supposed to be leftovers from a previous week but I make them fresh. The recipe makes six, so I think it’s overambitious to expect it to feed four of us for two meals – though it might workyour kids are young. If you did manage to stretch this to two meals, each one would be p. In the evening, the sausage tray bake is a big hit. You parboil potatoes, make a barbecue sauce, add vegetables and sausages then just throw the whole thing in the oven. I can’t find frozen Mediterranean veg in either of the supermarkets I go to so buy it fresh, pushing the price up. At £., I feel guilty for busting the budget.  MondayIt’s granola bars for breakfast. They’re made with porridge oats, honey and peanut butter, with whatever seeds,nuts and dried fruit you have in the cupboard.To feed the four of us, this uses two-thirds of a jar of honey and three-quarters of a jar of peanut butter. It’s delicious, but too sweet for breakfast. I try not to think about the calories but it’s only £.. Lunch is an apple slaw sandwich made with mayo, ­cheddar, apple and spring onion. I can’t find frozen apple, so I use a fresh one instead. Served with homemade rolls, it’s just p for all of us. Ham and egg rice this evening is essentially a simple risotto. Half is meant to be kept for later, but it’s so tasty and we’re so greedy we eat most of it up. If you do manage to restrain yourself, it would work out at £. for each meal.  Tuesday I made today’s breakfast – chocolate and banana overnight oats – before going to bed and it’s nice to have it ready and waiting. I’m surprised to learn I should have maple syrup, which is expensive, in my cupboard, so I use honey instead. This only serves one so would cost £. for four. It’s thick and satisfying but rather heavy. The boys take one look and reach for a box of cereal. Mediterranean sardine salad for lunch is exotic-sounding, healthy and delicious. But at £., it’s one of the pricier lunch options and the boys refuse to eat it. Sigh. For dinner, squash and chilli soup is spicy, filling and – served with my homemade rolls instead of the suggested part-baked baguette – cheap. As half of it is left over, dinner comes in at just £..  Wednesday The day starts with apple and pear muffins – essentially fairy cakes with one apple and one pear in  muffins – so the vitamin C boost is ­minimal. The boys are aghast at the thought of these for ­breakfast and fill their bowls with cereal. Cost: £. for , which will do as snacks plus breakfast for the adults on Friday. Lunch is a curried egg mayo sandwich, which is enjoyed by everyone. It’s tasty and zingy and will be made again – especially as it cost just p. In the evening, we have honey, garlic and soy chicken stir fry. Unfortunately, I’ve run out of soy sauce and honey which Lorna says should be in my cupboard, so I have to buy more. To balance the cost, rather than spending extra on frozen stir fry veg, I throw in frozen peas and sweetcorn, and a pepper and carrots that are going soft in the fridge. This £. meal is a hit.  Thursday Breakfast is a mint choc chip smoothie which is very rich and leaves me feeling a little queasy. It serves one to two so clearly I should have shared it. I’m also not convinced that anything containing chocolate chips is a healthy breakfast. Cost: p for four. Lunch is what little remains of the ham and egg rice – so it’s sandwiches for most – and dinner is hidden broccoli pasta. It’s concealed in pesto, although suspicious children who are picky eaters may well wonder what makes it green. You need a food processor to make this and there’s an awful lot of washing up afterwards. My boys don’t object to broccoli so this goes down quite well.

Personally, I think it could have done with more pasta. In all though, it cost £.. Friday Breakfast is apple and pear muffins and lunch is leftover soup from Tuesday. For dinner, we have steamed fish with couscous parcels. One of my sons won’t eat fish so he has yesterday’s leftovers. It’s just as well because this recipe for four has only three fillets, so wouldn’t have been enough for the boys. This £. dish is a bit of a disaster as the recipe doesn’t say to thaw the fish, so we cook it from frozen, which takes ages. Saturday We start the weekend with a healthy berry crush smoothie – but at £., it really blows the budget. The bruschetta for lunch redresses the balance at £.. It’s bursting with flavour but a bit of a faff. It’s supposed to serve six, but there’s barely enough for four. Completing our healthy day is a mandarin and chickpea curry which the author insists tastes better than it sounds – and to our surprise it does. It rounds the week off at £.… or at least it wouldthe kids had agreed to eat it. Total spend: £.  Verdict I failed… but I’ve only spent around £ per head for the week, which is pretty good. If I’d shopped around, bought more in bulk or chosen dferent recipes, I think I could have done it for less. Breakfast and lunch are more interesting than my usual fruit and cheese sandwich too. My fussy teenagers wouldn’t eat everything, but I’m going to try a few other recipes in the book out on them. The author expects you to have a well-stocked store cupboard with spices and things like maple syrup and sweet chilli sauce. Buying or replacing those will push the bill up. Some recipes also need gadgets like a blender andyou’re a snacker, you’ll need to budget for that too. Lornaaposs top tips ● Buy what you need in bulk and go to dferent places over the course of a month. For example, head to the supermarket one week, the freezer shop the next, then to the market and also visit bargain stores. ● Every couple of months, stock up on things like rice and spices at the Asian supermarket. ● Grow fresh herbs on your kitchen windowsill. ● If meat is on offer, buy it and cook it before you freeze it to make le easier. ● Onions keep wellstored in old tights. Simply pop one in and twist the tights around it before adding another. ● Freeze liquids like milk and cream in ice trays to use in dishes such as soups and sauces.

It is acceptable,” Mr Eustice said. He also argued ministers shouldn’t have to declare who they meet with, because it doesn’t “matter”. Fundamentally what matters is how ministers react, not who they talk to, he said. He argued that in his role he meets with a range of people, including constituents, farmers and environmental activists. He said: What matters is not who Iaposve spoken to, but whether Iaposm unduly influenced by the people I speak to. And Iaposm not. BBC Host Andrew Marr put to him that his argument amounted to let us regulate ourselves, we are above and beyond suspicion. In response, Mr Eustice argued the rules on lobbying - which allowed David Cameronaposs texts to Mr Sunak to go undeclared, and the private drink with Matt Hancock to go undeclared - were already robust.

Mr Eustice, who was Mr Cameronaposs press secretary when he was leader of the opposition, said: I think the key thing is that he has not broken any of the rules.

She had lingered over their parting, perhaps touching the casket with a kiss on her gloved fingers, before composing herself and preparing to face the world. When Her Majesty the Queen emerged yesterday to bid farewell to her consort she was the picture of dignity and stoicism. But behind her Covid-compliant mask and the invisible armour of duty the monarch was simply a grieving widow. Anguished Lilibet, mourning her beloved Philip, the light of her le for more than  years. What did you think of the service  Have your say in comments below And in her black mourning clothes on a dazzling spring afternoon she looked smaller, more frail and more alone than ever. Pale, bowed, a little unsteady - but determined to ensure the Duke of Edinburgh got the send off he had wanted. A fleet of cars had ferried most of the mourners to St George’s Chapel before the Prince’s coffin left the castle with senior royals walking behind the Land Rover hearse. In an unconventional gesture of respect the Queen followed behind in a maroon State Bentley, accompanied by her most-trusted lady-in-waiting, Lady Susan Hussey. The car stopped at the chapel’s Galilee Porch and the Queen got out to be greeted by the Dean of Westminster.  They exchanged a few words and then she paused and half-turned listening to the final round of the minute salutes which were fired from the same field gun used at her wedding to Philip in . She was led into the chapel, with her Lady in Waiting following. Lady Hussey was not one of the  official mourners but remained in attendance in case she was needed. The Queen was guided to her seat in the second row of the quire stalls on the right, closest to the altar. In front of her was the empty, purple-draped catafalque, awaiting her husband’s coffin. Outside it was being carried up the West Steps, where the bearer party paused for the national minute’s silence.  The Queen marked it inside, standing with her head bowed. Then a Royal Navy piping party piped the Carry On call and the Queen turned to watch the coffin was borne down the aisle, topped with her wreath of white lilies, roses, freesia, sweet peas and jasmine. She watched intently as it was gently set down, her eyes resting on the naval cap and sword that Philip had worn to accompany her to thousands of official s. And the empty seat beside her, was another reminder of the loss of her consort - the strength and stay who helped her bear the burden of monarchy. “Grief is the price we pay for love,” Elizabeth once said at a time of national mourning.  But after a loving marriage lasting  years the depth of her own grief was impossible to fathom. During the service the TV cameras only occasionally focused on the Queen, respecting the strain of the occasion. Her face mask was trimmed in white and a glittering brooch was pinned above her heart. But each time she bowed her head in prayer her black hat made her become almost invisible against the dark wooden quire. And you ached for someone to be able to place their hand on hers for the briefest, protocol-breaking moment of compassion.  But while the cruel constraints of a global pandemic left Elizabeth physically isolated yesterday, she was certainly not alone in her darkest hour. Because the thoughts, prayers and affection of the nation and Commonwealth were with her. And every single person who has lost a loved one to coronavirus felt an extra twinge of a sadness for her pain. Most of those tuning in to watch the TV coverage of the funeral have only ever known the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh as a partnership. “My husband and I” became part of the English language, the Queen’s unique royal catchphrase.  For while Philip always walked a respectful two steps behind he was still the other half of the team. And as they weathered the storms of family like and the changing fortunes of the nation, Elizabeth and Philip represented constancy, commitment and devotion. Philip had planned his funeral to the very last detail to reflect his le, faith and passions. When the order of service was released the palace had explained his choice of music and the signicance of military ceremonial. But the Queen was the only person who truly understood the symbols and references.  Because she had shared the le, the faith and the passions… and every detail must have sparked another achingly poignant memory. And yet she remained strong and composed, just as he would have expected. If her composure failed her at all it must have been at the moment Philip’s coffin disappeared from sight - lowered into the royal vault on a mechanical lt. It will remain there until the Queen passes and they can be laid to rest together. As it slipped away yesterday a lone piper played a lament, walking out of the chapel so the notes drted poignantly away.  But then, so typically of Philip, he had asked for Action Stations to be sounded. It was his way of telling his we and family “Back to work now, just get on with it.” Elizabeth did just that, leaving the chapel clutching the order of service and ing to Windsor Castle. In the months they spent alone together in lockdown they had been “reminiscing madly”, a royal source revealed. They watched cine camera films which Philip had had digitised and went through treasured family snaps.

Under Boris Johnsonaposs roadmap out of lockdown, non-essential foreign travel, which is currently banned, could be allowed again from May Covid cases in the UK continue to fall.A report by Robert Boyle, former strategy chief at BA, and circulated in the travel industry, said that most of Europe will be classied as amber or red - meaning quarantine will be required, according to The .It ranks  countries based on vaccination rates, infection levels, iants and capacity for genome sequencing - the four criteria used by the UK government. People arriving from countries listed as red would be required to quarantine at a hotel at a cost of £, - making them far less appealing as holiday destinations. France, the Netherlands, Turkey, Croatia, Sweden, Belgium and Luxembourg should be red under the criteria, researchers found, but this is unlikely to happen for political reasons, the report said.

You could be forgiven for thinking it sounds like a script for smash BBC hit Line Of Duty. But this is not fiction. It is the reality for an elite police unit who now star in their own fly-on-the-wall series looking at the war on organised crime. Fast Justice, which starts tonight on Dave, follows Operation Sentinel, a -strong team with one mission – to make le a misery for organised crime groups . In their turbo-charged BMWs, which reach speeds above mph, the Sentinels roam all over Suffolk hunting in packs of three vehicles. Have your say in the comments below They target the foot soldiers of gangs who operate within their borders, running drugs and sometimes weapons in “county lines” networks based in from London. Sgt Mike Moon, who heads the Sentinel team, says their job is to make le so hostile for gangs that they leave for good. “I’ve been around long enough to know that with enforcement of the law by the police in isolation, we’re just pushing water uphill,” he says.  “This is a health matter, it’s an educational thing, it’s about social justice – all sorts of really complex issues we can’t solve. “What we can do is make this county, which is my concern, a really hostile place for OCGs to come and earn their money. “If we catch them, then we nick them and we take their money, we take their cars, we take their communications, and we do it time and time again.”  “Burner” phones and other dodgy devices are commonplace for Line of Duty’s AC-, but it is not just Supt Ted Hastingswho is interested in seizing such technology. “I like being a disruptor,” admits PC Sophie Mitchell, one of only five women in Sentinel. “Criminals need two major things to operate – communication and transport. “If they can get around and they can communicate, they’re going to be making money.  “Sowe can take the cars off them and take their devices, then that’s great.” Violence, too, is commonplace. Sgt Moon explains: “It’s a dangerous business. Drug gangs kidnap and torture each other. “We’ve had groups robbing each other, people getting stabbed, people getting murdered.” Another serious problem on their radar is human trafficking. In Fast Justice, officers enter a small terraced house to find every room filled with dirty mattresses, with locks on the doors and young Eastern European men cowering in the corner.

Says PC Mitchell: “OCGs aren’t interested in the wellbeing of these iniduals. It’s all about money.” Thanks to Line of Duty, viewers have got to grips with lingo like OCGs, MITand AFO .  The current series introduced a new one, a CHIS or Covert Human Intelligence Source. Sgt Moon explains: “We get intelligence from lots of sources, including CHIS. “We also share information between police forces and other agencies, we get calls from the public, Crimestoppers, CCTV – all directions. So when a car linked to OCGs is in our area, we’re on them quickly.” "},{"url":null,"title":"i served afghanistan came back","story":"NewsI served in Afghanistan but when I came back to the UK I became gangland kidnapperFormer soldier Darren Wright, from Manchester, now hopes to offer a beacon of help for others in a similar situation, saying prison saved his lemirrorShareCommentsByNeal Keeling:,  APR NewsDarren Wright, who set up Veterans Into Logistics, a Heywood-based company which trains ex-service men and women to drive trucks \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters. Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeA former soldier has lted the lid on his battle after leaving the military - which saw him become a gangland kidnapper as he struggled with PTSD. Darren Wright now hopes to offer a beacon of help for others in a similar situation, saying prison saved his le. He was inspired to turn his le around after the death of a close friend from his army days. Darrenaposs pal Sergeant Jamie Doyle had taken his own le within a year of leaving the army, after struggling to adapt when his  years of service was up.Darren had seen too many others finding theinto civilian le punishing - including himself, the Manchester Evening News reports.He, too, had left the army only to soon find himself suicidal and aposlostapos. I was in a bad way. I didnapost want to live. I just didnapost care about le, he says. His own spiral downwards ended up in criminality - and he admits the only reason he is still alive today is because he was handed an -year prison sentence. Now out and reformed after getting the help he needed, Darren is determined to provide a rescue path for those in a similar position to what he found himself in. He is highly motivated, confident, and straight talking - with all the le experience to keep others from making the same mistakes. Darrenaposs upbringing was tough. He had left school with no qualications, was a father by the time he was , and a dad of three at . The army was a way out and an opportunity and so, back in  at the age of , Darren signed up.  I wanted to get a better le for myself and my kids, he says of his decision. He was voted best recruit and served for five years with the Royal Artillery as a gunner and paratrooper. He served in Afghanistan aposwhen each day you didnapost knowyou would step on IEDapos. Before being discharged, Darren spent a spell in a military hospital, where medics failed to diagnose that he was suffering from PTSD. Then, after he left the army, things began to spiral out of control for Darren. When I came out of the military my head was in bits. I was drinking, taking drugs. When I joined, the army became my family. When you leave you miss all that. I tried taking my own le and spent three months in a wheelchair. I threw myself in front of a car.  I was in a bad way. I didnapost want to live. I just didnapost care about le. I would drink at night just to get through the night. I was lost. I lost my relationship and became a distant father, from my kids. Darren had even further to fall. I got sucked into criminality. I was debt collecting. It is a common thing - people think you are aposAndy McNabapos - you have been in the military and can offer a professional service - you are a trained soldier, you have skills.  I did that for two years. Two years not being a parent, two years wanting to die. It ended catastrophically. He was convicted of kidnapping and given an  year sentence - reduced to  years and three months after he pleaded guilty.The kidnap gang he was part of got the wrong man when they tried to abduct a businessman from his home, in a £.m plot in .A shopkeeper was taken at gunpoint from a house in Glasgow. But it was his son, then , who was the intended victim. The younger man was shot at as he tried to rescue his dad. For three weeks the victim was kept hooded and handcuffed while held captive in Manchester and Heywood. The kidnappers were arrested when an undercover cop left a suitcase containing £, by an emergency phone on the M near Charnock Richard. Darrenaposs arrest was the start of his way back.  I committed a crime and it was prison that saved my le, he says now. I would not be talking to you nowhad not not got a custodial sentence. It was in prison that I got the help I needed, and the support. When he emerged from prison in , having been diagnosed and treated for PTSD, his head was clear. Within a week he had a job as a truck driver - making use of the licence he obtained while in the army. If Iaposd been diagnosed correctly upon leaving the army with suffering from PTSD and got the correct treatment, I wouldnapost have ended up in prison, my kids wouldnapost have grown up without a dad. Instead I was left to self medicate with alcohol and drugs, he says. I regret the crime I committed, I regret the distress I caused to the victimaposs family, but I wasnapost mentally right and going to prison saved my le, Darren adds. It is a shame that I had to commit a crime and get sent to prison to get correctly diagnosed from suffering from PTSD. If only the MOD took better care of the iniduals who fight for their country. Now more resilient and determined to shed his criminal links, Darren survived another setback in .  He was recalled to prison for three months when a member of his family was shot in Manchester and he was deemed by police to be a threat to le. He lost the job due to the recall but quickly found another. He has been in full time employment ever since and is now giving a leline to those at risk of ending up where he did. Darren set up Veterans Into Logistics, a Heywood-based company which trains ex-service men and women to drive trucks, after Jamieaposs death. The reason I set up the company was because one of my friends took his own le in . I walked away from the funeral thinking more needs to be done for veterans, who are coming out of service and canapost access employment and further training. He hopes to plug a flaw in the system which means veterans who are not academically gted miss out on training, despite building up thousands of pounds in credits during their service for post army retraining.

Paula Parfitt is hoping Her Majesty will intervene to save brain-damaged Pippa Knight by granting a Prerogative of Mercy order. Historically used by monarchs since the th century to commute a death sentence, it can now be used to change any penalty. Paula’s move follows a Court of Appeal and Supreme Court refusal to overturn a High Court decision backing doctors treating Pippa at London’s Evelina Children’s Hospital. At  months, in December , Pippa was hit by a brain disorder after a chest infection and hand, foot and mouth disease. What do you think  Have your say in the comments below Doctors believe she developed acute necrotising encephalopathy triggered by viruses. After an MRI scan, parents Paula and Karl Knight were advised to turn off Pippa’s le support. The couple refused and, after three months in hospital and a further three months in a rehabilitation centre, Pippa was allowed tohome in June . Sadly, Karl died that year, without seeing the progress his girl made. She learned how to walk with a frame and regained some speech.  But in January  she had a fever which led to another brain injury and she had to battle back from multi-organ failure. She has remained on ventilation in intensive care ever since and medics say she is in a vegetative state with “no prospect of improvement”. But Paula, , takes Pippa on to the hospital balcony on portable ventilation, and says: “I understand how it feels for your husband to pass away and I offer my deepest condolences to the Queen.  “But I want to say to her, ‘please give my Pippa a chance’. Two years and three months after doctors said she wouldn’t survive, she is still here. She’s proved she wants to survive.” She says her daughter has shown signs of movement and wants her put on a portable ventilator so she canto her home in Strood, Kent. Paula is also appealing to the European Court of Human Rights. “Pippa is my inspiration. I get my strength from her,” says Christian Paula. “I will never give up on her.

Her family were eager to see her but they became worried when she failed to show up at her home in New Inn at the scheduled time. After a few frantic hours, her loved ones were told that she had been taken to a home in Newport, more than eight miles away, and tucked up in a strangeraposs bed. Her son Brian Mahoney, from Cwmbran, told WalesOnline: The whole thing was a catalogue of errors from start to finish. Weaposd originally been called at about pm on that day and told mum was on her way home, so my we went over there to greet her.About an hour later I rang to see what was happening and was told she still hadnapost turned up. When warehouse manager Brian, , phoned the hospital he was told there had been a bit of a problem. He said: Mum had suffered a stroke not so long back, so naturally we were concerned something bad had happened to her.At about .pm I eventually got a call saying sheaposd been taken to a house in Newport, but that the details werenapost really clear. Brian spoke to someone from the ambulance service and found out his mum had been taken to the wrong address.

Brian said he was still awaiting an official explanation. He suspects his mumaposs details were confused with those of a female patient with dementia who was also due to go home from the hospital the same day. He added: As far as I can tell, mum was taken to this other ladyaposs house by mistake and, somehow, whoever answered the door told the ambulance staff to take her into the bedroom and make her comfortable.How they failed to notice it wasnapost their relative, I canapost say.But apparently they went to check on her a little while later and thataposs when the penny finally dropped and the alarm was raised. Elizabeth was then readmitted to hospital. Her son said: Mum initially wanted to come straight home but we insisted she go back in to get checked out, especially after having just had coronavirus - God knows what the house she was taken to was like. Brian blamed his motheraposs frightened and confused state for her failure to point out the mix-up as it was happening. He added: Mumaposs a very quiet woman anyway and has been on her own since Dad died in . However, she did later tell us that she couldnapost work out why she was being called by a dferent name. Also, given the woman sheaposd been mistaken for has dementia, my guess is any attempt to point out it wasnapost her house was possibly put down to her being a bit muddled.Who knows, she may have even looked at the unfamiliar surroundings and thought weaposd decided to put her in a care home. Itaposs heartbreaking. All we want is to find out how this occurred and ensure no one  ever has to go through a similar experience.

The only royal who showed him any sympathy was his uncle, Prince Andrew, who is himself an outsider, sources claim. Harry joined relatives for the first time in more than a year as they said farewell to the Duke of Edinburgh, who died on April  aged . According to the Mail on Sunday, Princess Anne, Prince Edward and his we Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, did not acknowledge him before or during the service at Windsor Castle. Only Prince Andrew, who stepped back from royal duties after a disastrous interview with the BBC in , sympathised with him, a source told the newspaper. They said: He knows from Sarah Ferguson – and now first-hand – how it feels to be the outsider, which Harry very much is. As far as the others are concerned, there is a deep sense of protection towards the Queen and resentment towards Harry. There is little sympathy for him after what he and Meghan said on Oprah. In the bombshell interview, Harry and Meghan made a string of allegations about the family. Meghan said she was offered no support when she suffered a mental health crisis, and Harry claimed royals including his father and brother were trapped in their role.  The couple also alleged that an unnamed royal had asked about son Archieaposs skin colour, suggesting that they would have a problemhe was dark skinned.

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeFor almost  years they exchanged letters that were chatty, tender, kind… and at times even a little bizarre.Today Prince Philip ’s loyal pen pal Liona Boyd reveals her extraordinary friendship with “the most wonderful, kind and humorous man”.Musician Liona told the Sunday Mirror how she “clicked” with the Duke when they were introduced at a royal event in the Seventies. She said the pair went on to exchange hundreds of letters, each of hers scented with French perfume. But their friendship truly took off when the Duke invited Liona aboard his private plane in  – and personally flew her from Manchester to a naval base in Norfolk. What do you think of this story  Let us know in the comments section below. She told us: “I was so shocked when he took the controls himself. It was a bit bumpy.” Liona,  – who was photographed with the plane’s mascot, a cuddly hedgehog named Lunch – recounted the “surreal” flight in his Hawker Siddeley  in her autobiography. It tells how she “chatted with the crew, sat in the Queen’s chair, tested out her ‘loo’ and nibbled on crustless cucumber sandwiches” while Philip visited a local bakery. The Prince had offered her the lt after a performance in Leeds for the Outward Bound Trust, of which he was patron and chairman until .  Her book In My Own Key tells how, after landing, he gave her “a quick kiss on the cheek and vanished into the morning rain”. Although born in London, classical guitarist Liona grew up in Canada and was first introduced to the Queen and Prince Philip after performing at a private dinner at the National Arts Centre in Ottawa in . Some years later she posted him her CD and says she was “stunned” when he not only replied but continued responding to further letters she sent. “He always wrote back right away,” Liona told us. “He was very prompt. I sent him poetry – he said my lyrics were brilliant. I was thrilled and never took it for granted.  “He became one of the most wonderful anchors of my le. I loved those trips to the post office, seeing his beautul stamps.” Liona, who has recorded  albums and worked with stars including Eric Clapton and Olivia Newton-John, found herself invited to royal events as the friendship blossomed. She recalls sitting next to the Duke at a dinner for the World Wide Fund for Nature in Toronto in . Liona says: “The places were set and I didn’t have a fork, so he scampered off to the kitchen to get me one. You’d expect a page or someone to do that. “The Nylons were playing, he sang along to The Lion Sleeps Tonight.”  In her autobiography she calls Philip “a delightful dinner companion”. She writes: “Was this really the Queen’s husband chuckling mischievously as he told me how, one night balancing on a wooden ‘loo’ outside in the rain, he was bitten by mosquitoes and blackflies on unmentionable body parts he’d neglected to spray ” Liona also shared with us some of the letters Philip wrote to her. We have obscured some of his words to protect personal details.  In one, written in November , Philip tells her: “Fundraising events are rarely unmitigated pleasure!! But your company at Ontorio Place [sic] made it a very happy evening for me”. He also reached out to Liona after an earthquake hit Calornia in . She says: “He sent a telegram saying he hoped our house was okay. It was so kind. I framed it.” Two years later Liona had an invitation to perform at Windsor Castle and stay overnight with her then husband. She wrote a song especially and Philip introduced her to the Queen Mother and Princess Margaret. Liona told us how she sneaked in a camera and summoned the “chutzpah” to ask for a photo with the Queen and Prince Philip during a tour of Henry VII’s armour. Speaking from her home in Palm Beach, Florida, she tells how she spritzed her letters to the Duke in French perfume and sent him “sweet” Valentine’s cards right up until this year, when lockdown prevented her. In her second book, No Remedy for Love, she recalled how the Duke once “teased” her for using Beverley Hills stationery, telling her: “Get some new writing paper!”  Asking him once about artwork for an album, she says he “chuckled mischievously and suggested I wear three maple leaves and nothing !” But after asking him for a hug in Toronto to “thank him for all the years of letter-writing and friendship”, she told us how he instead “shook his head and kissed me on each cheek”. Liona says the Duke “hand-typed, or hand-wrote all his letters in pretty good handwriting” – writing “Dear Liona” and signing off “Yours ever” or “Love, Philip”. And she reveals: “He was insulted when I once askedhe dictated the letters. I always used to wonder how he had time to write to me.” In a note sent from Sandringham in , the Duke wrote: “The older I get, the quicker birthdays seem to come.” He signed it, “With love, Philip”. In two letters in  he detailed his excitement about VE Day celebrations and complimented Liona’s latest CD. And in  he confided in one letter that he “didn’t expect to live that much longer,” she said. It prompted her to arrange a visit to Windsor Castle the following March, in which she played him guitar and says he gave her his blessing to mention their friendship in her books. Liona, known in Canada as the “First Lady of Guitar”, told how she dedicated a song about horses to the Duke after he told her the animals are “some of my best friends”.  He also confided about the dficulties of royal le, telling her it “hasn’t always been easy and maybe it had ended his freedom,” she says. Telling how she even sent the Duke postcards, she adds: “I think he lived vicariously through my adventures.” Though he stopped sending physical letters a year ago, Liona says Philip’s most recent correspondence was an email in March via his private secretary “wishing my sister and I condolences on losing our mother”.

While the lowering of the coffin normally takes place in private, the moment was shown on live television and online streams in a historic first for Britainaposs Royal Family. The Duke of Edinburgh, who died aged  on April , is the th royal to be interred inside the Royal Vault, though it will not be his final resting place. When the Queen dies, he will be transferred to the gothic church’s King George VI memorial chapel to lie alongside his devoted we of  years.  The monarch, , wore a face mask and sat alone during the socially-distanced funeral, which was held with just  mourners due to Englandaposs coronavirus lockdown rules.An electric motor was used to lower Philip incredibly slowly from the Quire to the Royal Vault as the Dean of Windsor read the Commendation and the Garter King of Arms proclaimed the y list of the duke’s regal styles and titles. Part of the lowering was filmed by the BBC cameras, which moved away at times to focus on other elements, including the Garter King of Arms, a piper’s lament, and the Actions Stations naval battle cry by buglers. After the coffin descended, the open rectangular space leading to the vault could be seen in the floor of the Quire. The Duke of Sussex, after bowing his head in front of the altar, was seen to glance down briefly towards the open vault as he made his way out of the chapel at the end of the service. Philipaposs coffin had rested on a catafalque in the Quire and was draped with his personal standard, and decorated with a wreath of flowers and his Naval cap and sword. He personally selected the regalia – the medals and decorations conferred on him by the UK and Commonwealth countries – together with his Royal Air Force wings and Field Marshal’s baton, which were pre-positioned on nine cushions on the altar in the chapel. Speaking before the funeral, Joe Little, managing editor of Majesty magazine, described the moment as “unique in British royal history”.

Usually, the movement of the coffin into the vault beneath the floor of the Quire of St George’s Chapel would take place in private, Mr Little said. He said: “I think it will be unique in British royal historythe public get to see this on television. “Clearly it’s an intimate moment, usually only witnessed by the Royal Family. “I think it will be regarded as too private. I think it is the sort of thing you might see at funerals in European countries, but not in Britain.”  The Royal Vault - behind a set of iron gates and about ft underground - is the final resting place of a range of kings and queens. It was created between  and  for George III, who died in  and is one of three kings buried there. Also interred in the vault are George IV and William IV. Others buried there include George III’s we Queen Charlotte and their daughter Princess Amelia, George IV’s daughter Princess Charlotte and Queen Victoria’s father the Duke of Kent.  Princess Margaret, who died in , was cremated and her ashes were initially placed in the Royal Vault, before being moved to the George VI memorial chapel with her parents’ coffins when the Queen Mother died just weeks later. The princess wanted to be cremated because she found the alternative royal burial ground at Frogmore in Windsor Great Park too “gloomy”. Lady Glenconner – a lelong friend of the princess – said in  that the princess preferred the memorial chapel instead. “She told me that she found Frogmore very gloomy,” Lady Glenconner said. “I think she’d like to be with the late King, which she will now be. There’s room I think for her to be with him now.” At George VI’s funeral in , the king’s coffin was lowered into the vault but the proceedings were not televised so the working operation of the motor has not been broadcast before, Mr Little said. Photographs of the occasion taken from a distance show the new Queen Elizabeth II stood in front of the space in the floor after the coffin had descended. She sprinkled earth into the vault and was stood with the widowed Queen Mother, her sister Princess Margaret and the King’s sister Princess Mary. Coffins are slowly lowered about ft and then carried along a passageway and through the iron gates into the vault.  The King George VI memorial chapel, where the Queen and Philip will rest alongside each other, houses the remains of George VI, the Queen Mother and Princess Margaret. George VI was interred into the Royal Vault first and moved to the memorial chapel annex when it was built  years later. The central feature of the pale stone King George VI memorial chapel, which was added on to the north side of St George’s behind the North Quire Aisle in , is a black stone slab set into the floor. It is inscribed with “George VI” and “Elizabeth” in gold lettering and accompanied by their years of birth and death. Earlier monarchs were buried under Westminster Abbey in a Royal Vault under the Henry VII Chapel, but it was almost full by , and George III commissioned a new vault under the eventual Albert Memorial Chapel in Windsor.  That was the main burial spot for the royals for a time.When George III died in , it was noted that the Royal Vault at St Georgeaposs Chapel had  low tombs, about  inches high, and several feet long and wide, in the centre for sovereigns and their wives, the Times reported.The vault had space for more bodies on shelves of York stone, behind grilles. A Times reporter was allowed into the vault before George IVaposs funeral in , and he reported that behind the gates were seen some of the richly ornamented coffins of the Royal Family on the shelves between the gothic octagon-shaped columns.  The report added: The reflection of lamp light upon these coffins irradiated the gloom of the tombhouse. The coffins of George III and the Princess Charlotte were seen more plainly than the others. There is no coffin at present on the  low tombs in the centre of the mausoleum, which are intended to take the remains of sovereigns. His late Majestyaposs will be the first. It became easier for royals to visit their dead ancestors when a stone staircase was built sometime around , and electric lighting was installed in . After visiting the funeral of her brother, Prince Francis of Teck, in , Queen Mary noted: The vault looks very nice now, and is well lighted and arranged. The King [Edward VII] lies on the stone in the centre for the present.

Penny Junor has said the image of the grieving Queen sitting by herself reflected the “remarkable woman” that the monarch is.  The royal biographer wrote in The Sun : “Ever resilient, ever composed, she has kept calm and carried on. As she will do now, as Prince Philip would expect her to do.Before the service began, the Queen was on her own for a full ten minutes and was seen with her head bowed in a quiet moment of reflection. Covid restrictions saw members of the royal family sit with their own households with social distancing in place and face masks worn. Junor said that Philipaposs own character will have helped the Queen cope with the funeral. She wrote: “And with his practical, unsentimental, stf-upper-lip attitude, he will, I have no doubt, have provided succour, comfort and the resolve to keep on going, to keep the tears for private moments and not for public display.”  Junor has said how grief will not define the Queen who has overcome dficulties and crises throughout her reign. One of the toughest losses for the Queen was when her father King George Vl died in  and it was Philip who broke the news to her. The young married couple were away in Kenya on a Commonwealth tour when her father, who she had a close bond with, died and she was thrust into the limelight.

Romanian breeders had stitched his eyelids, rolled in due to excess folds of skin, but botched the job. Smugglers had then taken the eight-week-old puppy on a non-stop road trip across Europe in a van without food, water or exercise. Nine-week-old Maltese terriers Roky, Betty and Botty endured a similar ordeal so criminals could sell them here for a huge profit. Shaking with fear and cold inside a tiny cage, and covered in their own faeces and urine, they weighed less than a kilo each when found under a pile of boxes in a car boot. Betty later died of parvovirus. All these underaged, poorly pups were intercepted by border officers at Dover and handed to the Dogs Trust. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section They are some of the tens of thousands smuggled each year and – with people willing to pay up to £, for a pup – the problem is getting worse. Dogs Trust says puppies are “the new drugs” for gangs after recording a % increase in the number it rescued from criminals last year. Paula Boyden, the charity’s veterinary director, said: “With everyone stuck at home in lockdown there has been a huge increase in demand. “As a result we have seen the age of puppies brought in drop to as young as four weeks, as well as a deterioration in their conditions.“Many of these puppies are advertised online and unsuspecting UK buyers will buy a puppy that hassignicant health issues, is underage, or has lelong behavioural problems and they might end up paying emotionally or financially.”Thanks to celebrity owners and their Instagram-appeal, dachshunds are the most popular breed being brought in, followed by French bulldogs, English boxers and, for larger dogs, chow chows. Among the dachshunds rescued by the trust are Millie, Mollie, Sadie and Maddie – eight weeks old when seized at Dover in February. They had been driven over from Hungary hidden under a car seat and were found in an emaciated state with diarrhoea. Among them was Lady, a two-year-old that the Dogs Trust suspects was placed as a fake mum to fool prospective buyers. Lady turned out to be pregnant and has since had a litter.  Paula said: “Since we launched our Puppy Pilot scheme in ,  very pregnant mums have come into our care although it’s illegal to transport a dog in the last % of her pregnancy. Many of their puppies die, possibly from the impact of the long journey.” By law, puppies must be at least  weeks old to travel across European borders. But unvaccinated animals as young as four weeks, raised in squalid puppy farms in central and eastern Europe, are being seized at ports and the Eurotunnel. Criminals, using fake pet passports, often get around the rules by ­scanning their own animals’ microchips at borders without enforcement officers seeing the dogs.  Once in the UK the animals can then be microchipped and passed off as home bred. During the pandemic, a record number of health certicates for the commercial shipments of puppies were registered online – a sure sign smugglers were exploiting stripped-back border checks by the Animal and Plant Health Agency . Many certicates are faked. Paula explained: “In the puppy farms, unscrupulous vets are being paid to falsy rabies certicates and lie about the pup’s age. “Conditions at the farms are basic and unhygienic, there is no attempt to socialise the puppies with other dogs or keep them with their mums until eight weeks old. “Then they are subjected to these horrically long journeys, with no rest, no toilet breaks, no food or water before they even get to the distribution networks in the UK.”  Despite such cruelty, there have been only two prosecutions in the past five years, with only small fines and no jail time. “To prosecute you need hard evidence and unfortunately APHA and Trading Standards resources are limited,” said Paula. “The maximum punishment for smuggling a puppy is  months in prison but you get up to seven years for smuggling cigarettes. Puppies are an easy way to make money and it is a risk worth taking for a small fine.” Once the puppies are seized at the ports and found to be underage, they are taken into quarantine centres, given a rabies jab at  weeks and kept another three weeks, to comply with pet travel laws. Dogs Trust helps the quarantine centres socialise pups before moving them to charity centres for rehoming. Butthere is insufficient evidence against them, smugglers can simply pay the puppies’ quarantine fees and then reclaim them once they are  weeks old and go on to sell them as planned for thousands of pounds.  “If the importers refuse to pay, then puppies are classed as abandoned and are taken in by Dogs Trust,” said Paula. “However, puppy smuggling has become so lucrative during lockdown, that fewer are being abandoned. “Puppies are the new drugs.” The main problem is that pet passport laws were relaxed in  to harmonise our laws with the EU – meaning the minimum legal age fell from  months to  weeks. This led to a % increase in the number of dogs entering the country in the first year. Dogs coming in from Hungary and Lithuania shot up by % to %.

Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  Post-Brexit, animal rights charities want the Government to introduce much tougher penalties, increase funding for APHA checks and resources at the ports, and raise the legal minimum age for puppy travel to six months to make the dogs less desirable to buyers. One of  MPs backing a law change is Labour’s Plymouth MP Luke Pollard, who said: “Now the UK has left the EU, the Government must take action to end this abhorrent trade and act on its manesto promise without delay and crack down on it.” But a recent Dogs Trust poll revealed that one in three purchasers would turn a blind eyethey suspected the dog they wanted may have been illegally smuggled. Paula said: “It’s an emotional purchase of a new family member so people ignore the red flags. But buyer beware. The sellers are incredibly clever and try every trick in the book to scam you.  They will get in a stooge mum, a female of the same breed to pass her off as mum, or rent a nice house in a nice part of town to pretend the pups were bred in the UK. “So always watch how the mum interacts with the pup, ask plenty of questions about its origins and health, be prepared to be asked lots of questionsit’s a legitimate breeder, and don’t ever meet a breeder somewhere like a service station to buy a puppy. “We want people to understand the huge implications of buying an illegally smuggled pet, both for the pup and the mum.” The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it was considering a range of recommendations from animal welfare bodies. A spokesman said: “We take puppy smuggling and other illegal importations of pets very seriously.

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy notice The Queen could take a step back from her duties following her late husband the Duke of Edinburghaposs funeral, a royal historian has said.Sarah Richardson, professor of modern British history at the University of Warwick, said that Prince Philipaposs death could be a turning point in the future of the monarchy. Ms Richardson also said the poignant service at St Georgeaposs Chapel at Windsor Castle on Saturday would have been an ordeal for the Queen, who will soon turn .Sat alone and wearing a face mask due to Englandaposs coronavirus lockdown rules, she mourned her husband of  years with dignity and stoicism during a funeral service that bore Philip’s touch and celebrated his le and legacy.Speaking about the Queen sitting on her own at her husbandaposs funeral, Ms Richardson said: She has a really strong sense of service and duty and protocol and sheaposs attended many funerals in the past and she strongly follows the rituals and so on. In some ways it would have been comforting for her that the Duke of Edinburgh played such a strong role in planning and organising the service but it must have been an ordeal at the very least. Ms Richardson added: The other thing I think it represented to me was that this is a turning point in the future of the monarchy. To some extent this is the end of a period, the Queen will carry on and she will carry on doing her duty, sheaposs already gone back to work to some extent.

Weaposll send the best Royal news directly to your inbox so you never have to miss a thing.to our newsletter here. I think she will step back more and more, sheaposs in her mid-s, and seeing her there solely on her own, when sheaposs been accompanied by Philip for -odd years, I think it represents a turning point.The royal expert also said that the conversation at the end of the service between Prince Harry, Prince William and Kate Middleton would have been a conscious decision by the trio.She added: The whole family apart from the Queen walked back to the castle from the chapel and the fact that Harry walked with William and Kate I think was perhaps a symbol that there is at least a willingness to talk and perhaps have some rapprochement between the two princes.  Ms Richardson said the Queen would want a reuniting but that William and Harry will need to have discussions going forward. After almost  years as head of state, the Queen will reign without Philip by her side – a man she met as a young girl and who was the bedrock of her happiness. In a symbolic moment, the Queen was pictured sat alone in St George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle as she waited for the funeral procession carrying the duke’s coffin to arrive. But Philip’s death at the age of  has revealed a side of the monarchy rarely seen beyond palace walls – a picture of a close-knit family who holiday together, share the good times and the bad, with Philip and the Queen at its heart. The outpouring of tributes and pictures from the royal family shows how beneath the public perception of an irascible figure, the duke was, as the Dean of Windsor summed up during the service, a man of “kindness, humour and humanity”. The day was one of contrasts, a spectacle of pomp and pageantry provided by the many regiments and military units – associated with Philip during his letime support of the armed forces – who took part. And there were also simple touches that reflected the man – his carriage, used for racing around courses, was parked so that it was passed by the funeral procession. On the seat were the duke’s cap, whip and brown gloves, and nearby a red pot containing sugar lumps the duke would give to his ponies.  Philip’s coffin, draped with his personal standard, featured his Admiral of the Fleet naval cap and sword next to a wreath of white flowers chosen by the Queen with a handwritten card, edged in black, from his we of  years. In bright brilliant sunshine, the funeral procession made its way through the precincts of the castle. Philip’s children – the Prince of Wales, Princess Royal, Duke of York and Earl of Wessex – walked behind his coffin, which was carried by a Land Rover Defender hearse he helped design. They were joined by the duke’s grandsons the Duke of Sussex, Duke of Cambridge and Peter Phillips, and Vice Admiral Tim Lawrence, the Princess Royal’s husband, and the Queen’s nephew the Earl of Snowdon. The royals walked in step as a military band played and all stared straight ahead into the sun as they made their way to the duke’s final resting place. Harry and William – who have a troubled relationship – were separated by their cousin Peter Phillips but he dropped back half a pace at one point so the brothers appeared closer together. After the service, the siblings walked back up the hill to the castle deep in conversation and seemed to have put any dferences aside. As the funeral began, the nation came to a halt to observe a minute’s silence in memory of the duke who died a few months short of his th birthday.  Covid restrictions meant all  mourners in the chapel wore face masks and were sat socially distanced with partners or by themselves. The Queen’s nearest family member was her son Andrew, while across from the monarch were Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall seated together. There was a space left beside the Queen where her husband the duke would have sat. Other guests included the Duchess of Cambridge and the Countess of Wessex, and her children Viscount Severn and Lady Louise Windsor. Zara and Mike Tindall, Princess Beatrice and her husband Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, and Princess Eugenie and her husband Jack Brooksbank were also among the mourners. Three of Philip’s German relatives were invited, as was his close friend Countess Mountbatten of Burma. Philip was the guiding force behind the preparations for his funeral, which was pared back because of Covid restrictions, with guests reduced from around  to  and the public elements cancelled. The well-known Victorian hymn Eternal Father, Strong To Save was sung by a choir of just four due to Covid regulations. It is strongly associated with the Navy in the UK but is also popular with the naval traditions of countries such as the US and France. Philip had a close connection with the Navy for more than  years, having enrolled at Britannia Royal Naval College in Dartmouth aged , served at sea during the Second World War and later held numerous honorary ranks. In a prayer, the Archbishop of Canterbury gave thanks for the duke’s “resolute faith and loyalty”. The Most Rev Justin Welby said: “O eternal God, before whose face the generations rise and pass away, thyself unchanged, abiding, we bless thy holy name for all who have completed their earthly course in thy faith and following, and are now at rest we remember before thee this day Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, rendering thanks unto thee – for his resolute faith and loyalty, for his high sense of duty and integrity, for his le of service to the nation and Commonwealth, and for the courage and inspiration of his leadership.” At the end of the service, the duke’s coffin was also slowly lowered into the royal vault as his titles were read out.

Pandemic restrictions meant Her Majesty was forced to sit alone at her beloved husbandaposs funeral at St Georgeaposs Chapel on Saturday afternoon. The Duke of Edinburghaposs coffin was draped in his personal standard, as well as a wreath of white spring flowers chosen by his we of  years. It also featured his Admiral of the Fleet naval cap and sword, along with the monarchaposs handwritten card in loving memory of the Duke, edged in black. Despite the pomp and ceremony, the service was a deeply personal one for the Queen and during the service she carried a number of special mementoes.The monarch was comforted by cherished belongings from her le with Prince Philip at the funeral including a photo of the couple when they were newlyweds and one of her husbandaposs pocket squares that she took in her handbag. During the service, which could only be attended by up to  mourners, the Queenaposs handwritten note reading in loving memory was left on top of the coffin. It was tucked in among the flowers, meaning whether the Queen signed it Elizabeth or her husbandaposs nickname for her aposLillibetapos was obscured. People Magazine, however, reports it was the latter, with the pet name originally given to her by dad King George VI, as she couldnapost pronounce her own name as a child.  The Queen, dressed all in black, including a face mask, remained stoic as she was filmed first in the royal Bentley and then entering the chapel.Despite the highly emotional service, which also saw grandson Prince Harry reunited with his family after months in the US, HM remained dignied. She sat at the front of the chapel, with pallbearers placing the coffin in front of her pew, and bowed her head respectfully. Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the Queenaposs note, and said it was private. Philipaposs coffin descended into the Royal Vault during his funeral service, lowered by an electric motor. It was a moment never seen before on television, with Joe Little, managing editor of Majesty magazine, describing it as unique in British royal history. Usually, the movement of the coffin into the vault beneath the floor of the Quire of St Georgeaposs Chapel would take place in private.

The claim surfaced before Philipaposs funeral at Windsor Castle, where the couple and about  staff members, dubbed HMS Bubble, had been shielding during the Covid pandemic. It is one of many private tales to emerge following the dukeaposs death on April , two months before his th birthday.In their unique relationship, only Philip put his arm around her, and they had been as close as they had been for years as they were brought together because of Covid, the Daily Mail reported.The palace aide told how he was called in to wait on the couple because of staff shortages caused by the pandemic.

As a nation, we love few things more than ­getting together with friends and family, socialising, sharing stories and catching up. Coming at the end of a tough year with so few opportunities to do just that, the reopening of pubs, cafes and restaurants – albeit only those with outdoor space – has been joyous and a real lt to the nation’s spirits. For people whose livelihoods rely on hospitality, this week will hopefully be remembered as the first baby step back to normality. There’s also been an overriding feeling of relief as peopleto venues in such encouraging numbers. Businesses have poured large chunks of cash into successfully and safely welcoming back guests to their beer ­gardens and terraces, come rain or shine – and in some cases, even snow. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section UKHospitality is the voice of the broad hospitality sector – Britain’s third largest sector, directly employing over three million people before the crisis hit – and understands how important a revival is for everyone. This dynamic industry and its venues can kick-start an economic recovery, restore and revive our high streets and communities. It can also generate jobs and careers for our young people, who have felt the brunt of the terrible economic impact of this pandemic. That is exactly why the Government cannot take its eye off the ball when it comes to supporting hospitality and ensuring we bounce back strongly. Issues like rent debt and the unfair burden of business rates still need to be resolved. Of course, support such as the furlough scheme has been incredibly helpful to sectors like hospitality and saved jobs – but the industry remains in a fragile state. Only four in  venues have the outdoor space to reopen, so many businesses are still shut and thousands of livelihoods still shrouded in uncertainty.

The majority of businesses that were able to reopen outdoors will have been lucky to have broken even this week, let alone turn a profit. Even when, fingers crossed, indoor opening s on May , it will still be with signicant ­restrictions in place. We are still far from being out of the woods. Yet we can all play our part to help safeguard the future of our local pub, bar, restaurant or cafe, by visiting what are probably the safest and most ­regulated of public spaces.

As hardy drinkers braved the cold for that longed-for pint, among the early revellers’ verdicts were “exciting” and “an absolute riot”. Others were more reticent: “slightly scary” and “I’m not sure”. It seems that not everyone is champing at the bit to leave social Siberia. New research reveals that more than half the population has anxiety about socialising without restrictions – with % going as far as to say they are scared. A further % say it will be a long time before they’ll feel comfortable socialising in the same way as pre-pandemic. I am delighted to be able to see friends again – albeit outdoors – and to taste something other than my own cooking. But I do sympathise with those who are feeling apprehensive. What do you think of lockdown easing  Have your say in comments below The survey, conducted by The Big Lunch, found that  million people are worried that they’ve forgotten how to have a proper conversation. What did we even talk about before Covid  And how do you break the ice with someone you haven’t seen for agesyou can’t give them a hug  Then there’s “friendship funnelling” – it’s a thing! Due to dfering attitudes towards lockdown, some people have found it hard to maintain relationships. Not everyone has been eager to e into a digital social scene, and one in five people reported that a friendship had fizzled out. A shocking nine million felt let down or unsupported by a pal. For a lot of people, their support network changed when they couldn’t see the people they normally socialise with.

Soyou’re suffering from “re-entry anxiety”, the key to getting socially fit is to get nattering to the locals. Last year, I was one of more than four million who took part in The Big Lunch – the UK’s largest get-together for neighbours. In a normal year, millions of people bust out the bunting and have street parties to celebrate community. Last year, it went ahead virtually, encouraging digital dining and neighbourly natters. This summer, The Big Lunch – from June  to July  – gives people a whole month for socially safe get-togethers.

Sarahaposs Law was was rolled out across police forces in the two countries in April , allowing anyone to ask the police to check whether people who have contact with their child or children pose a risk. If the person has convictions for sexual offences against children or poses a risk of causing harm, the police can choose to disclose this information confidentially to the parent, carer or , ChronicleLive reports. Previously, a parent could raise concerns about someone, but there were no clear rules about whether or not they should be told anythingofficers discovered cause for concern. Police can also warn parentsconcerns are raised by grandparents or neighbours. How did Sarahaposs Law come to be  Sara Payne, the mum of Sarah Payne, who was murdered by a convicted sex offender, campaigned for the Government to bring in measures to protect children. Sarah, from Hersham, Surrey, was just eight-years-old when paedophile Roy Whiting abducted her while she was out playing with her siblings near her grandfatheraposs home in Kingston Gorse, West Sussex, on July , . She was grabbed as she walked back to the home along a country road after playing hide and seek in a cornfield. The search ended in heartbreak when the youngsteraposs body was found  days later in a field near Pulborough, about  miles away from where she was last seen.  Grief-stricken Ms Payne became a leading advocate for child protection and worked endlessly to campaign for and bring in Sarahaposs Law, formally known as the Child Sex Offenders Disclosure Scheme. She was awarded an MBE by the Queen for her victim advocacy and child protection work. She wrote a book, called A Motheraposs Story, about her le and her daughteraposs death, and co-founded Phoenix Chief Advocates to help those victimised by paedophile crimes, challenge the institutional anti-victim prejudice, and help people with PTSD. Sarahaposs father Michael, , died of natural causes at his home in Maidstone, Kent, in October .  Whiting, now , lived in a seafront flat in Littlehampton, about five miles from the lane where he kidnapped Sarah. He had previously abducted and sexually assaulted an eight-year-old girl, serving four years in prison. He became a suspect early in the investigation and in February  was charged with kidnapping and murdering the schoolgirl. Whiting was convicted in December  by a jury at Lewes Crown Court, and sentenced to le in prison with a minimum term of  years. He will be  when he is eligible for parole. Who goes on the Sex Offenders’ Register  Itaposs important to note that a sex offender and a paedophile arenapost necessarily the same thing. A range of cautions and offences can get someone placed on the Sex Offendersapos Register. Someone could get a caution for smacking a girl on the behind while she walked past them on the street.

It was an occasion of flawless pageantry, ­ ­military order and stirring music. For obvious reasons, some elements had to be adjusted to accommodate the restrictions of Covid. Yet the simplicity of the pared-down service made it all the more powerful. Behind the ceremony and royal regalia this was ultimately a very personal send-off. No family, however mighty or lowly, is immune from the pain and loss which comes with grief.It was a moment for a we to say goodbye to her husband, for children to mourn their father and for grandchildren and great-grandchildren to remember their beloved grandad and great-grandad. What do you think  Have your say in comments below The funeral may have been blessed by spring sunshine, but not even the kindness of the weather would have softened their sadness. Prince Philip’s  years were a le well lived, and the service fully reflected his extraordinary career.As the Dean of Windsor, the Rt Reverend David Conner, said the nation has been inspired by his unwavering loyalty to the Queen. The Prince was the longest-living consort, a veteran of the Second World War, a champion of the arts, industry and the Armed Forces, a patron to hundreds of charities and a passionate defender of the environment.  Yet his greatest achievement was his steadfast and unstinting devotion to Her Majesty.He was, as she once said, her “support and stay”. Above all, Saturday was about a we in mourning saying farewell to her husband of  years.The fact that she is the monarch was not important.  On Saturday, she was another a grieving widow who sat poignantly alone as she braved a moment she had long feared but never wished to happen.Anyone who has attended a funeral will know how hard this must have been.It was all the more heartbreaking to watch the Queen, stoical as ever, sit isolated from her nearest and dearest because of the cruelty of Covid.Her Majesty has long commanded our respect and devotion – today she commanded as never before our affection.  The gap left by Prince Philip will never be repaired.The only comfort is the whole country was with her in their thoughts and prayers. When the buglers of the Royal Marines sounded Action Stations at the end of Saturday’s service, it was Duke of Edinburgh’s reminder that all hands in the Royal Family should be ready for the battles ahead. Perhaps it was this final message which spurred Princes William and Harry to walk together from the Chapel back to Windsor Castle.

It was always a joy to see them side by side, particularly in private when they could relax together away from their duties. They were a wonderful couple.

The Met Office has warned that there is a risk of rain in the North West of England but the outlook is mainly fine.“Parts of northwest UK cloudy with occasional rain or drizzle. Elsewhere a frosty start for many inland areas, but then plenty of sunshine and light winds,” said a Met Office statement. “This helps temperatures bounce back, and it should feel pleasantly warm by afternoon.” The South East is expected to receive the best of the weather with temperatures reaching “ or maybe C” said a Met Office forecaster. People flocked to the beaches on Saturday spurred on by the good weather and the easing of Covid restrictions. There were people in the sea from St Anne’s in Lancashire down to Thorpe Bay in Essex. A spokesperson for the Met Office said: As we go into Monday, Tuesday and possibly Wednesday we could see temperatures reach  to C in southern parts of England and Wales. The north is going to be a bit colder. We’ve got cold air coming down the north of the UK on Sunday, with northerly winds picking up through Monday. While there have still been some frosty nights, the temperatures are slightly above normal. The Met continued: These temperatures are slightly above average for this time of year. It’s normally around  or C in England in April. We’ve made some gains this week with strong sun during the day and some warmer air from the continent which could contribute to the slightly higher temperatures.  But some colder air will push across Scotland on Tuesday. So far this month it’s been far colder than average. We’ve had a lot of frosts and little rain so it will be a welcome change for a short time. Hopefully people will be able to enjoy the good weather while it’s here. The weather has been a boost for pubs and bars with beer gardens bustling on Saturday as people were able to .

He explains that he is a trans male and that it has always his dream to be a father, so heaposs had time to consider and pick the names he wants to use for his children. For a girl, he has chosen the name Willow, and for a boy he says he wanted to incorporate his love of Greek mythology and chose Achilles. The legend goes that Achillesapos mother had dipped him into the river Styx as an infant, which made him invulnerable to injury throughout his body except for the heel she was holding him by, which is where the idiom aposAchilles heelapos comes from. But when he shared his plan with his best friend and younger siblings, all three laughed at his idea, leaving him reconsidering whether it was still appropriate. He wrote on Reddit: My childhood friend said that the name Achilles would get my child bullied in school whatkids couldnapost pronounce it or tried to trip him or kick his heel  I understand that kids can be cruel, but I think bullies can make fun of any name, or anything in general. I stated how there are plenty of other names from Greek Mythology that are used today and no one bats an eye at them.  My siblings both agreed with her and said it was a weird name that would get my child bullied. My friend then said that aposhonestly, it sounds like what someone would name a dogapos, and at that point I tried my best to not cry because this is such an important thing to me. He said the only other name he had considered for a boy was Damien, but he knows his family donapost like it as they associate the name with a demonic character. After asking for advice as to whether he would be wrong to stick with the name, some people argued it wouldnapost be fair, with one saying: Remember you donapost have to carry that name. Itaposs not you having to apply for jobs or college with that name. Choosing a name because you like it and screw the consequences that come with it is an a**hole move.

The scene has haunted him day and night for the past  years. “The image is stuck in my head and I can’t get over it,” he says, taking a drag of his cigarette. “The child was only . He was kidnapped because his father was a ‘pentito’ – a police informant. “I went with colleagues when we found he’d been kept in a cave. There was no body to see. It had been completely dissolved in acid. “All that remained was his bed, burned from the chemicals, where he’d been sleeping.” What do you think  Have your say in comments below Very little  makes Alfonso flinch these days. From  to , the magistrate was one of the elite members of Italy’s anti-Mafia unit. Often spending years gathering evidence from informers and wire-taps, it was responsible for the successful conviction of some of organised crime’s most bloodthirsty ringleaders. Now, Alfonso’s book about his work is the inspiration behind hard-hitting Channel  drama The Hunter, starring Italian actors Francesco Montanari and Miriam Dalmazio. Telling the story of fictional magistrate Saverio Barone’s ruthless fight against the Mafia, there is more than a hint of Reservoir Dogs about the series. An eye-watering torture scene is not for the faint-hearted. In an exclusive interview with the Sunday People, Alfonso, , tells how crime bosses plotted to blow him up – once with a melon packed with explosives, then later with a missile. Pouring himself a drink in his Naples kitchenette, he explains how living under -hour protection and constantly moving to stay alive was too big a strain for his marriage. And, as the biggest mob trial in three decades continues in southern Italy, he insists it is now down to the next generation to continue his fight. Alfonso came to prominence while working at the public prosecutor’s office in Palermo, in the north of Sicily – a traditional Mafia stronghold. He was audacious and hungry for promotion. “I’d compiled evidence that my boss in the prosecutor’s office was colluding with the Mafia,” he explains. “I’ve been told that was a brave thing to do.  “People knew, it’s just that no one had spoken out about it before. “I was brought up on bread and justice, as we say in Italian. I came from a family of lawyers – including my mum, Giuseppina, which wasn’t common work for a woman at that time. “Even my sister Marzia ended up working in anti-Mafia. “I didn’t question the decision to take the job and my parents gave me enormous support.” In the early Nineties, Alfonso had his work cut out. The north of Sicily was controlled by Mafia, often referred to on the island simply as Cosa Nostra – “our thing”. Alfonso recalls: “You couldn’t do anything, even opening a shop, without paying money to Mafia. “There was no escaping them. They led the traffic of drugs and were money rich. “In the Nineties there was a very deliberate campaign to kill going on. It was a declaration of war, to show the state that the Mafia held the power.” The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening. Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  In , less than a year before Alfonso joined the anti-Mafia unit, the bloodshed was even worse than usual. Two of the highest profile anti-Mafia magistrates were assassinated. First was judge Giovanni Falcone, driving home from the airport – kg of explosives were detonated in a drain running under the motorway. The blast killed him, his we and three members of his police escort. Less than eight weeks later judge Paolo Borsellino and five members of his escort died in a car bomb near his mother’s Palermo apartment building. Mafia bosses from the Sicilian town of Corleone toasted the murders with champagne. Within days the government dispatched , military personnel to contain the threat.  Bombs went off everywhere – not just on the streets, but in places that held great importance to Italians, such as the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. Alfonso reveals: “On one occasion we stopped kg of explosives being detonated at the Tower Of Pisa.” But his new world brought with it a huge loss of freedom. He was ­under -hour security, and always flanked by bodyguards. Never in the same place for long, he lived a restless le, shunted from one hideout to the next. Wire-taps revealed the Mafia were closing in on him. He says: “In one recording of a phone call between two mafiosi, there was a clear reference made to me. “They spoke about a red melon, with explosives and a timer. It was payback because I’d just given the son of a Mafia boss a le sentence.  “Another time, I found out that a missile launcher was intended for me. “I didn’t worry for my le but I did for my we’s at the time. It was too risky. She moved with our daughter to Milan. It was so dficult for them, we eventually separated. “At one point I had to hide in a castle in the mountains.” He sent some of the Sicilian Mafia’s most dangerous and cruel bosses to jail. Among them was Leoluca Bagarella – called “il capo dei capi” . Bagarella ran the Corleonesi Mafia clan, a Sicilian faction which had murdered hundreds of people. Modelling himself on The God­father, he had music from the Marlon Brando movie played at his wedding. There was also Giovanni Brusca, known in Mafia circles as The Swine.  Alfonso said: “I took a list of all the people who had died for the Mafia since Brusca was . We started scrolling through the names and he’d say, ‘This one, yes, this one, no’. “In total there were about  who he’d murdered.” There were also those who had died in massacres he had helped plot. At his  trial Brusca admitted detonating the bomb that killed Falcone. Somehow Alfonso has managed to stay alive and now works at the Court of Naples – fighting the region’s Mafia-like Camorra. He is father to a five-month-old daughter and his partner Diana is also a magistrate. But while bodies may no longer line the streets, the Mafia are still very much present In January,  people went on trial in the region of Calabria, in boot-shaped Italy’s southern toe. It has been the biggest and most important organised crime trial in more than  years.

Up to  branches of Semichem will close.John Brodie, chief executive of Scotmid, addressed the Tayside closures as the co-operative’s annual results were announced.He told The Courier: “It’s always a dficult decision and a last resort – our aim is to keep stores open.“But sometimes we have to face into tough decisions.“It was based on the fact there were structural changes happening on high streets before the pandemic hit. The pandemic has accelerated some of those changes.“Some footfall driving stores in high streets, in shopping centres, they just don’t exist anymore.“We had a look at the locations we are in and assessthey are viable for the future.“Then we tried to make arrangements with landlords to help rental costs. We explored every opportunity before we took the tough decision that a store would have to close.”Mr Brodie said staff would be offered positions in other parts of the Scotmid group, which includes convenience stores, funerals and property.“There is a normal level of staff turnover in Scotmid food stores,” he added.“We anticipate that will create some opportunities for us to accommodate as many people as possible.”He said the company was satisfied that its other Semichem shops would continue to trade profitably.Scotmid Co-op Society delivered a £. million trading profit for the  weeks ended January  compared to £.m last year. Turnover increased by £m to £m.Mr Brodie said that while food sales increased as more customers shopped locally, there were also higher costs.There was also more demand for funeral services, but profitability was down partly due to social distancing restrictions.Meanwhile the company’s property arm saw some tenants default on payments.“This was a year dominated by the pandemic and the signicant but ying impact it has had on our dferent businesses,# Mr Brodie said.“Changes in consumer behaviour during the pandemic resulted in an increase in local essential shopping in Scotmid’s food convenience stores.“Customers visited less frequently, spent more each visit but the costs of operation were signicantly more than usual.“Like many other non-food retailers, Semichem was signicantly impacted by the pandemic due to low footfall on high streets and a long period of closure in the first wave.”“Scotmid Funerals conducted more funerals but at a reduced income per funeral due to safety and social distancing restrictions.”Mr Brodie said that even as the vaccine rollout continues apace, there was “considerable uncertainty” looking forward.He said management would adopt a “flexible approach” and focus on matters under its control.“We are an organisation that’s been around for  years and we will continue to follow our core purpose of continuing to serve our communities and improving people’s every day lives.“I’d also like to praise our society members for the fantastic work they have done in the past year.“They are unsung heroes for keeping going in uncertain circumstances.”Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/2.59233532-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/2.59233532-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/2.59233532-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/2.59233532-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"dundee announce departure of defender jordon forster","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remDefender Jordon Forster has left Dundee after almost two years at Dens Park, the club have announced.The former Hibs man played  times for the Dark Blues after signing in the summer of .His last appearance came as a second-half substitute against Arbroath on January  and he made just one league start this season.A broken foot suffered in the -

draw at Greenock Morton at the end of February.“I’m not going to lie, the last four or five weeks has been really frustrating for myself being out of the team,” he said.“I just kept my head down, I’m not one to mump and moan.#To be fair, the boys in the middle of the park in Gowserand Maxhave been dferent class recently.“I’m glad to be back in the team and I can hopefully pick up my form from January and have a good end to the season.”After a first campaign at Dens Park where Byrne himself admitted he hadn’t shown all he was capable of, the former Livingston midfielder was determined to up his game second time around.“That’s what made it more frustrating. I felt I was playing pretty well,” he said.“But we changed the middle and obviously we got some wins so that was good.“To be fair, the manager spoke to me every week saying I hadn’t done anything wrong but we were picking up results.“He was happy with my attitude and the way I applied myself, I never chucked the toys out of the pram or anything.“I came in against St Johnstone and felt I’d done pretty well so it was hard to be back out of the team after.“Then Maxy and Gowser both score at Ayr on the Tuesday so it was a genius decision from the gaffer!“It’s been frustrating because I feel I’ve been playing really well this year.“But I’m here to help the team.”Dundee boss James McPake certainly isn’t short of quality central midfield options – club captain and talisman Charlie Adam has also been on the bench next to Byrne of late.McGowan and Anderson have been the choice lately and both have been picking up key goals and laying on assists for team-mates in vital victories.Add to that theof Jordan McGhee, the defender who has been a revelation when moved into the middle of the park this season.With only two starting berths to fight for in the system that has seen the Dark Blues pick up  points in their last five matches, competition is fierce.“Jordan has been out for a while so it is testament to him for coming in and playing so well,” Byrne added.“The competition in the middle of the park is really tough, to be honest.#We have a lot of really good players there – Charlie Adam, Gowser, Max, Jordan and young Fin Robertson when he comes back.“It is strong competition so you do need to be on it.I think that’s what has pushed everybody on. You can see the standard in training has pushed up a notch with boys coming back.“I maybe did dip after the Hearts game so maybe that’s why I came out but hopefully now I can pick up the form and stay in the team.“I think everybody will have a part to play before now and the end of the season.“It has been frustrating, I won’t lie.#But I’ve kept my head down and worked really hard.#Hopefully, I can have a good end to the season.” ANALYSIS: James McPake looks to have solved Dundee midfield riddle # but insists Charlie Adam still has huge part to play\" title\"#ANALYSIS: James McPake looks to have

the Fe Coastal Path, which collapsed during severe storms in , has taken a major step forward.Engineers have carried out an in-depth survey of the Aberdour Harbour bridge to assess the extent of the damage and what it will take to repair.On August  last year Fe suffered more than a month’s rainfall in just  hours resulting in flooding throughout the region.In Aberdour flood water from the Dour Burn washed away abutments, as well as banking and structural supports, which eventually lead to the bridge being removed amid fears over safety.Since then the popular stretch of coastal path has impassable except for low tide when stepping stones, normally submerged under harbour water, can be used.Tourists, walkers and locals are currently required to take a ersion through the village in order to get round the impasse.A report outlining the required construction, design and overall cost will now be submitted to both Fe  Council and Fe Coast and Countryside Trust before a final decision is made on the project.The news has been warmly welcomed by locals.Ian Fleming, chairman of Aberdour Community Council, said: “Obviously everyone is keen to see a replacement footbridge in place as soon as possible and to now have had a geo-technical survey is good news.“Not only is there the design and structural engineering involved but there have been complex issues surrounding the location of the bridge too.“It sits within a conservation area as well an area of archaeological importance and there have been landowner rights and permissions to have been worked through too.“Environmental legislation also plays a key factor and in addition we’ve had the coronavirus pandemic that has restricted what could be achieved up to now.“The community council has been in regular contact with both the council and the trust and welcome the fact that the project is now moving forward in earnest.”James Dawson, Fe Coast and Countryside Trust#s head of communities and engagement, said: “The winter weather caused damage to several sections of the Fe Coastal Path, and unfortunately the structural damage to the bridge at Aberdour was a particularly bad example of this.“The trust realise that this is a real inconvenience for locals and visitors walking the coastal path or just visiting the harbour, and would ask that the public bear with Fe Council and FCCT as we work to fix such issues.“We have created a clearly marked ersion that takes walkers through Aberdour#s picturesque and historic town centre.#Fe Council service manager, Ross Speirs, added: “This is an area of real environmental signicance so a lot of work has been going on in the background to make sure the replacement of the bridge is done in an environmentally sensitive way.“We’ve now appointed a design consultant to oversee the detailed design phase and ground investigation work started this week.#We hope that we’ll be able to start work to replace the bridge later in the summer and make sure this important link along the coastal path can be enjoyed for many years to come.#Hospital workers# cars wrecked and landslide at caravan park after apocalyptic storm batters Fe\"

offering a iety of versatile prints that can be placed in any interiors or social space.The artist, who owns Meli#s Art Corner, produces the modern art prints in Aberdeen. And despite currently being a student, doing a post-graduate diploma in teaching, she dedicates a great deal of time to her business.Melinda said: #Each piece is drawn by me and reflects minimalistic, modern and clean colours, and fine lines.#At the moment, it’s the digital files of my prints that customers purchase and download. They can then print them in the sizes they want.#I drew every piece in an A size, which gives my customers freedom of choice when it comes to printing size, to complement their space.#My prints are very versatile and can be placed anywhere depending on the person’s personal style.#Customers can also play around with dferent colour and style frames for the prints to match their space. Personally, I have prints in the living room, bedroom, hallway and bathroom.#Melinda launched the business# Etsy shop less than one month ago, but she has also established other brands in the past.#I have a background in science and have worked in healthcare for a number of years before going for a career change in teaching,# she said.#I’ve always had a passion for art, which made it a tough decision choosing which degree path to take. Many people say I’m quite creative for a scientist, but I think good science needs some level of creativity too.#I launched the Meli#s Art Corner Etsy shop on March , but it all started with the brand called Zoicwhich mainly focused on hand painting people’s inner animals on T-shirts, later growing to include canvas bags on a commission basis.#Hand painting inidual products was very time consuming and I couldn’t fulfill all the orders, so I needed to digitalise my art instead.#My interest evolved from animals and I felt I outgrew the Zoic brand name, so I re-branded to something more organic Melinda. This is what the logo reads. I still take commission work through direct contacts on Instagram.#For my prints, the design process takes a while to come together in my head.#I first create a colour palette I am going to work with. Then I come up with the story based on le events, seasons, people I meet or see and the environment around me.#The drawing process can take a few hours to a few days. And I post the designs on Instagram and the Etsy shop.#Because Melinda operates as a one-person team, she is responsible for everything from social media presence, content creation, marketing and branding to drawing, customer service, market research and driving sales.Speaking on her inspiration, the artist says she has dferent mood boards for the ious themes and stories she comes up with.Melinda added: #I take inspiration from my environment and my spirituality.#I am a very spiritual person and want each piece to bring positive and soothing energy to my customers and spaces they are displayed in.#Currently, I am fascinated with the beauty of the female physique and the dference in the bone structure of dferent ethnicities # that’s the physiologist side of me coming out.#My most popular prints to date are the botanical print, Afro woman line art print and the abstract sets.#They are instantly downloadable digital files, which is also good because it reduces our carbon footprint and makes them more sustainable.#At the moment, most of my customers are based in the UK, but because it’s online, I’ve had purchases worldwide.#While the launch period is challenging for every business, the entrepreneur is thankful for the #enormous# encouragement and support she has had from friends and family.#I will be eternally grateful for that,# Melinda added. #The constant positive feedback I get from customers also helps a lot.#The challenges also arise with me being a one-person team. I am spinning a lot of plates at once. I have to be very organised to run the business and also work towards gaining my degree in teaching.#The business is currently in the growing stage.

However, ANSA#s services will not be limited to the oil and gas market.Both ANSA and READ are majority-owned by Norwegian private equity firm Norvestor.Tor Erling Gunnerød, Norvestor Equity Partner and chairman of READ said: “As a fully independent company, ANSA has the freedom to be more entrepreneurial and focus on its core competency of delivering ironclad data analysis solutions to clients around the world.“Our strategic goal is for ANSA to further develop its range of specialist services, accelerate the expansion of its client base, and create increased value andon investment for its shareholders.”Bruce Melvin will continue in the role of CEO of both READ and ANSA in the interim until a new figurehead for each business has been put in place.Bruce said: “This is a transformational moment for both companies.#Each has a tremendous opportunity to streamline its operations and ultimately focus on what it does best.#Clearly, change of this magnitude brings challenges, given the interconnectedness of the two business lines over the last  years. But it also brings huge opportunities that both READ and ANSA now have the potential to capitalise on.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/2.59132033-1-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/2.59132033-1-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/2.59132033-1-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/2.59132033-1-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"home bargains looks to double size of aberdeen store","story":"An Aberdeen retailer is set to double the size of its Beach Bouled store in the coming weeks.

This is mainly due to massive insecticide use and habitat loss caused by intensication of agriculture.Up to  per cent of flowering plants and  per cent of commercial crops require insects for pollination, with honeybees and hoverflies most often doing the job.But with declining numbers of these species, farmers may employ hives of bees to prevent crop yields falling.Wild honeybees forage within three miles of their nest, and onthey perform the #waggle dance# that advertises the location of productive foraging sites to other bees. Also, odours from scented flowers picked up inside the nest while unloading pollen act as cues to guide nest-mates to specic flowers.Now scientists have articially imprinted bees with flower odours in an attempt to improve crop yields*.In trying to establish long-term memory for flower odours, the scientists offered bees in three separate groups of hives alternative odours:  sucrose solution scented with synthetic sunflower odours,  sucrose solution scented with jasmine odours,  sucrose solution alone. They then relocated the hives to a sunflower plantation and compared the foraging activities of bees exposed to the three solutions.First, scientists decoded waggle dances to identy sunflower-specic dances. Using this information, they observed bees from hives fed with sunflower odours performing sunflower dances one hour after hive relocation.Contrastingly, the control bees fed jasmine odours took - hours and control sucrose-fed bees took  hours to perform sunflower dances.This resulted in the sunflower odour-imprinted bees performing signicantly more sunflower-specic waggle dances during the first day of relocation, peaking at  per cent increase over control hives preferentially visiting sunflowers and bringing in more sunflower pollen loads than the control bees.The scientists then measured the all-important crop yields in five plots containing dferent sunflower hybrid plants pollinated by sunflower odour-imprinted compared to control bees.Seed yields in all five plots were highest when pollinated by sunflower odour-fed bees, with increased production up to  per cent above control bees.They conclude that providing bees pre-programmed to forage on specic crops could circumvent wild pollinator shortages and signicantly increase crop yields.*Current Biology , -.

Especially when option one, the Glen Croe route, was the chosen option from the A Trunk Road Study # summary report published by Jacobs in .Surely, after nine years of consulting, the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland can choose the best solution rather than going through a y and expensive consultation process.Based on this, our members would like the permanent solution fast tracked, which is well within the Scottish Government’s power and we would ask for this to be seriously considered.Our other comments and feedback to last week’s announcement are as follows:The timber road route should be upgraded as a short-term solution this summer and not in the suggested  months.Argyll businesses have faced the issues of landslides for many years. However, the situation has worsened over the past year and in our opinion it has now become a national emergency and requires immediate action.The , tons of unstable material could swamp any further mitigation measures put in place on the A and Old Military Roadand make the roads impassable. This could easily happen when we next have an extended period of rainfall.Savings in further mitigation work could go towards upgrading the forestry road.The long-term solution should be selected from the  The A Trunk Road Study and based on the delivery of the most sustainable outcome.Any well-developed permanent solution needs to be open  without fear of being buried under tons of rock and mud, and will have less environmental impact than the landslides, catchpits, netting and OMR bund we are currently experiencing.Our understanding of costs and timescales from similar schemes in Norway show a tunnel could be built in three years at a cost of £-m, and not the £-m stated by Transport Scotland.Members of The RABT Campaign group represent a cross section of business sectors and we would welcome the chance to meet with your officials to discuss how we might help cut through the y timescales and fast-track decision making.John Gurr  Sir,I heard that there was work going on in Lochgilphead town centre, and that some people were complaining, about mess and upheaval. No change there then!When I observed the work, I was so surprised at the dference this will make to the town and to the moaners I say #you cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs#.When I spoke to them, the workforce were polite and commented that they were looking forward to the end result.For too long now Lochgilphead has been the Cinderella of Argyll and Bute now it seems she will go to the Ball.From a very satisfied resident.Name and address suppliedSir,Just ahead of WWF’S Earth Hour last year, the country was put into lockdown due to the Covid- pandemic. As we look ahead to this year’s event on Saturday March  at .pm, many of us are reflecting on the future, as we emerge from the latest, and hopefully last #stay at home# period.With that in mind, we are asking people to use Earth Hour by helping us to create the #Great Scottish Canvas#. Switch off your lights and by candlelight or torchlight, use the hour to paint a picture, craft a poem, doodle or write something which illustrates the future Scotland you want to live in.With so many eyes on Scotland this year, due to Scottish Parliament elections in May and the vital COP climate talks in November, we want to show the world the vision of the Scottish people, for a greener and fairer society for us all. Find out more at the www.wwf.org.uk website.I look forward to seeing the things you believe will make Scotland a better place, perhaps changing the way we heat our homes, how we travel around our towns and cities, or even how we grow the food we eat.Lang Banks, director, WWF Scotland, EdinburghSir,Tuesday March  marked the anniversary of the day the UK entered lockdown.

Thankfully, there#s now light at the end of the tunnel. But some ongoing measures could continue to be barriers to their independence and confidence.People with sight loss can sometimes find it dficult to judge space, so we’re asking everyone to maintain their own distance, be patient and be helpful.Just getting out and about can be more hazardous for those without sight. The government#s #Spaces for People# initiative has already transformed many of our streets and thoroughfares.

While saving in some areas of expenditure, it has incurred extra costs in tackling the pandemic and faces an uncertain funding future while the national economy tries to recover. The drive to save money in services where bringing in a little more through, for example, parking fees and fines, is understandable up to a point.But when the economy is on le support after a pandemic, surely the relatively paltry sums to be made are not worth the potential damage to Inveraray#s recovery, as seems to be the view of locals Perhaps councillors could look at this a little dferently. If they are determined to push this through for control traffic purposes, why not donate the proceeds, which would be a by-product of well-behaved traffic, to the town  The pier fund could certainly use it. Both the community council and Inspire Inveraray would no doubt welcome the cash and find many uses for public benefit.Just a thought.Congratulations to Cameron on his award. This is a huge achievement among a group of young people who each work hard for others.It is also  a great achievement for MacLeod Construction to be shortlisted for a national award.

However, on further reading, this was yet another unsurprising disappointment. The preferred corridor through Glen Croe is still to be announced and there is still no timetable for completion.Landslips at the Rest and be Thankful have frequently seen much of Argyll isolated from central Scotland, or journeys delayed by endless roadworks or convoys along the old military road. Most of these problems have occurred during the SNP’s  years in government and the continued failure to provide a permanent solution is yet more proof of how little the SNP cares about or understand the needs of people and businesses outside the central belt.It was clear long ago that patchwork schemes were not a solution but, rather than provide a new corridor which would have resulted in major capital expenditure, tens of millions of pounds have instead been wasted on years of ineffective schemes which nature evades in next to no time.In the meantime, the SNP has had no dficulty finding money to prop up central belt vanity projects like the Edinburgh trams.Mike Russell, SNP MSP for Argyll and Bute, has been far more concerned with Indyref and Brexit than the day to day concerns of his constituents and has done nothing to ensure that providing a reliable road connection to Argyll is a top priority for Michael Matheson, the Cabinet Secretary for Transport.The Holyrood elections on May  are an ideal opportunity for the residents and business owners in Argyll, whose daily lives are affected by such an unreliable road, to voice their dissatisfaction and vote for anyone other than the SNP or the Greens who oppose any road building on principle.A dferent government might not guarantee a speedy resolution, but after  years of failed sticking-plaster attempts to patch up the existing road, it certainly couldn’t be worse.Donald McCallum, Strathaven.Sir,Across the Kintyre and the Islands ward I continue to receive complaints about the rather shoddy condition of road signage.In some cases the signs are faded and covered in dirt and in many other cases they are falling to pieces.One example of this is the road signs above the footpath outside Port Ellen Primary School on Islay and sadly there are many other examples. In my opinion in the future Argyll and Bute Council must be more diligent in maintaining our signs.Road signs help to regulate traffic, provide crucial visual guidance and give drivers important previews, especially during night-time conditions.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I write further to correspondence on Lochgilphead#s expensive new pavements.When they are finally finished, could somebody seethey have a bucket or two of tarry stones left over that could be chucked into the tank trap that passes for a roundabout, next to the Tesco garage David Hay, MinardSir,I have immense pleasure in communicating to your readers our new address following our successful relocation of our main office premises.Our email, website and telephone numbers remain the same as before.Email: info@abcab.org.uk and phone  .We have had no break in service and continue to provide advice and support to clients across Argyll and Bute, with our advisers all working from home under current government guidance.We are also available to provide advice to those who find themselves in a vulnerable position and require face-to-face advice by appointment in our Helensburgh and Lochgilphead offices.We commence our second volunteer adviser training programme next month and look forward to welcoming our new trainees.Jen Broadhurst, Bureau Manager, Argyll and Bute Citizens Advice BureauSir,Following the Scottish Government#s pay offer of four per cent across the board for all NHS workers, Unite will ballot its members on the offer over the next few weeks.Unite represents workers in every pay band across the entire NHS structure and recognises that while this offer will put money into the pockets of our members, any monthly pay uplt will y considerably between iniduals. For this reason Unite will be putting this offer to our members without recommendation.The offer includes an opportunity to revisit any settlement including an intention by the Scottish Government to allocate additional funding through Barnett Consequentials. Unite will demand that any additional payment made to the Scottish Government by Westminster through this formula, is passed on to our members.Workers across the NHS have been described as #heroic# in what has been an exceptionally challenging year. Now is the time to reward those workers with the pay uplt they deserve, not just for their work during the Covid pandemic, but also for the pay cuts they have endured through years of austerity.For Unite, other pay potential remains on the table in the form of additional Barnett Consequentials and we will pursue any additional pay that is intended for our members through further negotiation with any future Scottish Government.James O’Connell, Unite regional officer for Scotland.Sir,I work for a TV company called Five Mile Films and we are making a new documentary series this year for Channel .We are looking for people to apply to take part who are wanting to live a simpler le.

He greeted them again, #Peace be with you,# before turning and addressing Thomas directly.He said to him: #Put your finger here and see my hands. Put your hand in my side.

You can also plant the first early potatoes, weather dependent.For beginners, some of the easiest fruits to grow are berries. Strawberries and blueberries love containers or open ground and both will crop heavily once established.A simple garden solution for April is to create your very own veg patch. Mark out the area well, prepare the soil, dig in compost and then sow a iety of seeds that will provide you with veg all year round.It’s a common misconception that you need a lot of space to be able to grow vegetables. You can still achieve real success with container grown plants. Tomatoes will thrive in pots and grow bags and can also be grown in the ground.Another plant that loves container leis Lavender – and it’s the perfect time to plant it so that you can enjoy it throughout the summer. It’s a favourite with gardeners not just for its beautul form and fragrance but also because it attracts essential pollinators such as bees and butterflies.It’s considered a romantic flower that most gardeners get the urge to plant in their garden sooner or later and can add real value with its scent and shades of purple flowers and silver leaf backdrop. To successfully grow lavender, it needs to be planted in a warm, well drained soil with full sun. It is often planted as an edging plant with roses or grown as an informal hedge. However, lavender does not like ‘wet feet’ as it promotes root rot and dampness is often the reason that it doesn’t perform well. It’s a tough plant though and once established only requires regular pruning after flowering has finished in the autumn.April not only sees the start of National Gardening Week , but it really kicks off the gardening season.Top April tips from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 9 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We are also looking for volunteers to support the service.There are an estimated , armed forces veterans in Scotland, with an average age of .  The Comradeship Circles also welcome their partners, widows, and widowers.Participants simply dial into the weekly chat, with a facilitator on hand to assistnecessary. The service is popular with those who are unable or find it dficult to enjoy social connection online.Our Comradeship Circles has been a social leline for many over the last six months, so we’re delighted this funding means they can continue. Even before the pandemic, thousands of older veterans still felt isolated because of health conditions, disabilities, or living in a rural location. Although restrictions are now easing, we know that many are feeling lonelier than ever before.While more and more older people are getting online, there are still hundreds of thousands who are unable or prefer not to use the internet. This telephone service has been especially valued by older veterans who have a disability or health condition which means they struggle to use the video conferencing apps.Comradeship Circles mean they can enjoy banter and share stories and memories of military le. It’s been inspiring to see the care and support that the veterans’ community give each other, helping each other through dficult time. Many participants have told us that they’ve rekindled old friendships or made new ones, or look forward to a natter to get them through the week.If you or someone you know is a veteran aged  or over, we’d encourage them to give it a try.A call to the Age Scotland helpline     can open the door to camaraderie and extra support for older members of the ex-service community.Brian Sloan, Age Scotland chief executive "},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures april 9 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

what now WeaskedDr Georgia Perona-Wright, who is a senior lecturer in Immunology at the University of Glasgow, to weigh in.Can I still get Covid, after Irsquom vaccinated Yes, you can. The good news though is that itrsquos very much less likelythat you will get covidyoursquore vaccinated, compared to someone who isnrsquot.Even better, in the unlikely event that you do catch Covid after being vaccinated, you are much less likely to get severe symptoms or be hospitalised thanyou had not been vaccinated.The clinical trials for the Pfizer vaccine reported a % efficacy, which means that the number of people who showed symptoms of covid during the time of the trial was % lower in the vaccinated group than in a comparison group who were not vaccinated.Data collected since the trials, as the vaccines have begun to be used widely, has confirmed these numbers, so the vaccines are very effective on a population scale. On a inidual scale, though, there is still a chance that you might be one of the very few people who is vaccinated and still gets infected it is possible, just very much less likely than without a vaccine.One extra point to add here is that the vaccines take time to work.The vaccine is not a instant shot of protectionit is a way to train your immune system, so that your immune system will then protect you. It takes - weeks or so for the immune system to respond so, evenyou are someone who has a superb immune response to the vaccine, you are still not protected until - weeks after the jag.Some cases of people being infected with covid after the vaccination are because they were exposed to the virus during this - week window. Be especially cautious during this time.Can I still infect other people Just as the vaccines make it much less likely that yoursquoll get infected, they also make it much less likely that you will be able to infect others ndash but in both cases the answer is that the chances are much reduced, but not zero.We donrsquot fully understand why some people are fully protected and others are not it might be that you have a slightly quirky immune system, or are immunosuppressed it might be that you are exposed to an unusually high dose of the virus.It might be something in your genes or environment that makes you a particularly good target for the virus.When the first trials were conducted to test how well the vaccines work, the data that was collected measured the number of people who showed symptoms of disease. This number was reduced % in the Pfizer trial.The trials did not attempt to measure whether vaccinated people could still be infectious. We have some really encouraging data now, collected after the trials from countries where vaccines have been used widely, showing that vaccination does also reduce transmission ndash meaning that vaccinated people are less likely to infect othersthan people who are not vaccinated.This is what we expected and hoped for, and itrsquos really good to see. This is why being vaccinated not only protects ourselves, but also others.Viruses cannot live for long periods on their ownthey need a person to provide a home.If you are successfully vaccinated, then your body is trained to refuse entry to the virus, denying it that home.When only a few people are vaccinated, the virus can fairly easily find another person, another home to occupy. When very many people are vaccinated, finding a home becomes much more of a challenge, and the virus is condemned to a lonely death outside.The idea of working together by using our immune systems to reduce the number of opportunities that the virus has to gain a foothold and spread is whatrsquos called ldquoherd immunity.Even the rare people in whom the vaccine didnrsquot work very well can be protected this way, as other peoplersquos vaccinations mean that they too are less likely to encounter the virus.Can I stop wearing a facemask when Irsquom vaccinated No. The importance of a face mask is that it is a barrier to stop you infecting other people.We still need to be cautious to avoid infection, and to avoid infecting others, until the amount of virus circulating in our communities falls.The Covid vaccines are one part of our toolkit for reducing the amount of virus circulating. They make it less likely yoursquoll get infected, less likely yoursquoll get sick, and less likely yoursquoll breathe out the virus and spread it to others.But there is still a small chance that each of these steps can happen, and so facemasks, space and distance are all still needed just now.The gradual easing of restrictions that is beginning just now is possible because wersquove successfully driven case numbers down, in part through the vaccination programme.If we can keep this up, then we will get to a point when case numbers are low enough that restrictions will ease yet further, and facemasks might then become optionalin more places.Will immunity last We are optimisticthat immunity will last ndash but not yet certain.The first people to receive the Covid vaccines were only vaccinated  months ago, so we know that vaccines can generate immunity that lasts at least  months.We know that the majority of people who have been infected with the SARS-CoV virus, that causes Covid, also have persistent immune cells and good antibody levels, even a year after infection.There was a lot of fear that immunity would not last, and there are been some prominent cases where people have been shown to be infected twice ndash so in those particualr people, immunity was either not persistent or not ever good enough.But for the majority of people, infection has led to persistent immunity, so far.Another piece of encouraging news is that particular immune cells, essential for protection, were still detectable last year in people who were infected in  with SARS, which was a severe infection caused by a similar coronavirus to the one that causes Covid.So we are optimistic, but will only know for certain when more time has passed.Another twisthere, is whether immunity generated by having one of the current vaccines will be effective against any virus iants: lasting immunity might not be useful,the virus mutates and can escape that immunity. But there are grounds for optimism here toohellipWill I need a booster ... There are two situations in which a booster might be useful.The first one is immunity doesnrsquot last long enoughwithout a booster, and in that case a third jag is definitely a possible solution.The second one is the virus mutates or ies, and we need to update our vaccines to match the new iants. The coronavirus that causes Covid is one that is known to mutate ndash thatrsquos a normal part of its biology.The flu virus is another example of a virus that we know mutates, and thatrsquos why flu vaccines are updated and given every year.But the Covid vaccines have held up well so far: the vaccines currently being used in the UK were designed against the original version of the virus, but have done very well in reducing disease and blocking transmission of the B.. Kent iant, for example.The immune response generated by the vaccines is strong, and evenit is two fold less effective against a new iant, there is a good chance the remaining immune response will still be enough to prevent severe disease and slow the spread of the virus.Another piece of good news is the way that these new vaccines have been designed makes it a relatively simple process to update them,new iants make that necessary.If we do need boosters, that too should be achievable.Will everything go back to normal once everyone has had both doses The gradual easing of restrictionsthat have begun now reflects the success of our collective ability to reduce the amount of virus circulating, and getting people fully vaccinated is a large part of this success.I hope that this gradual process will continue as the vaccination programme is completed, and more normality will be achieved in each step.That said, we are still a long way away from everyone having both doses, as we need vaccinations to be completed globally before any inidual country can fully relax.Within the UK, the vaccination programme is currently planned for all adults, but vaccines for teenagers and younger children are only in the stage of clinical trials.Globally, some restrictions on international travelmight need to persist until global vaccination rates increase, and those gobal vaccination rates depend on politics and cooperation between nations.Another aspect to this question is what normal really means.The pandemic hit us hard and for people whorsquove been bereaved, who have persistent symptoms or Long Covid, or whose jobs and livelihoods have been affected, normal wonrsquot ever be as it was.And as communities, there are also changes both good and bad.Will hand sanitiser provision in supermarkets continue  Will working from home always be more possible  Will high streets rejuvenate  There are opportunities for change here,we want to grasp them but there may also need to be time to heal and recover."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-peeblesshire-tests-people-without-symptoms","story":"CORONAVIRUS tests for people without symptoms are being offered in Peeblesshire again from today.In a press release issued by NHS Borders last week, the health board outlined plans for rapid testing sites toacross the region.Tests will be offered in West Lintontodayand tomorrow.COVIDtesting will alsoin Peeblesand Innerleithenover the weekend.:Fire started deliberately in Peeblesshire, suspect police ndash appeal issuedTesting will take place at the fire stations of all the above locations between .am-pm.NHS Bordersrsquo director of public health, Dr Tim Patterson, said: ldquoCommunity testing of those who feel well and do not have any typical COVID- symptoms is one of the key ways that we can keep each other safe.

It underlines the fact that it is communities who know best what is best for them.Argyll and Bute Council was at the centre of ensuring our resilience teams got support and Scottish Government funding dispersed quickly and efficiently.That is why I find the decision of the Tory Lib Dem Independent ruling administration to remove the recycling service from Kintyre Recycling Ltdand taking it in-house as short-sighted. And giving them only six months notice is disgraceful.KRL has provided a reliable service for the community since  and given employment opportunities to people with barriers to work. It has a committed board and management team who have ersied the projects it does to ensure sustainability. But this decision leaves a gaping hole in its business plan and a workforce unsurethey will still have jobs.There is a projected increase in cost of £, to supply recycling bins across Kintyre. But this does not take account of the possible social and welfare cost of the impact on the workforce. This is yet another blow to the community already hammered by unemployment.I urge the council to work closely with KRL to find a solution that ensures that all of the KRL employees at risk of redundancy are found suitable employment and that this valuable organisation can continue to employ vulnerable people providing services from which everyone benefits.In , the SNP published a coloured map showing options for the route of the A at the Rest and Be Thankful. Nine years later, all they have done is colour in the map slightly dferently. We are no further forward.Whoever is in government after the election must stump up the money needed to construct a road protected from landslides. This must be done a lot quicker than the  years the SNP say it will take them.Without urgent action, many businesses in Argyll will not survive.Across the Kintyre and the Islands ward I continue to receive complaints about the rather shoddy condition of road signs.In some cases the signs are faded and covered in dirt and in many other cases they are falling to pieces.One example of this is the road signs above the footpath outside of Port Ellen Primary School on Islay and sadly there are many other examples.In my opinion, in the future, Argyll and Bute Council must be more diligent in maintaining our signs. Road signs help regulate traffic, provide crucial visual guidance and give drivers important preview especially during night-time conditions.I will continue to campaign for more frequent road sign maintenance for every corner of my ward.Following the Scottish Government#s pay offer of four per cent across the board for all NHS workers, Unite will ballot its members on the offer over the next few weeks.Unite represents workers in every pay band across the entire NHS structure and recognises that while this offer will put money into the pockets of our members, any monthly pay uplt will y considerably between iniduals. For this reason, Unite will be putting this offer to our members without recommendation.The offer includes an opportunity to revisit any settlement including an intention by the Scottish Government to allocate additional funding through Barnett Consequentials. Unite will demand that any additional payment made to the Scottish Government by Westminster through this formula, is passed on to our members.Workers across the NHS have been described as #heroic# in what has been an exceptionally challenging year.Now is the time to reward those workers with the pay uplt they deserve, not just for their work during the Covid pandemic, but also for the pay cuts they have endured through years of austerity.For Unite, other pay potential remains on the table in the form of additional Barnett Consequentials and we will pursue any additional pay that is intended for our members through further negotiation with any future Scottish Government.I work for a television company called Five Mile Films and we are making a new documentary series this year for Channel .We are looking for people to apply to take part who want to live a simpler le.

He had #resigned himself to it,# the Pope said, #perhaps saying to himself: #Le is unfair, others are more fortunate than I am#. There is a plaintive tone in this way of speaking # there is resignation but there is also bitterness.#He added that it is an attitude reminiscent of #many [Christians] who lack enthusiasm and who are bitter#, who repeatedly say to themselves: #I go to [church] every Sunday but it is better not to become involved! I believe for my own sake, but I don#t feel the need to give it to others: each one peacefully at his own home.#These people, the Pope added, also take the attitude that # you do something well in le, they#ll reprove you: so, it#s better not to take the risk#.Good Friday, Easter Sunday # excellent days to take the risk and resolve to do something well in le, to set sensible goals to be better than I am now.

In summary, the society was to promote the study of the archaeology of Kintyre and adjacent islands, to investigate the history and antiquities of the area and to preserve and publish relevant records and documents.The office-bearers were: President, Macdonald of Largie Vice-presidents, Sherf Macmaster Campbell, Colonel Mactaggart and Thomas Lindsay Galloway Hon secretary and treasurer, Duncan Colville Council, Mrs T L Galloway , Latimer MacInnes, Dean of Guild Neil McArthur, Major W Macalister Hall of Torrisdale, Mrs Macneal of Lossit , Archibald Dunlop Armour and Rev Norman Mackenzie.Of these, Macmaster Campbell, Mactaggart, MacInnes and Colville would power the research engine of the society in the early decades of its existence with studies on archaeology, history, place-names and local dialect.The scholarly talents of two of the founder-members, Macdonald of Largie and Lindsay Galloway, were almost immediately annulled by the time of the society#s first annual general meeting on November  , both were dead.Macdonald, a product of Eton and Oxford, was the author of a three-volume History of France, and Galloway, a distinguished mining engineer and protégé of Lord Kelvin, in  graduated MA at Glasgow University with first class honours in mathematics and natural philosophy, #a very rare distinction#."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday april 9 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Sadly we have all heard of someone who has been affected by stroke and many people like me have tragically lost someone too.Almost five years ago, my wonderful mum, Diana, suffered a severe stroke. She died four weeks later. My mum was the most active, #full of le# person I knew. She LOVED le. She was my best friend and I miss her every day. That#s why I want to ask your readers to take part in the Stroke Association#s A Walk to Remember.This wonderful event is a special way to celebrate the le of your loved one whilst raising money in their memory.Simply pick a special place that is filled with memories, create your route, and on June  take part in your own walk to remember to raise funds for the Stroke Association.Stroke strikes every five minutes in the UK, and there are around , survivors in Scotland living with its devastating effects who really need our help.Like so many charities, the pandemic has drastically affected the Stroke Association#s income.However the charity has still been supporting stroke survivors as much as they can with support and advice, while continuing to fund vital research into the condition.Please join me and do something amazing in your loved one#s memory by taking part in A Walk to Remember.It#s bound to be an emotional but amazing day for all of us that have lost someone to stroke. Walk in their memory and raise funds to rebuild more lives after stroke.To sign up, please visit https:www.stroke.org.uk fundraising a-walk-to-rememberChildren#s lives have been turned upside over the last year due to challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic, with many spending extended periods of time out of school and behind closed doors.The NSPCC#s Childline service has heard from thousands of children who have found this time really challenging.Some have felt overwhelmed with home schooling and struggled to access their learning due to a lack of technology, whilst others have missed their friends and family and many have seen their mental health deteriorate.The NSPCC and Childline adapted during the pandemic so our frontline staff could continue to be here as a vital source of support for those children who felt like they had nowhere  to turn.Even though many children in Scotland are now back at school, it remains vital that we are still here to support those who are struggling with the impact that the pandemic has had on them.To help us be here for children and to remind them that Childline is a source of support they can turn to, we are encouraging schools across the country to get involved in the NSPCC#s Number Day.This annual fundraising day, which is based around fun maths activities, will take place in primary and secondary schools across the country on May  in aid of the children#s charity.As part of the day, schools can sign up to enjoy puzzles, games and challenges to raise vital funds.There are a range of activities for dferent age groups and teachers will also be provided with resources including information on supporting their school#s safeguarding.It#s now more essential than ever that children aren#t left alone, isolated and unsupported with their worries, and the money raised from Number Day will help the NSPCC in its mission to make  a better year for children.To sign up, visit the NSPCC#s website and search for Number Day and fill in your school#s details using the registration form.Age Scotland has won a £, grant for an innovative telephone friendship service which links older members of the ex-services community.Our Comradeship Circles service has helped to connect hundreds of older veterans for regular group calls since the pilot scheme was launched six months ago.The funding from the Armed Forces Covenant Fund Trust#s Tackling Loneliness Programme will enable our service to expand and continue until autumn , reaching even more older people. We are also looking for volunteers to support the service.There are an estimated , armed forces veterans in Scotland, with an average age of . The Comradeship Circles also welcome their partners, widows, and widowers.Participants simply dial into the weekly chat, with a facilitator on hand to assistnecessary. The service is popular with those who are unable or find it dficult to enjoy social connection online.Our Comradeship Circles has been a social leline for many over the last six months, so we#re delighted this funding means they can continue.Even before the pandemic, thousands of older veterans still felt isolated because of health conditions, disabilities, or living in a rural location. Although restrictions are now easing, we know that many are feeling lonelier than ever before.While more and more older people are getting online, there are still hundreds of thousands who are unable or prefer not to use the internet.This telephone service has been especially valued by older veterans who have a disability or health condition which means they struggle to use the video conferencing apps.Comradeship Circles mean they can enjoy banter and share stories and memories of military le.It#s been inspiring to see the care and support that the veterans# community gives each other, helping each other through dficult times. Many participants have told us that they’ve rekindled old friendships or made new ones, or look forward to a natter to get them through the week.If you or someone you know is a veteran aged  or over, we#d encourage them to give it a try.A call to the Age Scotland helpline     can open the door to camaraderie and extra support for older members of the ex-service community.I have been contacted by many of my constituents about the concerning condition of Ballymartin road on Islay.It has gradually been getting worse over the years but is now as bad as it has ever been and is getting to the stage that it#s nearly not passable for a small car without risking damage.I have raised this with our roads department and although funds are stretched, this road is clearly in need of some desperate repairs and,left unmaintained for any longer, will only end up costing the hard-pressed council taxpayer more to fix in the long-run."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week april 9 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The disciples were huddled indoors in fear of their lives when suddenly the resurrected Jesus was there among them.Thomas hadn#t been with the others when it happened. He just could not bring himself to believe without seeing him for himself. Thomas gets a bad press because of this.We often react to this wee excerpt from Thomas#s story aswe would have been less reluctant to believe. We carry our willingness to believe as a badge of faith. Poor old Doubting Thomas.But is doubt a weakness  Or is it simply an opportunity, a space, a fertile ground in which faith might grow and ultimately blossom A week later, the disciples were gathered again in the same house where they had last seen Jesus. This time, Thomas was with them. Once again, Jesus came and stood among them. He greeted them again, #Peace be with you,# before turning and addressing Thomas directly.He said to him: #Put your finger here and see my hands. Put your hand in my side. Do not doubt but believe.#Jesus#s words are aimed not only at Thomas, but at everyone who encounters this story, and struggles to believe that God is capable of doing the very thing that God has promised — call our world into new and unending, resurrected le.#Do not doubt but believe.#"},{"url":null,"title":"two pairs triumph at dunaverty","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

These devices have blocked an estimated , calls, of which , will have been scam phone calls prevented at least  scams and saved vulnerable households an estimated £, in NHS and health and social care costs.PC Laura Evans of Argyll and Dunbartonshire Policing Division said: #The most common types of scams at the moment are telephone and internet scams whereby the caller or person emailing, pretends to be someone , for example, someone from your bank, BT, Amazon or Sky.#We have a large number of telephone frauds where the caller is told their bank has set up a new account for them and has asked them to transfer their money to this new account. Your bank will never ask you to do this and I would encourage people to simply hang up the telephoneyou think you are being scammed or,you are concerned about someone  receiving scam calls, then consider a call-blocker device.#The most common calls being blocked by trueCall units are misleading sales of insurance for white goods, appliances or Sky equipment and attempts to sell cover for domestic home repairs.As more people signed up to streaming services during lockdown, there was an increase in scam calls purportedly from Amazon Prime, where cold callers said that the recipient#s subscription was due for renewal or that their account had been hacked.Another type of nuisance call which emerged towards the end of  was the sale of timeshares, possibly in response to widespread issues with travel and accommodation during the pandemic.An Argyll and Bute Council spokesperson said: #Scammers are unscrupulous with the sole intention of identying and exploiting the most vulnerable in our communities by obtaining people#s personal data and to encourage them to give the caller their bank details. This is often achieved by implying that urgent action is required – a tactic which particularly targets elderly and more vulnerable people.#The trueCall call-blocking unit can give our residents peace of mind, knowing thatthe phone rings it will be someone they want to talk to.#If you are being pestered by nuisance calls or you know a family member or friend that could benefit from having a call-blocker, please contact Argyll and Bute Trading Standards on    or tradingstandards.office@argyll-bute.gov.uk to apply for a free device.#"},{"url":null,"title":"announcements april 16 2021","story":"ProductionUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Demand was so high, however, that another  bottles were released.Bottle number one was auctioned off on April , the day the helipad was deemed operational, with  per cent of the winning £ bid, placed by Campbeltown man Lewis Nelson, being donated to SKDT.Beinn an Tuirc Distillers director Emma Macalister Hall met with Lewis and SKDT manager Eric Spence last week, to give Lewis bottle number one and present Eric with a cheque for the total £, raised.Lewis, who had to fight for the bottle after a bidding war broke out, said: #It#s a nice way to support the project — and it#s also a good way to get a nice bottle of gin!#He added that he is actually teetotal so the bottle will serve as a memento of the occasion.Eric said: I#d really like to thank Beinn an Tuirc Distillers — it#s a fantastic amount raised. The support we#ve received from the community, and local and national businesses, has been amazing.#Emma added: #We wanted to support the project because we know the dference it will make to the community. It#s fantastic — although we hope we never have to use it.#The helipad project was led by ambulance technician Stuart McLellan, from Neilston in East Renfrewshire, after he saw emergency services struggling to airlt patients from the often water-logged field which previously served as a helipad while visiting relatives in Campbeltown in .The £, facility was fully funded by the HELP Appeal, a charity dedicated to funding NHS hospital helipads, and was built by Kintyre companies McFadyens Contractors and McKinven and Colville, with specialist equipment supplied by FEC Heliports Equipment."},{"url":null,"title":"lindsay gets active ahead of 50k walk in memory of dad","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

There was mention the flat had not been used much for the purpose of respite for islanders.However, a report before IJB members said the lack of consultation over it closing had caused community concern. The meeting was told there had been #a mix up# over communicating what was happening with islanders.Councillor Mulvaney said he did not feel the flat merited still being in the budget. #We should have saved this [the money] a number of years ago,# he said.Councillor Currie said: #The flat has been used, not much, but it has been used. Everyone is accepting it could have been advertised better.#It was Mid Argyll councillor Sandy Taylor who asked for the service level agreement for the advocacy service to be spared from the savings option list as #a contribution to mental health.#MID ARGYLL AND ISLAY:People across Mid Argyll and Islay have had their mental health boosted thanks to the innovative #Take  Challenge# which began in Kintyre.Inspired by Campbeltown Tesco manager David Brown#s personal K-a-day challenge in , mental health network ACUMEN, in conjunction with Kintyre Link Club, organised the initiative encouraging more people to #take five# each day –  five minutes of walking, five deep breaths of fresh air or a five-kilometre walk or run – with the aim of boosting wellbeing.After success in Kintyre, ACUMEN mental health development worker Sarah McFadzean rolled the challenge out across Mid Argyll and Islay, where people are encouraged to support one another in their challenges by way of a dedicated Facebook group.Where possible, people have been able to meet in twos and, as restrictions change, it is hoped opportunities for groups to Take  together will increase as the initiative moves to the Oban, Lorn and the Isles area in June.Sarah said: #Being involved and enjoying the challenge is as important as the activities themselves.#I would like to thank everyone who supported and got involved in Take  for their enthusiasm and assistance.#We are in the process of developing a Mental Health Forum and Lived Experience Group in the Mid Argyll, Kintyre and the Isles, the purpose of which will be to gather thoughts on current service provision, listen to others# experiences and inform future planning, along with providing information from a range of services and peer support.#For more information contact sarah.mcfadzean@acumennetwork"},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane april 16 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Meantime, however, with the exception of the magazine, all society activities remain in a state of suspension."},{"url":null,"title":"from our files april 16 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

And now, more than a week later and despite updates in the interim about the reopening of schools, they#re still waiting – and it#s not acceptable.Like everyone , islanders are desperate to know when they can reconnect with family and friends. Island businesses are equally frantic to know when and how they can make plans for the weeks ahead.But, unlike everyone , our islands are at a complete disadvantage. They still don#t know what is happening, or when. They deserve better. The Scottish Government needs to respond to our islands# call for clarity and let them, like the rest of the country, start to think and plan ahead.Now in its nd year, the Big Garden Birdwatch is a chance for people of all ages to count the number of birds that visit their garden helping the Royal Society for the Protection of Birdsto build up a picture of how they are doing.This year, more than a million people across the UK, including more than , in Scotland, took part, counting  million birds.The event, held over the last weekend in January, revealed the house sparrow held on to its number one spot. But  out of the top  bird species showed declines in average numbers in Scotland compared to last year.Starlings remained in second place, but numbers were down  per cent compared to . Goldfinches saw the greatest decline in Scotland’s top , falling four places from sixth position last year, with reported numbers  per cent fewer than .I am absolutely delighted with the number of people who have taken part, making it the biggest year ever for RSPB Scotland.This has generated a massive amount of data which will help our scientists with important conservation work, but it also shows how many of us have turned to nature after what has been a dficult  months.We need every voice raised to stand up for nature. The wildle that brings us so much interest and solace is now just a fraction of what should be there.Big Garden Birdwatch has shown that people across Scotland have a real passion for their wildle. We now need government to take the global leadership, policy and legislative opportunities open to it this year to reverse the decline and restore nature.It#s no exaggeration to say that when a dog goes missing or is stolen, it is heart-breaking.Dogs for Good has put together some tips to reduce the likelihood of your dog being taken.If the unthinkable happens and your dog is taken, remember, you are not alone.

Phyllis Logan was Mary Poppins, music producer Naughty Boy was Jay Gatsby, Emma Barton was Holly Golightly and Jess and Natalya Wright were Alice in Wonderland and the Queen of Hearts.Families with dementia have been adversely affected by lockdown for just over a year now. Care home visiting restrictions, the closure of support and respite services and the resulting social isolation and loneliness have disproportionately affected people living with dementia and their family carers.Whilst Time for a Cuppa will be slightly dferent this year, we know dementia support is needed more than ever. We are so grateful to all our fundraisers who will be whipping up treats, enthusiasm, funds and who are giving their time for others – in a socially distanced way of course – in what will be a special and important Time for a Cuppa.For more information about Time for a Cuppa and how to host your own tea party with our free fundraising pack, visit the dementiauk.org timeforacuppa webpage."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week april 16 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We have celebrated birthdays, weddings, Christmases, Easters and any day we can! There has been laughter and sadness, fun, hope and joy.It was  when the seeds were planted at the South Kintyre Fit Communities about the need to develop a shopping service to help older people on discharge from hospital, no longer able to drive or to carry heavy bags.Since then, we have provided not just a shopping service but a number of social activities and housekeeping throughout Kintyre. We have developed the #Making Kintyre Dementia Friendly# project to help all parts of the community to have an understanding of dementia and how it can be managed. We have worked with children of all ages, meeting and helping the older generation and look forward to doing so again.Covid- has changed all our lives and we have had to adapt to dferent ways of keeping in touch and keeping busy. Phone Buddies was set up and we had a monthly virtual tea.However, our plans – started last year – to celebrate our th anniversary with parties has had to be cancelled but we are marking the occasion with a specially made mug by Simon Rochford of Campbeltown Pottery.Thanks to everyone who has been involved in any way with Shopper-Aide – it has been and, I hope, will continue to be, a help to the older generations in Kintyre.So here is to the next  years."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week april 16 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

In our desire to understand it, we have created starry patterns in our minds like the Plough, the Bull and so on, however, the signs of the Zodiac were already known to the Babylonians in  BC so that is not something new.Today, constellations like Aries, Gemini and others continue to fascinate followers of both astronomy and astrology.One of the most interesting star formations is the Pleiades, better known as the Seven Sisters. Positioned a little to the right of Taurus, they are an unmistakable sight in the winter sky.Even a modest pair of binoculars will reveal that there are many more stars in that cluster than the naked eye can discern. The Pleiades along with Orion, are even mentioned in the bible, in the Book of Job, chapter ..With the aid of binoculars these stars are a truly dazzling sight.The bible is a collection of books coming from the pens of many dferent authors over a long period of time. These books contain fascinating stories, many with moral teaching in them to guide us along the way of le.Alas, although the bible has sold millions of copies down the ages, it often remains unread and not consulted.Just as binoculars can enrich our vision of the #starry, starry night# so we can enrich our lives by a careful exploration of the bible and discover what it can teach us, so, let#s look at it more closely and take time to enjoy what it has to offer."},{"url":null,"title":"former-ross-high-pupil-ruari-paton-aiming-scottish-cup-glory","story":"Ruari Paton will be hoping to line up for Stranraer todaywhen they make the long journey north to face Brora Rangers, who stunned Hearts in the previous round.The frontman attended the Tranent secondary school after signing for Hibernian as a teenager and making the move from Dublin.Many had expected Stranraer to be travelling to Tynecastle this weekend but Brora caused one of the biggest shocks in the competitionrsquos history when they won - last Tuesday.Paton was part of the Stranraer team taking on Brechin City at the same time and said that his reaction was much the same as football fans up and down the country when he heard the result.He said: ldquoI would not like to take anything away from Brora but you donrsquot really hear of a Championship team getting beaten by a Highland League or a Lowland League team ever.ldquoIt was a shock, it was a big shock, but fair play to them.ldquoWhat an achievement it is and it is an amazing challenge to overcome.ldquoYou cannot take anything away from them.Stranraer have enjoyed an impressive start to the campaign, with just one defeat since the beginning of November, as they look toto League One.Paton, who now lives in Bothwell, South Lanarkshire, has been at the heart of that form, scoring eight goals in all competitions, with strikes against Spartans and a last-minute penalty winner against Kelty Hearts in the previous round.He has also found the net for Gala Fairydean Rovers, while on loan from Hibs, and for East Kilbride in the competition last year.Now, attention has turned to the trip to Brora and Paton said: ldquoTherersquos nothing better in the world than scoring.

Both of them made it very easy in terms of putting you at ease.ldquoHe was particularly interested in the history, not just of the racecourse, but also of the golf course. I think he had anticipated coming for just a race day, but we had gathered a lot of historical information about the racecourse and the golf course and he was very interested in both.ldquoThe impression I got was that he was a keen sportsman, but perhaps racing was not his first love, it was The Queenrsquos, and he was more interested in talking to people.ldquoHe did enjoy it ndash The Queen had a runner, and I got a bit carried away when we thought her horse was going to win.

Liberal Democrats have been highlighting the shocking state of mental health services across Scotland.Right now, adults can wait up to two years for necessary treatments.Even prior to the pandemic, waiting times for these vital community services were getting worse.Earlier this year, Lib Dems in the Scottish Parliament finally persuaded the Scottish Government to declare this awful situation a national crisis.Now we need to elect more MSPs that will treat it as that.We immediately need to see a resumption of mental health First Aid training.This was suspended for the pandemic, yet physical First Aid courses were allowed to continue.During the recent budget negotiations, my party was able to secure pound million for community services and we need to see much more going towards these early help services.The impact on our families, communities and economy of failing to take this crisis seriously cannot be overstated.Under the current SNP Government, it is not just mental health services which have suffered.Nicola Sturgeon has broken her waiting times guarantee, failing , patients, meaning they have to wait longer than  weeks for vital services.The mismanagement of hospital construction has meant that the new Sick Kids building in Edinburgh has opened  years after it was promised.Now she is threatening closure of the vital Eye Pavilion, which has provided such fantastic treatment for so many across the Lothians.It appears that her Government wishes to move the service to St Johnrsquos in Livingston, making it extremely dficult for many communities across East Lothian.In a few weeksrsquo time, we need to elect someone who will fight tooth and nail for investment in our health services and push to keep them as local as possible.This wonrsquot be possiblewe spend the next five years bickering over another referendum.Craig Hoy PARTY politics were rightly set aside last weekend when we suspended campaigning to mark the sad passing of the Duke of Edinburgh.Seeing our communities come together to remember someone who gave over eight decades of military and public service was a poignant reminder of what is important.As parties resume campaigning as postal ballots arrive this week, it is time for East Lothianrsquos candidates to outline how they plan to make a dference for our communities.My campaign is focusing on our recovery from Covid-.I am presenting positive commitments to our towns and villages while, at the same time, warning of the risks of breaking up the United Kingdom.One of my top campaign priorities is education and this reflects local peoplersquos priorities too.We must do more to support our young people who have been devastated by the effects of Covid-.In East Lothian, the pupil-to-teacher ratio ranks alongside Edinburgh as the worst in Scotland.The SNP have failed to deliver on their promise of reducing class sizes and pupils are suffering restricted subject choice.Thatrsquos why the Scottish Conservatives are committed to delivering , extra teachers nationally.The SNP have made only limited progress in closing the attainment gap in our schools ndash despite saying it was their defining mission.Alongside the local Labour council administration, the SNP are failing pupils from the poorest backgrounds in East Lothian.Our countyrsquos attainment gap grew by three per cent between  and .It is unacceptable that the SNP Government have excluded local schools from receiving attainment challenge funding to address this.If elected as your MSP, I will press the case for more investment and more teachers for our schools, to help give all our young people the very best start in le.Only a vote for me in the constituency vote, and only by casting your hugely important lsquoparty

where across Scotland The SNP is committed to public services: wersquoll give NHS staff a four per cent pay rise and introduce both a National Care Service and a National Wage for Carers.Nicola Sturgeon recently set out her aims to ldquobring on stream underused theatre capacity in community and general hospitals to treat more patients as day cases... including in East Lothian Community Hospital in Haddington.That is an immediate benefit, on our doorstep.Wersquore helping children to learn by ensuring they donrsquot go hungry at school and investing in social housing and fair rents in the private sector.Meeting housing needs must be guided by principles of social justice, equality and human rights: everyone is entitled to a home that supports health, wellbeing, job prospects and le chances.The SNPrsquos lsquoHousing to rsquo plan was initiated before the pandemic.Having consulted widely across Scotland, it is delivering a housing strategy putting people and communities first, with , affordable homes by  , including  per cent for social housing.The construction industry can benefit the economy and good-quality housing can transform lives.I believe voters trust the SNP to build the post-Covid recovery of public services.They have already rejected Boris Johnsonrsquos Brexit shambles and its  promise to spend billions more on the NHS.I believe East Lothian voters will similarly reject the Labour and Tory recent support of stockpiling even more nuclear weapons, rather than spending those billions on health, housing and education.Broken promises undermine public trust, and trust is fundamental in this election.Which leader do you trust to form a government that represents your values and prioritises public services meeting your communityrsquos needs Rebuilding an economy supporting public services will make Scotland the country we know it can be it needs the full powers of independence and I trust Nicola Sturgeonrsquos experienced leadership.To elect me as MSP and Nicola Sturgeon as First Minister, itrsquos lsquoBoth Votes SNPrsquo in East Lothian.Martin Whitfield FOLLOWING the death of the Duke of Edinburgh, we suspended our campaigning as a mark of respect for HM The Queen and the Royal Family.Prince Philip was a remarkable public servant and we will again suspend campaigning on Saturday for his funeral to reflect on his contribution to public le.Before campaigning was suspended, Scottish Labour unveiled its recovery plan for the economy and jobs.At its heart is a pound. billion jobs recovery plan, the biggest job creation scheme in the history of devolution.This recognises the scale of the looming jobs crisis the country faces.It includes guaranteeing a job or training for every under-, as well as those over- who are long-term unemployed, , new apprenticeships and a skills revolution.The party also launched plans for an ambitious climate recovery, something Scottish Labour believes should go hand in hand with our economic recovery.This includes investing in green transport, safer walking and cycling routes, free bus travel for under-s, making all homes energy efficient to reduce living costs, create jobs and help to reduce our carbon emissions.These innovative national plans will translate well to a local level, providing a framework to support East Lothianrsquos recovery.However, Irsquom very clear that our local recovery, while backed by national guidance and funding, must be designed and delivered locally, not by ministers and civil servants in Edinburgh.Over the last year, our communities have demonstrated how they can come together in times of need and look after each other.Local communities, businesses and organisations should be empowered to show the same drive and determination in recovering from Covid- that they have shown throughout the crisis.Finally, on a more personal note, I have pledged my support for several important campaigns and initiatives so far during the campaign.Among them are the Teach the Future pledge on making the climate emergency part of the curriculum the More for Scotlandrsquos Animals pledge on animal welfare the Walk, Wheel, Cycle, Vote

Trade Deal being negotiated with the USA leaves our NHS vulnerable and available for sale.Our SNP MPs proposed an amendment which would have ensured that our NHS remained in the public ownership.The Westminster Government rejected that safeguard.Since GP surgeries are independent contractors, not run by the NHS, they are vulnerable to being sold to the highest bidder.This is how the system was set up in .It may have made sense at the time but no longer.We must review the deal with doctors and ensure that creeping privatisation cannot take place.In Scotland, we have control over our NHS.However, the UK Government passed the Internal Markets Act, which allows UK Government ministers to arbitrarily enforce a lsquolevelling outrsquo of regulations and dferences between the nations of the UK.This would allow London to make NHS Scotland available for sale regardless of our wishes.I will fight to prevent the loss of our NHS and the best way to be sure of that is to take back

of the Duke of Edinburgh ndash a dedicated public servant.I send my condolences to Her Majesty The Queen and her family.The quality of our social care system should be a key issue at this election.The speed with which the failings of our social care system were exposed last spring was ghastly.The Covid crisis didnrsquot bring about the crisis in social care, it was already there.It simply brought it to the top of the agenda.The challenge of Covid- has made the crisis in care even more acute.The movement of people from hospital settings, without consultation and without being tested, into care homes to accommodate Covid patients was a human rights scandal.This contributed to the devastating reality of care homes becoming the epicentre of the pandemic and almost a third of deaths across the country being people from care homes.Scotlandrsquos social care workers have also been on the frontline in the fight against Covid.Their commitment, alongside all our other frontline workers, to help keep us safe during this public health emergency has been heroic.Scottish Labour has been calling for a National Care Service for some years now, a service that will include local governmentrsquos social care staff as partners in the service delivery.It will put the dignity of iniduals and the quality of services before profit.We must address the inequalities in the sector as it deals with the shortcomings highlighted in the recent Feeley Report, which I donrsquot think goes far enough.Scotland urgently needs a plan to transform social care. Scottish Labour knows that urgent reform and investment is needed and thatrsquos why we are working with the public to make our vision for a National Care Service a reality.We donrsquot want to just talk about the problems, we want a plan for how things could be better.Charles Dundas A QUESTION which I keep being asked during this campaign is what will the Scottish Liberal Democrats do for those in our communities who are struggling to make ends meet, especially those with children I know that all parties are committed to reducing child poverty, but here is what I want to do about it.Willie Rennie and the Scottish Liberal Democrats will commit to doubling the Scottish Child Payment.This is currently available at pound per week to eligible children under six.This will rise to take in under-s in the next few years and we will pay pound per week.We are also keen to listen to campaigners who want to extend the payments to include disabled children or those with disabled parents.It was Liberal Democrats who reintroduced free school meals and targeted extra money to schools who needed it most in England, and in Scotland we will extend free school meals to cover all primary school pupils all through the year, including school holidays.This will also help these children with their education since a hungry child finds it dficult to focus and learn.The Scottish Lib Dems also pledge to increase the amount of free childcare Scotland offers, increasing it to a full , hours for every two-year-old.At the moment only some twoyear-olds are eligible, and takeup of the places is very low.By expanding the scheme, wersquod hope it would be more useful to more and more working parents, helping them get back to work and all the benefits that brings to society and the economy.We will also extend the number of summer clubs on offer to eligible children to help parents on low incomes with the costs of childcare during the school holidays.Plus, our manesto pledge on fuel poverty will also help us with child poverty.Warm homes with lower heating costs undoubtedly help the families who need it most, and I think that Midlothian North and Musselburgh would benefit from more Liberal Democrat policies like these in place after the election.Iain Whyte AS PART of my campaign, I have been highlighting the need for more local policing and ato locally based crime prevention across the constituency.This should be backed by visible local police patrols in our neighbourhoods to deter and detect crime.So, it was disappointing to read news articles this week highlighting police advice to Musselburgh householders about securing their garden sheds due to a spate of breakins.The crimes seem to have been concentrated in the Stoneybank area but the advice is valuable for everyone.Police say you should make sure your shed is secure and should fit an alarmthere is anything valuable inside.The alarms can be provided free to elderly and vulnerable residents: email MusselburghWestCPT@scotland.pnn.police.ukSince Police Scotland was formed, there has been a centralisation of our policing that I want to see reversed.During that time, public awareness of police patrols fell from  to  per cent.I know from my time as chair of Lothian and Borders Police Board that locally based crime prevention had a really positive impact.Crime fell and communities felt far more connected to their local officers, who they knew were working on their priorities.Thatrsquos why I want to see beefed-up neighbourhood policing teams and theirin the parts of the constituency where they have been reduced or removed.These teams work well on a preventative agenda.They solve problem issues and work with the community sorting things like housebreaking sprees and anti-social behaviour.I also strongly support the wider Scottish Conservative campaign to introduce a Local Policing Act to boost local police patrols and increase community engagement with policing decisions.This goes alongside our plan to tackle more serious crime by introducing a Victims Law to end the SNPrsquos soft-touch justice system.This would give judges the ability to put the very worst criminals behind bars for le.It would also end automatic early release, so that criminals must earn parole.Musselburgh residents need to see a more visible, local and responsive police service.That

If yoursquove never tried growing tomatoes, this could be the year to have a go!Getting startedSome gardeners begin with seed but ensuring the correct temperatures for germinating tomato seeds can be tricky. We find that most people prefer to buy their tomatoes as young plants, and these are available in pots at this time of year. Buying tomatoes as young plants also gives gardeners the opportunity to mix and match dferent ieties.Therersquos a vast range of ieties to choose from, which at first may seem quite disconcerting. So start by considering the type of tomato you prefer and the space you have available to grow them.Generally speaking, tomatoes are either grown on a single, upright stemor as a bush.If itrsquos your first time growing tomatoes, it might be easier to begin with one of the bush ieties, but read on and decide for yourself!Bush tomatoesTwo of our most popular bush-type ieties are lsquoTumblerrsquo and lsquoTumbling Tom Redrsquo but seedsmen are always improving ieties so take time to read the labels on the plants in the garden centre before making your choice.Bush tomatoes tend to have a slightly weeping habit, making them well-suited to being grown in pots, window boxes or hanging baskets. They tend to be relatively compact plants with numerous sideshoots producing clusters of tomatoes.Upright tomatoesAmongst the upright ieties lsquoAlicantersquo, lsquoMoneymakerrsquo and lsquoShirleyrsquo are well tried-and-tested, producing a good crop of full size, red tomatoes.For cherry tomatoes, lsquoGardenerrsquos Delightrsquo is by far the most popular choice amongst our customers.Upright tomatoes can be grown in pots, grow-bags or directly into the ground. As the plant grows, the stem needs to be kept straight so that it can bear the weight of the tomatoes and will require support either by canes or string.To maintain the strength of the main stem, sideshoots need to be nipped out. Sideshoots are the little shoots that appear in the angle between the leaf and the main stem and, as any tomato grower will tell you, itrsquos a job that requires to be done very regularly!Other ietiesTherersquos also a wide selection of yellow, beef-steak, plum and other distinctive ieties to choose from, so take your time to read the labels and choose the ieties that will best suit you, your garden and your family.CultivationAll tomatoes like a warm, sunny location to grow. Outdoor-grown tomatoeswill have to be well-sheltered, although there still needs to be some movement of air to avoid disease.Watering needs to be consistent and regular, and tomatoes growing in pots or growbags will benefit from having a tray underneath to provide a reservoir that they can draw from between waterings. Avoid irregular watering, as it results in uneven growth and may cause the tomatoes to split.Once you see the first bunch of yellow flowers appear, thatrsquos your first tomatoes on they way! The flowers will die off and the little tomatoes will begin to form ndash thatrsquos when gardeners will happily report that ldquothe first truss has set!Once the first truss is set, yoursquoll need to provide additional feeding and this is best done in liquid form whilst watering using a specialist feed such as the well-respected lsquoTomoritersquo, for example.As the season progresses, you may decide to remove some of the older leaves to let more light in and help the fruit ripen. For tomatoes that havenrsquot ripened at the end of the season, use them in the green for chutney or bring them indoors and leave them on the windowsill to ripen.And then...If yoursquove enjoyed growing your own tomatoes and plan to do it again next year, make sure that you remove the old plants completely so that yoursquore not leaving any rotting vegetation and disease that could affect next yearrsquos tomatoes.As always, the plant team are always very happy to help with tips and advice ndash so much easier now that wersquore allowed to be open again, of course!Yoursquoll also find lots of information on our website at www.merryhatton"},{"url":null,"title":"doors-reopening-dirleton-castle-tantallon-castle","story":"Historic Environment Scotlandis preparing to open the gates to more than  ticketed sites, including Tantallon Castle, near North Berwick, and Dirleton Castle, across the country this month.The historic sites will open on April  following the Scottish Governmentrsquos proposed dates for the reopening of the tourism sector and mainland Scotland moving to Covid protection level three.New technology is also being implemented as part of HESrsquos new visitor offering.Visitors will be able to explore the stories of many of the sites in innovative ways through downloadable maps, family trails, quizzes and quests, music, poetry and personal accounts to tell stories throughout the centuries, videos exploring Gaelic culture and words, and digital fly-throughs to areas usually restricted to visitors.Visitors will be able to enjoy access to the historic outdoor spaces at both sites, as well as the Doocot, Gazebo, Hallyburton Range and first floor of the Ruthven Range at Dirleton Castle.All visitors, including members, will be required to pre-book tickets online and to use contactless payment where possible one-way systems will be implemented in some locations visitors must wear face coverings in any indoor enclosed spaces, including retail and catering areas and visitor numbers will be limited for safety reasons.Alex Paterson, chief executive of HES, said: ldquoWe know how keen our members and visitors are to get back to our sites, so wersquore delighted to reopen over  per cent of our properties on April .ldquoScotlandrsquos heritage sector is a key part of our tourism offer ndash from providing jobs to increasing our wellbeing ndash and, in addition to reopening the sites that reopened last year, we will also reopen further sites on a phased basis over the upcoming months.Tantallon Castle will open daily, am-pm, from April , while Dirleton Castle will open on the same date and from then on will be open Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays between the same times.For more information, go to restarthistory.scot"},{"url":null,"title":"in-pictures-prince-philips-visits-east-lothian","story":"On Friday, Buckingham Palace confirmed the news of his death, mere months before his th birthday, saying that he passed away peacefully last Friday morning at Windsor Castle.Since then people across the world have been sharing their condolences and been paying tribute to the late Duke, including here in East Lothian.Over the years the Duke of Edinburgh has visited East Lothian on several occasions, both solo and with the Queen, to whom he was married to for more than  years.From Haddington and North Berwick to Musselburgh and the opening of Yellowcraig Caravan Park in , he has visited several parts of the county over his  years.One of his first visits is believed to be in  with the then Princess Elizabeth, a year before her coronation.Over the years he re-visited the county on several occasions.Another was  when he inspected the British Legion parade in North Berwick, he also opened Yellowcraig Caravan park in .He has also visited Haddington on numerous occasions, in ,  and .Prince Philiprsquos last public visit is believed to be with the Queen, who was  years old at the time, to Musselburgh Racecourse in , when the couple helped it celebrate its th birthday.

The good news though is that itrsquos very much less likely that you will get covidyoursquore vaccinated, compared to someone who isnrsquot.Even better, in the unlikely event that you do catch Covid after being vaccinated, you are much less likely to get severe symptoms or be hospitalised thanyou had not been vaccinated.The clinical trials for the Pfizer vaccine reported a % efficacy, which means that the number of people who showed symptoms of covid during the time of the trial was % lower in the vaccinated group than in a comparison group who were not vaccinated.Data collected since the trials, as the vaccines have begun to be used widely, has confirmed these numbers, so the vaccines are very effective on a population scale. On a inidual scale, though, there is still a chance that you might be one of the very few people who is vaccinated and still gets infected it is possible, just very much less likely than without a vaccine.One extra point to add here is that the vaccines take time to work.The vaccine is not a instant shot of protection it is a way to train your immune system, so that your immune system will then protect you. It takes - weeks or so for the immune system to respond so, evenyou are someone who has a superb immune response to the vaccine, you are still not protected until - weeks after the jag.Some cases of people being infected with covid after the vaccination are because they were exposed to the virus during this - week window. Be especially cautious during this time.Just as the vaccines make it much less likely that yoursquoll get infected, they also make it much less likely that you will be able to infect others ndash but in both cases the answer is that the chances are much reduced, but not zero.We donrsquot fully understand why some people are fully protected and others are not it might be that you have a slightly quirky immune system, or are immunosuppressed it might be that you are exposed to an unusually high dose of the virus.It might be something in your genes or environment that makes you a particularly good target for the virus.When the first trials were conducted to test how well the vaccines work, the data that was collected measured the number of people who showed symptoms of disease. This number was reduced % in the Pfizer trial.The trials did not attempt to measure whether vaccinated people could still be infectious. We have some really encouraging data now, collected after the trials from countries where vaccines have been used widely, showing that vaccination does also reduce transmission ndash meaning that vaccinated people are less likely to infect others than people who are not vaccinated.This is what we expected and hoped for, and itrsquos really good to see. This is why being vaccinated not only protects ourselves, but also others.Viruses cannot live for long periods on their own they need a person to provide a home.If you are successfully vaccinated, then your body is trained to refuse entry to the virus, denying it that home.When only a few people are vaccinated, the virus can fairly easily find another person, another home to occupy. When very many people are vaccinated, finding a home becomes much more of a challenge, and the virus is condemned to a lonely death outside.The idea of working together by using our immune systems to reduce the number of opportunities that the virus has to gain a foothold and spread is whatrsquos called ldquoherd immunity.Even the rare people in whom the vaccine didnrsquot work very well can be protected this way, as other peoplersquos vaccinations mean that they too are less likely to encounter the virus.No. The importance of a face mask is that it is a barrier to stop you infecting other people.We still need to be cautious to avoid infection, and to avoid infecting others, until the amount of virus circulating in our communities falls.The Covid vaccines are one part of our toolkit for reducing the amount of virus circulating. They make it less likely yoursquoll get infected, less likely yoursquoll get sick, and less likely yoursquoll breathe out the virus and spread it to others.But there is still a small chance that each of these steps can happen, and so facemasks, space and distance are all still needed just now.The gradual easing of restrictions that is beginning just now is possible because wersquove successfully driven case numbers down, in part through the vaccination programme.If we can keep this up, then we will get to a point when case numbers are low enough that restrictions will ease yet further, and facemasks might then become optional in more places.We are optimistic that immunity will last ndash but not yet certain.The first people to receive the Covid vaccines were only vaccinated  months ago, so we know that vaccines can generate immunity that lasts at least  months.We know that the majority of people who have been infected with the SARS-CoV virus, that causes Covid, also have persistent immune cells and good antibody levels, even a year after infection.There was a lot of fear that immunity would not last, and there are been some prominent cases where people have been shown to be infected twice ndash so in those particualr people, immunity was either not persistent or not ever good enough.But for the majority of people, infection has led to persistent immunity, so far.Another piece of encouraging news is that particular immune cells, essential for protection, were still detectable last year in people who were infected in  with SARS, which was a severe infection caused by a similar coronavirus to the one that causes Covid.So we are optimistic, but will only know for certain when more time has passed.Another twist here, is whether immunity generated by having one of the current vaccines will be effective against any virus iants: lasting immunity might not be useful,the virus mutates and can escape that immunity. But there are grounds for optimism here toohellip... There are two situations in which a booster might be useful.The first one isimmunity doesnrsquot last long enough without a booster, and in that case a third jag is definitely a possible solution.The second one isthe virus mutates or ies, and we need to update our vaccines to match the new iants. The coronavirus that causes Covid is one that is known to mutate ndash thatrsquos a normal part of its biology.The flu virus is another example of a virus that we know mutates, and thatrsquos why flu vaccines are updated and given every year.But the Covid vaccines have held up well so far: the vaccines currently being used in the UK were designed against the original version of the virus, but have done very well in reducing disease and blocking transmission of the B.. Kent iant, for example.The immune response generated by the vaccines is strong, and evenit is two fold less effective against a new iant, there is a good chance the remaining immune response will still be enough to prevent severe disease and slow the spread of the virus.Another piece of good news is the way that these new vaccines have been designed makes it a relatively simple process to update them,new iants make that necessary.If we do need boosters, that too should be achievable.The gradual easing of restrictions that have begun now reflects the success of our collective ability to reduce the amount of virus circulating, and getting people fully vaccinated is a large part of this success.I hope that this gradual process will continue as the vaccination programme is completed, and more normality will be achieved in each step.That said, we are still a long way away from everyone having both doses, as we need vaccinations to be completed globally before any inidual country can fully relax.Within the UK, the vaccination programme is currently planned for all adults, but vaccines for teenagers and younger children are only in the stage of clinical trials.Globally, some restrictions on international travel might need to persist until global vaccination rates increase, and those gobal vaccination rates depend on politics and cooperation between nations.Another aspect to this question is what normal really means.The pandemic hit us hard and for people whorsquove been bereaved, who have persistent symptoms or Long Covid, or whose jobs and livelihoods have been affected, normal wonrsquot ever be as it was.And as communities, there are also changes both good and bad.Will hand sanitiser provision in supermarkets continue  Will working from home always be more possible  Will high streets rejuvenate  There are opportunities for change here,we want to grasp them but there may also need to be time to heal and recover."},{"url":null,"title":"inveresk-street-branded-unremarkable-glazing-firm","story":"East Lothian planners refused planning permission for the new windows in the house on Wedderburn Terrace, Inveresk.Planning officers argued that the modern window frames were harmful to the character of the Inveresk conservation area.However agents for CR Smith, who were supported by the home owner in the appeal, argued that the locale of the property was ldquounremarkable.In an appeal statement to East Lothian Councilrsquos local review body, they said: ldquoWhilst the Inveresk Conservation Area in its entirety is undoubtedly worthy of its conservation area status, this stretch of Wedderburn Terrace is comparably unremarkable, without any buildings or vistas that would warrant protection in their own right.Inveresk is a conservation areaThe appeal came after planners refused retrospective permission for the windows and doors of the property to be replaced using PVC.Agents argued that the new material was not only more energy efficient than the original timber frames but offered more security given ldquoa number of house burglaries in the area.They pointed to other properties on the street which had similar window frames, producing a montage of images of other homes in the area to back them up.And they said of the house itself: ldquoIt is a reasonable attempt by a homeowner to improve the energy efficiency and security of his modest and unremarkable home.At the local review body meeting, Councillor Norman Hampshire, chairing, agreed that the new windows on the house, which dates back to the s, did not have an impact on the conservation area.He said: ldquoIf it had been a listed building, I would be minded to go with the officers however, on this building I do not think its impact on the conservation area will be signicant.His view was backed by fellow body members Councillor Jeremy Findlay and Councillor Kenny McLeod, who agreed unanimously to uphold the CR Smith appeal and allow the windows to remain."},{"url":null,"title":"north-berwick-become-mini-blackpool-claim","story":"Stirling Stewart, owner of The Rocketeerin North Berwick, has applied for a series of occasional licences to allow him to serve alcohol at an outside seating area from the end of this month.However, the move has brought more than a dozen complaints from local residents after his proposal suggested using Anchor Green, which borders the restaurant.

Ever since Scotland emerged at the end of what scholars no longer call ldquothe Dark Ages, it has been a multilingual nation. A time-traveller visiting what is now Scotland around the year  would encounter speakers of Old Northumbrian in the south-east, of Celtic ieties across large swathes of the country, and of Old Norse , the language of the Vikings, in the far north and dotted around the coast and islands. Shetland and Orkney, in particular, were settled by many Norse speakers, as recorded in the Old Icelandic Orkneyinga saga, the earliest manuscript-witness of which survives from the th century. Native speakers of Orkney Norn were still to be encountered in the late eighteenth century, and present-day Orkney Scots retains many Norn-derived forms. One such word is souk.According to the Dictionaries of the Scots Language , souk sook has several meanings, many of them derived from the Old English verb s#can ldquosuck a sook is an evocative Scots word for a toady, for instance. However, the word found in Orkney and Shetland seems to have a distinct etymology, being traced to the Old Norse noun suacutegr ldquodrying wind. There are specialised usages that seem to have survived for a long time. The antiquarian and geologist Samuel Hibbert, in his Description of the Shetland Isles , referred to a ldquosemi-putrescent local delicacy, viz. ldquosouked fish, which seems ndash according to a s citation ndash to have developed special properties: ldquoSookit skate .

I had been tipped off that an unscheduled and very encouraging announcement from the First Minister on the easing of Scottish lockdown restrictions was imminent.The tip-off was that, due to the continued success of the vaccine roll-out and the signicant reduction in the prevalence of coronavirus, and, letrsquos not kid ourselves on here, the joyful scenes of mobbed English beer gardens which had turned many a Scot putrid green with envy ndash and possibly also the fact that one million postal ballot papers will be dropping through letter boxes ndash the lting of Covid travel restrictions would now be accelerated. It would be brought forward by  days and the easing, a major policy reversal, would also include the licence trade, live music and the night-time economy.Unethical, impractical, and unnecessary: we donrsquot need passports for clubsI shouldnrsquot have bothered! It was again all too good to be true. As has become the depressing norm throughout this pandemic, once the Big Brother ldquonewspeak of the First Ministers briefing had been fully digested, it became very clear that there was to be no light at the end of this business-destroying tunnel, certainly not this side of the summer or possibly even autumn.I had perked up when the First Minister said that she knows \"many people that want to see venues, like, nightclubs, open again\" and that she was more optimistic and hopeful that all of that would be possible over the summer period. I wanted to believe this was true, share her optimism, but the cold and brutal reality was that this hollow announcement had changed nothing. There would be no ldquoFreedom Friday\" for any of these struggling sectors today, tomorrow, or for months to come,at all.And, with my hopes again cynically and cruelly crushed by a government to which I had once given my full support, believing in my naivety that they actually cared about Scotlandrsquos live music and night time economies, I trundled home feeling as let down and deflated as my worn tyres.I wasnrsquot alone. A spokesman for the NTIA, which represents nightclubs and entertainment venues, was equally disappointed at the vague talk of loosening restrictions sometime in the future and said, ldquountil there is a complete end to all legal restrictions on capacity, activity and operating hours, our sector simply cannot trade viably.They say the devil is in the detail. Well, I wish that were true, because there really has been no detail given, only the contentious and iniquitous reality that for non-scientic reasons known only to Scotlandrsquos all-powerful Covid eliminator Professor Jason Leitch , this multi-billion pound sector, a colossal contributor to Scotlandrsquos GDP and a major employer, as well as a pivotal component of our world-renowned live music industry, has not been deemed important enough to be granted the lowly status of Level  in the governmentrsquos strategic reopening framework.That is a shocking state of affairs and the FM and Scottish Government, and their hectoring gaggle of dictatorial mask-wearing and social-distancing health experts should all hang their heads in collective shame. As should Finance Secretary Kate Forbes over her stubborn refusal to authorise the release of Covid funding, part of the pound million already received from the UK under the Barnett consequentials and promised by ious ministers. It is emergency funding that is desperately needed for venues, promoters, festivals and labels, who because of these ongoing restrictions are unable to open, book or trade and are in dire threat of going under ndash monies, I should add, that have been paid out in England and Wales.Stop talking about the referendum or it will be another R word we face: redundanciesFreedom Friday  There is nothing free about it, especially when you might have to pay a lawyer!Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Last weekrsquos polling had them at anything from seven to nine points behind the Conservative government, which by any measure is unimpressive against a mid-term government which has already locked the Labour Party out of power for  years.In normal times, with numbers like these, some might question whether Sir Keir is up to the job. Indeed, some are. But these are not normal times. Polling has proven to be exceptionally fluid. It was not altogether long ago that Sir Keir entered his sixth month of beating Prime Minister Boris Johnson in head-to-head polling .From Labourrsquos perspective, Sir Keir is in the eye of the vaccine storm. For every journalist, commentator, citizen lamenting the UK governmentrsquos handling of the Covid pandemic in its early stages, there is now one lavishing praise on its world-leading vaccine rollout.Boris bet the house on the vaccine, and won.It is an inevitability of human behaviour that the public will be, to a degree, beholden to the leader who oversees a route out of the most calamitous event of their lives all the more so when they see near neighbours across the English Channel moving in the opposite direction.For Sir Keir, however, all is far from lost. Were there an idiom for Labour, it would be ldquowhere there is time, there is hope. And there is time.Sir Keirrsquos ultimate electoral test may not come for three-and-a-half years, during which much can change. By then, we assume, the acute pandemic will be over and Covid, as Professor Chris Whitty, the Chief Medical Officer, has indicated, will be treated much like the annual influenza.Furthermore, we will be locked into what will inevitably be a hugely painful recovery. Unemployment will be higher. Taxes too, probably. Interest rates, perhaps. In other words, our Potemkin economy will have lost its facade.And there is little doubt, at least in my mind, that Sir Keir is the right person to take advantage of that political and economic environment when it emerges. His move to Downing Street is far from locked-in writing off Mr Johnson is a foolrsquos errand, and he is at least as deserving of the Comeback Kid moniker as its more famous owner, President Bill Clinton.However, it seems to me that those in the Labour Party who doubt it made the right choice seem to believe they live in a country inhabited by a mythical population of committed socialists. They donrsquot.It is unclear what more empirical evidence is required to make them understand this. Tony Blair won three elections for the first time in the partyrsquos history, because of centrist politics and economics, before the party gradually deteriorated over the following  years as it steadily moved further and further to the left. A centrist resurgence in the form of Sir Keir immediately flipped the polls. Some things in politics are simple. This is one of them.In Labour land, Sir Keirrsquos job is not the only one occupied by the right person. Enter Anas Sarwar, the star-so-far of the Holyrood election campaign, having clearly won the first leadersrsquo debate, and emerged from the second with at least a score draw.Much like Sir Keir, Mr Sarwar is a man with time on his hands. The worst possible thing he could have done, having replaced his predecessor so soon before an election, would have been to over-promise before inevitably under-delivering.He has assiduously avoided taking that well-trodden path, so much so that he appears to have already started telling his - story, ready for a tilt at Bute House in five years time.That is by no means a fancul prospect. For the Labour Party sits on electoral gold, which can be cashed inand when the second independence referendum is called, and can accumulate value after it is over.We are currently locked in constitutional polarisation, with the two poles occupied by the SNP and the Tories. This will change, particularlythe SNP wins a majority next month. The denial of a democratic request, for a second referendum, will see the Tories become as isolated as they were in the s Labour will surely avoid falling into that hole alongside them, and will endorse a referendum.At that point, Mr Sarwar will be in a position to grasp the leadership of the pro-UK lobby, with he and Sir Keir advocating the sort of enhanced devolutionary agenda which historic polling has always shown to be the likeliest vote winner.A third way on the constitutional question, sensible economic policy, a partnership with an equally sensible Labour leader in London. In a post-referendum environment, those are enviable attributes, and could see Mr Sarwar with a realistic prospect of being First Minister in , by which time the SNP will have been in power for almost two decades.And whilst Scottish Labour has a distance to travel in terms of voting intention, it has much less far to go in terms of voter trust. This monthrsquos Ipsos MORI polling for STV showed Labour, again, recording very solid figures on whether the people trust them to run public services and the economy, and to stand up for Scotlandrsquos interests. They remain well behind the SNP, as we might expect, but on each of these measures they are ahead of the Tories, despite trailing them in voting intention.In other words, people are ready to, and want to, vote Labour again, when they see sensible, relatable leadership , and when they see a credible position on the constitution .Not so long ago, many commentators, me included, wondered out loud whether Labour was dead, north and south of the border. We were wrong. They are not. The rose is still wilted, but this is Labourrsquos spring.Be patient, I say.

He told us otherwise only days before: ldquoThe best thing of all is to vaccinate our population, get everybody out getting the jab, thats the key thing and thats what I would advocate, number one.So his bombshell statement calling into question the efficacy of mass vaccination is a rapid turnaround, a slap in the face for millions who trusted his advice, and perhaps the most outrageous example yet of how this man constantly shts the goalposts.:I treasure Line of Duty because it exercises your brainJohnson and his omnipotent, unaccountable Star Chamber of SAGE advisors evangelised vaccination to us as the silver bullet that would hand us the keys to freedom and normal le. Indeed, Johnson appeared so convinced of the critical importance of vaccines that he threatened those who would not, or could not, be vaccinated with coercion, in the form of mandatory vaccine passports.So why has Johnson cooled on vaccination now  We know that he bores easily, has only superficial mastery of his brief, and switches ground when presented with irritating detail that contradicts his ldquobig picture statements. Could the reason be the problems that are now emerging with Covid vaccines A growing number of countries have paused, restricted, or in the case of Denmark halted, the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine. The European Medicines Agency has agreed that blood clots should be listed as a very rare side effect of it. A UK trial of this vaccine on children has been halted as a precaution.Johnson and Johnson delayed the rollout of its vaccine in Europe after US health agencies called for a pause there while they investigate blood clot incidents. Also in the US, the National Institutes of Health is investigating why some people have had allergic reactions, including severe anaphylactic shock, after receiving the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.By the th of March, the UK had recorded, under the government Yellow Card scheme, a not insignicant number of suspected adverse reactions to Covid vaccines reported by members of the public or health professionals: , for the Pfizer vaccine, and , for the AstraZeneca one. Many of these adverse reactions were trivial. Others were not. They included cases where the person died shortly after vaccination:  and  reports for the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines respectively.Meanwhile, Covid virus fatality statistics have been collated on an entirely dferent basis. Any death within  days of a positive Covid test has been recorded as a Covid fatality, eventhe person in question died in a road accident, or had a heart attack.And now, guess what  Another U-turn. The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics reveal that % of registered coronavirus deaths are people who have died ldquowith the virus rather than ldquofrom it. In other words, although they tested positive for Covid, that was not the primary cause of their death.So it appears that UK Covid death statistics have been inflated either by accident, or by intention. We may yet see these latest mortality figures revised downwards as government death recording guidance is scrutinised further. As it stands, a truer tally appears to be around , deaths, not the oft-quoted ,.Observe how supposedly reliable ldquofacts and figures underpinning Johnsonrsquos Covid narrative donrsquot add up. But the efficacy of lockdown, his currently preferred strategy, is surely incontrovertible Not according to Simon Wood, a professor of statistics at the University of Edinburgh. He has run the figures for the last three lockdowns. They show that fatal Covid infections were falling before each lockdown was imposed. Sweden also saw its daily infection rate starting to decline only a day or two after the UK, he points out, even though that country didnrsquot lock down. Indeed, the pattern of deaths in Sweden is strikingly similar to that in the UK. The dference is that Swedenrsquos economy isnrsquot wrecked as ours is. Professor Tim Spector, creator of the Zoe Covid app, also agrees that lockdown is not the main reason for plummeting cases.Farmers and food-lovers will pay the price of ill-advised rush to fake meatStringent lockdowns do not reduce casualties, as Perursquos quasi-military lockdown yet high Covid death rate shows. And as you read this, millions of Americans in the states of Florida, Texas, Georgia, South Dakota, South Carolina and Mississippi, are going about their daily business, hugging their loved ones, enjoying a baseball game, socialising in crowds, mainly unmasked. These states have no lockdown restrictions, yet their Covid numbers have dropped dramatically.Professor Wood asks: \"If lockdowns were not essential to turning the tides of the epidemic, the question remains whether they were worth the collateral damage. The answer is no. Of the non-pharmaceutical tools we have to fight respiratory viruses, lockdowns are blunt, and of questionable utility. Yet in the hands of tinpot despots like Boris Johnson, and Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel, who jump to the ldquoGreat Reset tune of their corporate masters at the World Economic Forum, they become frighteningly destructive weapons to oppress us.

In my day, you were more likely to see a replica semmit, in that it precisely resembled your darsquos vest. Footwear is generally more sophisticated, too. The fives of the s were the sole preserve of the gutty or the ten-bob slider as these unsponsored trainers were known.The body shape of the players is familiar to those who played in a bygone age. There are basically two types: the fit and the fat. Intriguingly, the better players usually fall into the latter category.The fit career around with a scant observance of any tactical discipline and only a fleeting relevance to where the ball is. The fat play judiciously and efficiently, only deigning to run for three pacesit is deemed absolutely necessary, as in to convert a definite scoring chance or the hall being on fire. The latter occurrence would be carefully gauged, of course, before any intemperate and undignied jogging.The central point about fives, of course, is the violence. It is more refined now but it still exists. In my day, it was as physical as wolverines playing rugby.

Seriously, Ms Sturgeon was making a pertinent point. Which is that a staged fight over who is the most avid for independence might momentarily amuse the zealous, as they formed a ring, chanting ldquofight, fight, fight.She noted, however, that it would do nothing to impress those who remain unpersuaded by the merits of independence in the first place. They might simply turn away, faintly nauseated.Which is why the leitmot of Ms Sturgeonrsquos launch was continuity. As it has been for the entire campaign thus far.That seems to me particularly apt this week. Today brings the funeral service for the Duke of Edinburgh. The arrangements are, inevitably and rightly, suppressed by Covid.But, still, the gathering at Windsor offers a visible reminder of the core constitutional continuity presented by the Royal Family, alongside the collective desire to give thanks for a le of long and devoted service.Events occasionally conspire, Oprah Winfrey et al, to make many of us contemplate the Royal Family asthey were stars in a soap opera, a source of innocent merriment or exaggerated empathy.They are, of course, much more. They are ldquothe firm. They are the much-altered but still salient Royal prerogative. They are the palpable core of the United Kingdom.When party leaders at Holyrood paid tribute this week, it was left to Patrick Harvie of the Greens to note, en passant, that support for the institution of Monarchy was not universal in Scotland. However, he subsumed this Republican thought beneath personal sympathy for the Queen and her family.:Coronavirus: From Indias double mutant to vaccine hesitancy and the supply slowdownNicola Sturgeon sounded a genuine, personal note as she evinced admiration for the wit and intellect of the Duke, whom she met frequently at Balmoral and where. They shared, she disclosed, an intense interest in books.But her general theme was, again, one of continuity. The Dukersquos role as a constant companion to the Queen, the cherry trees they planted in the grounds of Canongate Kirk, which she hoped would thrive and bloom for many years.Of all the sundry institutions which comprise the UK State, it has long struck me that the Palace gets devolution best. Perhaps alongside the Foreign and Commonwealth Office which, as one mandarin once told me with a wry grin, is well used to dealing with troublesome colonies.The Palace appreciates the need to work with the UKrsquos devolved apparatus. For example, the Sovereign regularly travels to her palace of Holyroodhouse to welcome new First Ministers from over the road, rather than obliging them to sojourn to London.While representing continuity, the Palace is adaptable. Within limits, it moves with the times, often cajoled down the decades by the Duke of Edinburgh. The Queenrsquos own speeches to the Scottish Parliament constantly endorse devolved governance.However, the Queen has also been known, very occasionally, to express disquiet at potential constitutional change.In , as Scottish devolution was under active discourse, the Sovereign said she could readily understand such aspirations but could not forget that she was ldquocrowned Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.More recently, in , days before the independence referendum, the Queen was also in contemplative mood, perhaps prompted by advisers. Asked about the ballot by a by-stander outside Crathie Kirk, she said that she hoped people would think very carefully about the future.Nicola Sturgeon thoroughly understands this nuanced approach by the wary Palace to the malleable UK constitution.She studiously avoids placing any question marks against the Regal Union of . She is not about to pick a fight, arm wrestling or otherwise, with the Monarchy.However, she does maintain a standing challenge to the Parliamentary Union of . She does want, in the word of the moment, to affect transformational change there.Yet she also understands that, right now, the people of Scotland remain deeply, deeply apprehensive and unsure about their future.:Kevin McKenna: Recover from the virus and a referendum  We can do bothThey contemplate the pandemic, this hideous plague, and they fret. They also cast their minds back to the banking crisis of , from which we have yet to recover. They consider too the disruption of Brexit, which may or may not resolve itself.Folk need reassurance. Which is precisely what Nicola Sturgeon was attempting to offer this week, most notably with regard to indyref but also in her policies on income tax.Ms Sturgeon declared that tackling Covid must come first, with indyref on hold until the middle of the new Parliament. She opts for popular pragmatism. She calculates that there is little to be gained from evoking the spirit of William Wallace, or even Robert the Bruce.Once more, it is easy to understand why this might exasperate the most eager adherents of the independence cause. Incidentally, it also irks the Conservatives who yearn for constitutional wrestling arms, feet, whatever.This week, also, there was some passing interest in a poll which suggested that fewer than one in five of the Scottish population ranked independence as among the most important issues at this election.That did not surprise me. Constitutional questions, even independence, are generally second order matters, unless a population is actively experiencing oppression, either physical or spiritual.By ldquosecond order, I do not remotely intend to say that such matters are unimportant. Merely that they are dferent, that they are regarded by the people as conduits towards the issues which dominate their thoughts, such as employment, health and security.That is the error the Tories previously made when they used to say that devolution was never raised on the doorsteps. They needed to ask a second question: how best might you address the concerns you have raised Nicola Sturgeon gets that distinction. She understands the yearning for stability in a time of turmoil. That is why her offer, for the most enthusiastic fans of independence, is Paradise Deferred.Our columns are s for writers to express their opinions.They do not necessarily represent the views of The Herald"},{"url":null,"title":"zero-waste-scotland-reminds-scots-recycle-old-batteries","story":"A survey carried out on behalf of Zero Waste Scotland revealed that % of people who responded admitted they disposed of batteries in the general household bin.Batteries contain valuable materials so binning them when they run out wastes resources that can be reclaimed and reused in other products.

The majority of children were deficient in basic, parental care..It was agreed that a new system of ldquoneeds not deeds was required whereall but the most serious cases would be taken out of the courts and handled by a  of highly trained, volunteers.This is an enduring system of  yearsThe first childrenrsquos hearings took place  years ago this week on April   and while the system has evolved and changed over the decades and poverty and the complexity of cases has increased, the ethos remains the same - the protection of the child.:Nicola Sturgeon accused of record of shame over child povertyLord Kilbrandondied at his home near Oban, aged  in . As well as overseeing the legal reform for the treatment of young offenders, he was also author of the report which proposed a Scottish Assembly.Today, offences make up a small proportion of the cases that are heard in local authority offices.

Why does Mr Jackson believe it has not been replicated south of the border ldquoI was a  member in the late s and I remember that on two or three occasions, someone from Whitehall would attend a hearing to look at the system.ldquoEngland is a huge slumbering giant of a country and I donrsquot knowit was too complex in terms of changing it.\"They moved to a model of family courts, so they have adopted some elements of the system. \"I think the principle of keeping children out of court is hugely important and they have gone some way through family mediation and family mediation court models etc. I sense that from their perspective they have gone as far as they could but they have just announced a care review in England so who knows - they may revisit it.The national convenor said the pandemic had taken a huge toll on the hearings system. Local authorities were tasked with prioritising the most serious cases and he believes it may take until January  to deal with the huge backlog of cases.ldquoCovid has impacted enormously on the system, said the CEO.ldquoWe had to flick the system completely from face-to-face to online.ldquoWe managed to do that successfully and the government brought in emergency legislation, which allowed our colleagues at SCRA  to make powers such as extending legal orders, which was really helpful to protect those children who were most vulnerable.ldquoAs each element of the restrictions kicked in we had to respond pretty quickly. Face-to-face hearings were only held in exceptional circumstances but the wearing of masks changes the dynamic.ldquoCertainly itrsquos been a bit of a challenge.\"The combination of  members, reporters, social workers have all done extremely well in really, really dficult circumstances.Added to the backlog of cases, the child protection sector is expected to experience a surge in referrals in the coming months.

by the success of the vaccination programme itself.Cases and deaths are a fraction of what they were back in January, which can send a misleading signal that the crisis is \"over\".Complacency is a danger.As the Herald highlighted, weekly hospital admissions for Covid have nearly doubled recently among under-s, with more under-s than over-s hospitalised at the beginning of April.Beer garden are expected to open from Monday April Over the next seven weeks, up to early June, we should see ious restrictions ease: travel limits between areas have already been scrapped, and in just over a week gyms, shops, beauty salons, spas, beer gardens and restaurants should reopen -

meaning that they will experience equivalent shortfallsIt would be safer, she said, to maintain restrictions at April or May levels for longer while delaying the full reopening of the economy planned for England on June until August instead, when all adults will have had at least one dose.Doing so would \"prevent much of the summer surge\" of -, Covid deaths predicted by Sage, added Prof Pagel.A third cloud could be iants.While numbers remain extremely low in Scotland , England is seeing an increase.\" alt\"HeraldScotland: The South African iant responds less well to vaccines \" class\"editor-image\"The South African iant responds less well to vaccines Cases of the South Africaniant have gone from  in early February to  now, despite efforts to contain it through sequencing and self-isolation.Clinical trials suggest the AstraZeneca vaccine is only about % effective at preventing mild to moderate infections from the South African iant, which has also shown evidence of being able to escape the Pfizer vaccine.On the upside, scientists believe it can spread less easily than the UKs own Kent iant and that vaccines should still guard against more severe disease.Another iant to watch, however, is Indias new \"double mutant\" strain- so-called because it has two potentially worrying changes in the spike protein which have not been found together in any other type -

the mercat cross in Culross is a tourist attraction, known to Outlander fans around the world for its starring role at the heart of the fictional village of Cranesmuir.But now the historic credentials of one of Scotlandrsquos most unusual mercat crosses is coming under intense modern scrutiny amid suspicions that all may not be as it seems.Indeed, itrsquos thought that Dunbarrsquos -year-old medieval mercat cross, lsquorediscoveredrsquo early last century as townrsquos fathers frantically sought to restore and revive parts of the townrsquos built heritage, may be something of an imposter.And rather than incorporating historic elements of the real medieval mercat cross, itrsquos now thought to have been patched together in  from a stone pillar which was once part of an old coaching inn, gargoyles from a religious building and a now missing modern cement thistle.A D photographic and digital survey of the cross has recently been carried out by specialist conservation architects in the hope of gaining greater understanding of the monument prior to any future conservation or possible enhancement.Mercat crosses were erected in cities, towns and villages which had been granted the right by the monarch, a bishop or a baron to hold a regular market.As well as being a gathering place for traders, they were often accompanied by a tron or beam used for weighing goods, and a custom house.Their location at the heart of a community meant they were a focal point for proclamations of national and local importance, where criminals would be punished and where able-bodied men mustered for wapinschaws, regular reviews to ensure the weapons they carried matched their rank and were adequate to protect the town from invaders.Dunbar was given burgh status by David II King of Scots in , when trade in items such as wool and hides was taking place through Berwick on Tweed and Roxburgh.Because the towns were in the hands of the English, customs duties were not being paid to the Scottish royal exchequer. And to counteract the problem, the charter granted to George, Earl of March and his heirs the right to create Dunbar a lsquofreersquo burgh, with burgesses given the right to trade and the establishment of a market cross in the town.The first mercat cross would probably have consisted of a simple wooden pillar on a stone base and would later have been replaced by a more permanent stone structure, said Herbert Coutts, chair of a working group made up of Dunbar Community Council, Dunbar Trades Association, local branch of Rotary and Dunbar and District History Society which is behind the new research into the cross.ldquoFor almost four centuries it was the focus of the trade in goods in the burgh, he added.But by the th century towns across Scotland ndash including Dunbar ndash were in the grip of modernisation. Itrsquos thought the mercat cross was seen as a nuisance which obstructed traffic through the high street and was dismantled.That might have been the end of the cross saga. However, the early th century saw a new movement emerged that was more appreciative of historical and architectural heritage.A drive to preserve buildings and structures for future generations placed pressure on local authorities to act as s of their local heritage.Mr Coutts suspects a  letter to the Burgh Council from HM Office of Works in Parliament Square in Edinburgh calling for modern additions to the late th century Town House ndash originally Dunbarrsquos tolbooth and gaol - to be removed, sparked a search for parts of the missing mercat cross.As luck had it, a stone pillar was suddenly found in the garden of one of the townrsquos banks and quickly declared to be the missing mercat cross shaft.It was lowered into place outside the Town Hall in  by local builder George Cunningham, complete with gargoyles finial ndash an unusual addition, as most mercat crosses featured either baronial emblems, a lion or a unicorn - and a modern cement thistle perched on top.However, while the council enjoyed the plaudits for its \"enlightened spirit\" and having ldquorediscovered the long forgotten cross documents emerged which suggested the original cross had really been used in the mid-th century to construct a new well for the town.Claims swirled that the towns reborn cross was a ldquopseudo mercat cross, with no original elements, and its gargoyle features probably retrieved from a medieval hospital or church.Now fresh investigations are being carried out in the hope of unravelling the truth behind the cross, as part of anniversary celebrations to mark the th anniversary of Dunbarrsquos burgh status.It has led to a theory that the stone pillar probably came from the townrsquos th century Black Bull coaching inn, known for generations as ldquothe Pillars, a reference to the ldquowell-marked entrance to the stables and outbuildings of the property.Mr Coutts said: ldquoThere was a need among the magistrates to tidy up the tolbooth in the early th century. Someone might have said that the town didnrsquot have a mercat cross yet it was a royal burgh.ldquoThey decided they should have a restored mercat cross.

He was synonymous with the ferry and never seen without his Skye Ferry jumper.ldquoThis season will be bitter-sweet, the ferry is his legacy.Indeed, without his determination, the little car ferry may well have ceased to operate two decades years ago, a move which would have surely dealt a fatal blow to the small Glenelg community.More so, he pioneered a new era of Highland tourism. Having taken over the crumbling Glenelg Inn in , he transformed it from a fire-ravaged Victorian wreck that had been derelict for four decades, introduced stylish rooms, an upscale restaurant, a superb collection of beer and whisky, and the first coffee machine in the Highlands.At a time when touring the remote parts of the west coast could be a culture shock for travellers used to modern comforts, he helped inspire a new style of sophisticated yet authentic Highland welcome.According to Jo, saving the ferry did not just save a -year-old ferry crossing which gained fame when mentioned in James Boswells famous  travelogue, The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides, but it helped to save the small community too.ldquoItrsquos hard to overstate how important the ferry is to this tiny village on the edge of the west Highlands, she says. ldquoTherersquos a mountain path from the main road to Glenelg, itrsquos one way in and one way out, andthe ferry isnrsquot there, then people would not bother to come.ldquoThat little corner of the village is dead when the ferry is not on. But when it is, it utterly changes the place.:Skye, Argyll hotels reopening next monthldquoIn a normal season, the ferry handles , passengers and , cars. It is pivotal in terms of supporting the Glenelg Inn, the pub, the shop...For centuries little ferries criss-crossed narrow stretches of water that separated west coast communities, providing lelines between the mainland.The Ballachulish Ferry Company was established in the s to cater for rising demand from vehicle owners. But as more bridges were built, the MV Glenchulishrsquos route changed several times.By  she was working the -yard crossing from Glenelg on the mainland to Kylerhea, the shortest sea crossing to Skye.However, the opening of the Skye Bridge in  transformed travel to the island. The decision to abolish the Skye Bridge tolls in  was the signal for the Glenelg ferryrsquos private owner, Roddy MacLeod, to retire, and daily crossings from Easter to October appeared to be at an end.ldquoLike any village, people had dferent opinions, says Jo. ldquoOne group thought we had to save this unique service, others thought there was no point because of the bridge.ldquoChris said we have to keep it going. He was visionary in many ways, he felt this would absolutely work.ldquoHe had experience of getting people to come here he had created a Highland idyll in his premises, he knew people will comeyou give them something unique and worth coming for.Convinced there was a market for unique and unusual experiences waiting to be tapped, locals launched the Isle of Skye Ferry Community Interest Company and applied for National Lottery and Highlands and Islands Enterprise funding.ldquoA massive amount of work needed to be done to the ferry, adds Jo, ldquobut Chris could see beyond that and money was raised to make sure she was restored.Passenger numbers were slow but the community held its nerve and launched a marketing drive that would do VisitScotland proud.ldquoThey knew they had to market it, because you could drive to the Isle of Skye and it would not cost a penny, she adds. ldquoYou could go over the sea to Skye from Mallaig on a big CalMac ferry. Why would people bother to go all the way down this hill to come here ldquoWe had to show people that what we have to offer is something they canrsquot get anywhere .The experience of travelling on the last ferry of its kind wasnrsquot enough. So, the community set about highlighting the satisfaction that came with keeping centuries of tradition alive, the chance to follow in generations of footsteps and the breath-taking scenery.ldquoYou could drop your camera on the slipway and still take a brilliant photo, itrsquos so utterly beautul here, adds Jo. ldquoYou can see sea eagles pretty much every day, otters, a billion seals and all sorts of bird le, dolphins, porpoises, we even see basking whales.ldquoWe also see a lot of ferry nerds here who know their stuff.

Colon cancer took its toll, and he died, aged , in January.His children, daughter Poppy, and son Joss, faced with saying their goodbyes in an era of covid restrictions launched a JustGiving memorial page to raise some money in their fatherrsquos memory which could go towards supporting his beloved ferry.In a few months, the figure has so far ballooned to pound,, with messages from people around the world recalling meeting their father and how touched they were for his love for Glenelg and the ferry.While in Glenelg, the community has agreed that the recently built shore station should carry the name of its most fervent supporter.ldquoIt feels strange, says Poppy. ldquoMy father was a big part of a lot of peoplersquos lives. When I say Irsquom from Glenelg, people seem to know of it and know my dad.ldquoHe thought Glenelg was magical, and that we needed to bring people here so they could fall in love with it too.ldquoAnd he thought the ferry was quite special, she was Scottish built and the last of her kind.ldquoHe was absolutely passionate about the ferry.

We forget that before this, in the s, the country was torn apart by a bitter factional civil war which itself brewed over from an even earlier conflict, that against the Soviet occupation in the s.Should anyone have forgotten during these past  years why America went to Afghanistan in the first place, it invaded in  to oust the Taliban, who were providing sanctuary for Osama bin Laden and other al-Qaeda figures linked to the   attacks.Bin Laden has been dead for a decade now and while al-Qaeda still has pockets in Afghanistan, and still co-operates with the Taliban ndash despite Taliban assurances to the contrary ndash the US intelligence community believes the group is no longer able to pose a credible threat to the US homeland.Now, exactly  years to the day after those attacks on the US that triggered the ldquowar on terror and the invasion and occupation that has cost an eyewatering trillions of dollars, America will remove its ldquoboots on the ground leaving Afghanistan and its people to an uncertain fate.ldquoThree hours and they could be right here in Kabul, in fact many are already operating in covert groups in the city as you know, David, one Afghan friend reminded me of the Talibanrsquos omnipresence around the capital when I was last there just before the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.Since then, the insurgents have stepped up their deliberate targeting of local journalists, particularly women, as well as rights activists and civil society leaders. More than , civilians were killed or wounded in attacks during the first three months of , up  per cent from the same period last year, according to the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan .The violence runs in tandem with negotiations between the Afghan government and the Taliban, heightening concerns about preserving freedom of expression and womenrsquos rights in any peace settlement.Fears of the peopleTIME and again Afghans told me of their fears over an American pullout and of concerns that the countryrsquos security forces might well collapse without the support of the US-led coalition that at times has comprised up to  countries including the UK, France, Germany, and Australia.So, with the departure of US troops imminent, what now does the future hold for Afghanistan and its people  The first thing to say in answering this question is that itrsquos important to recognise why America chose now to leave.Ending a ldquoforever war for the US is only part of the story and clearly the Biden administration is convinced that its unconditional troop withdrawal might ramp up the pressure on both the Taliban and Afghan government to reach a peace deal.Both sides, for a long time now, have used the US presence as leverage. The insurgents through escalating violence while the Afghan government under president Ashraf Ghani has done so by putting himself at the front of the long established and often corrupt political gravy train. The president, too, failed to build the kind of relationship or ties with Washington that might have allowed a long-term, stabilising US troop presence.Hardly surprising, then, that few ordinary Afghans have much trust in Ghani who has consistently dragged his feet on any power-sharing or peace deal.While Ghani supposedly ldquowon the disputed September  elections with .% of the ballots, this has hardly legitimised his presidency. Many Afghans remain disillusioned by the electoral process because of direct political manipulation, corruption, or outright threats. Only . million among Afghanistanrsquos . million registered voters bothered to turn up. This is not even counting another five to six million Afghans of eligible voting age who never registered.Ghanirsquos nationwide mandate is questionable, as are his efforts to engage in any serious dialogue with either his immediate political opponents or the Taliban in trying to bring about peace and stability. As Foreign Policy magazine columnist Elise Labott summed it up last week: ldquoAfghans are coming to realise that Ghani can neither wage war nor make peace.Warlords embracedFURTHER undermining his credibility, Ghani has also embraced warlords he once shunned, like Uzbek powerhouse Rashid Dostum, accused of war crimes. These warlords are another potential wild card as Afghanistan enters a new and perilous phase.There are just too many old faces and political parties who have had access to power in some shape or form for years and will not relinquish it now. Many of these warlords, in a country awash with weapons, have substantial numbers of armed supporters which only adds to an already combustible political and military mix.Perhaps sensing how the US withdrawal has boxed him in politically, Ghani has recently ndash and reluctantly ndash proposed the formation of an interim government as a prelude to another election. But few are holding their breath and the bottom line is that Ghani has shown little enthusiasm for any power-sharing with the Taliban or anyone  that doesnrsquot include him as president.Seen from the Talibanrsquos perspective this matters little given that the insurgents hold the trump cards diplomatically and militarily because of the US drawdown. To date, the Taliban have even refused to sit across the table from Ghani.This is turn raises the spectre of escalating violence and perhaps another all-out civil war or even a takeover by the Taliban once the Americans are gone. Therersquos no doubt the insurgents sense a ldquovictory of sorts and have every reason for believing it possible.Despite a -year US presence, the Taliban currently hold or control up to % of Afghanistan including many provincial town and cities. They are within proximity, too, of Kabul and for a long time now have had a shadowy covert presence in the city terrorising the population and forcing the Afghan security forces to turn it into a labyrinth of checkpoints, emplacements, and blast walls. Any trip to the city gives the visitor that feeling of being hemmed in, surrounded. In such an intimidating environment, most Kabulis continue to fear the worst after the Americans leave with Ghani more isolated and the Taliban piling on the pressure.ldquoItrsquos hard to imagine any scenario under which peace would break out post-September  in Afghanistan, warned Michael Kugelman, deputy director of the Asia Programme at the US-based Wilson Centre speaking last week after news of the American deadline for a pull out.ldquoThe best hope is that the peace process wonrsquot be dead, Kugelman told the Associated Press, echoing the thoughts of many Afghanistan analysts and watchers.Most though are now pessimistic about the peace process with even the US intelligence communityrsquos own prediction outlined in its annual Threat Assessment published last week concluding that current peace talks are unlikely to succeed.Asto underscore that last week the Taliban boycotted a scheduled peace conference in Turkey, again throwing the whole future of the peace process into doubt.What matters nowthe worst-case scenarios are to be avoided is to urgently reassure Afghans that the most effective way of stabilising the country is by introducing a clean slate as far as representations goes.This is the proposal suggested by Edward Girardet and Peter Jouvenal, two veteran journalists and Afghan analysts who have reported on the Afghan conflict from its earliest stages, one arriving just prior to the Soviet invasion on December , , the other shortly afterwards. Writing recently in the online reportage magazine Global Geneva, they outlined in what they described as a ldquofeeler article the way in which an independently mediated peace process could be created.Itrsquos one that bypasses ldquoself-centred politicians, power-mongering warlords and abusive insurgents as well as ldquothe undermining of outside powers with their own geopolitical agendas or, evenwell-meaning, with policies that have consistently failed.The two authors also detailed what they describe as the need for a ldquonon-factional interim administration in Afghanistan. ldquoEvennot easy, the creation of such a transitional government involving - respected and erse Afghans remains the only viable way forward.ldquoIts representatives should come from dferent parts of the country and dferent walks of le from teachers, religious leadersand entrepreneurs to lawyers, farmers and civil servants, suggest Girardet and Jouvenal.Political squabblingTHEY stress that at least one-third should consist of womento guarantee the gains of women in Afghanistan. Equally important, they say, would be to exclude any officially designated government politicians or Taliban representatives, and to avoid political squabbling. The interim administration might be appointed by a neutral outside group, highly experienced outsiders well-respected by Afghans and who know the country well, such as former NGO co-ordinators and diplomats.Itrsquos a novel idea and precisely the kind of imaginative thinking that has been missing these past years from an international engagement that has focused more on the security dimension. But escaping that insecurity and instability to make such an administration viable would remain an enormous challenge and, as the authors point out, would doubtless face hard resistance from political traditionalists like Ghani and others as well as the Taliban.Should such a peace process and new administration fail to emerge then itrsquos almost certain Afghanistan faces a potentially disastrous time ahead.Knowing my own long association with the travails of this long-suffering country itrsquos perhaps not surprising that many people ask how I think all this will ultimately play out.Sad as it is to say but without the emergence of some new peace process and interim administration initiative of the kind outlined by Girardet and Jouvenal, I believe the country most likely faces a civil war along the lines of that experienced in the mid-s.During those devastating times I was to visit Kabul often as factional fighting tore the city apart in a way even the guerrilla war against the Soviet occupation and communists had failed to do.That period in the s was among the darkest days for Afghanistan in modern times and gave birth to the Frankenstein monster that became the Taliban. When so avoidable, what a tragedy it would beAfghanistan were to go through that madness all over again."},{"url":null,"title":"independent-scotland-lead-global-efforts-nuclear-disarmament---patrick-harvie","story":"Speaking in the run up to the May  Holyrood election, he insisted the UK is \"run by a corrupt government that wants to invest in expanding its nuclear arsenal\".But by leaving the UK, Greens believe Scotland could play a leading role in international efforts to build peace and tackle the climate emergency.:Patrick Harvie raises Prince Philips extreme wealth and privilege at Holyrood tributeBoth the Greens and the SNP want to see a second vote on independence take place in the next Holyrood term -there is a majority in the Scottish Parliament for this.And Mr Harvie said: \"The Scottish Greens provided a pro-independence majority in the last parliament and we are ready to do so again.\"He insisted: \"Scotland doesnt have to sit back and accept a Brexit race to the bottom run by an increasingly right-wing Tory party.\"With the potential and talent Scotland has in innovation and renewable energy, we could be leading European efforts to tackle the climate emergency.\"And by recognising that the nuclear weapons based in Scotland are illegal, we can lead global efforts in nuclear disarmament too.\":Why no support for green nuclear power Mr Harvie said his party wanted Scotland to be a \"new, outward-looking nation with our own seat at the European table, driving change across the continent and restoring the rights of workers\".And speaking ahead of campaigning in Dundee, he told voters: \"This election is a chance to endorse that vision and vote for the Scotland you want.\""},{"url":null,"title":"snp-mps-have-no-ideas-no-desire-indy-claim-alba-members","story":"Kenny MacAskill and Neale Hanvey blasted some members of their old party and said they have spent more time ldquoplanning for COP attendance than they have for another referendum.The pair, who left the SNP last month to join Alex Salmondrsquos Alba party, said that they did so as a result of frustrations with the SNP Westminster group, their cosy relationship with the Westminster establishment, and their apparent lack of commitment to securing independence.Mr MacAskill, Alba MP for East Lothian, said: ldquoTherersquos more planning ongoing in the group, as far as I can see, for COP attendance than there is for a referendum.ldquoDiscussions began when I went to the first group meeting, raising issues such as what are we going to do to address the border, which is now the biggest issue rather than perhaps sterling. Irsquove heard nothing further, heard nothing on that.ldquoMy reason for leaving the SNP has been to do with exit strategy and independence hellip there is just very little in the Westminster group. I have friends there who will remain friends so Irsquom not going to be overly critical, I just disagree with the strategy which is why Irsquove chosen to join Alba.The former Scottish Government justice secretary also cast doubt on the partyrsquos wider plan, saying there is ldquosimply no strategy for independence.:Iain Macwhirter: Post-covid cost cutting will wreck SNP spending plans ... and possibly the unionHe said: ldquoThe time is now, the British state is at its weakest. The need has never been higher because of the challenges that we face coming out of coronavirus, the effect on the economy ... The impact that will have on those who are already suffering austerity.ldquoThere simply is no strategy. I have yet to see one in this new SNP.Mr MacAskill also rubbished the partyrsquos independence ldquotask force announced by depute leader Keith Brown in January.Former MSP Marco Biagi was appointed as its campaign strategist, with the intention of the unit to ldquofire up the Yes movement.However, Mr MacAskill said it was not all it had been presented as, adding: ldquoWithout giving away secrets of meetings, both Neale and I attended a meeting in which Marco Biagi was present about the establishment of a task force. It seems to me there is no task force for independence.\"There is one guy commissioning opinion polling. There is no strategy being conducted by the SNP leadership, and the Yes movement and huge swathes of the SNP are crying out for action.Mr Hanvey, MP for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath, was readmitted to the party after a six-month suspension, an apology and an agreement to take a re-education course.He said: ldquoI had a very challenging introduction to the party and to the wider Yes movement.ldquoI have to think about the impact of speaking out on my family. What happened to me in November was incredibly damaging to my family, and very upsetting.ldquoI was really thinking about how I choose my moment, and the Wednesday before I was announced [as an Alba candidate], that group meeting was the final straw for me.ldquoThat is the culture that exists and, andyou canrsquot ask that question without the kind of response I received, that doesnrsquot feel good. ldquoWhen we talked about tactics with Jacob Rees-Mogg, hersquos referred to as lsquoJacobrsquo. That is not what Irsquom here for, this is not what I stood for, playing the game with Jacob Rees-Mogg.The pair of MPs agreed thatthey were to be elected to Holyrood in May, having a dual mandate would be beneficial for their fight for independence, and for their constituents.They have also planned to donate the additional salary payments to causes in their constituencies such as food banks.Askedthey were surprised that more of their SNP MP colleagues had not joined them in the Alba party, Mr MacAskill said it was ldquoearly days and hinted that he was expecting others to move.He said: ldquoWersquoll see what happens.

Another, under decades of grime, is illegible until Derek Souter shines his torch on it. ldquoIt says lsquoNewrsquo, he explains. ldquoThis was a Chinese restaurant.The businessman, effectively one of three owners of this city landmark, had just rolled up a graffitied shutter, unlocked a steel security door and gingerly climbed an unlit flight of steps.ldquoItrsquos beautul, this building, he keeps repeating. But the Egyptian Halls ndash designed by Alexander ldquoGreek Thomson and first opened as a commercial base for an iron magnate  ndash are also dying.What is left of the New Palace ndash some records suggest it was also called China Palace ndash is more like archaeological dig than an abandoned eatery.Shafts of light shine through windows still painted with the Chinese characters of its name. Like laser pointers they pick out the roomrsquos architectural and design features: torn scraps of flock velvet burgundy wallpaper mirrored columns and exposed lath-and-plaster walls.At the rear, in what was once kitchens, there is a stack of the old restaurantrsquos bulbous s light fittings. They look like Greek amphorae.Amid the broken glass, the heaps of rotten, powdered plaster and the piles of timber there are abandoned tools, at least two rusted saws.But repairs never happen, not substantive ones anyway. No-one has raised the money to do them. Last week, Mr Souter was warned he would shortly be issued with a defective building notice ndash the latest in a seemingly endless series of twists and turns in the story of the Egyptian Halls.The building is historic but so too now is the bureaucratic and political saga over attempts to save it.Rescue packageTHE Halls have stood on Union Street, right opposite Central Station, Scotlandrsquos busiest, for a century-and-a-half. For the last four decades or so ndash ever since the New Palace and other tenants moved out ndash its upper storeys have been empty.Mr Souter, , and his two business partners have been trying to put together a rescue package for half that time.:Egyptian Halls fake facade unravels.He says he has been in contact with no fewer than  public officials and politicians since he first became involved around the turn of the century. He has dealt with several generations of civic leaders, planning and regeneration staffers as he aims to get public money to make redevelopment viable.The cost of that has ticked up over the years. A website run by Mr Souterrsquos development firms now puts the commercial deficit at pound million. However, the businessman declined to go into any further details, saying he believed a new, fth planning application was ldquoin the pipeline.As recently as , there was talk of demolition. The Egyptian Hallsrsquo classic facade ndash with Greek rather than Egyptian-style columns ndash has been covered with scaffolding and a protective membrane for more than a decade. Last year, Europa Nostra named it as one of the continentrsquos  most at-risk historic buildings.Various schemes have been mooted to turn the buildingrsquos upper street into a hotel and to regenerate the ground floor. But relations with local authorities have soured. Mr Souterrsquos website pins the blame for delays on the council.He has a specic gripe which stems from some of the legal complexity surrounding a compulsory purchase order of the building back in the s.Mr Souter says he was not made aware of a change in the terms of the CPO before he and his partners bought the property. The change, Mr Souter argues, gave a previous owner time to seek compensation and caused a delay to transferring the title to Mr Souterrsquos companies.Councilrsquos denialWHEN this grievance was aired in , Glasgow City Council denied ldquoallegations of misrepresentation and impropriety. A spokesman added: ldquoRather than ing to issues from the s, it may be betterthe buildingrsquos owners joinwith us in a co-operative manner to ensure the preservation and regeneration of this historic building.Mr Souterrsquos website suggests he isnow ready to reset relations with the council.ldquoThe past should not influence how we get to a solution, it declares. ldquoThere is a phenomenal potential to be realised. We need to get a balance of commercial funding and grant funding combined with projected valuation and income upltswe take a , , , -year perspective.ldquoAnd then assess this financial information with the up-to-date structural position given the Upper Floors have been vacant since , an astonishing  years ago and the efforts of the heritage stakeholders.Last year, as the Black Lives Matter protests welled in America and the UK, calls again mounted for Glasgow to have a Slavery Museum. The Egyptian Halls was mooted as a potential site for this though the building has no actual connection with trafficking or profiteering from trafficked people.That, Mr Souterrsquos website contends, might help plug the deficit. ldquoThere is now the option of the Museum of Slavery concept, which would deliver signicant tourism, cultural and educational benefits as well as probably unlocknon- commercial sources of funding, it says.:Egyptian Halls revival could cost up to poundmldquoAnd which, from Susan Aitken, Glasgow City Council leader, has found traction reiterating the councilrsquos support for either a standalone museum or a permanent exhibition dedicated to slavery and empire.lsquoNot giving uprsquoSPEAKING to The Herald on Sunday, Mr Souter struck a diplomatic but determined tone. ldquoDo I love the building  Definitely. Wersquove not spent  years trying to achieve the original objective to give up now when we believe a solution can be facilitatedeverybody lowers the temperature to pragmatic levels.Council officials, meanwhile, want to see concrete plans and meaningful action.The buildingrsquos design is very unusual and vulnerable. Its iron framehas been exposed. Signs warn visitors ndash who enter at their own risk and only in safety helmets ndash that the floors held up by the metal are now dangerous.But the Egyptian Halls are not just important on their own account. This is an anchor building on a street that many city insiders say could be one of Scotlandrsquos finest.An official spokesman for the local authority this weekend said: ldquoThe Egyptian Halls are undoubtedly an important part of both Glasgowrsquos cultural heritage and its urban fabric.ldquoCouncil officers have worked with the owners, over a number of years, to support the appropriate development of the building in order that it can be enjoyed by future generations.ldquoHowever, we have yet to see proposals that address the condition of the building and, as a result, we have informed the owner that we will be issuing a notice in the coming weeks.Souter travels from his native Dundee to the building every week, to check in with the ground-floor retail tenants. Above the shops, the only residents are pigeons in its attic floor.On the final landing of the Egyptian Halls, somebody has put two Marigold gloves on broom handles, waving to anyone who makes it in to what was once seen as a Thomson masterpiece."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"April ,  at : amA Holm woman has shared how a very special assistance dog has “completely changed” her le, by helping her with everything, from popping to the shops to making emergency calls.

The most striking feature is the patch of white at their rump. Males are slightly smaller and pale grey with black wingtips. Both have a round, owl-like face.Hen harriers are the UK#s most persecuted bird of prey relative to its population size. Their Scottish population is of global importance, yet it remains far from stable largely as a result of illegal killing by humans.The RSPB’s Jenni Burrell said: “We are calling on the public to email our Hen Harrier Hotlinethey believe they’ve seen a hen harrier. This helps us build a picture of where these birds are. Please don’t hesitate to contact usyou see them # we welcome any sightings and appreciate your time.“Hen harriers are beautul and elusive raptors and, unlike peregrines and kestrels, they are rarely seen in urban environments. Soit’s perched on your fence, it’s probably a sparrowhawk,it’s in a tree by the roadside, it’s probably a kestrel or a buzzard… butit’s over rough pasture or moorland, and matches the description above, then you might have seen a hen harrier.“Sadly hen harriers are a long way from reaching a healthy, self-sustaining population, and this is largely down to persecution by humans. Particularly where land is managed for the purpose of driven grouse shooting, natural predators like hen harriers can be viewed as pests and, despite being legally protected, the shooting, trapping and poisoning of hen harriers is a serious and ongoing problem.”If you think you’ve seen a hen harrier, you are asked to email henharriers@rspb.org.uk and to include the date, time, location grid reference and a description of the bird.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

supervised where possible ndash taken in the previous  hours.And after attending the occasion, they will be asked to conduct a PCR coronavirus swab test.Professor Iain Buchan, executive dean, Institute of Population Health, chairman of public health and clinical informatics, faculty of health and le Sciences, University of Liverpool, explained that only those who consent to taking part in the study will be able to attend.Explaining the process, he said: ldquoSo what will happen  You will see an advert for the event via some media.ldquoAt the Liverpool events we have arranged for people looking at those adverts to immediately go to the site that explains the event research programme, where they will give their consentthey wish to go further, consent will be recorded, people will be informed about what theyrsquore likely to be asked.ldquoAnd theyrsquoll start going through questionnaires online.ldquoThat will give them a token to then book a ticket and part of activating your ticket will then be getting a test within  hours before the event.ldquoPeople may receive text messages by phone as well, to say lsquohave you got any symptoms on the day of the event andso, you shouldnrsquot gorsquo.ldquoFive days after the event, those who have become part of this research study will be asked to take a swab up their nose at home, and theyrsquoll be asked the questions as well that will be triggered probably by text message.ldquoIt will y between the dferent events, but this is very much an ethically thought through careful science led programme that wersquoll be pursuing. vw,vw,px, px\"Prof Buchan said many of the events will be safer than mixing happening in other settings, as people will have been tested beforehand, and encouraged to limit their contact with others before and after.He added that local public health services will receive data very quickly on any potential outbreaks and be able to trace and contain them.The risk is the equivalent to ldquoabout one in several thousand people and based on the current background rates of infection ldquothat is likely to be quite rare, Prof Buchan explained.He continued: ldquoThe main thing we want to do is make sure that those mechanisms are in place, sorates do rise, say for example in July, that we have a very, very effective safety net, and we can decide whether or not to go ahead with particular events, y in the spacing, the choice of venues to licence more of the outdoor venues with lots of fresh air.Venues participating in the programme will test specic settings to collect evidence and best practice.The programme will explore how dferent approaches to social distancing, ventilation and test-on-entry protocols could ease opening and maximise participation in these sectors in the future.The findings will be used to provide key scientic data and research into how small and large-scale events could safely reopen in line with the road map out of lockdown ndash particularly step four which is due to commence no earlier than June .As part of the programme, Covid-status certication will also be trialled.copy -.

She said she feels ldquoignored on the issue of accessibility.She told the PA news agency: ldquoMy main problem at the moment is the increase of street furniture. It is very dficult to negotiate round it as well as keeping socially distanced from people.ldquoI wish Boris Johnson could meet some visually impaired people so we could explain how dficult it is for us at the moment. Sadly we seem to be ignored and donrsquot have a voice loud enough for people to hear our daily struggles. vw,vw,px, px\"Maureen Goodall said it is dficult for her to navigate around additional street furniture ldquoSocial distancing has become a problem because people are either not seeing my stick or just not getting out of my way, so Irsquom bumping into more people again, which is getting a little bit frustrating because for the last few months Irsquove been used to the paths all by myself.ldquoEven walking through Kingrsquos Cross yesterday I was pushed and shoved a little bit which I havenrsquot had for months. Itrsquos all a little bit daunting again.ldquoI was able to cope with it betterbecause I didnrsquot have to be aware that everybody has to be two metres apart. Now, Irsquom very conscious of that.ldquoItrsquos not just me thatrsquos struggling, Irsquove got a friend thatrsquos in an electric chair and shersquos saying the same thing.

When somebodyrsquos guiding me therersquos just not enough room for us to walk safely side-by-side. vw,vw,px, px\"Alan Benson said the easing of lockdown has to be lsquoinclusive of everybodyrsquo Alan Benson, chair of Transport for All, an organisation that aims to improve transport accessibility for disabled people, said the reopening of society must be ldquoinclusive of everybody.He said fencing off areas with tables and chairs, and making sure the pavement is wide enough for wheelchairs, could be a way of making areas more accessible.Mr Benson, , told PA: ldquoIrsquom a wheelchair user, so itrsquos something that Irsquom certainly well aware of.ldquoSoho is a particular issue because itrsquos quite inaccessible as it is, so you often get missing dropped curbs. Yoursquoll get to a corner, want to cross the road and canrsquot, so when you put all this new Covid outdoor dining street furniture all over the place, that then adds on top of whatrsquos already an inaccessible street-scape.ldquoToday is my th day of shielding, so essentially Irsquove not been out in  days, so Irsquom really looking forward to getting out and enjoying some of this opening up.ldquoItrsquos not that wersquore trying to stop people enjoying themselves, we want to get out probably even more than they do, but we do want it to be accessible, itrsquos got to be inclusive of everybody. vw,vw,px, px\"Fazilet Hadi, head of policy at Disability Rights UK, said: ldquoSince the Government relaxed rules on pavement dininghellip wheelchair users, people with mobility impairments and those with sight loss have all experienced signicant problems.ldquoIt is important that councils consult with their disabled residents before granting permission, that the boundary of the eating area is clearly defined and that there is enough space for a wheelchair user to safely pass by.Mr Benson added that ldquoconsideration of disabled people on pavements could help with accessibility.He told PA: ldquoItrsquos an issue for both wheelchair users andyoursquore blind or partially sighted, things that you use like curbs and edges of buildings to guide yourself,you put tables and chairs in the way, people walk into them.ldquoThe issue is that people just arenrsquot used to thinking about ithellip but we really need your help, your support, and your consideration.copy -.

He locked the door and deprived her of access to a key.Donald pinned her against a wall and grabbed her throat. On a number of occasions he repeatedly punched her head and body, all to her injury.Exerting control over her, he destroyed her mobile phone and her passport, repeatedly calling her abusive and degrading names, threatening her with violence. He forced entry into a locked bathroom where she was hiding, and repeatedly monitored and controlled her communications with family and friends.In  Donald became abusive to another partner.As well as regulating the communication she had with others, he also controlled the amount of money she had access to.He was abusive to her, calling her degrading names, and ly accused her of infidelity.Then, in September of that year, he repeatedly struck her body with a kne, causing injury. On rd September he repeatedly thrust a kne at her. She sustained injury after grabbing the blade in an attempt to protect herself.Last year he embarked on a similar course of conduct with a third woman.On th May, he shouted and swore at her and threatened her with violence. Grabbing her arm, he pulled her and threw a punch at her.The court also heard that, on th May, he made  phonecalls to her over a period of  minutes.Speaking on Wednesday, defence agent Tommy Allan said Donald had been contrite during meetings he had held with him prior to his remand.But he added: #It#s clear from the social enquiry report there is work still to be done with Mr Donald.#Police Scotland has welcomed the sentencing of Norman Donald who was sentenced to two years and two months imprisonment following domestic abuse offences.

Yetwe continue using coal, oil and gas at the current rate, estimates show that reserves will be gone in around  years. But this is the least of our worries. If we want to slow rising global temperatures we need to stop burning these fuels their combustion, and subsequent release of greenhouse gases, is the main driver behind global warming.In , the Scottish Government pledged to end the use of all fossil fuels by  in order to reach their zero net emissions target. And in their place  Renewables.The traditional options such as wind farms and hydro schemes have now been joined by green hydrogen. Although still in its infancy, this renewable gas is expected to be a leading source of future energy production. Naturally occurring hydrogen is obtained by passing electricity through waterthis electricity is renewably sourced the gas is labelled as ‘green’ hydrogen, as opposed to ‘grey’. Once extracted it can be used in existing gas pipelines to heat and power homes, fuel vehicles and drive heavy machinery.And unlike traditional gas, when burned it produces no harmful emissions, only water.Keith Masson, climate change and energy team manager at Highland Council, said: “We’re in the process of recruiting a project manager to lead on the delivery of new hydrogen and low carbon heat strategies, to ensure that the council and the wider Highland region benefits from the energy-systems transformation that these technologies will bring.”In Highland region, plans are underway for a ‘hydrogen hub’ in the Cromarty Firth. Electricity generated from wind turbines in the area will be used to produce hydrogen gas for use in local industries.But progress towards the net zero emissions target is also happening even closer to home. In the last few months plans have been confirmed for two community hydro developments in Skye and Lochalsh.Construction of a community owned kW micro hydro development in Sleat is due to begin this month. Electricity produced will be sold to the national grid with over £, expected to be generated in the first  years. All money generated will be used to fund sustainable projects in the local community.Kenny Nicolson, project officer for Sleat Community Hydro, said: “Despite the Gàidhealtachd being a huge exporter of renewable energy, we pay the highest prices for electricity with some of the worst rates of fuel poverty in the UK. On Skye we have issues with inequality, young people unable to find secure employment and housing, and a dying language and culture.“Community-owned renewable energy projects are not just a means for reducing carbon emissions, there is a massive potential to create community wealth and address some of these underlying issues.”We as iniduals can also take steps towards installing renewable energy sources. The process may seem complicated or costly but thanks to an initiative launched by the Scottish Government, homeowners can apply for  per cent cashback, up to £,, for a renewable heating system. Small and medium sized businesses are also eligible for a similar cashback grant scheme. And the options for renewable heating systems are vast, from biomassboilers to solar  and ground source heat pumps.Iain Stewart and Shelagh Parlane have a ground source heat pump which sits just below the surface in their garden in Edinbane, extracting warmth from the ground to heat their radiators, underfloor heating and water. Shelagh said: “I would absolutely recommend it. It is certainly a very efficient system. If you were trying to heat water in a standard way I think it would be much more expensive.”Renewable heating systems can also be a source of income with the UK government’s Renewable Heat Initiative scheme. If you install, or have installed in the last year, an eligible system you could receive quarterly cash payments over seven years.Of course, no energy source is completely harmless. Whether it is birds flying into wind turbines or the destruction of fish spawning grounds with a hydro scheme, everything has a cost. Butwe want to continue using electricity, fossil fuels are not the way forward.No birds or fish will be able to survive at allwe continue to exacerbate the greenhouse gas effect by burning coal, oil and gas.Green alternatives are no longer trials for the future of energy production, they are the future."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MV-Glenachulish2.jpg","title":"glenelg ferry back in service in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine• Bittersweetafter death of founding directorFerry company directors took the decision not to operate the service for the  season in the interests of public and crew safety during the Covid pandemic.The vessel, MV Glenachulish, which normally runs from Easter to mid-October, has been tied up at the Kishorn boat yard since the autumn of .This week, general manager Jo Crawford from Glenelg said the boat was undergoing final checks and it was hoped to resume the service on Saturday st May.“It was a big miss last year, for locals and visitors alike,” said Ms Crawford.“We have put in additional measures to comply with Covid regulations including sanitising stations at both slipways and all the crew have been issued with PPE.“We have secured some grant assistance for opening up again and the ferry’s  employees will be taken out of furlough. We will have a few days of crew training and then the ferry will be back in service after a gap of a year and a half. It will be a boost for everyone.“For people in Glenelg the ferry makes a big dference. If you want to go to the supermarket in Kyle it’s a -mile round trip, compared to  miles to Broadford when the ferry’s running. It changes the experience of living in this corner of the west Highlands, particularly when there’s snow on the hill.”But Ms Crawford said there would be a poignancy when the ferry sailed again this season.Former Glenelg innkeeper Chris Main, who was a founding director of the Isle of Skye Ferry Community Interest Company, passed away in January.Ms Crawford said: “We all felt Chris’s death really keenly here. He was the ferry’s most fervent supporter and would be down most days to get the craic with the crew.”Mr Main’s children, Poppy and Joss, launched a crowdfunder on online fundraising  JustGiving in their father’s memory to raise £, to help maintain MV Glenachulish. To date almost £, has been raised for the Glenachulish Preservation Trust with donations pouring in from all over.Ms Crawford added: “We’re really grateful to them for that support. It’s wonderful. The Glenachulish is the last manually operated turntable ferry in Scotland and at  years old is always needing work done on it.”The ferry will run seven days a week, am to pm, and to pm in June, July and August."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/thumbnail_IMG_0001.jpg","title":"scottish radios voice of sport with his roots in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineAlastair Alexander of BBC Scotland was one of the names and iconic voices which dominated the Scottish airwaves for a signicant generation. What is not as well-known about Alastair though, is that he had strong family connections with Skye, which he never forgot.Alastair MacPherson Alexander, to give him his full name, was born on th November , in Parklea, Port Glasgow. He died on Sunday th March, aged .Alastair was intensely proud of his home area of the Port and wider Inverclyde but was also acutely aware of his roots in Skye. He is one of a long list of people in that area who could trace his lineage to the island and the remarkable tale of serendipity and genealogy which eventually saw him commentate on Skye Camanachd’s greatest day in  bears further examination.Alastair’s maternal grandmother Jessie MacPherson was born in Skye in . His mother, Marion Smith, was born in Skye and lived at Tarskavaig in Sleat where her father was a shepherd. Following a well-trodden path, they moved to Kilmacolm in Renfrewshire for work.And it was farming and work on the land which brought Alastair’s parents together. Walter Alexander’s family had Bogston Farm in Greenock and eventually Marion and Walter met and married. Walter was to live with sight and hearing loss and they were, understandably, huge influences –clearly demonstrated in Alastair’s subsequent voluntary work with the Rex Blind Parties, while he developed a remarkable affection for shinty through his connection with Skye.Incidentally, Marion’s father moved to Renton, won the football pools, bought the show house in Dumbuck Crescent, Dumbarton and called it Tarskavaig. It was there that Alastair’s grandmother Jessie died in  when he was seven years old. Her sister Annie MacPherson , whom Alastair Alexander visited in Skye, was known locally as ‘Annag Alasdair’ denoting her father’s identity, and was single all her le. She lived at No. Tarskavaig, and is well remembered by people in the area today.Alastair met his family circumstances head on with a resilience and fortitude, marking him out as a thoroughly decent human inidual, as well as a consummate professional in more than one area of le.He went to the Glasgow School of Art to train as an architect and pursued a career in the building industry, while maintaining his other interests – moving seamlessly in all his dferent spheres of activity.Forty years of Alastair’s le were spent commentating on more than , football matches and describing bowls, hockey at the Kelvin Hall, and athletics for BBC Scotland, as well as the shinty. He first started commentating for people with vision loss at Love Street, Paisley in .Six years later he asked the BBC for an audition and was on television the following week.It was a great privilege to share commentary duties with the great man in my own early days as a commentator, beginning in  in Oban on a blisteringly hot day. I learned a great deal from him over the next few years and he was fantastic to work with.Technology, or more accurately a digger, failed us together one famous day in  when Fort William scored a goal in less than ten seconds and went on to win the Camanachd Cup -. Few in Fort William were aware of the outcome until much later in the day —there were no mobile phones — as a digger had uprooted the cable which connected Old Anniesland to the BBC studios at Queen Margaret Drive. Alastair and I blethered away for the whole match not knowing that only a few minutes had been broadcast and Tiger Tim had filled the rest of the afternoon with records.One of Alastair’s cousins, Ann McCarron, recalled: “My brother and Alastair spent a lot of their youth together on the Skye holidays and at Gran and Grandpa Smith’s in Dumbuck Crescent. Apparently my brother Alistair had a Subbuteo football game and when they played he [Alastair] used to do the commentating, so he must have had the commentating in his blood!”Such was the family’s affection for Skye that Ann’s brother Alistair’s ashes were scattered on Skye following his death a few years ago.Tributes have been fulsome and sincere. The plaudits and anecdotes could fill Hampden. Alastair was a “gentleman and a true professional” according to Ken MacQuarrie who made the formal presentation to him on behalf of the BBC in .It was singularly appropriate that he commentated on Skye’s greatest triumph in . In that famous final Alastair described Skye’s Calum Murchison on the radio as “leaping around like a salmon”. That of course meant an awful lot more to anyone knowing the shape and size of Calum and also his family’srelationship with the local salmon fishing river in Bernisdale.Alastair was a great man and is a huge loss to our collective knowledge of our history, sport and broadcasting. Meticulous in his presentation and fastidious when it came to detail, he was a total professional. The BBC bid him farewell with the traditional microphone presentation in October  when he retired.We shall not see his like again and we know that Alastair will of course be most sorely missed by his daughters Shirley, Susan and Joyce, her husband Mark, granddaughter Alex and grandson Callum."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/POT-HOLES-KYLE-1-scaled.jpg","title":"kyle womans petition targets","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineIona MacLachlan says people are being forced to drive in the opposite carriageway in Kyle’s Main Street to avoid huge potholes and believes a bad accident is waiting to happen.Ms MacLachlan, of Heathmount, is asking people to sign her petition on the change.org online petitions , urging Highland Council to improve the roads in the busy village.The health and social care frontline worker said: “I’ve raised this petition because of an experience I had at the weekend as an L-driver.“I was driving down to the village and I was confronted with this car in the middle of the road. I nearly hit it. I understand why the car was there – the driver was trying to avoid the massive potholes all along the street. I was able to avoid the vehicle but it gave me a scare and this situation could easily result in a bad accident.”Ms MacLachlan has reported the potholes in the road to Highland Council on multiple occasions.She said: “All you get is for the potholes to be filled with gravel and with the bad weather we’ve had over the past few months that lasts only two or three days and then they’re as bad as ever. The road needs to be properly repaired.“I’ve had to replace coil springs and tyres on my car because of the state of the roads in Kyle and I’m fed up with it. I hope as many people as possible will sign the petition to send a strong message to the council.”Ms MacLachlan’s petition is on the change.org site and calls for “All B roads in Kyle of Lochalsh to be repaired”.Local Highland councillor Biz Campbell said she was aware of the petition and agreed the road was in a poor state.“I don’t blame people,” said Councillor Campbell. “The roads are horrendous. We fight for funds for roads all the time and make the case when the budget comes up, but council doesn’t have the money.”However, she said councillors in Ward  — Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh — had been allocated an extra £, for local projects and members had discussed buying a “hot box” tar machine.She explained: “Currently the potholes in this ward are filled with cold tar and it’s a complete waste of money because the tar is simply washed out and the repair doesn’t last.“This machine would allow hot tar repairs to be made to potholes and it would last longer. We have discussed it at a meeting and I think this could achieve better road repairs which would help road users at least in the short term.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3746987.jpg--.jpg?1618485362000\n","title":"martinstown post office temporary closure for modernisation work","story":"Martinstown Post Office will temporarily close for modernisation.

Worth poundm, the low emission diesel buses will be destined for the streets of Hong Kong and Japan. It marks a signicant move for the Ballymena-based business, owned by green entrepreneur Jo Bamford, which sees the orders as an opportunity to grow the profile of the Wrightbus brand as far afield as Australia. Chief Executive Buta Atwal said the news was proof that Wrightbus was leading the way in bus technology regardless of the fuel. “Whether it’s our world-first hydrogen bus, our near-zero emission diesel or our single-deck electric, the Wrightbus name stands for excellence in the bus world,” he explained. “Although we have endured a complicated year like so many manufacturers across the world, these orders will help us emerge from the pandemic with confidence.” Wrightbus, which launched the world’s first zero-emission hydrogen double decker bus in , recently announced the creation of  new jobs in preparation for increasing production of the vehicle this year to assist global net zero ambitions and support the PM’s pledge for at least , new Zero Emission Buses to be produced during this parliament.The recruitment drive will welcome new members of production and office staff, including coachbuilders, spray painters, welders, electrical engineers, technicians, accountants, sales staff and a project manager. Nineteen of the positions will be apprenticeships, giving a boost to opportunities for young people in the region. And an international project engineer role has also been created as the firm looks to increase sales around the world.Nathan Hodge, who heads the Wrightbus international ision, said there was growing global optimism. “While it hasn’t got to the tender stage yet, we are having some really good discussions in Australia about hydrogen buses,” he said. “While Australia is seen by many to be among the leaders of hydrogen technology, there is only one hydrogen bus in the country so there’s a huge amount of potential. “Countries like Malaysia, which exports oil, will always find the cost of hydrogen or electric buses prohibitive, yet that’s where our near-zero diesel comes in.” Mr Hodge explained that the ASEAN free-trade agreement signed last year would ensure tarf-free movement of goods from the Wrightbus factory in Malaysia. “Naturally having a factory in the Far East enables us to be part of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnershipwhich provides tarf-free trade to the Southeast Asian Nations as well as Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1618581284924.jpg--covid_19___fri_16th_apr_figures.jpg?1618581284000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20210416newscovid 19 fri 16th apr figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows One further coronavirus related death and  new positive test results.

Every day I speak with business owners who are in distress and despair and were becoming devoid of hope.

Thankfully, retail, close contact services, hospitality, leisure and tourism businesses now have clear reopening dates that are signicantly better than those mooted in the media yesterday morning. They can now plan and prepare for trading again in just a few weeks# time.We welcome the Executive#s decision and the fact that Ministers have listened to and responded positively to the concerns expressed by businesses and the genuine fears they had about their futures and the jobs of their staff. We now look forward to working with departments and the council to deliver a safe reopening of our city#s economy.Simon Hamilton is chief executive of Belfast ChamberNo, says Conor BrowneI do not have a problem with outdoor activities being increased in Northern Ireland. There is no issue with outdoor table service in bars or restaurants, as long as social distancing is maintained.However, the Executive announced an indicative date for eating and drinking indoors on May .We have known for a long time in the biosecurity community that the single most dangerous place and activity that you can engage in, is groups of people inside and not wearing masks. That indicative date is a little bit too close. Whenever you release restrictions from a lockdown, you should do it in a slow manner.If you make a big change like opening close contact services and outdoor hospitality, what you want to do is wait and see what that does to the number of people who get infected with the virus and also to the number of hospital admissions.I want the economy back but my concern is thatwe move too quickly on everything, then we run the risk of infection rates spiking again and we end up going back into another lockdown of some description.I do not want to go back into another lockdown and neither does the business community but, for me, the big issue is hospitality indoors. I would like to see a little bit more time passing before we start thinking about getting people indoors.We are doing exceptionally well with our vaccination programme but the problem is there are some iants of the virus - in particular the South African iant.The vast majority of people going out will be young people, who will be unvaccinated, and could potentially lead to a spread of the South African iant in Northern Ireland.Conor Browne is a biosecurity consultant specialising in Covid- business continuity, forecasting, and analysisBelfast Most ReadBad blood still lingers after republican gun murders as IRA vows revengeChurch of Ireland reverend John Andersondies from Covid- DUP#s Alderman Bill Keery apologises for #ill-judged# Prince Philip comment during Duke of Edinburgh tribute meetingLoyalists set to resume NI protocol protests Facebook bins pages by loyalist agitators as fears raised about #dissident organisation#Top VideosPlayCanadian MP caught naked on camera reprimanded in ParliamentPlayVideo: X-rated footage of woman stripping outside a Comber bar branded #disgusting#Play#Landmark day# for Northern Ireland as coronavirus restrictions easedLatest CoronavirusChurch of Ireland reverend John Andersondies from Covid- Coronavirus Northern Ireland: Two deaths and  new cases of Covid- Mapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling averageNorthern Ireland businesses will welcome southern customersrules are followedNI councils in the dark over extension of law on virtual meetings Latest from Belfast Calls for Mary Lou McDonald to face Dáil grilling over Sinn Féin voter databaseJohn Kerry: Failing to tackle climate change would be ‘beyond catastrophic’Germany remembers nearly , dead in Covid- pandemicUS horror crash man had fled Northern Ireland over drink caseJoe Willock confident Newcastle can complete Premier League survival mission,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

President Higgins said educating pupils based on the their religious background is “abandoning them to parcels of hate and memory that others are manipulating”.He made the comments during an interview with RTE#s Late Late Show to mark his upcoming th birthday on Sunday.The Irish president was speaking following violence on the streets of Northern Ireland following a decision by the Public Prosecution Service not to prosecute members of Sinn Fein for their attendance at the funeral of IRA man Bobby Storey, despite coronavirus regulations.The disorder has also been linked to unionist anger around the post-Brexit Northern Ireland Protocol, brought in to prevent a border on the island of Ireland by creating a trade border in the Irish Sea. “Who in  can justy the teaching of children separately on the basis of belief  Is it importantyou talk about an ethical present and an ambitious future that you deal with it,” President Higgins told host Ryan Tubridy.He cited social deprivation as one of the reasons for young people getting involved in the trouble and said this should have already been addressed.

Last month Seaview Primary School in Glenarm became the first Catholic primary in Northern Ireland to be approved for integrated status. The Integrated Education Fundworks to further the case for integrated education in Northern Ireland by financially supporting integrated schools and helping others to make the transition. Integrated education is often put forward as one potential long-term solution to contention around religion in the region.During his wide-ranging interview the Irish president also discussed his own experiences during the coronavirus pandemic. He said he was worried about how the general public dealt with loneliness during the lockdowns. Oh yes I have , it was one of the experiences that I really worried about, but not about myself,” he said.“I have grounds to walk in and the big dogs that I enjoy, I kept thinking as I watched television - whatyou were in a flat  Whatyou had someone who was dependent on you with special needs and you were two or three stories up, how could I begin to compare my experience with that “In Covid, some people had it harder and those people with less resources who are in circumstances where they couldn’t move about, they had it harder.”He also revealed how he was feeling ahead of his landmark birthday. I’m in two minds about it, first of all, I think age is only a concept but I#ve been very very fortunate to have the experiences that I’ve had and to have been able to meet so many people,” he said.“Why I hesitated slightly is that so many good friends of mine even in the past year have passed away and in a sense, I miss them.”Belfast Most ReadBad blood still lingers after republican gun murders as IRA vows revengeChurch of Ireland reverend John Andersondies from Covid- DUP#s Alderman Bill Keery apologises for #ill-judged# Prince Philip comment during Duke of Edinburgh tribute meetingLoyalists set to resume NI protocol protests Facebook bins pages by loyalist agitators as fears raised about #dissident organisation#Top VideosPlayCanadian MP caught naked on camera reprimanded in ParliamentPlayVideo: X-rated footage of woman stripping outside a Comber bar branded #disgusting#Play#Landmark day# for Northern Ireland as coronavirus restrictions easedLatest Northern IrelandMournes mountain walker dies after collapsing on Slieve DonardMLAs angered at plans to involve PSNI in £m government scheme #to buy off paramilitaries#Church of Ireland reverend John Andersondies from Covid- Police seize £, worth of drugs in east Belfast UVF investigationLatest from Belfast Mournes mountain walker dies after collapsing on Slieve DonardSport pilots can pave way for ‘le as we used to know it’ – Oliver DowdenPeople with disabilities report ‘struggle’ to move around outdoor seating areasMarcelo Bielsa dazzled by Leeds defensive duo Diego Llorente and Robin KochCalls for Mary Lou McDonald to face Dáil grilling over Sinn Féin voter database,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Communications between Foyle MLA Sinead McLaughlin and the Health and Finance Ministers demonstrates that even those heading government departments have been confused about what Covid restrictions were in force and when. Localised restrictions were put in place in Derry and Strabane on October  following a surge in positive Covid cases. As part of those restrictions no indoor gatherings were permitted between people from dferent households. That specic restriction prevented barbers and hairdressers from working. In an Assembly response Health Minister Robin Swann acknowledged that fact saying close contact services were not permitted to open from October  because of the restriction on indoor gatherings. googletag.cmd.push But, he states, official regulations were only in effect between October  to November , November  to December  and those from December  are ongoing. The Localised Restrictions Support Schemeopened to businesses in Derry and Strabane council area on October , . However, SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin has questioned why some of her constituents have been left unable to access support for the period between October -. She also asked Finance Minister Conor Murphy why his department is ‘recovering’ money from Derry workers who had received support. Sinead McLaughlin said: It has been dficult for businesses in Derry to understand the restrictions which govern when they were allowed to trade, and when they werent. googletag.cmd.push “What we have now learnt as a result of my questions in the Assembly to the ministers is that it has also been dficult for the departments that issue the regulations to understand them. The result is that close contact businesses such as hairdressers and barbers in Derry and Strabane which believed they were unable to trade between the th and the th October now find they are not entitled to financial support for that period from the Localised Restrictions Support Scheme, operated by minister Conor Murphy and his Department of Finance. “Some of these businesses were initially given this financial support and are now having it recovered through reductions in ongoing support payments.”     She added: The minister for health initially told me that close contact businesses in Derry and Strabane were not able to trade between th and th October because of the lockdown restrictions, but that the regulations had not been in place that confirmed this. “Now a revised Assembly answer from the minister says they were able to trade between those dates. To explain six months later that close contact businesses in Derry and Strabane could, after all, have traded in early October is absolutely no good at all. “I am appalled that businesses here are now suffering additional hardship because of the lack of clarity and co-operation between the health and finance departments in the setting of Covid regulations. “It is up to Conor Murphy to resolve this and I am very unhappy that, to date, he has failed to do this. The Finance Minister stands over his department’s decision saying that Covid regulations imposed by the Department of Health on October  did not require hairdressers and other close contact services to close during the period to October . He added: “As the Localised Restrictions Support Scheme was introduced to provide financial assistance for businesses directly restricted by the Health Protection Regulations, I am unable to extend support to any close contact service for that period. “The criteria for the Localised Restrictions Support Schemeis directly linked to the Health Protection Regulations and there is no need to review the criteria.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Amongst easements announced this week, there were changes to the number of people allowed to play sport outdoors. From Monday, groups of up to  people, were permitted to train and play sports together. Speaking to the Derry News, Patrick Simpson of Bay Road Soccer said the past year has been ‘tough’ mentally as well as financially. Like many businesses, uncertainty hung over every decision as lockdowns were put in place and then lted again. The ‘next generation’ outdoor soccer centre on the Bay Road reopened over the summer to the delight of service users but was forced to close a few months later. googletag.cmd.push Mr Simpson hopes lockdowns have now been resigned to the past and that people can get back to some form of normality. People of all ages use the facility for recreation. Coaches make use of the all-weather G pitches to train young football teams such as the Oxford Bulls and it hosts soccer camps during the summer. Mr Simpson said: “Every time we’ve opened there has been a great appetite for people to get back outside and to play football again. “A lot of people are saying it’s like Christmas again for them, some people are there three or four days a week. That is their hour of exercise and the hobby they enjoy.” googletag.cmd.push He added: “I hope this is the last lockdown because it really is having a detrimental affect on people’s mind when they can’t get outdoors to take part in activities that really give them a lt. “It’s about children as much as adults. “People are delighted to be back now. There’s a big smile on their faces.” Regular user of the facility, Kevin McGowan , has missed playing badly. It’s rumoured that Bay Road has a special video archive containing the Derry man’s best finishes.  Kevin, who works as a Peer Support Volunteer at ARC Fitness, is an untiring advocate of the physical and mental health benefits of playing football.     He explained: “The Bay Road to me is like meditation. Its a place where you can forget about everything  going on for an hour where its just you, your mates, two nets and a ball. “It is a great way to get rid of stress and after one session Im already reacting to things in a calmer way. “Its great to be back at it and the usual slagging has already started with the football WhatsApp group. “I forgot how much I missed that. Everything just seems easier to handle when you can have that hour away at the glorious Bay.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There are smiles on the faces of the few people who are moving up and down the pavements. Approaching midday, the sun,not quite splitting the stones, is definitely causing them some discomfort. Traffic is almost constant. It comes through at a steady pace, the roar of passing lorries reverberating off Dungivens roadside shops and houses. A green and white ice cream van emblazoned with Super Mario rolls through the town. I can almost hear the theme tune in my head. googletag.cmd.push Dungiven Main Street curving down the hill. As I make my way up the hill, there is construction work going on in a few of the estates off Main Street. One man carefully removes paving stones in front of a set of flats. Further on, McReynolds Bar sits in forlorn darkness, mourning the loss of another sunny day in the beer garden. The towns other Covid-abandoned pubs would no doubt concur. The ornate gates of Gaelcholaacuteiste Dhoire are closed for Easter, but the sun illuminates the castle like a scene from a postcard. Across the street, the Kevin Lynch memorial has been spruced up, with Easter just around the corner. Political posters adorn street corners as parties jostle at the starting line ahead of next years Assembly election. googletag.cmd.push At the top of the town, traffic grinds to a halt, stled by road works that have created a narrow corridor of cones and warning signs. Heading back towards the town, I spot two people on a narrow laneway, seemingly in heated discussion. Both have puffy coats and woolly hats on, despite the strong sun, and there is a lot of finger-pointing. I decide to give them a wide berth. Passing through the town again, I notice the door to Inner Beauty is open. A glance in on the way past reveals a woman sitting cross-legged on the floor, with products strewn around her.     I have to go back. Road works at the top of the town are currently causing disruption. Claire McGill, who runs the skincare specialist salon, tells me she is preparing goodie bags to leave outside the salon for local children in place of their usual Easter celebrations. “Every Easter Saturday, we usually do an Easter egg hunt through the town, but Ive been closed since Christmas Eve,” she explains. “My customers are really running out of products now. Ive been doing deliveries, but to be honest, there is no profit in it, between time, effort and road works. “I did a delivery yesterday that was just to the top of the town and it took me over an hour. I only spoke to her for about two seconds at her front door too. Its a nightmare. “My phone hasnt stopped with people askingIm open today, because Ive had the shutter up doing this.” Claire says the latest period of lockdown has been a hard pull. Forced to seek the help of a local councillor in accessing government grant support, it still took a number of months. “I didnt get any grants because I dont have a rates bill in my name, so he got it all sorted. It took months, I only got my first one there in the middle of February, from October. ” she says. “I know everybody thinks getting pound a week when closed is fantastic, but firstly, its all taxable, so its only pound a week. “I have girls furloughed, so theres nothing left. My landlord is so decent, which is just as well, otherwise wed all be closed by now. “Were very lucky in the town that were in that everybody is very close,” she adds. Karen Groogan is looking forward to welcoming customers back in store. In an example of that close-knit community, Claire sends me across the street to meet Karen Groogan. Karen runs Groogans, a boutique clothes and fashion shop on the towns Main Street, and agrees with Claire that community support has been vital during this time. “In the run-up to Christmas, this year more than any other year, the town really got behind shopping local and it was brilliant,” she says. “Ive found this one has been harder for several dferent reasons. The weather has been a real downer and regarding shopping, I think people have been better prepared this year. “Last time I was able to help them out and ersy, selling things I wouldnt normally sell, whereas this time round, theyve had a houseful of stuff for their kids already.” Finvola keeps a watchful eye on Dungivens Main Street. As well as the dficulties associated with Covid, Karen is in two minds about the effect the new bypass will have on trade in the town. “I really dont know how its going to affect us. A lot of locals think its going to be a great thing for the town and encourage people to shop local,” she tells me. “I hope thats the way, but is there enough for them to shop local  We could really do with a good bakery, a good fruit and veg shop, but all those shops have closed because of the high rates. “Now were going to make the road to Derry even shorter. There is a feeling that when the town quietens down it will make people shop local, and I really hope thats true. “I do really well from passing trade though professional women going between Derry and Belfast for their work. They dont have the time to go shopping at the weekend and nor do they want to. “Whenever they come here, they know theyre going to get what they want. The girls that have come over the past four years know Im here, but its going to be hard to get any more girls like that. “Thats what I really worry about losing the passing trade. I really enjoy the company of them as well, so Im on the fence about whether or not it will be a good thing for the town.” Karens online trade has been good, but it doesnt replace the rapport she builds with her customers. “We do have a website, but I prefer to be open and able to sell things to people,” he says. “My shop is the kind of shop that you come in for one thing and you come out with more. Its a treasure trove. “Its got all sorts of dferent things school wear, home wear, childrens and ladies clothes, whereas it can be a bit limiting online.” The Roe sparkling in the March sun. Moving past the empty shop fronts at the bottom half of the town, your reward is the sight of the sun shimmering on the clear waters of the Roe. A young couple appear along its banks, ing from a ramble in the nearby fields. Throughout lockdown, people have rediscovered the beauty of their immediate surroundings. While the fine weather intensies dreams of normalitys , many will be hoping ambivalence to local nature spots will notwith it. In Dungiven, the community has pulled together, and they will look to harness that spirit of regeneration after Covids bitter chapter is finally drawn to a close.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Hailstones this time. By the time I reach the deserted play park at the bridge, it has receded to a bitter mizzle, only a stf breeze propelling it into my face. A quiet Swatragh last Friday afternoon. The Drumbane Road climbs towards the North Sperrins Scenic Route away to my right as I make my way up the hill past an empty St Johns Primary School, closed for the Easter holidays.

A pink Fiat brings a splash of colour to the street as grey clouds swell overhead. Outside McGuigans Garage, Kieran McGuigan says the pandemic has taken on a personal edge for him and his family.     “I had Covid myself, and so did my family, but we have all recovered. Its been a strange time. Once you get that [positive] result back, you just dont know whats in front of you.” he tells me. “Other families havent, and its been a tough time for everybody. Business-wise, were just tipping away and doing what we can. “Covid affects dferent people in dferent ways. I was off my feet, in bed for a week with the fatigue and no energy or appetite. “My we and the kids had it too, and my mother-in-law had to go into hospital with it for ten days, but thankfully shes okay now.” McGuigans garage has adapted to the restrictions as they have been introduced. Kieran pauses to wave a customer around the one-way system introduced with the onset of the pandemic. McGuigans have had to adapt like everyone . “Its all one-way and its appointment only now,” he says. “Its easier managed, you dont want too many people on the premises at the same time. Ive a routine every morning and evening where I wipe everything down. “You have your signs up, you do what you can and you bring as little people inside as possible. Were managing it and doing what we can. “The car sales will be open on Monday morning again. Vans and pick-ups have been very busy, but its going to be great to get opened up to do test drives again and meeting people face-to-face. “People enjoy the process, its part and parcel of the business. When theyre spending that amount of money, its a big step and you cant take them for granted.” Kieran admits not being able to physically meet up with friends has been tough, but says last years lockdown had a galvanising effect on the community. “There are boys I havent seen since the bars shut. Youd be texting boys, but its not the same having the craic in a WhatsApp group,” he says. “Having the banter over a beer or even getting to a football match is missed. Last year, Swatragh had five games and I was at every one of them. “The year before, I was only at a few of them, but it was just the fact you could get out, so you made a point of going to them. “The local GAA club did a lot for the community throughout the  months. They were offering to pick up groceries for people that were isolated and delivered meals. “My mum is  years of age and got it a few times, and that was done by Davitts. Its the heart of the community. Everything revolves around it and it brings everybody together.”  Sineacutead McErlean and Fran OKane from SM Filling Station on the Kilrea Road. After indulging in the glamour of being a reporter on the road and conducting a Zoom interview in the car, I head down Kilrea Road to SM Filling Station. A few minutes of to-and-fro with Sineacutead and a phone call with Sean and Im chatting to Fran OKane, who tells me the ongoing vaccination programme is lting peoples spirits. “I think people are more hopeful now because of the jab, theyre more upbeat as its been rolled out,” she says. “I have had the first one. It was a bit of a relief, but itll be better when I get the second one. Youre meeting so many people in here all the time.” The busy service station found itself with the responsibility of being essential retail, but Fran says the extra regulations quickly became part and parcel of doing business. “Its busier now again than it had been. It was very quiet early on in January but things have really picked up now and were a lot busier,” she says. “You always had that bit of nervousness and were very aware not to stand too near, or to sanitise your hands, especially with handling money and everything. “It was dficult, but as time went on it just became matter-of-fact and you just do it now every time you serve somebody. You adapt and get used to it. “Even outside, youre still inclined to pull back. Id say % of customers are wearing the masks, but you do get that odd one that doesnt wear it.” Daffodils signal Spring is well underway in Swatragh. Fran has noticed an upturn in people out walking, but is already turning her attention to more trivial matters as normality draws nearer. “I would walk the dog anyway, and you used to meet nobody out, but now youre meeting people a lot more,” she says. “Im looking forward to getting back to normal,there ever is such a thing, but Im most looking forward to getting my hair done. “I need a trim and a colour done,” she adds. The stay at home message has now officially been discontinued by the NI Executive, but it has been moot for weeks. Ato group training will come as a welcomed relief to sportspeople throughout the county, and summer feels a lot closer now than it did last week. At the weekend, the Department of Health announced over one million vaccines had been administered, between first and second doses. As Kieran McGuigan shows customers around the garage courtyard this week, Swatragh will be one small step closer to the end of the pandemic. It might feel like one giant leap.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Ive a routine every morning and evening where I wipe everything down. “You have your signs up, you do what you can and you bring as little people inside as possible. Were managing it and doing what we can. “The car sales will be open on Monday morning again. Vans and pick-ups have been very busy, but its going to be great to get opened up to do test drives again and meeting people face-to-face. “People enjoy the process, its part and parcel of the business. When theyre spending that amount of money, its a big step and you cant take them for granted.” Kieran admits not being able to physically meet up with friends has been tough, but says last years lockdown had a galvanising effect on the community. “There are boys I havent seen since the bars shut. Youd be texting boys, but its not the same having the craic in a WhatsApp group,” he says. “Having the banter over a beer or even getting to a football match is missed. Last year, Swatragh had five games and I was at every one of them. “The year before, I was only at a few of them, but it was just the fact you could get out, so you made a point of going to them. “The local GAA club did a lot for the community throughout the  months. They were offering to pick up groceries for people that were isolated and delivered meals. “My mum is  years of age and got it a few times, and that was done by Davitts. Its the heart of the community. Everything revolves around it and it brings everybody together.”  Sineacutead McErlean and Fran OKane from SM Filling Station on the Kilrea Road. After indulging in the glamour of being a reporter on the road and conducting a Zoom interview in the car, I head down Kilrea Road to SM Filling Station. A few minutes of to-and-fro with Sineacutead and a phone call with Sean and Im chatting to Fran OKane, who tells me the ongoing vaccination programme is lting peoples spirits. “I think people are more hopeful now because of the jab, theyre more upbeat as its been rolled out,” she says. “I have had the first one. It was a bit of a relief, but itll be better when I get the second one. Youre meeting so many people in here all the time.” The busy service station found itself with the responsibility of being essential retail, but Fran says the extra regulations quickly became part and parcel of doing business. “Its busier now again than it had been. It was very quiet early on in January but things have really picked up now and were a lot busier,” she says. “You always had that bit of nervousness and were very aware not to stand too near, or to sanitise your hands, especially with handling money and everything. “It was dficult, but as time went on it just became matter-of-fact and you just do it now every time you serve somebody. You adapt and get used to it. “Even outside, youre still inclined to pull back. Id say % of customers are wearing the masks, but you do get that odd one that doesnt wear it.” Daffodils signal Spring is well underway in Swatragh. Fran has noticed an upturn in people out walking, but is already turning her attention to more trivial matters as normality draws nearer. “I would walk the dog anyway, and you used to meet nobody out, but now youre meeting people a lot more,” she says. “Im looking forward to getting back to normal,there ever is such a thing, but Im most looking forward to getting my hair done. “I need a trim and a colour done,” she adds. The stay at home message has now officially been discontinued by the NI Executive, but it has been moot for weeks. Ato group training will come as a welcomed relief to sportspeople throughout the county, and summer feels a lot closer now than it did last week. At the weekend, the Department of Health announced over one million vaccines had been administered, between first and second doses. As Kieran McGuigan shows customers around the garage courtyard this week, Swatragh will be one small step closer to the end of the pandemic. It might feel like one giant leap.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

However, unlike other parts of the UK, retail and hospitality businesses in the North do not yet know when they can re-open. The Northern Ireland Executive is due to meet on Thursday to discuss their plans in terms of further easing of the current lockdown restrictions. Retail NI Chief Executive Glyn Roberts described the resumption of click and collect services as a long overdue and welcome development. googletag.cmd.push “It is a step toward the wider reopening of our high streets and will provide a much-needed leline for many local independent retailers whose businesses are on their last legs. “This Thursdays Executive meeting will be one of the most important ever for thousands of local small business owners. “With over million vaccinations, falling hospital admissions and decreasing new cases of the virus, there is absolutely no reason why the Executive cannot greenlight the safe reopening of non-essential retail, hospitality and close contact services for thApril.” Mr Roberts said his organisation was also concerned that the Executive is not doing enough preparation for the wider reopening of our high streets. googletag.cmd.push “Public hand sanitisers, Covid marshals and agreed Covid compliance signage for businesses, all need to be in place ahead of reopening. “These next few weeks will be make or break for thousands of local small businesses.” Meanwhile, Derry City and Strabane District Council has said that its outdoor sports facilities are now available to be booked following the latest phase of the easing of the lockdown restrictions.

Planning permission was this week granted for the conversion of the former Officers Mess building at Ebrington, known as Building , into offices. However, SDLP councillor John Boyle questioned whether offices were the best use for the fascinating building which was built in . Planning permission was also granted at a meeting this week of Derry City and Strabane District Councils Planning Committee on Monday for another historic building on the Ebrington site base to be turned into office accommodation. googletag.cmd.push The former guard house building, known at Building , will be remodelled and extended. The works will provide new office accommodation incorporating meeting rooms and other associated facilities. Building  is a Grade  listed building, located along the southern side ofEbringtonSquare. Building  will undergo internal alterations with the addition of a lt shaft and a flat roof extension, transforming the building into a modern office space. Cllr Boyle told the meeting that he supported planning permission being granted for the respective plans for the two Ebrington buildings. However, in relation to Building , he said he believed the building could have been put to better use. googletag.cmd.push “Sometimes I do consider that buildings like this as office space, perhaps that is not the ideal use,” he said. “I actually know this building and some years ago a friend of mine was carrying out some remediation work inside it and I happened to call over and have a look around it. “It is a fascinating building, it really is a first class quality building and I just regret a little more imagination around what this building could have been used for has not been applied in this particular instance. “But office space can be useful and provides for employment opportunities and jobs and progression of local people and the economy here locally but we are where we are.     “I am also conscious of the fact that something can obviously then be reconverted back into something  as well.” Sinn Fein councillor Christopher Jackson, chair of the councils Planning Committee, said he could understand Cllr Boyles comments in relation to a perceived lack of imagination. However, Cllr Jackson said many of the Ebrington buildings had been unoccupied for too long and he said the new office accommodation was a major step for the site. “We are starting to see businesses whatever their nature having the confidence to invest in Ebrington Square and relocating to Ebrington Square and inevitably it will lead to an increased footfall and along with that we hope to see the real ambition for Ebrington Square fulfilled.” In response, Cllr Boyle agreed that many of the Ebrington buildings had been unoccupied for too long and he welcomed the new plans for the Building  and Building . This weeks meeting was told that a local company, GLA Surveyors, had indicated that they plan to move into Building . A planning officer told this weeks meeting that he did not knowthere were prospective tenants for Building . Cllr Jackson said he was delighted to see work continue to progress at the site. This is just the latest step in the complete transformation of the site atEbringtonSquare and the journey towards achieving its potential as a hugely important business and cultural hub for the city. “The site is unique in bringing together both Derrys past and future stories. During the pandemic, people have really been making use of the space with its beautul panoramic views of the city and open walkways and recreational areas. “As the work continues and more businesses choose to locate to the site,Ebringtonwill become the vibrant, attractive and buzzing heart of the Waterside community. “I look forward to seeing this area continue to develop and improve over the coming months,” added the local councillor.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The upgrade of the Buncrana Road was first mooted some  years ago. Hopes that work would commence in the near future rose this week after it emerged that traffic lights are to be erected at the Springtown Road junction of Buncrana Road. However, Dfi has quashed those hopes by stating the new lights were being put in place to facilitate an expectant increase in traffic due to the construction of a new Lidl supermarket due to open in  weeks time. googletag.cmd.push In a statement to the Derry News, a Dfi spokesperson said: “Planning permission was granted for a new Lidl store on the Buncrana Road which includes for the upgrade of the Springtown Road Buncrana Road junction to a signal controlled junction prior to the opening of the new store. “This measure is to assist the mitigation of the impact of traffic generated by the new retail outlet in the interests of road safety and traffic progression and will incorporate a pedestrian phase.” The spokesperson added: “In June , Minster Mallon announced her commitment to fund the continued development of a number of Strategic Road Improvement schemes including the A Buncrana Road, as part of her plan to aid economic recovery and community transformation while addressing regional imbalance. googletag.cmd.push “Consistent with wider priorities, Minister Mallon is committed to ensuring that this scheme is future-proofed to help stimulate green recovery. “The Department is continuing to progress the A Buncrana Road scheme in line with the objectives which include improving transport links, road safety, traffic progression and contributing to the regeneration of the area. The spokesperson concluded: “Officials will continue discussions with all affected landowners and other stakeholders over the coming months and to progress scheme development.” Sinn Fein Foyle MLA Martina Anderson said it was vitally important the upgrade took place as soon as possible. “The full upgrade of this road is crucial to ensure that it is fit for purpose as a main gateway into our Donegal hinterland and feature in any future expansion of the Fort George site.     “And it is also vitally important to make sure that happens as soon as possible for all the residents and businesses along its entirety as it’s estimated that over , vehicles use itdaily.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Offices of Mid Ulster District Council in Cookstown were vandalised in the attack, with the words Fly the Flag spray painted on the wall. The grafitti is thought to be in reference to an earlier decision by the council to reject a motion calling for the Union flag to be flown at half-mast to mark the passing of the Duke of Edinburgh. DUP leader on the council, Paul McLean had called on council Chair Cathal Mallaghan to explain to Mid Ulsters constituents why the flag would not be flown. googletag.cmd.push We requested that the Union Flag be flown at half-mast to mark the passing of the Duke of Edinburgh but the Council Chairman has declined that request, he said. We disagree with the decision and have requisitioned a meeting for the Chairman to explain to those in Mid Ulster who want to show their respect for the Duke of Edinburgh why this position has been taken. The chairman has seven days to grant the meeting.Unionists may only make up  of the  members but we have a right to be heard and to receive an explanation. It is extraordinary that the Sinn Fein Speaker in the Northern Ireland Assembly can have the Union Flag flying at half-mast on Parliament Buildings but here in Michelle O’Neill’s constituency another Sinn Fein councillor has refused to fly the Union Flag at half-mast as a mark of respect.” googletag.cmd.push Council Chair Cathal Mallaghan condemned the grafitti, saying it was completely unacceptable. These are civic offices where we our residents come to register births, deaths, marriages, he said. Its where we provide crucial public services, from building control to economic development and from where we also operate our local bin collection services. “To see the offices defaced in this way is completely unacceptable. This should be a safe, shared space for our residents and for our staff and such vandalism is an attack on local public services, as well as local democracy. “I condemn it and I call on all elected representatives to do likewise”.     SDLP councillor Malachy Quinn said the vandalism was pathetic. MUDC has since the very start held a no flags policy to stop them becoming an issue, he said. All our staff have the right to come to work free from harassment and will continue to make that the case. Sadly we have sad inidulas who are out their trying to whip up sectarian hatred through defacing public buildings, violence on our streets and wrecking their own towns and trying to drag a new generation down with them. They wont succeed. John Hume always said You cant eat a flag and unionism should take heed and tackle the real issues in our society instead of talking flags.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

After  years in Asia,  of which have been in Thailand, John is now nearing  years of age and is finally taking a step back from an adulthood that has revolved wholeheartedly around the growth of gaelic football in Bangkok and beyond. The magnitude of the Asian GAA community cannot be underestimated. The Asian Games are massive in this part of the world, with over  teams involved – men and women, and over  people coming together in friendship and competition. There are  clubs in Asia and the popularity of the sport, amongst Irish exiles and locals is growing year on year. googletag.cmd.push At the heart of this growth was, and is, Derry native John who founded Thailand GAA in . Since then, John has slowly but surely built something lasting, ever since agreeing to a request from the Asian County Board to set up a gaelic football team in Thailand. That set in motion a chain of events that has resulted in a thriving club – Thai GAA – but also a gaelic community that extends far beyond the limitations of the game itself. With three South Asia Championships to their name, Thai GAA is not just there to make up the numbers – it has ambition, not just for growth, but for success, and winning the men’s section of the Asian Gaelic Games remains the ultimate goal. googletag.cmd.push It is a far cry from kicking a ball about with Oxford United back in the late s. “I would never have thought  years ago when I was in Derry that I would end up in Thailand,” John admits. “I had one of those fork in the road moments. I was working for two years in England and was itching to get back home. I wasn’t that satisfied with my career and wanted to do something dferent. It was in July ’ that my boss rang me and asked ‘How do you fancy going to Thailand next week ’. The very same day I got a job offer back in Derry. I thoughtThailand didn’t happen, I would take the job in Derry. A week later I was in Thailand. That taste in travel, it opens your eyes to the world and I have never looked back.”     John left St. Columb’s in  and was accepted into Loughborough University for a degree in Chemical Engineering. Loughborough’s fine sporting pedigree was a key factor behind his choice but that side of it didn’t work out as he hoped and it wasn’t until his final year that he kicked a ball regularly again. He started playing gaelic – not his strong suit – in Leicester, before moving to Reading where there was a strong Irish community, and plenty in the way of soccer and gaelic. His job took him all around the world, but a trip to Taiwan in  ultimately changed his path and his le, completely. Now married to Jessie, with children Shannen, Cara and Caolan, John remembers when he discovered just how popular gaelic was in Asia. “I went to Taiwan in  on a project and discovered gaelic football team there,” he recalls. “They were competing in Asian Gaelic Games. It was just amazing to see  Irish people playing Gaelic football in China. “I had the opportunity to meet with Micheal OMuircheartaigh who was the honorary President of the Asian County Board. He comes over year and commentates on the games pitch-side. I didn’t watch a lot of gaelic growing up but I always watched the All-Ireland final. His voice was legendary and to actually meet the guy and have dinner with him and get to know him, was inspiring. “I ed to Thailand in , the County Board asked Johnhe could set up a team in Thailand. I managed to get a few Irish people and a few non-Irish people together and we got a team together and we played in our first Asian Games in Singapore in . In our first match we were lined up against Singapore Rugby team and I was in midfield and was lined up against a guy called Phil Green, who used to be a hooker for the England rugby team. “That was our first participation as Thailand GAA. Since then, every year, except , we have entered a team into the Asian Gaelic Games.”  Responsibility For a man who preferred soccer, and even a bit of golf, John was suddenly thrust into a position of responsibility, and, admittedly stubborn, he was not about to give his new role anything other than %. It was not easy however, and a lot of dficult days passed for a club which started out with five showing up for training to a club and city which has now hosted the Asian Games on three occasions, in ,  and  as well as hosting the South Asia Games on four occasions. “It was very dficult to be honest,” he admits. “The first thing I did was put an ad in the Bangkok Post and I got maybe four or five replies. The first training session had four or five people with a few girlfriends watching on. Because of my background with Oxford United, fitness came first so I told the guys they wouldn’t see a ball until they were fit, and I think because they had a dferent background from me, they thought this wasn’t for them. I probably scared people away. “Near tournaments it’s easy to get people to commit, but during the year and you’re running training once a week – I have a -hour commute to get out to training – you’re not sure what numbers you’re going to get. It’s very frustrating and the number of times I questioned myself ‘Why am I doing this ’ It was dficult, but I’m quite stubborn as well, and when I start something, it takes a lot for me to drop it because I want to make it a success. I persevered and I persevered and in  it really started changing.” The foundations of Thai GAA really started to take hold thanks to a talented group of girls, who came to the club, not just wanting to play, but to compete at the highest level. As defining moments go, this was signicant for John and his hopes of what Thai GAA could ultimately be. “I got a batch of girls in who were all natural athletes,” he explains. “Only two of them were Irish, one from the North and one from the South and neither of them had played gaelic before. One of them had played soccer for Northern Ireland but had no background in gaelic football. I had this group of girls for six weeks – all teachers from international schools before the  Asian Games in Malaysia, trying to get the basics. “In the first games they were asking ‘Where do I stand  Where do I go ’ They won six out of six at that tournament and won their ision. That was unbelievable success. Their hardest game was actually the semi-final against the Japanese Ladies. We beat them on Sudden Death Golden Goal. The same bunch of girls came back the next year in  and they won their title again that year. The following year they lost in the Upper Division, but that set the basis. This group of girls was committed, they loved their sport and we were giving them an opening to play competitively. “ was when we really bedded in as a club and that was on the back of our girls’ team. In , my girls won the South Asia Championship, so that was a regional tournament involving Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, Taiwan and Shanghai. That was quite an achievement.”  Sustained success On the back of the girls’ success, the club got this influx of Irish men in  and that has since helped sustain the club over the last  years. The first men’s trophy soon followed – the Plate at the South Asia Games, and from there the club has gone from strength to strength. Better quality players joined – some with county experience, and fresh ideas and new energy began running through Thai GAA. “I was trying to remember things I learned playing with Doire Colmcille  or  years ago, but then these guys come in with fresh ideas and I was happy to let them coach,” John laughs. “The club is in a really strong place right now. We probably have about  members. What’s important is that there is a really good social side to the club as well. Most of the players would be late ’s, and early to late s, but there is room for everyone and it’s just a home away from home for a lot of people. It’s a good social network as well and you’re giving people a chance to play competitive sport as well as keeping fit. “Something I’ve picked up from the last  years of playing gaelic in Asia is what gaelic football means to people as a community. Most major cities in Asia have a gaelic team and it really is a home away from home from Irish and Northern Irish people, and people from both sides of the community in Ireland.” Only recently, John gave up the Chairmanship at the club, as he finally takes a back step from the day to day running of Thai GAA. It has been a labour of passion for the Carnhill man for  years, and he is proud of what it has become. He is not about to drt away into the sunset however. He might be turning  but he wants to keep playing, and doing whatever he can to ensure longevity and success for the club in the future. “I am very proud of what we’ve achieved in Thailand,” he says. “It’s also helped me stay connected to Ireland to be honest. This connection with gaelic football has given me more of an identity and a connection with Ireland being overseas. I have been able to meet a lot of people through gaelic football. The GAA certainly connects people and you can see the impact it has overseas. “I’m realizing that Father Time is marching on. I still want to be involved with the club, but I have work and family commitments. I used to be very heavily involved in making all the decisions but I have got a good bunch of people in there now who can share the load. “The next tournament maybe in Bangkok next year as it will host the South Asia Games and then at the end of  for the Asia Games, so maybe I can have a final swansong at those. There are guys older than me still playing so there’s a level for everyone. I’ll still be involved.”  Home away from home John s to Derry every summer with his family but for now, and for the past  years, his real home has been over , miles away, where he has helped build not just a team, but a club, a community and a legacy that will last long into the future. “It makes you realise the world is a small place and that the opportunities are out there,” he reflects. “It wasn’t something I sought out. I am proud of what I have achieved and what the club has achieved, but there has been a lot of good work that other people have done out in Asia around gaelic football. “It’s not just about gaelic football, it’s about Irish people and how we fit in around the world. We have no real baggage, we are able to adapt and fit into the communities we find ourselves in, and make a positive impact with our culture and with the welcome that we can bring to other people. When you are a teenager you have no idea where the future is going to take you. I had no great expectations or any great career plan. It was all by chance and by opportunity and here I am, sitting in Thailand.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Candystripes are one of just two teams without a victory so far this season, with Tuesday night’s - defeat to Shamrock Rovers the latest disappointment for Declan Devine and his players. There is now signicant pressure on City to get a result against Drogheda United at the Brandywell tonight to avoid the club’s worst start in their League of Ireland history. Victory however, could see them climb a few places, and Coll believes that a win would be huge for the club in a number of aspects. googletag.cmd.push “There’s a wee bit of pressure coming into it,” he admitted. “It’s not nice coming into a game under pressure so we have to try and take it away, and, on our home patch, start making it our patch. There are a few faces looking over the walls looking in watching us and we have to put a smile on their faces again. Hopefully Drogheda comes thick and fast and we can get the three points and get up and running.” Despite the defeat to Rovers, Coll saw a number of positives, particularly the performances of youngsters Ronan Boyce and Brendan Barr, who started Tuesday’s game. In all, six players who came through the Academy represented the club against the champions. googletag.cmd.push “They deserve their minutes,” he said. “If you look at Caoimhim Porter coming on, and Ronan Boyce, Brendan Barr, Caolan McLaughlin and Dixie Ferry, these players deserve their chance, because in pre-season they have stepped up to the mark and they know that Declan, Paddy, Conor and Mark will give them a chance. That’s exactly what they’ve done and hopefully they can keep driving on. “It’s hard to take and it’s four from four but there were some positives from the game. We conceded two disappointing goals, butyou look, we had Brendan Barr coming into the team and Ronan Boyce, and then the other young lads who came in. They were all brilliant and they are a credit to themselves. They were very good but the rest of the team have to step up to the same mark they are trying to reach.”     ‘Stick with us’ Coll has urged the fans not to fret despite the poor start to the season, promising that the players will turn it around soon. City have home games against Drogheda and Dundalk coming up in the next five days and a goodof points could change everything according to the experienced full-back. “Don’t be panicking too much because it’s a long season and we’re only four games in,” he insisted. “We have experience in this team look at Will Patching and Eoin Toal and others, we will be able to turn this around. Hopefully that’s on Friday night. We just have to regroup and that’s what we have to do. It’s our job. Tonight is another game so hopefully we can turn it around.” “You see the boys coming in after games and there’s nearly tears in their eyes. It’s not that we’re used to winning every single game or anything like that. Shamrock Rovers haven’t lost a game in the last year. We just want to get three points on the board and get off the bottom of the table because this club does not belong where we’re at, at the minute.” Defender Danny Lupano is set tofrom suspension after missing the Shamrock Rovers game due to his red card at St. Patrick’s Athletic last week, while Darren Cole should be fit after a recent injury.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It is imperative that this report is published and consulted upon so that we can see the stark reality of what key strategists in health here are thinking.ldquoAre we to take the threat of having the Downe and Daisy Hill in Newry reduced to dferent grades of urgent care centres  If we are, then we need to maintain solidarity as a district and not allow this to happento either of our two beloved hospitals.Cllr Savage said the local authority could not get into a ldquoide and conquer approach that saw ldquoone end of the district get more crumbs from the health service table than the other.ldquoWe need to fight to protect and enhance the services at both hospitals. We want services retained and enhanced for our people, he said.The Newry councillor pointed to the -year community campaign for a new Downe Hospital, suggesting that since its foundation stone was laid ldquoit has been a constant battle to retain services, commending the Down Community Health Committee for its work in fighting to retain local services.ldquoWe in this district should not have to constantly look over our shoulder in fear of the centralising grim reapers within the Department of Health attempting to swing the axe again at our cherished local hospitals to enhance services within a cluster of hospitals within the greater Belfast area, declared Cllr Savage.ldquoElected representatives have an obligation to speak up for our people and ensure that we are not treated as second class citizens when it comes to access to local hospital services and first class health care.ldquoThe Department of Health should be looking to enhance local hospitals and a strategy needs to be looked at regionally with the emphasis on fair access to local health services.Highlighting the need to fight to protect the health rights of rural communities across the district, Cllr Savage called for a ldquofair share of specialist services across all hospitals, suggesting thatthe Downe is good enough to provide cataract surgery, it is good enough to provide other services.Cllr Savage added: ldquoWe need to look at the challenges we face in health and ask ourselves are the current engagement structures we have capable of holding decision makers within health to account into the future and could they withstand the body blow of a potential decision to halve the number of current hospitals ldquoWe need to review those structures and a good place to start would be enhanced engagement with the Down Community Health Committee and Daisy Hill Pathfinder Group, inviting these groups to meet with us to discuss their concerns for the future of our local hospitals in a post-Covid world.Cllr Savage said local people required an ldquounequivocal statement from the health minister that there are no plans to reduce the number of hospitals and a ldquocast iron guarantee that there are no plans to downgrade the Downe HospitalHe added: Only when we get a response will we know  the rumours are just rumours.

The post-Christmas lockdown presented yet another challenge to the council and the DfC to target help where it was most needed.The County Down Rural Community Network , Newry Confederation of Community groups and others were asked to set up three brand new distribution centres and allocated over pound, worth of food and essential hygiene and household goods to the area.The Journey Church stepped up to assist in the Downpatrick area and week after week, dozens of their volunteers received the supplies from Lynas Foods, which they made into the ious orders and dispatching them to the ious groups in need. Down Community Transport helped with the bulkier loads.The Clanrye Group were tasked with coordinating the scheme and Kilkeel Development Association looked after the Mournes area. Clanrye collated orders for food and supplies each week and Lynas foods delivered pallets of supplies to this part of the world.Orders were placed each week by local food banks, the St Vincent de Paul Society, Home-Start, Sure Start and other organisations.Nicholas McCrickard, manager of CDRCN, said: ldquoOn behalf of the strategic stakeholder forum, I want to thank Journey Church and all the other groups involved in this gigantic effort.ldquoThe general public may never fully grasp the scale of the operation to keep our foodbanks and SVP stocked and able to answer the great need which has been brought on by the pandemic.ldquoWhile many of us have seen our lives as relatively unaffected, thousands of people have seen their normal weekly incomes and their day to day struggles take a turn for the worse.ldquoThis food pallet scheme and other financial and food security systems have been a leline for many. I want to thank the Maria Keenan from the Clanrye Group in particular and my colleague Daniella McCarry for going well beyond their normal jobs to help people most in need.Daniella said: ldquoWe could not have done this without the volunteers from the Journey Church in Downpatrick. They selflessly gave up days of their own time and rallied to the warehouse to get the vital supplies out to those that needed it most.ldquoThe foodbanks, SVP and our other partners are also to be commended for getting their orders in every week and for getting food and nappies and other products quickly out to local families.Thomas Leavy, from the Journey Churchrsquos leadership team, was the person who co-ordinated the local effort.He said that the church volunteers represented all generations distributed food to Downpatrickrsquos Fountain food bank, St Vincent De Paul in Strangford and Killough, Newcastle and Ballynahinch food bank.ldquoThis is the second time we have partnered with County Down Rural Community Network, he explained.ldquoIn the first lockdown we delivered food parcels, this time we delivered straight to agencies so that they could get the supplies out.ldquoDown Community Transport assisted with the use of several of their buses to deliver supplies furthest away while we did more local deliveries.The church hired the former Down Sports Centre premises in order to have room to break down the thousands of pounds worth of food which came each week on pallets..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/14Apr2021-Backing.jpg","title":"Council backing ban on conversion therapy  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has called for a ban on so-called conversion therapy and increased protection for those in the LGBT+ community.The decision was taken at last weekrsquos monthly meeting of the local authority with the debate including a powerful and moving contribution from Slieve Gullion councillor Pete Byrne, who highlighted the issues that those in the gay community like himself face.Tabled by Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown, the motion was not agreed unanimously, with Independent Unionist Henry Reilly voting against it on the grounds that he did not know enough about the issue to make a judgement. The DUPrsquos Glyn Hanna and Kathryn Owen abstained.Cllr Brown urged the local authority to oppose the harm caused to the LGBT+ community in the past through the denial of rights and equal treatment and to recognise that discrimination still occurs today.Councillors have also supported a call to three Stormont ministers mdash Deirdre Hargey, Robin Swann and Naomi Long mdash to introduce an effective ban on conversion therapy within Northern Ireland, supported by a programme of work to help tackle these practices in all their forms.Cllr Brownrsquos motion, which urged the NI Executive and UK government to ban conversion therapy, called on the council to highlight and promote the continued support, counselling and advocacy local groups provide to members of the LGBT+ community.ldquoConversion therapy is a horric practice that has no place in todayrsquos society, Cllr Brown declared.ldquoConversion therapy is a term used to refer to ious dangerous and discredited practices aimed at changing an inidualrsquos sexual orientation or gender identity.ldquoThat could include attempting to change someonersquos sexual orientation from lesbian, gay or bisexual to straight or their gender identity from transgender or non-binary to cisgender.Cllr Brown said this disgraceful practice should not be accepted and permanently banned through legislation.Cllr Byrne mdash who is the SDLP group leader mdash said the fact that the issue was being debated in  was ldquobeyond distressing and as conversion therapy was still openly being practised.ldquoWe canrsquot look at the LGBT community and ask us to speak about it without your support, he told colleagues. ldquoWe need everyone in the chamber to support it and I hope they do.ldquoWe have heard the disappointing and weak response from the equalities minister on the conversion therapy debate in early March and we have waited almost , days since the UK government announced its intention to ban this therapy and we should not have to wait any longer.ldquoItrsquos long past time that the NI Executive stood up together to ban what I think are abusive practices in Northern Ireland and right across the UK, banning all interventions that have the intention of changing, suppressing, converting or cancelling sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression.Cllr Byrne said that growing up as gay, he found it incredibly dficult, explaining to his colleagues that he could not express how dficult it had been.ldquoMentally, you torture yourself, you question yourself and you close down, block out your feelings. You literally wear a mask every single day, praying that you donrsquot say something that will give you away.ldquoYou endure enough mental anguish to last a dozen letimes so, to me, when I look back, that is you internally practising a form of conversion therapy on yourself. It is shameful, but that is how you feel growing up, suppressing your own sexual orientation and every LGBT+ person knows the damage that it does, he said, emphasising that allowing conversion therapy to be practised openly or signposting people towards it is ldquobeyond depressing.Cllr Byrne said for most of those in the gay community they ldquogenerally breathe for the first time when they let it all out and to be true to yourself, explaining that the dficulties do not stop there.ldquoYou are confronted as a gay person by many situations that challenge you mentally and while people say lsquothat is the cross you have to bearrsquo it should not be, he continued. ldquoThere is nothing about my sexuality that needs fixed, nothing about it that needs intervention.Cllr Cathy Mason, who seconded the motion, said the practice of conversion therapy sought to ldquodenormalise or completely eradicate a personrsquos sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression and was deeply rooted in ldquointolerance and bigotry.She said those who conducted the therapy regularly exploited the vulnerabilities of young people struggling with their sexuality.She described conversion therapy as a ldquodeeply harmful and regressive practice and that there must be no loopholes on the legislation governing it.Cllr Hanna said the DUP would abstain on the motion, making it clear he had no problems with anyone and takes everyone as he finds them and that conversion therapy was ldquosomething that he would not wish on anyone.Cllr Willie Clarke said no one had the right to question another personrsquos sexuality, while Cllr Reilly askedpeople were ldquoforced into conversion therapy, explaining that he did not know about the issue.However, he suggested that to ban something because ldquoyou did not like a personrsquos ideology or philosophy was the start of a dark path.He said there was a wider context to the issue and that he had a lot of respect for Cllr Byrne.

He has also sold two to the US market.Michael, who is a full-time wheelchair user, has designed Changing Places in order to give disabled people confidence and privacy when using the bathroom at outdoor spaces, pop-up events or festivals.He recently received a pound, grant award from UnLtd, the UKrsquos foundation for social entrepreneurs, to further develop his design.Michael, who is also chair of the Centre of Independent Living NI, said: ldquoThe awardrsquos funding and tailored business support will signicantly help us to widen the positive social impact for the disabled community across the island of Ireland.ldquoDuring lockdown over the past year, we have utilised the time in research and development to be able to extend the products and services we are able to offer.ldquoAs well as our mobile Changing Places for outdoor and pop-up events, we have been able to develop a modular Changing Places.ldquoThis will offer a cost effective permanent solution to breaking down the barriers that disabled people face when trying to access public toilets. We are also able to extend this to installation of Changing Places is physical buildings as they are almost identical to the modular units that we are manufacturing.Each Changing Place will come a toilet and wash basin that can be lowered or heightened depending on the userrsquos needs, along with a changing table which can also be lowered. It is automatically washed down after every use to provide a hygienic convenience for its users.His designs have been discussed in the European Parliament and at a United Nations conference in Australia.Michael explained that central to his development of Changing Places was his experience of the barriers to living his le fully as someone living with a disability such as Motor Neurone Disease.ldquoUnless you are disabled or have a family member or friend who has a disability, the likelihood that you have even considered the barriers we face in daily living is nil, said Michael.ldquoI have consulted with people such as local campaigner Michaela Hollywood to find out exactly what people with complex medical and disability needs require from using a public convenience.ldquoA blind person even commented that to find a toilet where the floor was dry enough for her guide dog is rest on was nearly impossible.Michael, who has been living with his we, Jenner, and children, Georgia and Noah, in Darragh Cross since , stressed that AccessoLoo was about improving the everyday experience for disabled people while they were out and about and not about making a profit.He said: ldquoWhat is best about all of this, is that we are producing these items where quality is paramount, but the profit margin is not. This is a solution that we all believe in and require, so the more affordable the product, the more we hope to see installed.ldquoWorking across the island of Ireland, we are a user led organisation and have a lived understanding of the barriers that we face in % of places we visit.Michael, who received an MBE in  for his service to disabled community, added that he hoped to recruit two people with a disability to work on Changing Places as a plumber and carpenter by the end of the year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/14Apr2021-Downpatrick.jpg","title":"Downpatrick congratulates Blackmore on Aintree glory  ","story":"JUST weeks after drawing a blank at Downpatrick, Rachael Blackmore became the queen of Aintree on Saturday.Golden girl Blackmore made history by becoming the first female jockey to win the Grand National as she rode   shot Minella Times home to collect top prize.The  year-old sensation entered the National on the back of winning six races at the Cheltenham Festival, which was more than the entire British training contingent.She created further history by becoming the first female jockey to win the Champion Hurdle, as well as the first female to finish in the first three of the Gold Cup where she placed runner-up.Blackmorersquos six Cheltenham victories have only ever been bettered by one other jockey mdash Ruby Walsh.

And an influential coronary care specialist based in Belfast has warned that closure of the Downersquos coronary care unit in favour of a thrombolysis initiative would signicantly reduce the quality of care available to the districtrsquos residents.The coronary care unit is seen as the cornerstone of the current hospital campaign to provide lesaving services in Downpatrick.

I thought he did it excellently, he had such short time but he had the room laughing and I think everyone really appreciated it.While Mr Lindsay also met him at St Jamesrsquo Palace in London, it was another Hillsborough Castle event that Prince Philip shared his robust opinion.ldquoThere was only the one time that I talked to him for about two minutes at Hillsborough gates and there was a statue there that he didnrsquot think very much of and he told me, which was quite funny, recalled Mr Lindsay.ldquoI was once lucky enough to have a short private conversation with the Queen but that was all I managed with the Duke unfortunately.Mr Lindsay commended the Duke for the positive impact and benefit his award scheme had on young people.ldquoI do strongly support the Duke of Edinburghrsquos Award scheme, as I support all groups who help develop and support young people, said Mr Lindsay. ldquoThere is no doubt about it, these groups who help young people make a huge dference as to how people develop as adult and help keep the more vulnerable children away from undesirable habits.ldquoI take my hat off to him being behind a scheme which has been an outstanding success and copied around the world as well.He revealed that previous plans for the aftermath of the Dukersquos death had advised there were to be no memorial services for  days after his death which subsequently had been changed to  days.Mr Lindsay said: ldquoAll along the Duke said that he did not want any particular arrangements and I agree. I think that we should not be holding any special church services or special events within that period.ldquoI certainly intend to observe the minutersquos silence at pm on Saturday but I will do it at home.

I had been told it was good for anxiety which I have struggled with, so I thought I may try it myself, said Lorna.ldquoOnce I tried it for the first time, I was hooked. It sends sensations up your body and brings an overwhelming sense of calmness to you. Itrsquos a complete form of tranquility.Cold water swimming has been reported to help people who struggle with depression and anxiety as well as slowing down the onset of dementia and help with the effects of menopause. It also has been reported to increase happiness, give your body better circulation and to help build your immune system.Although an advocate for cold water, Lorna also stressed the importance of safe swimming, especially when the temperature s to near freezing.ldquoItrsquos a good place to be when yoursquore in the water. I think the colder it is then the more benefit you get from it, she said. ldquoHowever, you obviously have to be careful when yoursquore going in, especially during harsher weather you have to limit your time.ldquoIf you go into it and yoursquore not used to having your breathing under control, your body can go into an uncontrollable shock. Start slowly and get your body into control. Irsquove seen people walk in and run out again almost immediately, but once you get used to the process you just feel happy, calm and relaxed and you want to stay in longer.After stressing iables which must be taken into account before hitting the waters, Lorna also lists some essential tips for beginners thinking of giving it a try.ldquoAlways take someone with you in case something goes wrong. Try and find a safe beach, which I know could be more challenging as we have to stay local she said.Since lockdown, Irsquove been restricted so I would travel to the end of the quay in Killyleagh and swim down there. You have to consider the effects of rip tides as they can come close to the shore and can be a very real danger.Lorna recommends those who are thinking of giving it a try to bring a wetsuit, neoprene socks, a hat, gloves, dry robe, hot drinks and possibly a hot water bottle for afterwards.Swimmers should always aim to gradually heat their body once out of the water by adding layers to prevent going into a hypothermic shock.Also, they are advised to bring a floating aid to be seen safely and wear bright clothes.Lorna, a NHS care worker, first got involved with wild swimming after a colleague informed her of a Bangor-based group called Dash and Splash.Since then, more and more groups have took to the waters in local places such as Newcastle, Ballyhornan and Whiterock. Lornarsquos native Killyleagh have recently formed the cold water group Dippy Flipper swimmers.These groups are highly recommended to beginners as they have invaluable knowledge of the waters they are swimming in..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/14Apr2021-family.jpg","title":"McAlister family raises £3k for Marie Curie nurses  ","story":"A DRUMANESS family have helped raise over pound, for Marie Curie nurses in memory of local woman Peggy McAlister.The money was raised through a series of Easter activities including a virtual raffle and a socially distanced visit to homes in the village from the Easter bunny.Peggy, who was a well known figure in Drumaness, sadly passed away in August .

Thatrsquos been a big bonus, Irsquove played a few minutes more than I thought I would when I signed.ldquoI have settled in well, which is not always the case when you move clubs. Accrington have a great group of lads on the team and theyrsquove made the transition easy for me. Similarly with the manager, John Coleman. So far hersquos been great with me and is giving me the minutes on the pitch.The highly sought after Morgan didnrsquot take long to make his mind up on his move to Accrington, which is less than  miles away from his home, with everything falling into place at the right time.ldquoI was part-time at Southport so being full-time now with Accrington makes le a lot easier. One thing that crossed my mind about having to move clubs is that Irsquove two young children and one is at school. Itrsquos not easy for children to move so in all respects of teams that may have been interested in me, itrsquos the perfect situation not having to move home said Morgan.The midfielder also noted the dference of both training and playing level at his new club, and how he has adapted to his new surroundings on the pitch.ldquoI treated Southport as a full-time role, despite only training two times a week. Irsquom in five times a week with Accrington. We get as much grass work as possible which suits me settling into a new team so I can understand what way they tick, he said.ldquoI hadnrsquot played for two months before I moved to Accrington, due to the league being cancelled at Southport. When I first arrived I was fit, but not match fit. I got thrown in at the deep end due to injuries and noticed instantly the pace of the game is a lot quicker. You donrsquot have time to take extra touches.Accrington Stanley are currently pushing for a place in the play-offs with just six games remaining before the end of the season.Morgan hopes he can help his new team gain promotion to the Championship, but he remains firmly grounded ahead of the next game.ldquoPlay-offs are the aim, every game is massive and we know that as a group. Everyone knows that is the objective for this season but we must take it one game at a time and not overlook anyone he said.Morgan is also looking forward to seeing theof fans, as he is yet to witness a crowd at his new club.ldquoOne of the big things Irsquom looking forward to seeing is the fans in the stadium. Football is not the same without the fans. You associate the two with being normal and you just want that back, he said.ldquoI want my family to experience the football league. They were constantly taking me places to help me develop as a player. I remember my dad racing home from work just to take me to training and I want to repay that with them watching me in the stands.The new No  also paid homage to his former club as he focuses on the next chapter of his career.ldquoIrsquove a special connection with Southport. The staff, volunteers, the team and the club as a whole is something I have a lot of time for.

In October, firefighters fought to bring a malicious blaze under control.They were back at the plant last Saturday just before pm following reports of a fire in an industrial skip which spread to a nearby metal container.Fire crews from Downpatrick and Ballynahinch brought the blaze under control within an hour of the alarm being raised.The fire at the waste oil plant came at the end of three nights of sporadic trouble in the area, with fires started in the middle of the Killough Road which straddles the Model Farm and Flying Horse estates and missiles fired at cars.It is also understood that police on patrol in the area came across a pile of breeze blocks which were removed, fearing they would have been used as missiles to target passing cars.Cllr John Trainor mdash who was a passenger in a car targeted by petrol bombers late on Saturday night mdash has called for an end to the violence, which, he said, is being perpetrated by teenagers hellbent on causing misery for others.He believes that a partnership approach involving the local community, statutory agencies and the police is vital in getting on top of an issue which has resulted in a number of residents living in fear and others afraid to venture out at night.Just before .pm last Saturday, Cllr Trainor was approaching the Model Farm junction when a petrol bomb was hurled at the vehicle by a crowd of up to eight teenagers which included girls and boys. While the missile missed the car, it smashed on the main road and exploded.ldquoA fire had been lit on the main road and there is just no sense to this kind of activity, he declared.ldquoWhatan elderly driver had been confronted by a petrol bomb thrown at them and lost control of their vehicle  I have no doubt that last weekrsquos trouble was cleary pre-meditated.ldquoYou just donrsquot turn up at a housing area and discover petrol bombs. While what happened was clearly planned, it is not reflective of the hard working local people in the area.Cllr Trainor said there was ldquono sense to this kind of activity and questioned how the teenagers were able to get their hands on petrol bombs.He said there had been trouble at the Killough Road some years ago and that a targeted approach involving local groups and statutory agencies had made an impact.ldquoI think we need to go back to this model and there must be community buy-in. It is clear we are talking about a long term commitment as this continued trouble needs to stop. People have had enough and want to be able to live their lives free from the threat of trouble and violence, continued Cllr Trainor.ldquoWe need a strategy and action plan in tandem with an effective policing policy to deal with this issue and a pledge from partner agencies that they will make a long-term commitment. A partnership approach is vital moving forward and must include the local community.Admitting that he was not shocked nor surprised by the petrol bomb attack, Cllr Trainor said what happened could potentially have had ldquocatastrophic consequences with the behaviour witnessed over the past number of days at the Killough Road area nothing knew, insisting that it is in no way reflective of of the people who live locally.ldquoWe have a situation where people are not happy and a number are living in fear. Numerous scenarios could potentially have played out last weekend and I am thankful that they didnrsquot. The the fire in the road, the arson attack at the waste oil plant and the petrol bomb incident will be roundly condemned and rightly so. But they must not be allowed to continue, that is why a strategy to deal with the issue involving all stakeholders is vital.Cllr Trainor added: ldquoWe simply cannot have a situation where violence is prevalent in a part of Downpatrick where people are trying to get on with their lives. They do not need this. Throwing petrol bombs is not entertainment, it is criminality. Anti-social behaviour is often a symptom of other issues in peoplersquos lives which have to be tackled.Agreeing that the recent trouble is not reflective of the wider community, Cllr Oonagh Hanlon revealed that she witnessed some of the incidents including the malicious fires.She said it appeared that the blaze at the Macwaste plant was started deliberately and was ldquoextremely concerning given that the business was targeted last October.ldquoConsidering the highly flammable material stored at the Brannish Road site, it is a miracle that no one was seriously injured, she declared.ldquoCredit to our local firefighters who ensured that the fire did not spread. It is extremely frustrating that emergency services are being distracted from what could be more serious incidents and emergencies. We also had reports of petrol bombs being thrown at cars passing through the area last week.Cllr Hanlon added: ldquoIt is hugely disappointing and frustrating that this type of behaviour continues in this area. Do the perpetrators of these crimes realise the impact of their actions ldquoI would appeal to anyone with information about what happened and those involved to provide it to the authorities and ask the community to continue to report suspicious behaviour as people are fed up with the actions of a small minority.

The Prince will be missed most by his family, but he has left an indelible mark and the success of his Duke of Edinburgh award scheme is unparalleled.Terry said the torch for environmental issue which was taken up Sir David Attenborough so many years ago was one once carried by Prince Philip whose care for the such an important issue has been passed to his eldest son Prince Charles.He added: ldquoPrince Philip has left his mark on this world and there are many people from Northern Ireland who have met him over the years.ldquoThey recall a man with an infectious sense of duty and one who could also be humorous at times, using this aspect of his character to put others at ease.

She spoke of `a regrettable legacy of suffering’ acknowledging that the Royal Family also were `directly impacted’ by the conflict. Alex Maskey said few would ever be able to compare with the Duke’s `record of public service’.By Sandra ChapmanSaturday, th April , : am  \"       \"  Irish patriot Maude GonneI would suggest many people were surprised to hear the `effusive tributes’ to the Duke of Edinburgh who died this week, delivered in the Assembly by the Speaker, West Belfast MLA Alex Maskey and deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill. She spoke of `a regrettable legacy of suffering’ acknowledging that the Royal Family also were `directly impacted’ by the conflict. Alex Maskey said few would ever be able to compare with the Duke’s `record of public service’.During the week I had been reading a biography of Maud Gonne, a woman born of the aristocracy but who shunned its trappings to become a passionate advocate of Irish freedom. Ireland’s leading poet of the day, William Butler Yeats,`devotedly pursued her for years’ but Maud did nothis devotion. Her greatest love was Ireland, her lelong fight was to get rid of the English whose record in the country she constantly trashed. By the time she died in , aged  she hadn’t achieved that goal and mostly today she is remembered for the battles she fought to feed the children of impoverished Ireland and her support for the rebels who didn’t succeed in making Ireland a united country. Many Irish politicians of those years regarded her as more of a nuisance. WB Yeats died loving her to the end. Today’s younger generation may never have heard of Maude Gonne but she’s a worthy historical figure.Samuel Levenson who wrote her biography mentions `the relative quiet that attended her passing’. He believed she had `lived too long’ at a time when `patriotism was in a slump’. The Irish Republican Army was again `blowing up buildings in London but no-one knew why. Emigration and poverty were continuing and people were still in jail but there was nothing new or exciting in that’ he wrote.In some respects she was the Bernadette Devlin of the day, a fighter for a united Ireland who was also hero worshipped. Where is Bernadette now  Where are all those names which filled our newspapers daily as Ulster strived to withstand its enemies who wanted to blow it into a united Ireland This is Northern Ireland’s Centenary year and already the event is being `snubbed’ by Republicans. Sinn Fein Communities Minister in the Assembly Deirdre Hargey was accused this week of `a callous snub’ when she declared her department in Stormont had no plans to mark the th anniversary of the birth of Ulster. Unionists want a centenary stone to be installed at Stormont. Ms Hargey declares it ‘reflects only one political perspective’ declaring, when criticised, `that there is nothing callous in my approach’.Yet Michelle O’Neill and Alex Maskey took a completely unexpected tone when they praised His Royal Highness for his contribution to public service. Shinners praising a Royal, even one who has passed on, is not something we are used to. And then there is the question of the stone. The Protestant community of Ulster feels it deserves a commemorative stone to be erected at Stormont in this centenary year. Go anywhere in the world and you will find commemorative stones and statues which represent achievement and give a visitor an instant history lesson of the place. By now the stone should have been erected – after all we are four months into the centenary year – but one suspects it is still on the drawing boards because it requires majority approval of the Assembly and despite the generous aknowledgements from Sinn Fein this week regarding the Duke of Edinburgh’s contribution to the world and his exemplary support of the Queen who did her bit for peace here by meeting Martin McGuinness, the stone is viewed in stony silence by nationalist politicians. I suppose you could sayMaud Gonne was around today she would be proud of them.Now I wonder what Maud would have thought of the NI Protocol the battles over which have left over  police officers injured and street riots the like of which we haven’t seen for a decade or two  Maud’s speciality was street protests to make her claims heard. I think she would have been in the thick of them.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Photo Kirsten McTernanDiscussions about the opening of an arts centre in Cardf started in  and were part of a vision for a space where artists could produce and present work, free from commercial pressures. Experimental work was seen as key to its identity, and the needs of artists were at its heart.The venue was formerly Canton High School, and the initial period of set up was a demanding time. The founders, and a gang of enthusiastic and dedicated volunteers, lovingly cleared, restored and adapted the building to make it fit for purpose as Walesrsquo first arts centre.The first official Board meeting was held on  April  and in July that year Chapter opened its doors with a temporary cinema, gallery and bar, and with former classrooms used as studios, workshops and offices.

Every year, the venue welcomes , visitors to more than  film screenings,  live performances,  visual art exhibitions and  community classes, artisan fairs and events.Mr Eagle added: ldquoChapter is many dferent things to many dferent people. For some, it will be the international gallery exhibitions and the programme of independent films.\"For others, it will be the cafeacute bar and restaurant to meet friends before a Cardf City home game, or it will be for dance and theatre classes or a cup of tea before working in the community garden.\"But at its heart itrsquos a centre for contemporary art, supporting artists and creatives from Wales and beyond to produce and present work.Chapter works with practitioners at every stage in their careers, supporting and stimulating opportunities for exciting new talent as well as promoting the work of established artists.It is a springboard for the creative community of Wales with a focus on bringing the world to Wales and Wales to the world.Chapter is home to over  of Walesrsquo most dynamic creative companies and artists, including BAFTA Cymru, Printhaus, ie ie Productions, Everyman Theatre, Beryl Productions, Cardf Music School and Taking Flight Theatre. Chapter has remained open to this creative community during the pandemic.MORE NEWS:They also offer a range of spaces in support of local artists and companies for the research and development of artistic projects, including Hijinx Theatre.Like most art and entertainment venues, the last year has been one of the most dficult times for the organisation as they were forced to close their doors. MrEagle commented: ldquoClosure has had a massive impact on us. We are an arts organisation that generates almost all of its income through ticket sales, classes, hires, cafeacute bar and other activity.\"The small remaining amount comes fromArts Council of Wales and is used to support our arts and education programme. Our capacity to earn incomeliterally stopped overnight and that was profoundly scary.Support has been generated from extremely generous public donations and from a range of funders including Arts Council Wales, Welsh Government, BFI, Art Fund, Ffilm Cymru and Admiral.Since its closure, Chapter has offered an exciting Chapter from Home programme, consisting of over  virtual film screenings, online theatre productions and art exhibitions, monthly online comedy gigs presented by Welsh comedian Robin Morgan, virtual lectures with Arts Society Cardf, as well as outdoor theatre performances with Cardf-based companies including Theatr Iolo and Kitsch  Sync.Currently showing at Chapteris internationally focussed art exhibition Artes Mundi.

Irsquom opposed to this plan. Itrsquos a loss of open countryside yet again, and the big issue of course that wersquore concerned about in Llantwit Major is the impact on local infrastructure.ldquoWe have two surgeries in Llantwit Major: one is nearly falling down. Our leisure centre is over  years old it has never really been improved upon in that time. Our traffic is chock-a-block the roads are gridlocked at peak periods.ldquoWhorsquos going to live in these homes  Wersquore building more and more homes all the time, but there are so many homes already available. Therersquos not the jobs in the area. The western Vale is becoming a concrete jungle.More NewsThousands of jobs saved at Peacocks as buyout agreedPenarth pub gardens readers said they would when restrictions easeWelsh Waters green energy plant in Dinas Powys a step closerThe plans are split across two parts: a western site of . hectares with  homes, adjacent to the B and an eastern site of . hectares with  homes, north of Bethesdarsquor Fro Church. About  per cent of the planned homes will be affordable.     Both sites would be accessed off of the Northern Access Road, also known as Fford Bro Tathan. This new road was built in  and , running from the B north of Boverton to the St Athan enterprise zone and Aston Martin factory.Planning officers responded to Cllr Johnrsquos concerns by pointing to the newly built road, as an example of new traffic infrastructure in the area and saying new residents of the proposed homes could help local shops by bringing them extra trade.A plan showing the layout of site A Picture: WYG Free to use for all LDRS partnersAn image showing the layout of the siteAnother concern was noise pollution: the eastern site is close to a firing range used by the Ministry of Defence. Councillors on the planning committee feared future residents could suffer from hearing loud gunfire. Planning officers said they could make noise complaints.David Harris, who lives in the local area, told the planning committee: ldquoThis site is located right opposite and within  metres of a live MOD firing range. This range can be used seven days a week, up to pm. Itrsquos regularly used.ldquoNo matter how much mitigation is used in the building fabric, you canrsquot reduce the exceptional noise of live gun fire when you have your windows open or when yoursquore in your garden. This fact alone makes this site totally inappropriate for residential development.Because the housing development is split into two sites, councillors voted on two separate planning applications, one for each site.The second application, for the eastern site, only narrowly passed a vote. Six councillors voted in favour of granting planning permission, and six voted against, with four abstaining. Planning officers warned refusing permission could risk a costly legal challenge.As the vote was tied, the chair of the planning committee, Cllr Jonathan Bird, used his casting vote to grant permission, effectively voting twice. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Mr Drakeford added: ldquoOn behalf of the Welsh Government and those supporting the government in this parliament, which was another huge development during his letime, I extend our sincerest sympathies at the end of an exceptional le lived.:Leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Senedd, Andrew RT Davies, said Philip had ldquooffered so much to so many people including through the Duke of Edinburgh Awards or the serving and former members of the Armed Forces.ldquoHis own military service saw him play a key role in the struggles of World War Two, and he never forgot the men and women he served with and the countless thousands who followed, Mr Davies said.Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said: ldquoWe are here not only to grieve but also to thank Prince Philip for his letimersquos contribution.ldquoItrsquos not a title or status or crown that is Prince Philiprsquos most important legacy that we celebrate today but the support that he provided to others.The Duke of Edinburgh last visited the Senedd while accompanying the Queen to the opening of the fth session of the-then National Assembly for Wales in .Campaigning for the May  Senedd election was postponed over the weekend following Philiprsquos death, but was set to resume for all parties following Mondayrsquos recalled parliament plenary. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A previous application for a total of seven apartments including an extension on the site was withdrawn in February . article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They are really daunted and concerned by the move away from this method of payment.“Some elderly folk I have assisted feel overwhelmed with the terms and conditions which they must sign up to operate a current account with a card facility and some don’t have all the identity documents required. Whilst this is routine for many who are well used to signing up for ious services, elderly people can be more reticent of paper work and what it all means.”Mr Irwin explained: “I feel there could be steps that banking organisations could take to enable this process in these specic circumstances to be slightly less burdensome on the elderly. This could be around offering greater assistance one-to-one and through simplying the process, for instancethe person has limited identication documents. There is a lot of detail contained in the benefits letters that people received and I feel it would be easy for banks to quickly very a person’s identy and reason for opening an account on this specic basis with further verication provided by the Department for Communities.“The Payment Exception Service will also operate from this summer which will help through the issuing of redeemable vouchers to those pensioners who have been unable to open a bank account. However, this will be a short term measure and thus there remains a time pressure for the creation of a bank account.

The play centre will be a neighbour of the new drive-through and a petition collated by it contained , signatures objecting to the proposed application.Members were told the application site is currently used as a car park and there will be “no loss of retail use should the application be approved”.Members were also advised the proposed access points to the site have been heavily revised to limit the impact of potential traffic congestion in the area.Speaking about vehicular access, Alderman Gareth Wilson said the plans showed  vehicles in the queueand noted that at ious points in Portadown a build up of traffic is possible and asked what impact this proposal would have on traffic in the area.The planning officer told the meeting, as long as the proposal can accommodate vehicles it meets the policy and noted how the access is via Sandy Row, not Meadow Lane.“The access to the site has been looked at in detail and that is why access is not onto the main arterial route – the scheme was designed with that in mind,” said the planning officer.Councillor Sam Nicholson said he knows the area very well having used the area for his banking and noted how busy it can be. He then asked the engineer to provide some detail as to how they approached this design.In response, an engineer from Clyde Shanks said it had been recognised as an issue early in the design phase and had required a series of revisions before DfI Roads were satisfied.“We had five or six consultations with DfI Roads before we reached a satisfactory outcome,” said the engineer. “In that process the drive-throughincreased and was moved to the back of the site.“At present, drive-throughsare very popular and this one will be able to take about  vehicles. To address concerns about the traffic lights, the site will be accessible without going through them as customers will be able to access it via Sandy Row.”Councillor Paul Duffy noted the drive-through lanes appear to front onto the main road, like the McDonald’ssite in the vicinity and askedthere will be anything to deter pedestrians from taking a shortcut through the drive-through.He was advised a knee high rail fence will be erected to act as a barrier preventing this.Alderman Sydney Anderson also expressed some concern about the traffic flow and stated “I just hope there has been enough vision put into this to allow the traffic to build up on the premises as it can ill afford to back up on the road.“It is a busy junction most of the time and extra vehicles are to exit out onto the Sandy Row side, is everyone quite happy these plans and the road network can sustain this impact.”The planning officer answered Alderman Anderson’s question, telling the chamber it has taken a “considerable amount of time and focus”.“At present it is an existing  car, car park,” said the planning officer.“This means  cars could potentially come and go as they please at any time of day or night and we have no control over that.”An engineer from Clyde Shanks also noted the site expects to accommodate vehiclesan hour at peak times.“That is an extra vehicle every two minutes between the two roads,” said the engineer. “And that is assuming this is new traffic coming to the area but Tim Hortons are keen to come to this location becauseof the number vehicles and people in the area already.”Councillor Peter Lavery said he was “leaning towards approval” and noted the applicant has put a “number of measures” in place to address concerns about traffic build up.“They have done everything they can to mitigateour concerns and we should be noting and welcoming that,” he said.Alderman Wilson said he held the same opinion as Cllr Lavery while Councillor Duffy said he would be minded to approve as well but felt the traffic lights in the area may need some adjustment to accommodatethe extra traffic turning into this facility.Alderman Sydney Anderson said he was “encouraged by the amount of effortto look at potential traffic problems” and proposed the application was approved.This proposal was seconded by Cllr Nicholson who praisedthe application for being “very creative on what could have been a restrictive site” and the committee voiced its approval for this proposal.The development has beeen welcomed by local MLA Jonathan Buckley, who described it as ‘another great asset for our town’.  \"       \"  Most PopularLaura Gracey, a woman of substance, has diedTim Hortons set for Portadown arrested after ‘serious assault’\" data-s-el\"\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-index\"\" href\"https:www.portadowntimes news witness-appeal-after-serious-assault- itm_sourceparsely-api\" arrested after ‘serious assault’\" \"\" width\"\"Manarrested after ‘serious assault’Hopes for resolution of Bannview Medical Practice problems suffer serious setbackDozens of pupils sent home after positive COVID test at NI collegeMost PopularPlanning to get outdoors this weekend  Here’s the NI weather forecastDisgraced jeweller is convicted of indecently assaulting a childWarning after dog poisonedCall for banks to offer help to elderly as pensions move from Post Office paymentNeil Lennon video -
