I really do like you and your family and dog.’Ruby tells  that Christopher is normally ‘like a giant teddy bear’.She said: ‘He is mostly very sweet but has his moments where he can be irritable and unkind mainly due to his diagnosis on the autism spectrum and bipolar disorder.(Picture: Ruby King)‘The manager of the service told me Christopher was doing something for me, to give me some warning so I wouldn’t be overwhelmed, so I went about my afternoon of shopping in town and came back around 4pm.‘I am now aware that Christopher walked up to Asda whilst I was out and bought me a card, cookies and a plant.‘He expressed to staff that he was feeling something strange in his stomach, they asked if he was nervous and he said yes, they explained that is called butterflies.‘Staff invited me downstairs to his flat and I went in, he couldn’t make eye contact with me but said here you go and gave me the cards and apology gifts.‘One of the staff was blubbering as this is a very out of character thing for Christopher to do, I read the card and started crying too as I was just so touched, I said to him “I know you hate hugs but tough I’m giving you one”.(Picture: Ruby King)‘So I quickly gave him a hug as he is not a fan of being touched and expressed my gratefulness for his apology and expressed that he didn’t need to have got me gifts, his apology would have been enough but thank you anyway.’According to Ruby, Christopher had seen her gardening a few days prior to the gifts and wanted to go out and join her but felt he couldn’t.She left the flat saying thank you again, as she was feeling very overwhelmed by the whole situation.She continued: ‘The next day I was leaving the building to go to my Grandma’s for the weekend and he shouted me out of his window and waved, of course, I waved back and I haven’t seen him since but everything is all good.‘I forgave him, I understand that it wasn’t him truly speaking, I’ve said things I’ve regretted when I haven’t been in a good frame of mind so I sympathise towards him.’Since sharing her tweet, Ruby has gone viral with more than 35,000 retweets and 230,000 likes.(Picture: Ruby King)She said she’s been absolutely ‘blown away’ by the response, telling us: ‘I had simply put it on to show my friends and followers the sweet gesture, as I share a lot of my life on twitter as I am a blogger.‘I kept thinking it’s going to die down but as time went on it got crazier, my phone kept crashing I just couldn’t keep up with it.‘Out of thousands and thousands of repliesquoted tweets, I had a handful of negative responses, mainly about sharing his letter online. I chose to share it as there is such a misconception of autism that we are all non-verbal, illiterate and low functioning when that is far from the truth.‘Autism is a spectrum and some of the smartest people in the world are on this spectrum they just display different difficulties to what people may expect from the stereotype.Ruby adds that soon, she’ll be moving out of her flat and into a more independent service.She would like to keep in touch with Christopher, but it will be difficult as she feels it will cause more harm than good.She added: ‘Before I leave I will spend an evening with him, perhaps have a takeaway or go out for the day as I know he will miss my company greatly, as I will his.’MORE: How chronic illness and mental health are inextricably linkedMORE: Photographer’s emotional portraits will make you want to give your grandparents a call"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/08/12/4BF8F63E00000578-0-image-m-32_1525778119619.jpg","title":"True story Japans WWII human experiments Unit 731","story":"    Horrendous: Japanese scientists carry out a vivisection - a dissection of a live human being without anesthetics - just one of dozens of human experiments carried out at Unit 371It was a completely covert operation, and during WWII it was at first described as a lumber mill, then a water purification plant, and even today, awareness of Unit 731 in and outside of Japan is low.Today, its remains, now a museum,  echo many of the chilling hallmarks of a former Nazi death camp  with its disused railway track and ghostly buildings.96-year-old WWII vet gets degree delayed by nearly 7 decades¿Nazi Grandma¿, 89, who went on the run in Germany to escape...Share this articleOne structure still today contains rows of cages that housed giant rats which Japanese doctors used to produce the bubonic plague.The horrendous disease was later unleashed on hundreds of thousands of Chinese, by dropping  plague-carrying fleas on villages as part of experiments in biochemical warfare.Photographs from the new book - Unit 731: Laboratory of the Devil, Auschwitz of the East - shows Japanese soldiers taking part in a vivisection - carrying out operations on a live person to study living tissue and organs.          War crimes: A human \u0027subject\u0027, seemingly a young Chinese civilian, is subjected to an unknown form of bacteriological test  at Unit 731,  built to conduct research into germ warfare, weapons capabilities and the limits of the human body          Human guinea-pigs: Frostbitten hands of a Chinese prisoner at Unit 731, where scientists would test the effects of hypothermia and gangrene on human subjects          In the name of science: A vivisection is carried out in this photograph from Unit 731 Experiments and dissections on men, women and children were carried out without anaesthetic so that the results would not be influenced by drugs. Prisoners would be infected with diseases, after which their organs would be removed while still alive so the scientists could study the effects of the disease before decomposition could start.Limbs would be amputated from prisoners to study blood loss,  and documents show that they were often re-attached to opposite sides of the body.Extensive experiments into frostbite were carried out, as the Japanese tried to find the best cure for the affliction. Prisoners would be exposed to extreme temperatures in order to develop frostbite, after which the Japanese would study how long it took before gangrene would set in, and how long a human could survive it.  One experiment conducted on young Chinese civilians would see their arms frozen stiff with ice, before being placed into a vat of hot water. The flesh would then be stripped off the bones - the prisoner still alive.           Torture: More than 3,000 people - mostly Chinese civilians, but also Allied POWs - were murdered in human experiments at Unit 731 - seen here is the remains of the frostbite lab          Back then: Unit 731, which was built in 1936 in modern-day Harbin, northeastern China when the area was a Japanese puppet state, is seen in one of its first years in operationThe Japanese scientists also used prisoners to study STDs, forcing prisoners infected with syphilis to have sex with healthy prisoners to study how the virus spread. Doctors injected prisoners with animal blood or forced them to share cells with diseased inmates to test how infectious the conditions were, historians say.Female prisoners were systematically raped to force pregnancies, in the name of science.Sometimes the mother-to-be would then be infected with syphilis or another disease, so the Japanese could study how it may affect the foetus. A shocking photograph found in archives show a Chinese woman so far along in her pregnancy that the fully-grown baby has turned, ready to be born. She has been cut open from throat to pelvis, the baby exposed in her belly.Despite knowledge of a large number of babies born at Unit 731, there are no accounts of any survivors - including children.           Unit of torture: The senior officers of Unit 731 are pictured during World War II          Chinese adults and children have been infected with an unknown illness and are being monitored by Japanese medical staff at Unit 731 Some of those at Unit 731 died in experiments testing weapons such as grenades and biological bombs. Others are said to have been buried alive or drowned. As well as the 3,000  killed  at Unit 731, tens of thousands are also thought to have died when the Japanese used what they had learned against their enemies in the war - mainly Chinese civilians.In addition to releasing plague-infected fleas, the Japanese are known to have planted typhoid fever, cholera and other diseases into the water systems in Chinese villages.          Evil: The head of Unit 731, Shirō Ishii, who was awarded immunity by the US after the warDespite thousands of victims, the Japanese government denied the existence of the unit until 1998, when the Supreme Court indirectly acknowledged it by ruling there was an academic consensus that Unit 731 existed. The man largely responsible for the operation of Unit 731, Shirō Ishii, escaped punishment after the war.Ishii, and several others from Unit 731, were granted immunity by the United States in exchange for full disclosure of the results of their biological warfare experiments.Ishii died of throat cancer in Tokyo, Japan, in 1959, aged 67.The Soviet Union did hold trials for eleven of the scientist working at Unit 731 at the end of the war.They each  received between two and 25 years in a Siberian labour camp.Last month, a group of Japanese scholars announced that they are is set to publish a list of 3,607 members of Unit 731, including 52 surgeons, 49 engineers, 38 nurses and 1,117 combat medics. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/08/12/4BF8747000000578-5703293-image-m-23_1525779465935.jpg","title":"Extraordinary snaps joyful Meghan Markle Italian holiday date Prince Harry","story":"    Meghan\u0027s unofficial wedding planner and best friend Jessica Mulroney posted this picture on Instagram in August 2016 – a month after Meghan had her first date with Harry.

Since then they have been to watch a Toronto Blue Jays baseball match together, holidayed in Italy and Meghan has taught Jessica\u0027s daughter to dance.\u0027Jessica helped Meghan with her wardrobe and introduced her to the right people,\u0027 one of their circle said. \u0027Meghan adores Jessica, not just as a friend but also as someone whose taste and style are impeccable. Meghan looks up to Jessica and has, to a certain degree, modelled herself on her.\u0027     Jessica is Meghan\u0027s best friend and will be there when she marries Harry at Windsor Castle on May 19. Meghan is known to lean on her best friend for style and fashion advice          Jessica\u0027s pictures give a revealing insight into the fun nature of their friendship including the time when Meghan invited her backstage on Suits where she looks through wedding dresses          Meghan Markle is reportedly set to wear a Ralph and Russo gown (not pictured)  when she walks down the aisle at St George’s Chapel in Windsor on May 19Unlike Meghan, the former Jessica Brownstein, came from a privileged background as a member of Canada\u0027s Browns shoes dynasty, which is worth a reported £50 million.She attended an exclusive all-girls\u0027 school, before going to McGill University, where she studied industrial relations and economics. She then launched her own business importing luxury lingerie.After a successful career as a stylist – with her own TV slot – and wedding planner, she was propelled to the A list in 2008 after marrying the eldest son of Brian Mulroney.The couple has three children: twins Brian and John, now seven, and daughter Ivy now four, who are rumoured to be page boys and flower girl at the Royal wedding.Jessica and Meghan bonded over their shared passion for yoga, Pilates, dogs and philanthropy.

She wore a coat by Canadian designer Sentaler and people went crazy for it. We had created this media frenzy, like you see with anything Kate wears.\u0027But it was only after Meghan began dating Prince Harry in 2016 that Mulroney became a global name. It was in her house that the couple sought refuge when news of their relationship broke.Then, last September, as speculation of an engagement reached fever pitch, Mulroney was in a box with Meghan, her mother Doria, and Markus Anderson, for the closing ceremony of the Invictus Games.Harry joined them for the final 20 minutes of the show, standing arm in arm with Meghan and planting a kiss on her check as they watched Bryan Adams sing love songs.And, when Harry and Meghan got engaged last November, Mulroney was credited with orchestrating the outfit – a white wrap coat by The Line, PAROSH green dress and Aquazzura nude pumps.She is also believed to be the brains behind Meghan\u0027s outfits for many of her official engagements and is instrumental in helping her choose her wedding dress.    The relaxed snaps are a far cry from Meghan\u0027s polished appearances with Harry, such as the Anzac Day Service of Commemoration and Thanksgiving at Westminster Abbey last month  The candid photos show just how close the women are as Jessica and Meghan spend time away from the spotlight on holiday  A source close to Maghan has revealed how the friendship has blossomed since their time together in Toronto.  \u0027Jessica helped Meghan with her wardrobe and introduced her to the right people,\u0027 one of their circle saidThe couple had a dress rehearsal on Suits when Jessica helped her choose the Anne Barge Versailles dress from Jessica\u0027s Kleinfeld Canada bridal boutique when her Suits character Rachel Zane was supposed to marry Mike Ross - only for him to leave her at the altar.She flew to London in January to attend the first fitting and was in London in April when Meghan had her final fitting. Mulroney jetted into Heathrow for a \u0027mini hen party\u0027 and was given a sneak preview of the dress and the wedding venue.She has been so successful in helping Meghan create her \u0027effortless chic\u0027 style that Vogue, editor Edward Enninful believes she could eclipse the Duchess of Cambridge. \u0027Ms Markle is an astonishing fashion sales force, who is setting the industry alight,\u0027 he said recently.A royal source said: \u0027Jessica is Meghan\u0027s BFF (best friend forever) and has been a huge influence. Meghan\u0027s turned to her for advice on everything from the dress, the flowers, decorations in church, the wedding lunch — and even the seating plan. \u0027Although Jess lives in Toronto, the two are on the phone all the time. Meg wanted Jess at the final fitting as it\u0027ll be the most famous dress of the year and she\u0027s quite nervous about it. It all went really well and they were delighted with the result.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/08/12/4BF87BE700000578-5703381-image-m-12_1525779072907.jpg","title":"Cannes Film Festival no longer let critics movies red carpet","story":"    Cannes has cancelled all advance press screenings so actors and filmmakers\u0027 of bad films don\u0027t have their spirits crushed before the premiereStars would walk down the red carpet blissfully unaware that their film had been given scathing one-star reviews.That model was \u0027blown to bits\u0027 by the internet where reviews on news websites, film blogs, and social media were posted within hours, or even minutes, of the screening.Organisers insisted the first major change to the festival programme in decades was \u0027necessary\u0027 to protect the egos of stars.\u0027The underlying logic was was based on best practice blown to bits by the massive incursion of digital technologies in our professional and personal lives over the past 15 years or so,\u0027 it wrote in a letter to the press seen by The Telegraph.\u0027Basically, as soon as the film is screened, the social networks turn it into confetti-like strips of rumours.\u0027  In 2016 critics savaged The Last Face starring Charlize Theron (left) as the lowest point of actor-director Sean Penn\u0027s (right, with Theron) career          Earlier in 2012, Nicole Kidman had to walk the red carpet after a scene in The Paperboy where her character (pictured) urinates on the one played by Zac Effron made newsThe letter said the new principle was to make the gala session attended by the people who made the film the \u0027veritable first screening\u0027.\u0027When the team walks the red carpet and enters the room... the moment will be far more powerful as no one will have already seen the film,\u0027 it read.Academy of Motion Pictures expels convicted indecent...Kate Winslet urges women to cover up on the red carpet as...Share this articleNumerous Hollywood stars have been glum-faced or asked uncomfortable questions as they walked the red carpet after bad reviews at recent Cannes events.In 2016 critics savaged The Last Face starring Charlize Theron as the lowest point of actor-director Sean Penn\u0027s career.

She says she drinks more now she\u0027s olderI usually celebrate the end of the working week with a drink with colleagues. Later, I’ll toast the weekend with a few large glasses of Merlot, sitting on the sofa at home. With three daughters, grandchildren, a full-time job and a college course, I have lots of demands on me. Wine helps me to relax.I’m an outgoing, sociable person. Graham, my partner, who’s 40, and I will often go out with friends on a Saturday night. If I’m off to a party, I’ll have a couple of cocktails at home to get me in the mood, then switch to red wine once we’re out. I can drink a bottle over the course of an evening and have a few cocktails, too, without any ill-effects.Most of the people I know drink like me, and it certainly doesn’t feel excessive or something to worry about.My alcohol consumption has definitely increased with age. I married and had children young, so had a lot of responsibilities in my 20s. Back then, wine was a rare treat.Sadly, I was widowed young, too. My husband took his own life after suffering from depression. It was a very difficult time for all of us — but even then I rarely drank.But now that the children are grown up with families of their own, and I’m in a happy new relationship, I feel I deserve to enjoy my freedom.I don’t think that it’s impacted on my health or life in a negative way. I don’t suffer hangovers but, admittedly, I don’t sleep brilliantly. Often it takes me an hour or two to fall asleep and I often wake in the night, but I think that is more to do with my age (I’m peri-menopausal).Sunday lunch wouldn’t be the same without wine, and Graham and I usually share a bottle of white with our roast chicken. I wouldn’t say I crave it, but it has become a habit.Sometimes I’ll have a Cointreau, too. It’s a nice way to finish a meal.          Mandie likes a bottle of wine over a Sunday lunch of roast chicken and drinks most nightsDuring the week I drink most nights. I like a glass of wine while I’m cooking and I’ll have another glass or two over dinner. If I’ve got friends over, then the alcohol always flows. We’d have much less fun without it.My daughters barely drink, but they don’t nag me about my habits. The only time they do bring it up is when I complain about my weight — then they’re quick to point out that alcohol is packed with calories. I’m interested to see how I get on without drinking any alcohol for a week.         Accountant who was five times over the limit when she was...¿I wanted to be a nurse ¿ then realised girls can be...Share this articleThe daughter’s storyKala Spokes, 29, is a business development manager and mum to Jack, seven, and Summer, four.

She prefers a cup of tea to a bottle of wine if a friend pops over When it gets to Friday night, I know my mum, like many of her generation, likes to wind down with a bottle of wine — but that just doesn’t appeal to me. Not only have I got the responsibility of my two young children — I’ve been a single mother since their father and I separated three years ago — but I don’t even like the taste of most alcoholic drinks.In my teens I’d go drinking with friends, but I’m confident and talkative and I soon realised I could have just as good a time without alcohol.Nowadays I have a couple of drinks when I go to parties — something sweet and palatable like a Southern Comfort and Coke — but never on a work night and certainly not at home.I’m not unusual among women my age. We’re focused on health and fitness and on staying slim.That’s more important than going out and getting drunk.If a girlfriend calls round in the evening, we won’t open a bottle of wine but will have a cup of tea instead. Our only decadence is sharing a bar of chocolate.As I tell Mum when she complains about feeling fat, drink’s full of calories. It boosts your appetite, too, and in my experience those who drink tend to eat more junk.Mum doesn’t sleep well and I think that’s down to the drink. I’ve seen research showing that alcohol means you spend less time in deep sleep and more in the lighter, less satisfying stages.And that is certainly confirmed by my sleep habits: I get eight or nine hours of unbroken sleep most nights and wake up refreshed.That said, I’m no party pooper. I love socialising and chatting with friends — few of whom drink. I think our attitude might have something to do with all the alcohol awareness campaigns we were exposed to while growing up.  Kala says her generation are more concerned with staying slim than going out boozingWe don’t see it as merely a social lubricant but as something that can cause cancer, heart disease and all kinds of other health problems.I’m a bit nervous about adopting my mother’s drinking habits as, although I don’t think she has a drink problem, I worry that she drinks far too much.I’ve picked a week when the children will be with their dad most of the time to swap drinking habits with her.After a rundown from Mum on what wine and spirits I’m going to need, I stocked up and almost fell over at the Sainsbury’s checkout when I saw the bill: £89! That’s already put me in a bad mood.

There was no sign of holdouts in Lanipuna afterward, he said.Edwin Montoya, 76, had planned to stay to care for animals and keep looters away from his family\u0027s property in neighboring Leilani Estates. But he was forced to evacuate after the new fissures emerged, including one just a mile away.\u0027I\u0027m in my truck right now on my way up the road,\u0027 he said. \u0027The police came down here and made me.\u0027Both communities are in a forested, remote part of the Big Island on the eastern flank of Kilauea volcano, which has been erupting continuously since 1983.In recent years the volcano has mostly released lava in hard-to-reach areas inside a national park or along the coastline. But last week, vents popped open and released lava, gas and steam inside residential neighborhoods.There is no indication when the eruption might stop, or how far the lava might spread.   Gov. David Ige and Brigadier General Kenneth S. Hara, deputy adjutant general of the Hawaii National Guard, hurriedly returned to Hawaii County Civil Defense headquarters soon after news of the latest lava flows broke.The eruption has already claimed 27 homes and a total of 37 structures as lava streams advanced across the island. Scientists have recorded at least 14 vents since the eruption began last week.Leilani Estate had been the main focus of evacuations until Tuesday when the new vents focused efforts on Lanipuna Gardens.          Volunteer Jasmine Kupihea, right, hugs Keula Keliihoomalu, a local resident affected by the lava flow, at a makeshift donation center Tuesday          Hawaii County officials have issued a cellphone alert warning residents of a subision to immediately evacuate after two new lava fissures opened in a neighboring community           An evacuee carries a case of water at a makeshift donation center Tuesday, May 8 in Pahoa, Hawaii\u0027Some people are not complying,\u0027 said Debra Weeks, director of disaster services at the American Red Cross in Hawaii County.\u0027They\u0027re putting themselves at risk. They\u0027re putting first responders at risk.\u0027If you know anyone still out there, encourage them to come in, not only for their own safety, but for safety of the community.\u0027Retired couple Larry and Geri Butler were among the many residents to lose their home in the volcanic eruption.Their son Christian Butler, told CNN his parents only realized they\u0027d lost their house of 15 years after seeing footage of it burning on social media.\u0027They lost everything with the lava and have to start over from scratch,\u0027 he said. \u0027I\u0027m not sure that fact has really sunk in with them yet,\u0027 he said, adding that his parents were staying in temporary housing.\u0027They evacuated Thursday afternoon, so there was some time where they had no idea if anything was happening to their home.\u0027           Volunteers and evacuees hold in hands while praying before serving dinner at a makeshift donation center          First Lt.

Thankfully, no deaths of serious injuries have been reported.Some locals have been leaving offerings to try and appease the volcano goddess Pele during the eruption. But geologists have warned that the eruptions are likely to continue. Hawaii governor David Ige has called for federal assistance as fissures keep spreading from the state\u0027s erupting Kilauea volcano, spewing lava and forcing residents to evacuate. Ige told CNN that residents were feeling helpless in the face of the phenomena.   \u0027There\u0027s a sense that it\u0027s Mother Nature,\u0027 he said. \u0027The lava flow is unpredictable. It\u0027s hard to determine which direction it will go. It starts and stops on a whim. That\u0027s the uncertainty that residents are faced with.\u0027  He revealed he had contacted the White House and the US Federal Emergency Management Authority (FEMA) when he met with people on Hawaii\u0027s Big Island who have left their homes near the Kilauea volcano. Red hot lava flows engulfed homes, trees, cars and streets - with nothing able to stem the inevitable advance of molten rock.            Governor David Ige (pictured speaking with residents yesterday) revealed he had contacted the White House and the US Federal Emergency Management Authority (FEMA) when he met with people on Hawaii\u0027s Big Island who have left their homes near the Kilauea volcano          Lieutenant Aaron Hew Lew, of the Hawaii National Guard, measures levels of toxic sulfur dioxide gas near a lava flow in the Leilani Estates subision during ongoing eruptions of the Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii          First Lt.

One of the year\u0027s first harvests had been planned for this weekend.\u0027If we lose our farm, we don\u0027t know where we\u0027re going to go. You lose your income and you lose your home at the same time,\u0027 said McArthur, who\u0027s had the farm for about 20 years. \u0027All you can do is pray and hope and try to get all the information you can.\u0027About 250 people and 90 pets spent Saturday night at shelters, the American Red Cross said.The number of lava-venting fissures in the neighborhood grew overnight from eight to as many as 10, Stovall said, though some have quieted at various points.

Since then they have been to watch a Toronto Blue Jays baseball match together, holidayed in Italy and Meghan has taught Jessica\u0027s daughter to dance.\u0027Jessica helped Meghan with her wardrobe and introduced her to the right people,\u0027 one of their circle said. \u0027Meghan adores Jessica, not just as a friend but also as someone whose taste and style are impeccable. Meghan looks up to Jessica and has, to a certain degree, modelled herself on her.\u0027     Jessica is Meghan\u0027s best friend and will be there when she marries Harry at Windsor Castle on May 19. Meghan is known to lean on her best friend for style and fashion advice          Jessica\u0027s pictures give a revealing insight into the fun nature of their friendship including the time when Meghan invited her backstage on Suits where she looks through wedding dresses          Meghan Markle is reportedly set to wear a Ralph and Russo gown (not pictured)  when she walks down the aisle at St George’s Chapel in Windsor on May 19Unlike Meghan, the former Jessica Brownstein, came from a privileged background as a member of Canada\u0027s Browns shoes dynasty, which is worth a reported £50 million.She attended an exclusive all-girls\u0027 school, before going to McGill University, where she studied industrial relations and economics. She then launched her own business importing luxury lingerie.After a successful career as a stylist – with her own TV slot – and wedding planner, she was propelled to the A list in 2008 after marrying the eldest son of Brian Mulroney.The couple has three children: twins Brian and John, now seven, and daughter Ivy now four, who are rumoured to be page boys and flower girl at the Royal wedding.Jessica and Meghan bonded over their shared passion for yoga, Pilates, dogs and philanthropy.

She wore a coat by Canadian designer Sentaler and people went crazy for it. We had created this media frenzy, like you see with anything Kate wears.\u0027But it was only after Meghan began dating Prince Harry in 2016 that Mulroney became a global name. It was in her house that the couple sought refuge when news of their relationship broke.Then, last September, as speculation of an engagement reached fever pitch, Mulroney was in a box with Meghan, her mother Doria, and Markus Anderson, for the closing ceremony of the Invictus Games.Harry joined them for the final 20 minutes of the show, standing arm in arm with Meghan and planting a kiss on her check as they watched Bryan Adams sing love songs.And, when Harry and Meghan got engaged last November, Mulroney was credited with orchestrating the outfit – a white wrap coat by The Line, PAROSH green dress and Aquazzura nude pumps.She is also believed to be the brains behind Meghan\u0027s outfits for many of her official engagements and is instrumental in helping her choose her wedding dress.    The relaxed snaps are a far cry from Meghan\u0027s polished appearances with Harry, such as the Anzac Day Service of Commemoration and Thanksgiving at Westminster Abbey last month  The candid photos show just how close the women are as Jessica and Meghan spend time away from the spotlight on holiday  A source close to Maghan has revealed how the friendship has blossomed since their time together in Toronto.  \u0027Jessica helped Meghan with her wardrobe and introduced her to the right people,\u0027 one of their circle saidThe couple had a dress rehearsal on Suits when Jessica helped her choose the Anne Barge Versailles dress from Jessica\u0027s Kleinfeld Canada bridal boutique when her Suits character Rachel Zane was supposed to marry Mike Ross - only for him to leave her at the altar.She flew to London in January to attend the first fitting and was in London in April when Meghan had her final fitting. Mulroney jetted into Heathrow for a \u0027mini hen party\u0027 and was given a sneak preview of the dress and the wedding venue.She has been so successful in helping Meghan create her \u0027effortless chic\u0027 style that Vogue, editor Edward Enninful believes she could eclipse the Duchess of Cambridge. \u0027Ms Markle is an astonishing fashion sales force, who is setting the industry alight,\u0027 he said recently.A royal source said: \u0027Jessica is Meghan\u0027s BFF (best friend forever) and has been a huge influence. Meghan\u0027s turned to her for advice on everything from the dress, the flowers, decorations in church, the wedding lunch — and even the seating plan. \u0027Although Jess lives in Toronto, the two are on the phone all the time.

If customers don\u0027t have the required funds in their bank account, a further step is available to petrol stations which allows them to check what available funds a customer has, enabling a lower value of fuel to be dispensed.\u0027While some customers may see a request for a higher amount than the fuel they bought - perhaps on their mobile banking app -these funds are not taken from their account.

She says she drinks more now she\u0027s olderI usually celebrate the end of the working week with a drink with colleagues. Later, I’ll toast the weekend with a few large glasses of Merlot, sitting on the sofa at home. With three daughters, grandchildren, a full-time job and a college course, I have lots of demands on me. Wine helps me to relax.I’m an outgoing, sociable person. Graham, my partner, who’s 40, and I will often go out with friends on a Saturday night. If I’m off to a party, I’ll have a couple of cocktails at home to get me in the mood, then switch to red wine once we’re out. I can drink a bottle over the course of an evening and have a few cocktails, too, without any ill-effects.Most of the people I know drink like me, and it certainly doesn’t feel excessive or something to worry about.My alcohol consumption has definitely increased with age. I married and had children young, so had a lot of responsibilities in my 20s. Back then, wine was a rare treat.Sadly, I was widowed young, too. My husband took his own life after suffering from depression. It was a very difficult time for all of us — but even then I rarely drank.But now that the children are grown up with families of their own, and I’m in a happy new relationship, I feel I deserve to enjoy my freedom.I don’t think that it’s impacted on my health or life in a negative way. I don’t suffer hangovers but, admittedly, I don’t sleep brilliantly. Often it takes me an hour or two to fall asleep and I often wake in the night, but I think that is more to do with my age (I’m peri-menopausal).Sunday lunch wouldn’t be the same without wine, and Graham and I usually share a bottle of white with our roast chicken. I wouldn’t say I crave it, but it has become a habit.Sometimes I’ll have a Cointreau, too. It’s a nice way to finish a meal.          Mandie likes a bottle of wine over a Sunday lunch of roast chicken and drinks most nightsDuring the week I drink most nights. I like a glass of wine while I’m cooking and I’ll have another glass or two over dinner. If I’ve got friends over, then the alcohol always flows. We’d have much less fun without it.My daughters barely drink, but they don’t nag me about my habits. The only time they do bring it up is when I complain about my weight — then they’re quick to point out that alcohol is packed with calories. I’m interested to see how I get on without drinking any alcohol for a week.         Accountant who was five times over the limit when she was...¿I wanted to be a nurse ¿ then realised girls can be...Share this articleThe daughter’s storyKala Spokes, 29, is a business development manager and mum to Jack, seven, and Summer, four.

She prefers a cup of tea to a bottle of wine if a friend pops over When it gets to Friday night, I know my mum, like many of her generation, likes to wind down with a bottle of wine — but that just doesn’t appeal to me. Not only have I got the responsibility of my two young children — I’ve been a single mother since their father and I separated three years ago — but I don’t even like the taste of most alcoholic drinks.In my teens I’d go drinking with friends, but I’m confident and talkative and I soon realised I could have just as good a time without alcohol.Nowadays I have a couple of drinks when I go to parties — something sweet and palatable like a Southern Comfort and Coke — but never on a work night and certainly not at home.I’m not unusual among women my age. We’re focused on health and fitness and on staying slim.That’s more important than going out and getting drunk.If a girlfriend calls round in the evening, we won’t open a bottle of wine but will have a cup of tea instead.

The usual suspects were there – those who spoke on the duke\u0027s little rebellion included that interminable Euro-groupie and former diplomat Lord Hannay, and his fellow crossbencher Lord Butler, once cabinet secretary. There may have been many more who voted when the House ided, but the actual debate was under-attended.Most peers know where they stand on Brexit, and it is not on the side of the majority who voted in the 2016 referendum. They were elsewhere on the parliamentary estate yesterday. I bet the bars were doing brisk business.           He helped bring about another defeat for Theresa May (pictured) and her ministers. And usAnd so we come to the Duke of Wellington, nominally a follower of the Tory Whip but, on this issue, happy to ignore his political affiliation in favour of his apparently stronger loyalty to the European Elite Party.I merely note that his duchess, Antonia, is a Princess of Prussia. He himself, Charles Valerian Wellesley OBE, DL, with more titles than a champion boxer, after schooling at Eton, has had a business career, home and abroad.He is a member of Portugal\u0027s Order of Merit and he holds the Grand Cross of the Spanish Order of Isobel the Catholic.

The first Duke of Wellington (pictured) was a tremendous thumper of the French, the victor of Waterloo, later prime minister Where once his illustrious forebear wore battle colours and carried a riding crop, this silk-suited patrician, purring in a voice that was pure gin and French, put it to their lordships that he was merely \u0027trying to help the Government and not in any way to thwart\u0027 Brexit. Noo noo, of course not. Dear heart, the thought never crossed our minds.He argued simply that it was a frightful bind for ministers to have to work with the burden of this set date for our departure. How much more they could achieve if that date were not there!Lord Butler, from what I could understand, sought to suggest that dropping the date might actually allow Brexit to be delayed for ever, but the duke did not want to pursue that idea.Eurosceptic opposition came from Lord Grocott, a Labour peer who has had to put up with some pretty bad heckling in recent months (his party colleagues at the far end of the Palace of Westminster hate him for siding with the voters).He recalled Parkinson\u0027s Law, which states that \u0027work expands to fill the time available\u0027 and he suspected that the Europhiles were merely attempting to hold up Brexit. His voice went unheeded and the duke\u0027s dismal little delay was approved by a House that, with every day, looks riper for the abattoir.Does this sort of thing help the Remainers? To have an hereditary peer, one of the most blue of all blue-bloods, helping their cause?

While the others were identified with a name and their country’s flag, Y\u0026nbspMardini was identified by a white flag emblazoned with the Olympic rings. A\u0026nbspbeep, and they were curving into the blue pool. Mardini was slightly ahead for the first length, but lost momentum on the turn. She struggled to catch up to the Grenadian swimmer next to her – until the last few strokes, when, like her childhood hero Michael Phelps, she found a final burst of speed, and touched the wall first. The butterfly is a powerful, uncompromising stroke, and head-on pictures of Mardini in full flight only underline this: delicate face furious with focus, big shoulders lifting arms like wings. But what was more powerful, for millions watching, was the flag, and why she was competing under it: Mardini was swimming in her first Olympics as a member of the refugee team, travelling on a document that enabled her to go anywhere except her home country of Syria, from which she had literally swum away.Butterfly tells the story, in Mardini’s own (ghostwritten) words, of how she got to that starting block. It is a story full of so much incident, put so plainly and at such a\u0026nbsppace, that the reader begins to feel just as Mardini does about her late teens: “Things happen so fast there’s no time to reflect.”The swimmer, now 21, was born in Damascus. Her father competed for the national swimming team until he had to do military service all ambition was then transferred to his two daughters, Sara and Yusra. He threw them into pools when they were still tiny, fishing them out again under their mother’s horrified gaze. Later, he insisted they keep training even when Sara’s shoulders began to give under the strain, when Yusra had fainting spells, or ear infections, or, one day, when a weight-training machine, released unexpectedly by a team-mate, split her cheek open. “Dad wants us to be the best swimmers. The very best. On Earth. Ever,” writes Yusra, who, frightened, obeyed his autocratic requirements, swimming two hours a day under an unsmiling portrait of President Bashar al-Assad. Sara made the national team, and won a medal at the Pan-Arab Games a picture is taken of her, with her medal – and Assad.The Arab spring rumbles in the distance, comes closer and closer, until it spills into Syria. They wait for it to pass, “and while I\u0026nbspwait, I swim,” Yusra writes. “Swimming is the best distraction.” But one day they turn into their street to find three tanks squatting at the end of it, and a soldier takes direct aim at their car. Not long afterwards, their father is arrested in a case of mistaken identity, hung upside down and beaten. Their home is flattened, and they are at the mercy of landlords who take advantage of their vulnerability to rack up rents. Mardini watches as the stadium where she trains is destroyed by a shell. Then one day, as she is swimming elsewhere, there is a\u0026nbspsound of shattering glass, shouts – and in the suddenly clear water, an unexploded bomb. Sara already knows she must leave Syria Yusra now realises it, too.So, leaving their mother and much younger sister in Damascus, they set out for Turkey and the Mediterranean. Their dinghy is turned back once by the Turkish coastguard. When they set off again the sea is no longer flat under the sun, but full of “churning teeth”. Fifteen minutes in, the engine fails. The boat is full and riding low so they throw anything out that they can. Then one of the men, a non-swimmer, bravely goes over the side, and hangs on. The dinghy lifts. Sara goes in, too, then Yusra. The sisters don’t physically pull it to shore, as has been widely reported – 10km (six miles), in high seas, with a heavy boat, is impossible even for two national-level swimmers – but they hold it steady, feeling for currents, keeping it on course, telling joje and smiling so as not to worry the six-year-old who is still on board. Night falls.Yusra was the sister who captured the public imagination, but Sara is really the hero here – plucky, confident, charismatic, a natural leader given to reckless irreverence in the face of muscled, humourless men abusing their scraps of power. Yusra’s arc, though, is so improbable, so narratively neat, that it is not surprising there’s a film, directed by Stephen Daldry, already in the works. She has met Barack Obama, and the pope.The account of the sisters’ travels after they land on Lesbos is a litany of\u0026nbspfaithless smugglers, prisons, border after border, trains that stop in the middle of a\u0026nbspEuropean nowhere while passengers wait, hearts in mouths, for the police to crash in – a litany predictable, not just from the recent refugee crisis but from film after book after memoir throughout the 20th century. They could be Armenians, or Poles, or Jews escaping Germany – except this time, Germany is where they’re heading (they even, disconcertingly, find themselves billeted in a camp where Rudolf Hess was once held). The weekend they arrive in Germany they are two of 20,000 similar arrivals.Vastly grateful for inidual kindnesses, Mardini is nevertheless shocked at the degree to which all that she is – Damascene, swimmer, girl becoming woman – is collapsed into one word: refugee. She fears that she is only competing at the Olympics out of pity. Yet\u0026nbspshe agrees to race in order to demonstrate her iniduality – and that of all other refugees.

The Newcastle-based firm, best known for its sausage rolls and pasties, said that dwindling footfall during the bad weather, as well as a strong comparative performance in the same period of 2017, contributed to a tough trading backdrop throughout March and April.The bakery chain suffered disruption during the snow storms in late February and March, with delivery vans struggling to reach their destinations and staff unable to make it into work, particularly in Scotland and parts of Wales, which experienced the worst of the weather.In an update for the first 18 weeks of 2018, Greggs said it was expecting full-year profit to be roughly unchanged from the £81.8m achieved in 2017. City analysts were forecasting profits of about £87m for 2018.“Taking into account trading conditions in the year to date, and our more cautious outlook, we currently believe that underlying profits for the year are likely to be at a similar level to last year,” Greggs said.“In the period ... market data confirms weak customer footfall in retail locations, which has impacted demand for food on the go. The impact was especially significant in the weeks of severe weather when many shops, including our own, could not be opened,” the company said.Greggs, which has about 1,900 shops across the UK, said its breakfast and hot food menus were proving popular among customers. The chain said sales of healthier options also continued to grow as it extended the range on offer for the summer.“Sales in May have started more strongly than we experienced throughout March and April. However, given the uncertainties over market footfall we are cautious in respect of the outlook for sales in the balance of the year,” the company said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af93ebfa418fa9cfb2f15624771d3c291639985a/0_384_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d384d23da2881de98cb18e11b848d7bf","title":"shopping centre currency hope newcastle under lyme","story":"Commerce has deserted Newcastle-under-Lyme’s town centre. The latest in our new economics series looks at how the community is filling the gap • Listen to Aditya Chakrabortty talking about game-changing economic models on The Alternatives podcastFor years, all Mike Riddell has seen in his trade is failure and death. But today he’s at a birth – and all his hope rests on it. A new cafe is opening in the shopping centre he manages and they are throwing a party. Having brought along his wife and mum, 53-year-old Riddell goes into “full-on host mode”, chatting up council officials and swapping elaborate handshakes with teenagers. Yes Sir, I Can Boogie blasts out of the stereo, and some obliging soul in a Spider-Man costume complies. Over all the music and chat, you can hear the free ping-pong tables getting a pounding. Yes sir, clip-clop, clip-clop, I can boogie, clip-clop, clip-clop.Through the big windows, you can see the world Riddell normally faces – and it’s desolate. No babble, no mucking about. Hardly anyone clip-clops past. On this Tuesday lunchtime at York Place, the most tired shopping centre in Newcastle-under-Lyme, just outside Stoke, there are few actual shoppers.After decades building and running shopping centres across the country, Riddell has looked after York Place for two tough years. He let out this same entrance cafe to a can-do pair at the end of 2017. They lasted a few months before giving up, leaving behind the tables, chairs and a stove for whoever else wanted to try their luck. It would be hard for anyone, but especially for Riddell, who is one of life’s enthusiasts. He zooms down conversational detours about his great love, northern soul, and its debt to miners’ culture. And he never wears a poker face. Ask how important this successor cafe is and he admits: “Fucking vital. We need to make this work.”At rock bottom, eight of York Place’s 35 units stood vacant. Still today, bare shopfronts are as obvious as missing teeth. Next door at the fancier Roebuck Centre, the Early Learning Centre, Argos and Primark have all disappeared. Even the charity shops are vanishing. For centuries, Newcastle, as locals call it, has been a bustling market town. Today the market is retreating and the town’s very identity is under threat.York Place is at the eye of a storm that has either already hit your home town or is looming over it. Last year 5,855 shops closed in Britain, the most since 2010. If today is in line with the average, by this evening a net total of five shops will have given up the ghost.In our long post-crash slump, trusted names are either shutting down or cutting back: Woolworths, Comet, Blockbuster, Maplin, Jaeger, Toys R Us, BHS... As British wages continue to flatline, more closures will follow. Just last week, the 169-year-old chain House of Fraser announced plans to begin insolvency proceedings .These inidual business failures amount collectively to a disease eating away at small-town centres and suburban high streets. It advances in stages: first out are the brand names and chains then shoppers with cars after that, in come the charity shops and betting dens. What’s left are ghost towns, abandoned by all bar schoolchildren and pensioners.“Walk around Newcastle at three in the afternoon and a lot of the cafes are empty,” says Andy Arnott, a senior local council officer. “Come five, everybody finishes work and leaves town.”I can see why a retailer already battling Lidl or Amazon’s Jeff Bezos might pass over Newcastle. It’s a bit too close to Stoke to draw its own footfall. It lies in a region built on mining and potteries, where prosperity is now a fading memory. In a country that simply has too many shops, executives have little use for Newcastle and other places, from Dartford to Newport to Dewsbury. What, apart from shopping, will they do now? What, indeed, does a country built on debt and consumption do when it’s exhausted that model? These are questions that Westminster has barely even clocked, let alone tried to answer.David Cameron got Mary “Queen of Shops” Portas to write a report on “distressed town centres”, then so roundly ignored her proposals that she attacked his “PR campaign”. Since 2011 there have been seven high street ministers in as many years. So weighty have been their interventions, I bet you didn’t even know there was such a thing as a high street minister.Which leaves it up to towns to fix their own gutted centres, using whatever tools they can find. Dumfries has a “doon toon army” of locals bidding to buy derelict shops. In Newcastle, Riddell and his colleagues already have a plan. They’re turning York Place into a post-shopping centre.Its anchor tenant – the big shop to draw in passing trade – isn’t an H\u0026ampM or a Wilko, but a charity: the YMCA. Rather than a traditional charity shop, it’s selling jewellery and other work hand-made by local artists, and runs arts and crafts workshops for residents of all ages. And as of last Tuesday, the cornerstone cafe is Cultural Squatters, a social enterprise that markets itself as the “anti-Costa”. It serves instant coffee at £1 a mug alongside those Staffordshire specialities, lobby (stew) and oatcakes. Staff include adult volunteers with learning disabilities.Where shopping centres are normally stuffed full of chains, York Place is now a hub for local independents. Where landlords usually demand maximum rent, Riddell has cajoled his London-based client into accepting two non-profits in return for reduced business rates.It’s a pragmatic way of reclaiming commercial space for a community – and it’s buttressed by a reward scheme launched by Riddell and his colleagues at Manchester-based consultancy HometownPlus. Called CounterCoin, it’s like a Tesco Clubcard – except you earn points not by spending, but by doing something for the community. Help out at a YMCA workshop, say, and you’ll get clay tokens that entitle you to bargain off-peak sessions at the neighbourhood bowling alley, or discounts from the local Spar on food about to pass its best-before date. “If we can dole out points for being a zombie consumer at Tesco, why can’t we give points for doing some good in the community?” says Riddell.“Genius,” says Arnott, who plans to add more of the council’s leisure facilities to the scheme.Again, this is commonsense radicalism: retrieving things discarded by the market, whether shops or goods or people, and giving them a social value.That’s true of the abandoned plot now occupied by Cultural Squatters. It’s also true of its founder, Narina Stead, who fixed up her cafe despite a broken arm and torn ligaments. Painting hurt, she admits, but “I’m too busy for a sling”.Has you or your community come up with answers to doing things differently? If so we\u0027d like to hear from you.\u0026nbsp Share your stories\u0026nbspvia this form\u0026nbspand we\u0027ll be in touch.\u0026nbspYou can share your experiences anonymously. We’ll include some of your stories in our reporting.Now 42, pink-haired Stead cheerfully says: “I’ve lived with some absolute monsters.” She talks of a history of domestic violence, of a broken back two decades ago. Another relationship broke her mental health, forcing her out of work and on to benefits. She used the time to get a first-class English degree, then “boshed out” a master’s, finishing both in three years. Yet in a jobs market as slack as north Staffordshire, it would be an unusual employer who would bother looking past her long-term unemployment to see her brains and stamina. What about the state? A couple of months ago, it was chasing her for bedroom tax. Only Riddell offered her a shot at a business. It’s hard graft that has still to pay, but when she blurts out “This is my baby!”, her pride needs no underlining.Pinned to the noticeboard of the York Place offices are not charts of till receipts or footfall – but a graph depicting how many person-hours have been poured into the local community through the shopping centre. However crude, it’s an attempt to measure social value, and I’ll bet 10 CounterCoin that no other mall anywhere in the country charts such a thing.“It’s no ordinary shopping centre. It’s a laboratory,” says Julie Froud, a professor at Alliance Manchester Business School, who is conducting an independent evaluation of York Place.It lacks investment, as shown by the cluster of buckets to catch leaks in the entrance. The ideas are rough around the edges, and many of those involved are working on goodwill. But at least the centre only has one faraway landlord activists in Dumfries are having to barter with a number of absentee owners.In this lies a lesson for any opposition party that wants to offer disaffected voters a means of taking back control: make it easier for communities to repossess derelict properties. Most of all, Froud notes: “This is a group of people all trying to make things happen.”And trying to change a broken model. It’s often assumed that this hyper-consumerist culture of debt and spending is intrinsically British – yet it is a recent invention. As late as the 1960s, the historian Frank Trentmann notes in his 2016 book Empire of Things, furniture bought on hire purchase would be delivered in “plain vans” so as to not to shame a family. Then, between the mid-70s and the mid-90s, the number of Britons with credit facilities tripled.With that began the giant boom for the shopping business – including for Riddell, who built malls from Newport to Crewe. He drives me to see one of his last shopping malls, the Grand Arcade in Wigan. It opened in March 2007, “pretty much the same day as Warrington, only 20 miles away, had a massive extension to its shopping centre. The Trafford centre had just had one too. Preston, Chorley – they were all at the same game.”Then Britain’s credit system failed. “The banks were like, ‘That umbrella we lent you when it was sunny, can we have it back now it’s raining?’ We had a shopping centre in Wakefield half-built, and the banks stopped the funding.”Since the company’s huge loans were backed by the partners, Riddell had to hold his own closing-down sale and liquidate almost everything he owned. He went from being worth millions to being tens of millions in debt. The family home was only saved by cash from his father-in-law. He also donated the nine-year-old car we’re now in.“Those bastards in the banking system” are, in his eyes, “drug dealers. They want to get their cocaine out, and they’re bonused up to find people like us. ‘Here, d’you want more stuff?’ Then when the drugs ran out, they came and kicked our doors in and scared our wives.”Now he holds no bank account, and buys precious little. Having been spat out of the debt-consumerist complex, he wants nothing more to do with it.As we park up outside his glory days, he sighs: “Weird, being back here.” The Grand Arcade was built on the site of the Wigan Casino, and there is by the vast cafe a shrine to northern soul: guitars, posters and seven-inch singles.Still, he remembers, local traders hated the mall for sucking the life out of the local high street. Now it has its own voids: both TK Maxx and Monsoon have left. Riddell takes a long, mystified look at the temple he built, deserted at closing time.“Retail,” he finally says. “It’s dead, innit?”• Aditya Chakrabortty is senior economics commentator for the "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42762ad2489cb444707a08cda7b14acd9056ff76/94_149_5485_3292/master/5485.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ddd69d487de591ad9a3f1e18086a6d98","title":"windrush shaped britain 70 years immigration national holiday","story":"June marks 70 years since the start of the postwar immigration boom. A national holiday would be a fitting tributeBack in 2010 I wrote an article arguing that we would have failed as a nation if, by 2018, there was still no substantive recognition for the Windrush generation on the 70th anniversary of their arrival in Britain. I have been part of a call to action for a public holiday called Windrush Day on 22\u0026nbspJune, the anniversary of the arrival of the MV Empire Windrush at Tilbury docks in 1948. For we need to remember that many aspects of British society today would be unrecognisable without the contributions that immigration and integration have made: from the NHS to the monarchy, our language, literature, enterprise, public life, fashion, music, politics, science, culture, food and even humour.Since then, there has been movement on Windrush celebrations. The ship’s image was used as part of the 2012 Olympic Games opening ceremony. Recent changes to the national curriculum for history have for the first time recognised the Windrush and wider postwar migration. There has also been a growing campaign to promote the idea of a Windrush Day as a\u0026nbspnational holiday.A number of national and regional events are planned on 22 June, including a service at Westminster Abbey and local authority events around the country. No 10 has hosted meetings to explore how the government can support Windrush commemoration events around the country. This is encouraging but piecemeal. As has been so clear in the past weeks and months, obtaining their rightful due for the Windrush generation has been an uphill climb. They saw this as the motherland – but how does Britain see them?The 70th anniversary is a chance to reach across our many different ethnic, faith and family heritages to reject the prejudice and intolerance that seem to have been given a new lease of life by the fractiousness and factionalism of current debates on race, identity and immigration. Of course we, the descendants of that generation, will celebrate. We don’t need the government or officialdom to do that. But this is a chance for all of us to consider the past and locate Windrush in our national story. I hope we seize it.• Patrick Vernon is a campaigner and was the founder of the 100 Great Black Britons campaign"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8f10a3aba47667ab106c92ec2cb44161e655ed3/0_232_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d78640d5bee43b2547fbbbba22a5232","title":"from backstreet eats to five star feasts abu dhabis diverse dining scene","story":"Whether you’re on a blow-out budget or hunting for a bargain, Abu Dhabi has it all. Here, we pick some of the best – from souks to starry hauntsAbu Dhabi is a city of extremes, and we’re not just talking about that summer heat. The expensive tastes of wealthy locals and expats have seen it become a magnet for the biggest global names in hospitality, but if that’s not your scene, there’s also quite a selection of less overdraft-bothering local cafes that can offer astonishing value for money. From the ultra-shiny to the super-simple, here’s our pick of the best ...Liwan MansourLebanese is by far the UAE’s favourite cuisine, and despite the efforts of the capital’s top hotels, the best hummus and tabbouleh is still to be found in less polished surrounds. Most of the dishes here are simply on a par with nearby contenders, but it’s the takeaway shawarma – stuffed with beef or chicken, fries and garlic sauce – that make it a must for street-food seekers. Yours for just AED 6 (£1.16), one makes for a tasty lunch, two the perfect late night sustenance.liwanmansour.aeTandoori CornerIndian restaurants in Abu Dhabi fall into two categories: slick and pricey hotel-based operations, and backstreet curry houses where the bill can come in at a tenth of the price or less. Tandoori Corner (which isn’t, in fact, on a corner) is very much the latter, though the food is easily as good as its five-star competition. As with many Indian restaurants in the city, there’s a whole menu of Chinese dishes, too, making it perfect for any group at loggerheads over what they fancy for dinner.MeylasEmirati food is oddly difficult to come by in the United Arab Emirates. Looking to redress the balance is Shaikha Al Kaabi, a young local who first set up a roving foodtruck serving modern takes on the dishes of her childhood, and has since opened a bricks-and-mortar site. Start with the fareed (a meat and veg stew), before graduating to harees (a wheat pudding with beef). Even if one plate isn’t to your taste, dishes start at AED 20 (£4), so risks are minimal.meylasenBonna AnneeAs is tradition in Ethiopian cuisine, dishes at this welcoming backstreet restaurant come served up on a spongy sourdough flatbread called injera. This edible plate also serves as cutlery – rip a patch off and use it to scoop up the slow-cooked stews and curries on top. The Bonna Annee Special – preposterous value at just AED 40 (£8) – comprises a mix of meat and veg dishes, and will feed two people very handsomely indeed.Bord EauAbu Dhabi’s restaurant scene is full of wacky concepts. Thankfully, between the classic French cooking and the modestly stylish dining room, there are none to be found at this polished waterfront restaurant. That’s not to call Bord Eau stuffy – even traditional dishes such as boeuf bourguignon and confit duck surprise with canny twists and inventive presentation. Best of all, though, is the fact that even the simple stuff is beyond decadent – try the outrageously silken, buttery mash potato for evidence.shangri-laabudhabishangrilaHakkasanIt’s not unusual for glitzy restaurant brands to put down roots in the UAE. But Hakkasan – one of the first to do so – is unique in that it’s still every bit as good as it was when it first arrived at Emirates Palace eight years ago. The menu of modern Cantonese dishes is big on luxe ingredients – think Canadian lobster, Alaskan crab and wagyu beef – but the delicate, stunningly beautiful dim sum is where the kitchen’s real craft lies.hakkasanlocationshakkasan-abu-dhabiButcher \u0026amp StillThe Four Seasons hotel brought a whole new level of luxury to the city when it opened in 2016, so it’s no surprise to find that its flagship restaurant – a 1920s-styled steakhouse – is one of the hottest tables in town.

If so, Abu Dhabi’s your placeThe United Arab Emirates has a reputation for the outlandish and the eccentric, and you’ll only need a few hours in its glitzy capital to see why. It’s hardly surprising, really: you can’t smush together centuries of Arabian tradition with oodles of international wealth – then use it to build one of the most ethnically erse, technologically ambitious cities on the planet – and expect the result to be run-of-the-mill. Looking for a break from the usual humdrum tourist itineraries? From high-speed camels to driverless cars, your hitlist starts here.Ride the world’s fastest roller coasterA veritable temple to the prancing horse, Ferrari World on Yas Island was the biggest indoor theme park on Earth when it opened in 2010. Its star attraction is Formula Rossa – a Formula One-themed ‘coaster that launches riders to a speed of 149mph in just four seconds, in the process inflicting the sort of G force that even Lewis Hamilton would describe as “a bit much”. Among other things, the park is also home to a fine-dining restaurant, which you’d do well to visit after your ride.Make tracks out to the desert for a camel raceAscot may have the upper hand when it comes to headwear, but for sheer dust-flinging excitement, a regular day at the races has nothing on the hump-backed alternative. This being Abu Dhabi, the regular meetings at Al Wathba – a short drive out of the city into the desert – are more high-tech, too, with robot jockeys taking the place of actual humans, who are relegated to riding alongside in SUVs and cheering like lunatics. Probably not how the Bedouin racers of yesteryear did it, but it’s a hell of a spectacle nonetheless.Hop aboard a driverless car in Masdar CitySomething a bit special is springing up out of the sand next to Abu Dhabi airport. Billing itself as a “greenprint” for how the sustainable cities of tomorrow will be built, Masdar City was envisaged as a 6 sq km (2.32 sq mile) district run entirely on renewable energy. This being the desert, most of the juice comes from solar power, which is used to run everything from street lights to the kitchens within the area’s growing stable of cafes and restaurants. Oh, and Masdar’s star attraction: the fleet of futuristic little driverless pods that zip visitors around the place like something out of a 90s sci-fi film.Admire the rainbow sheikh’s car collectionIt’s fair to say Sheikh Hamad bin Hamdan Al Nahyan is the petrolhead of the Emirati royal family. Set within a gleaming white pyramid just outside the city, the Emirates National Auto Museum houses the sheikh’s personal collection of cars, a fleet so vast and engine-revvingly macho it makes Jeremy Clarkson look like Jeremy Corbyn. Among the highlights are the world’s biggest pick-up truck (which has four bedrooms), a giant, driveable globe and a set of seven vintage Mercedes S-classes, one in each colour of the rainbow. Subtle? No. Spectacular? Oh yes.Clock a hot lap on an F1 trackWe’re sure the gym at your hotel is absolutely fine, but there’s a far more fun way to stay fit during your visit to Abu Dhabi. The Yas Marina Formula One race track welcomes walkers, runners, cyclists and rollerbladers on to its 5.5km (3.4 mile) grand prix circuit every Sunday and Tuesday evening (during the cooler months), and there’s even kit available to rent if you don’t fancy bringing your own. But no, sadly, they won’t let you spray rosewater from the podium if you set a new personal best.Strap on a water-powered jetpackIf you’ve ever fancied yourself as Iron-Man, flying around under your own steam, your luck is in. Thanks to the flyboard, a neat piece of kit that fires two high-pressure jets of water downwards, the wearer is able to float above the surface of the water. It’s simple enough even for watersport newbies to get to grips with in an hour-long lesson, and plenty of fun too.Experience the real Abu Dhabi.

Today, this bioerse nature reserve is best explored on a 4x4 safari with a local wildlife expert. Two-hour family-friendly safari drives (best taken early in the morning when the animals hunt for breakfast) cost approximately £100 per person and offer the chance to spot some of the island’s 10,000 free-roaming animals, including giraffe, Sudan cheetahs, hyenas and a herd of Arabian oryx. There are also richly patterned axis deer stags, gazelles and blackbuck antelope. It’s not just land activities either – the island offers a range of scuba ing and snorkelling trips to delve further into Abu Dhabi’s abundant marine life.sirbaniyasislandGo dolphin spottingAbu Dhabi’s coastal waters are home to the largest population of Indian Ocean humpback dolphins and plenty of bottlenose dolphins. Get out on the waves to see them in their natural habitat on a three-hour Dolphin Bay eco boat tour with marine biologist Arabella Willing (Saturdays, £76 per person).

Covering a vast 1,214 hectares (3,000 acres), it features a series of oasis gardens, running from the orchard garden – which is filled with fragrant scents of fig, lemon, pomegranate and olive trees – to the symbolic garden, whose moringa and frankincense trees are known for their medicinal properties.visitabudhabi.aeFeed a falconThe sport of falconry is held in very high esteem in Emirati culture, with skills being passed down through the generations. The popular Abu Dhabi Falcon Hospital is the largest falcon hospital in the world, acting almost like a regular hospital, with birds being assessed on arrival. Each year, 11,200 falcons are received for examinations and treatment. The site opens its doors twice a day for the public to tour the hospital, where they can get an insight into the work that is done there. Visitors will even get a chance to feed the falcons, and there’s a museum on site.

Any “excess energy savings” during the law’s writ would then be forwarded to the post-2020 period. MEPs have branded the plan “incomprehensible”. “This approach would risk failure in our efforts to reach even moderately ambitious overall targets, while the higher – and beneficial targets – that we need to strive for could become lost altogether.”Jávor added that it was “rude” for the UK to weaken climate measures that it would only be bound by during a transition period, before it left the bloc. Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade and climate spokesman, said: “2018 is the year when countries have been asked by the UN to ratchet up their commitments on climate change. Instead our government is actually proposing to count emissions savings made from as far back as 2010 towards fulfilling their obligations in the next decade from 2021-2030.”“This sneaky, behind-the-scenes amendment indicates a government that likes to pretend it is a global leader but will not take the strong policy action needed to deliver the necessary change.”A UK government spokesperson said: “We are asking for clarity on certain energy savings between 2010 and 2013 and agreeing these for the 2020 target. This is not about applying these energy savings post-2020. To suggest otherwise is incorrect and we continue to advocate ambitious future targets.”Any “excess energy savings” between 2014 and 2020 “may count towards the fulfilment of obligations between 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2030”, it says.The UK tried but failed to have similar loopholes added to the original directive in 2012. The Liberal-Democrat MEP, Catherine Bearder said it “gave the lie” to Michael Gove’s claims to be leading a “green revolution”. “One despairs,” she said. “In the face of Brexit, we really don’t have a leg to stand on. We’re in no position to start issuing demands. This is a carefully crafted agreement to decrease our carbon emissions and make our energy use more efficient. It is disappointing and ludicrous that we would come forward trying to water that down as we head towards the EU’s exit door.”  Europe is expected to easily achieve this, although its CO2 emissions appear to be rising as economic activity picks up, while energy efficiency gains have gone into reverse. Almost all UK environmental policy currently derives from EU law and the union’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has insisted that a ‘non-regression article’ be included in any final EU-UK agreement to prevent backsliding."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f915ef8fd0c22ff7af07eb6390b8038180c415a1/0_117_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fffdf28b33c841ece467e3c9bc4b5d44","title":"south georgia declared rat free centuries rodent devastation","story":"World’s biggest project to kill off invasive species to protect native wildlife is hailed a successThe world’s biggest project to eradicate a dangerous invasive species has been declared a success, as the remote island of South Georgia is now clear of the rats and mice that had devastated its wildlife for nearly 250 years.Rats and mice were inadvertently introduced to the island, off the southern tip of South America and close to Antarctica, by ships that stopped there, usually on whaling expeditions. The effect on native bird populations was dramatic. Unused to predators, they laid their eggs on the ground or in burrows, easily accessible to the rodents.Two species of birds unique to the island, the South Georgia pipit and pintail, were largely confined to a few tiny islands off the coast, which the rodents could not reach, and penguins and other seabird populations were also threatened.The last of the poisoned bait was dropped more than two years ago, but scientists have spent the intervening period monitoring the island for rodents. Two experienced dog handlers from New Zealand walked three dogs – named Will, Ahu and Wai – across nearly 1,550 miles (2,500km) in often extreme weather, beset by heavy rain and often fierce storms, seeking out signs of rats and mice.Only when none were found over the whole period and in every area was the project deemed a success according to international standards. The leaders of the eradication effort declared the island free of rats and mice on Wednesday, and said the air resounded with the once-rare song of the native pipit.The project was led by the South Georgia Heritage Trust, a charity set up to protect the island, and an associate organisation, the US-based Friends of South Georgia Island. The UK government also played a role, but the bulk of the funding came from private fundraising and philanthropy.Scientists hope the success could become an inspiration and model for other projects around the world to eliminate invasive species, which in the worst cases can drive native animals close to extinction.The South Georgia programme involved dropping hundreds of tonnes of poisoned bait on areas known to be infested with rodents. Harsh weather, mountainous terrain and the island’s limited accessibility made the project fraught with danger.At times, when scientists believed they had eradicated rats from one area, they returned from another nearby section of the island, meaning the poisoning regime had to begin again. Richardson paid tribute to the teams’ endurance and bravery.South Georgia, one of the UK’s numerous overseas territories, was first noted by Captain Cook in 1775 on one of his voyages of discovery. It became a stop for the hundreds of whalers which plied the southern seas, providing shelter, dry land and a meeting site for ships that may have spent weeks or months without sight of land. About 2,000 people lived on the island during whaling’s heyday, but today the main activities are centred on two scientific research stations run by the British Antarctic Survey. It was claimed for Argentina during the Falklands war, and a UK garrison was only withdrawn in 2001. The island is also known as the burial ground of the Antarctic explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton, who died there in 1922.About 100 miles long, the island covers about 350,000 hectares (865,000 acres) and much of it is covered in snow and ice. The remainder is very mountainous. Some of the coastal regions have vegetation, which has provided a haven for seabirds, and the pipits and pintails.Invasive species are one of the worst threats to bioersity around the world. When non-native species are introduced, often inadvertently but also sometimes as pets or ornamental features, they can disrupt natural ecosystems evolved over millennia to the detriment of the native species. One classic example is the grey squirrel, introduced to Europe as a novelty and which has come close to eclipsing the native red in the UK. It was thought this was mainly because the more aggressive greys outcompeted the reds for habitats and food, but more recently scientists have discovered that a virus called squirrelpox, to which the natives have little resistance, also played a leading role."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f316043573efcb83ae38674111847cc13285a400/0_0_2264_1359/master/2264.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34aef54510230c7490145c989bacca47","title":"use excess wind and solar power to produce hydrogen report","story":"With more electricity often generated than needed the excess could be utilised to generate the green power sourceGreen energy would be boosted if excess electricity from wind and solar farms was used to produce hydrogen for use in heating and other parts of the energy system, according to engineers.Renewables were the UK’s second biggest source of electricity in the last three months of 2017, and now provide about a third of the country’s power at certain times of day.National Grid has warned that at times this summer there will be more electricity being generated than needed when demand is low, solar output is high and some inflexible power stations are hard to turn off.With a significant number of large new offshore windfarms due to come online over the next few years, the challenge of balancing supply and demand will continue to grow.The Institution of Mechanical Engineers (iMechE) said the answer could be to use the power to generate hydrogen. Electricity would be used to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, with the hydrogen functioning as a form of energy storage for renewables. The gas would later be blended in with normal gas supplies for heating supplies, sent to fuel cells to generate electricity, or used for topping up hydrogen vehicles, iMechE said in a report backed by the gas industry.Dr Jenifer Baxter, the report’s lead author, said: “We are seeing continued expansion of renewables. If we’ve got a lot of low-carbon power, we want to make sure we’re using all of that.”The engineering group urged the government to bring the renewables, nuclear and gas industries together to work on “power to gas”, and encourage demonstration projects. The nuclear trade association welcomed the report.The iMechE also called for a government study into the environmental impact of lithium-batteries, which have been deployed on a large scale recently and offer an alternative way of storing energy.Last year the government gave much more backing to batteries, with the announcement of £246m for battery research and development, compared with £25m to explore using hydrogen for heating.Asked if the economics of hydrogen stacked up, Baxter said electricity was getting cheaper while electrolysers – used to split water into hydrogen and oxygen – were getting more efficient. Jim Watson, director of the UK Energy Research Centre, said the report was good but cautioned it was pushing a very pro-gas agenda on how best to decarbonise heating, when there was still a lot of debate over the most cost-effective and feasible technologies.The Oxford Institute for Energy Studies said there are not yet any obvious ways that the technologies could achieve major reductions in cost."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6244a8e7c5b502e9f16cb55cf513976c938fcb9b/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e60f0f5fd79a5181f878cd7bc7c45fb2","title":"met gala 2018 best dress code catholicism fashion","story":"This year’s theme of Catholicism in fashion was a challenge that required a leap of faith. But from Rihanna’s pope to Lena Waithe’s rainbow-flag cape, the opening night ball was a triumphIt took curator Andrew Bolton several years to convince the Vatican to give its blessing to Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination, the blockbuster show at the politan Museum in New York that explores ine inspiration in fashion. One imagines Rome’s reluctance stemmed from concern that the exhibition – and particularly the opening night gala, which has become known for its outrageous outfits – would trivialise religious imagery.It needn’t have worried. Fashion takes clothes very, very seriously. In a world in which dressing up matters and sartorial symbolism carries a very real weight, the Met Gala is the most important night of the year. Even when it looks absurd to outsiders – remember the omelette dress of 2015? – the fashion seen on the Met Gala red carpet has been considered and planned with the solemnity of a papal conclave. In their Manhattan hotel rooms, celebrities dress for this event with a level of meticulous ceremony which would befit a Sunday at St Peters.This year’s dress code was a challenge. To succeed on this red carpet required honouring the theme of Catholicism in fashion without being seen to make fun of it. What is special about the Met red carpet – by comparison, for instance, with Cannes – is that you can’t win it just by looking good. A supermodel can wear a tight dress and high heels and sail through almost every other public occasion with flying colours, but that look is a fast track to being completely ignored at the Met. You have to dig deep for this night, because Met Gala triumph requires not just beauty but bravery and a leap of faith. The Vatican would surely approve.The obvious link between the world presided over by Pope Francis and the one ruled by Queen Anna Wintour is that clothing delineates status. Rihanna attacked this theme with her signature fearlessness and blew everyone else out of the water. In the season of the first Millicent Fawcett statue and of a Christian Dior slogan T-shirt namechecking Linda Nochlin’s feminist essay “Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists”, RiRi gave us a female pope. She wore a heavily embellished mini dress under a matching cloak, accessorised with a pointed mitre, stiletto heels and pearls strung around one ankle – because, after all, there’s not always room for a rosary in a clutch bag – all created for her by John Galliano for the house of Maison Margiela. The look was a version of an ensemble designed by Galliano during his time at Christian Dior that appeared on the catwalk in 2000 worn by a man, and is included in the Met exhibition.But clothes are never only about power, either in fashion or in the church. Beauty as a metaphor for human goodness runs through the history of art, through religious iconography and through the way fashion worships at the altar of beauty and glamour. Katy Perry was a triumph in Versace. In a gold dress and boots, and with a 6ft white feathered wing, she was arguably the most breathtaking representation of the archangel Gabriel since Fra Angelico painted the Annunciation fresco in the Convent of San Marco. (And yes, I do realise how sacrilegious that is, in artistic terms.)Sienna Miller in gold and white Louis Vuitton was also ine as another Renaissance angel on the red carpet.The transactional business of fashion is a multimillion-pound industry precisely because it taps into powerful emotions and desires. Fashion deliberately blurs the boundaries between things that you have the power to change and the things you don’t. (You can buy the perfect party dress, but you can’t actually buy romance or joy or fun.) Religious imagery has long employed the same porous boundaries, conjuring the invisible into life. The word halo – an accessory seen last night on Solange Knowles in Iris Van Herpen and Lily Collins in Givenchy, among others – means glory. And the aesthetic of papal garments has roots in worldly power, as well as spiritual. When the Emperor Constantine moved his capital east to Constantinople and allowed the pontiffs to assume control the old capital, Rome, they incorporated some of the clothing and accessories worn by the Roman emperors who had ruled before them, the better to legitimise their power in the eyes of the people of Rome.Like all the best dress codes, the Met Gala invitation allowed for lots of iniduality. Frances McDormand consolidated her role as 2018’s designated maverick by coming as “a pagan”, she said on the red carpet, in her Valentino butterfly headdress. Those actors who have pledged vows to fashion houses (or at least, signed contracts with them) showed their constancy with looks that mined clerical robes for the most this-season silhouette. A clear winner on this is the mozzetta, a short shoulder-covering robe worn by the pope and cardinals and, last night, by a very chic Alicia Vikander in Louis Vuitton. Kate Moss wore a black dress with a feathered black neckline that nodded to the dress code with a fallen-angel vibe – this was her first appearance in the US since 2009, and there was speculation that the prolonged absence was due to difficulty procuring a visa after the drug scandal of 2005 – but mainly referenced herself. Moss in a black feather trim dress, with Johnny Depp at Cannes, and a messy bun, is a late-1990s fashion reference the fashion faithful will immediately recognise.Best red-carpet quote of the night, though, goes to the actor Lena Waithe, who wore a rainbow flag cape to spotlight the Catholic church’s complicated relationship with the LGBTQ community. “The theme to me is, like, be yourself,” she told the New York Times on the red carpet. “You were made in God’s image, right?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52ca83df70a4437839922a36439e22b801a4e8dc/0_244_4056_2435/master/4056.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=646ed41f7d3f9dcca07f7db8a9d764a6","title":"met gala 2018 pageantry and performance on the red carpet in pictures","story":"The 70th annual Met Ball was themed Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic ImaginationElon Musk is dating Grimes – plus four other things we learned at Met Gala 2018"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09e0a9a96f9233e3f77090ecd4cc410fd48d29ec/0_390_3728_2236/master/3728.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83fd67a7881dd316ceb6c4ba862d32e9","title":"roman polanski calls metoo movement mass hysteria","story":"Director who won Academy award for Rosemary’s Baby dismisses MeToo movement as ‘mass hysteria’ and ‘hypocrisy’Roman Polanski is suing the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences after being expelled from the organisation last week.In a letter to the academy, Polanski’s lawyer, Harland Braun, said it failed to follow its own rules or California law by not allowing Polanski a chance to defend himself. “We are not here contesting the merits of the expulsion decision, but rather your organisation’s blatant disregard of its own standards of conduct in, as well as its violations of the standards required by California corporations code,” Braun wrote, according to the Los Angeles Times.The 84-year-old Oscar-winning director of Rosemary’s Baby was last week expelled from the academy along with the actor Bill Cosby in light of sexual assault cases against both men.Polanski dismissed the \u001dMeToo movement as “mass hysteria” and “hypocrisy” in a Polish interview carried out before he was expelled from the Oscars academy.Asked what he thinks of the movie industry’s recent reckoning with sexual harassment, Polanski told this week’s edition of Newsweek Polska: “I think this is the kind of mass hysteria that occurs in society from time to time.“Sometimes it’s very dramatic, like the French Revolution or the St Bartholomew’s Day massacre in France, or sometimes it’s less bloody, like 1968 in Poland or McCarthyism in the US..“Everyone is trying to back this movement, mainly out of fear … I think it’s total hypocrisy.”Polanski, a dual Polish and French citizen who lives in France, is wanted in the US for the 1977 rape of Samantha Geimer. He has for years sought to negotiate a deal in the case with US authorities.Geimer, who has said in the past that she has forgiven Polanski, dismissed the Academy’s move to expel him as “an ugly and cruel action which serves only appearance”.Polanski himself called the decision last week “the height of hypocrisy”, according to his lawyer Jan Olszewski.Olszewski added that comparing Polanski to Bill Cosby, who was also expelled from the Academy for sexual assault, was “a total misunderstanding and harassment”.The expulsions came as Hollywood reels from the assault allegations against disgraced film mogul Harvey Weinstein, which prompted an international uproar and encouraged legions of women to share their own experience of sexual harassment or rape under the hashtag \u001dMeToo."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0bee0fc91841901f593c05a2a2d6af5e22c8d68b/0_0_3300_1980/master/3300.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf85591b0c6988fb17f8e0424c24d5ed","title":"southampton mark hughes dark arts swansea","story":"• Saints’ booking at Swansea hotel cancelled at short notice • Squad decided to walk into stadium after being kept on busMark Hughes believes “dark arts” were at work at Swansea, where Manolo Gabbiadini’s second-half goal gave Southampton a hugely significant victory that takes them to the verge of Premier League safety. Gabbiadini’s goal relegated West Brom in the process and also leaves Swansea on the brink of losing their Premier League status.Although Hughes tried to play down the wild celebrations at the end and made the point that Southampton are not mathematically safe, it would need a nine-goal swing for his team to be relegated on the final day at the expense of Swansea, who are three points behind them. Swansea’s survival hopes rest more on beating Stoke on Sunday and hoping Huddersfield lose their remaining two fixtures, against Chelsea on Wednesday and Arsenal on the final day.“I think those celebrations shouldn’t be misinterpreted, they were just emotion as a consequence of winning this key game,” Hughes said. “We weren’t celebrating staying up because there is still an issue to be resolved in that regard. There’s a little bit of a cushion but we’re playing Manchester City and if there is one team in this league that we know has the capability of scoring a lot of goals, then it’s Man City. We’ve done what we needed to do tonight but clearly there is still work to do.”Southampton were bitterly upset about a couple of events before the game. They were prevented from staying at the Marriott Hotel in Swansea after their booking was cancelled at short notice and there was more confusion when they arrived at the Liberty Stadium to be told they would have to wait for their opponents to get off their bus first.“I’m not for one minute suggesting Swansea had anything to do with that,” said Hughes, referring to the accommodation problems. “It’s just maybe over-zealous Swansea fans in positions to affect our hotel booking. But those things you can use to your own benefit and use as a motivating factor. We got held up a little bit outside as well because we were first here on the coach and apparently we were supposed to wait for Swansea but we weren’t going to do that. We were too focused, we got off the bus and walked the 100 yards into the ground. So we weren’t going to be denied and messed about. A point was made.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ff486d3d122420bd5bfbcb41875a3cc99075ef2/0_57_3256_1953/master/3256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d098e26e0d5ca1ec92b977b286a42352","title":"swansea city southampton premier league match report","story":"A night of drama and tension ended with Southampton all but securing their Premier League status for another season, Swansea City staring relegation in the face and West Brom joining Stoke City in the Championship next season. Manolo Gabbiadini was the player who set that chain of events in motion with a goal that was scrappy and untidy but worth its weight in gold to Mark Hughes and his players.“We are staying up,” chanted the Southampton fans as the players joined hands to celebrate in front of them at the final whistle. Hughes was as pumped up as anyone as he strode on to the pitch without shaking hands with Carlos Carvalhal, clenching his fist and embracing the players who have taken Saints to the verge of safety.Swansea were crestfallen. They are three points adrift with only one game left and will need to beat Stoke at home on Sunday and hope Huddersfield lose their final two fixtures, against Chelsea and Arsenal, to have any chance of staying up. On this evidence there is little chance of Swansea keeping their side of that bargain.The Carvalhal revival has crashed and burned. Swansea have failed to win in nine matches and this was the eighth home game of the season in which they have not scored. They are toothless in attack and Carvalhal’s negative approach over the last couple of months – he has become obsessed with playing five at the back – has done nothing to help their cause.Hughes read the script in that respect. Southampton sat deep initially, defending in numbers, and effectively asked Swansea to break them down. As has been the case so often Swansea struggled to do so, and there was always a feeling Southampton had the wherewithal to punish them at the other end, especially when they started to attack with more conviction after the break.The goal arrived in the 72nd minute and it was a desperately poor one to concede. Dusan Tadic’s corner was headed back across goal by the unmarked Shane Long, it was flicked on again by Oriol Romeu and although Lukasz Fabianski managed to keep out Charlie Austin’s shot, Gabbiadini was perfectly positioned to sweep home from inside the six-yard box four minutes after coming on.Hughes said he had always planned to introduce Gabbiadini at some stage, and the Southampton manager made it clear he had felt this was a must-win game because Saints face Manchester City on the final day.A heavy defeat against City and an emphatic Swansea win could still see Hughes’s team relegated in theory, yet nobody can realistically expect a nine-goal swing in the respective fixtures.For Hughes, victory was particularly sweet because of some of the shenanigans that went on before the game. The Swansea hotel Southampton planned to stay in was cancelled at short notice on Sunday, forcing Hughes and his players to find alternative accommodation in Cardiff, and there was more frustration for the visitors when they arrived at the Liberty Stadium and were told they would have to wait on the bus.Hughes had had enough at that point and instructed his players to leave the team coach and walk the 100 yards or so to the entrance.Although the atmosphere crackled inside the Liberty Stadium in the early stages the game was something of a slowburner. Swansea had plenty of possession and tried to dictate the tempo but they created little going forward.Andy King’s low drive was comfortably saved by Alex McCarthy and Sam Clucas’s glancing header fell the wrong side of the far upright but that was the sum total of Swansea’s threat before the interval and it was difficult to know what opportunities Carvalhal was referring to afterwards when he talked about his team creating plenty of chances.Swansea’s best moment came at the start of the second half and that was down to a piece of inidual inspiration from Jordan Ayew. Twisting and turning to wriggle clear of a couple of Southampton players, Ayew cut inside and unleashed a 25-yard dipping shot that looked to be arcing into the top corner until Alex McCarthy, stretching every sinew, got a hand to the ball to superbly flick it over the bar.Southampton were starting to look more and more menacing. Austin had forced Fabianski to make two saves before half-time and another couple of attempts from the same player highlighted the visitors’ growing threat.Desperate for a goal, Carvalhal introduced Tammy Abraham, but it was the change made by Hughes that did the trick as Gabbiadini, who has endured a difficult season, joined Long and Austin in a three-pronged attack.All three were involved in that defining moment and, although it will never make a contender for goal of the season, it could well go down as the most important."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8102571e07b086901e59f3a2cf207653c0b1efb/42_72_1850_1110/master/1850.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3c1c6d0cbb9010691424bb462116318","title":"football transfer rumours arsene wenger sam allardyce everton","story":"Everton have sensationally lined up Arsène Wenger as Sam “1110” Allardyce’s replacement. One pint of wine for Monsieur Arsène please! Actually, though, the Mill has a better idea: job share. Allardyce and Wenger together at last, working in tandem, just like Gérard Houllier and Roy Evans, only with genuine mutual antipathy. Wenger could sarcastically call himself Big Arsène, while Allardyce could answer every question with: “Look, in today’s society”. The Mill gives it no more than three months, with the end coming when Allardyce refers to Wenger as assistant to the senior manager after a 10-0 defeat to Chelsea, but it would probably be the greatest time of our lives.Unfortunately Everton might have other ideas. Wenger is a long shot, after all, and it would be foolish for them not to have an alternative. Porto’s Sérgio Conceição is another option to replace Allardyce, whose final act at Goodison Park could be to push Wayne Rooney out of the door. Wazziesta’s representatives have been talking to DC United and the former England captain could move to America when the MLS transfer window opens on 10 July. Bradley Wright-Phillips would finally have a worthy rival.Now that Yaya Touré has knocked Manchester United off their effing perch – to paraphrase his line in today’s papers – the Ivorian can think about his next move. Burnley, Everton and Wolves are all interested in signing the Manchester City midfielder on a free. Wolves also want Milan’s André Silva, although the 22-year-old striker is also a target for Monaco, who could send Falcao to the San Siro in return.Manchester City want a new winger. Deep breath: they’ve lined up Leicester’s Riyad Mahrez, Bayer Leverkusen’s Leon Bailey, Ajax’s Justin Klluivert, Chelsea’s Eden Hazard, Borussia Dortmund’s Christian Pulisic and Sporting Lisbon’s Gelson Martins. But United are also eyeing Pulisic and could include Anthony Martial as part of a deal for the Dortmund winger. Even though José Mourinho totally loves Martial and would like nothing more than to see the forward flourish under his patient, caring tutelage.Mohamed Salah has had a couple of iffy games, so Liverpool have decided he’s yesterday’s man. Jürgen Klopp has met Lyon’s Nabil Fekir, who could move to Anfield for £61.5m.Newcastle fancy Craig Dawson for £15m now that West Brom are down.

The four Ethiopian boys pause for breath and refreshment beside the road, grasping their plastic water bottles tightly as they sip, careful not to waste a drop. The Djiboutian sun is still low in the sky but the road is already hot. They have more than 200km left to walk and their plastic sandals are disintegrating.Badru and friends are from Jimma, a poor farming district in Ethiopia’s Oromia region. Over the past fortnight they have travelled more than 1,000km from their homes, first on buses and then later on foot, jumping the border into neighbouring Djibouti under the cover of darkness. When the group gathered in Dire Dawa, a town in the arid drylands of eastern Ethiopia a couple of hundred kilometres from the border, there were 20 of them. “Most are left in the desert,” says Badru wearily. “They are very tired. I don’t think they can follow us.”Many do not make it. The numbers that die in the Djiboutian desert are unknown but there are enough unburied dead to contaminate the water supply. Ethiopians walking along the road north to Obock told the  that friends had perished en route. Another group of three, also from Jimma, say they had no food for the duration of the six-day walk from Dire Dawa. Seven of their companions were left in the desert some got lost, they say, but one they watched die. “We’ve had no help from anyone,” says the youngest, a 10-year-old orphan.The journey across the Bab el-Mandeb strait to Yemen is also perilous. One recent estimate put the numbers who have died making the crossing over the past decade at close to 3,000. The boats organised by smugglers are old, rickety and often overcrowded. Few Ethiopians can swim but the vessels, which depart at night in order to avoid detection, usually hover 20m or so away from the shore, which can be fatal for those clambering aboard.The anarchy in Yemen brings a welter of dangers. In January at least 30 people drowned when their migrant boat capsized, with reports of gunfire being used against those on board. In March 2017, a helicopter opened fire on a vessel carrying more than 140 migrants, killing 42 Somalis. Those who make it to shore then face multiple threats. UNHCR has catalogued reports of physical and sexual abuse, abduction, extortion, torture and forced labour by smugglers and criminal networks. “Only a very small minority make it to Saudi Arabia without facing at least one incident of abuse,” says Danielle Botti of the regional mixed migration secretariat (RMMS), which monitors movements between the Horn of Africa and Yemen.Those who survive remain vulnerable. Some are deported straight back to Yemen rather than home, in violation of international law. Some have their passports taken away by their employers, which is against international labour conventions. Francesco Martialis, head of Caritas, which works with street children in Djibouti, recounts the story of a 15-year-old who had fled life as a slave in Saudi Arabia. He had been beaten, his skull cracked, leaving him with amnesia. Unable to remember his family or his home, he had walked hundreds of kilometres alone along the road from Obock to Djibouti City, in the country’s south, before being picked up by police.Young Ethiopians in Obock are either unaware or unfazed by the dangers awaiting across the sea. Around 250 have set up makeshift homes under acacia trees and in caves beneath the cliffs near the rubbish-strewn village of Fantahero. “So what?” asks Hassen, a 20-year-old teacher from Wollo region. “That’s the life of the Ethiopian people.” His companion, Murad, 18, agrees: “We fear Ethiopia more than the war in Yemen.”Many cite persecution and violence as reasons for fleeing. Oromos, the country’s largest ethnic group, complain of marginalisation for more than three years anti-government protests and deadly confrontations with security forces have plagued the region. “I quit my schooling and came here,” says Mohammed, a 17-year-old from Arsi in southern Oromia. “I was a ninth-grade student. But when I saw youths like myself being arrested and thrown in jail I decided to leave. I was afraid of being arrested too.”But for most, poverty is the biggest grievance. “I’m going to Yemen because I need work,” says Hassen. “There’s nothing in Ethiopia. I have a job but it is too expensive there – 2,000 birr (£53) a month? That is not enough! In Saudi Arabia I will get 10,000 birr a month.”Three days earlier, police had arrived in Fantahero and loaded many of the boys into trucks to deposit at the Ethiopian border. But on the whole the migrants are tolerated. Obock locals have done well out of smuggling and a journey that costs somewhere between $300 and $500 (£221-£368) per person. “Nobody will control it,” says Momina Ahmed, a French-Djiboutian who grew up in the town. “All the locals, including the authorities, are profiting.”An IOM transit centre in Obock, across the road from a UNHCR camp for Yemeni refugees fleeing in other direction, is one of the few institutions available for people who want to return to Ethiopia. It assists with voluntary returns, but it can take in only around 250 at any one time. Mohammed, the schoolboy from Arsi, says he is one of the few in Fantahero to get cold feet, but that the centre was full when he visited earlier in the day.Elsewhere in Djibouti, facilities are even more scarce. Mobile health patrols started work only late last year. There are plans to build a humanitarian shelter at Lake Assal, near where the desert hits the coast. There is only one shelter in Djibouti City for migrant children, Caritas, and it is prohibited from providing beds at night.Few will return home without something to show for their efforts. “If it is the will of Allah to improve my life, then maybe one day I will return to Ethiopia,” Badru says fatalistically. Just as he speaks a police truck pulls round the corner. Within moments, the four boys have been ushered into the back by armed police officers, their long, hard journey cut suddenly short."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2377d8d555a9c62d470b1be2a534c593c766806/0_54_1024_614/master/1024.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4dfb81e3b21a880dc7467a2b6475ecce","title":"cameroon president biya 35 years podcast small changes akere muna","story":"Despite never having held political office, lawyer Akere Muna is on a mission to fight corruption by standing for election as Cameroon’s leader"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf46f4f4310ad2771fd5e41f58d5b4fac40da6d4/0_477_2385_1431/master/2385.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a76b1eccc18a98e43d38582886031e05","title":"six of the best party snacks","story":"Elevate the nibbles for your next do by whipping up salt cod fritters, pork hand pies or shrimp and caper bunsFor the pastry175g butter, diced200g plain flour, plus extra for dusting2 tsp grated parmesan1 egg yolk15ml ice-cold water1 tsp saltFor the fillingJuice of 1 lemon100ml olive oilSalt and black pepper1 fennel bulb, finely diced 20g dill (or fennel top), chopped300g white crab meat150g brown crab meat10g parsley, chopped 1 pinch cayenne pepperHeat the oven to 200C390Fgas 6.

Turn on the mixer and add the warm milk to the flour until well mixed. Knead in the machine until you have a shiny dough. Cover the bowl with clingfilm and put in a warm place to prove until doubled in size – one to two hours. Dust a work surface with flour and split the dough into 12 equal pieces, roll into balls and place on a greaseproof tray, cover with clingfilm and leave to double again in size. When ready, bake for 10-15 minutes, until golden brown.To make the filling, boil the eggs for seven minutes and rinse under cold water. Peel the eggs and chop finely, then add the shrimp, capers, mayonnaise and tarragon, mix well, and season to taste. To serve, split and butter the buns and fill with the egg and shrimp.For the flatbreads2½ tsp dried yeast700ml warm water120g yoghurt250g wholemeal bread flour600g bread flour1 tbsp saltOlive oil, for brushingFor the topping5 ripe tomatoes1 tsp capers100ml olive oil Juice and zest of ½ lemon½ bunch parsley, choppedSalt and black pepper1 tin anchovy fillets in oilCelery leaves (optional)In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast in the warm water, then add the yoghurt. Add the flours, and salt, then mix with your fingertips until a dough forms. Cover the bowl with clingfilm and leave to rise at room temperature.After an hour, knead the dough until it comes away from the sides of the bowl. If it looks a little wet, add a bit of flour.

Put the flour and salt in a bowl. Put the water, milk and butter in a saucepan and bring to a boil. As soon as it boils, turn off the heat. Tip in the flour and quickly start beating with a wooden spoon or electric whisk. Keep mixing until the dough is lump-free and has formed a ball that pulls away from the sides of the pan.Beat the eggs in a separate bowl and add to the dough a little at a time, beating well until fully incorporated. When it is ready, the mixture will be shiny and smooth.Put all the other ingredients in a bowl and slowly combine with the choux batter.Heat the oil in a large, deep saucepan to 180C350F. Using a tablespoon, add small dollops of the fritter mixture to the hot oil in small batches.Fry until deep brown, turning occasionally so they cook evenly.

Add the spices, garlic and cider, and reduce until the liquid evaporates, then set aside to cool.Put the pork, bacon, herbs and onion mixture in a bowl, season and mix well.Roll out the pastry to about 3mm thick. Using an 11-12cm cutter, cut out 12 rounds for the pie bases. Then, using a 6-7cm cutter, cut out 12 lids. Line a 12-hole muffin tin with the pie bases, shaping the pastry to fit the sides – it should come slightly above the rim of each mould.Put a heaped tablespoon of the filling into each case. Mix together the beaten egg and the double cream to make an egg wash, then brush the rims with the wash and top the pies with the lids. Crimp the edges and brush the tops with more egg. Prick holes in the top of the lids with a fork, then bake for 40-50 minutes, until golden brown.To make the quince mustard, mix the mustard with the quince paste and serve with the pork pies.For the crackers150g rye flour150g plain flour5g dried yeast2 tsp salt1½ tsp linseeds300ml warm waterFor the topping500g swiss chard200g peas1 garlic clove, peeled and thinly sliced5g dried chilli10g mint, chopped10ml olive oil150g goat’s curd50ml milkJuice and zest of ½ lemonHeat the oven to 180C350Fgas 4.

Chuka Umunna, the Labour MP who co-chairs a pro-European Commons committee with Conservative Anna Soubry, said the leadership would now have to come off the fence and make it clear where it stood. “The time for constructive ambiguity is over: our members and our voters will be delighted with this clear signal that we will not go along with this Tory Brexit,” he said.The vote came hours after Boris Johnson called the prime minister’s proposal for a customs partnership “crazy” in an interview with the Daily Mail that dealt a major blow to the government’s strategy of a cautious balance between leave and remain. Johnson was the subject of fierce criticism from within Tory ranks all day. In the Lords debate the former Tory MP Patrick Cormack asked: “What sort of example are we being given by a cabinet that is rent asunder by the foreign secretary, the second most important cabinet minister, rubbishing the prime minister in the columns of the Daily Mail?”On the key EEA amendment, Labour peers were whipped to abstain. But 83 defied the whip to back the amendment, including a former party leader, many former ministers and a former chief whip. Seventeen Conservatives also backed the amendment.It was the third defeat of the afternoon for the government and an unexpected triumph for a cross-party group that included Waheed Alli for Labour, the Conservative peer Sandip Verma and the crossbench peer Karan Bilimoria.All the amendments to the bill that have been passed in the Lords will have to be considered and voted on by MPs when the bill returns to the Commons, perhaps as soon as next week. Lord Alli told the House that continued membership of the EEA was vital to ensure the future profitability of the UK’s export business and the jobs and livelihoods of many thousands of people. “It is the EEA that deals with services, services like retail, tourism, transport, communications, financial services and aerospace where we have a £14bn trade surplus,” he said.“The customs union only will benefit our European neighbours in their imports and without an EEA equivalent it will damage our profitable export business.” In a rowdy and sometimes ill-tempered debate peers, many of whom had been debating the EU for the past 30 years, argued passionately for and against EEA membership.Officially Labour opposed the Alli amendment because other amendments gave MPs a role in the negotiations. But the leadership will now have to face the tension between its strongly pro-remain rank and file membership, its largely pro-remain MPs and the policy consequences of remaining in any arrangement with Europe such as the EEA, which limits its plans for greater state involvement in the economy.The Tories are now likely to try to brand Labour as the party of free movement, which is one of the obligations of EEA membership. The threat of higher EU migration is likely to alarm Labour voters in some parts of the country. A Department for Exiting the European Union spokesperson said: “The referendum was a vote to take control of our borders, laws and money. Ongoing participation in the EEA would mean having to implement new EU legislation automatically and in its entirety without having a say on how it is formulated – and it would also mean continued free movement. We will now consider the implications of this decision.”Peter Mandelson, the former trade secretary and one-time EU trade commissioner, said ministers were perpetrating a “Brexit fraud’ by pretending that migration from the EU, which would continue under membership of the EEA, would end after the UK left.“The time has come for economic reality and commonsense to prevail over wishful thinking and political dogma,” he said. “This gives us the opportunity to do the right thing for the country and in my view that is what we have a duty to do.”The EEA offers most of the benefits of the single market, without being subject to the European court of justice. It does not cover the common agriculture or fisheries policies. Earlier, peers voted to remove the EU exit date of 29 March 2019 from the withdrawal bill, warning that it would be a straitjacket for negotiators. The Duke of Wellington, Charles Wellesley, who moved the amendment, insisted he was not trying to undermine the result of the referendum by delaying or averting Brexit.“We should give ministers a bit more flexibility to secure and obtain ratification of the best possible deal, which will do the least damage to the economy and the national interest,” he said.The government also lost another vote on an amendment seeking to protect UK membership of EU agencies such as Euratom. The Labour leader in the Lords, Angela Smith, said it was an opportunity for the Commons to think again.“The House of Lords amendment is not about stopping Brexit but the fine print of when and how the agreements are concluded,” she said.The defeats came on the final day of debate on the report stage of the bill in the Lords. Peers are due to send it back to the Commons at the end of the week, and the government hopes it will be on the statute book before the end of May. The government has been forced to make concessions, as well as losing a dozen votes during the debates, in a series of amendments that have often had cross-party support.The amendments have been ided between trying to preserve benefits of EU membership, such as workers rights, and other fundamental rights through the incorporation of the EU’s charter of fundamental rights, which has a broader reach than the UK Human Rights Act.Others were intended to promote the place of parliament at the heart of the process of leaving the EU, including clarifying the significance and consequences of the “meaningful vote” on any Brexit deal. And some were more narrowly technical, intended to restrict ministerial powers to change laws without proper parliamentary process and debate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6ff13a2c3d2f01bdc9ed8a0224787ec937cce31/0_143_4669_2801/master/4669.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b10fb484062d4d356db0d927af4f7c1f","title":"eamonn magee boxer bullet ira sectarianism world champion","story":"The former world champion boxer’s epic life has been scarred by sectarianism and alcoholism. But he insists he would not change a thing‘I’ve had a beautiful wee life,” Eamonn Magee says soon after he has opened the front door in his dressing gown and cracked open his first beer of the day just after 11 on a Monday morning. The former boxer, who knocked down Ricky Hatton in 2002 and was a world champion when he won the WBU welterweight title, is cut and bruised from being attacked the night before.Magee’s left hand is also swollen with an obviously broken finger making him wince whenever it brushes against his can of Carling. Such pain, however, is fleeting compared with the deeper hurt that runs through him in Ardoyne, the tough Republican enclave of Belfast, where Magee’s life has been scarred by violent sectarianism, tragedy and alcoholism.“I wouldn’t change a thing,” Magee says as he takes another slug of warm beer. His battered, 46‑year‑old face crinkles and the lump under his left eye looks even more like a purple mouse as he echoes: “I’ve still had a wee beautiful life.”Magee is in trouble again because he and the writer Paul Gibson have produced a raw and riveting book which opens like this: “A book? Listen, I’ve been beaten with baseball bats, I’ve had my throat slashed, I’ve been kidnapped and exiled out of the country. I’ve been shot twice, I’ve been in prison and my son’s just been stabbed to death. Amongst all that, I was the welterweight champion of the world while drinking the bar dry and doing enough coke to kill a small horse every night. My life’s not a book. It’s a fucking movie script.”The book has caused strife and he says he has been attacked on successive nights in Ardoyne. Exception has been taken to Magee detailing many horrendous incidents, stretching from Republican politics and sectarian violence to drink and drugs, and he shakes his head when I ask how he is feeling. “It’s more embarrassing when I’m fighting,” he says softly, licking his cracked lips. “Last night I was even talking to him while defending myself. I’m punching him and saying: ‘Fuck sake, what’s this about?’”Magee waves his bust hand at me. “Who do you think came out the better?”Will Magee return to the gym? “I’m busy this week but back next Monday,” he says, defiantly.Could someone really walk in and shoot him? “What’s keeping them?” Magee says with a dark chuckle. “It’s not as if they don’t know where I live.”I had felt calm when I took the call which told me about Magee’s latest scrap. My mood remained the same in the cab rumbling through the familiar streets of Belfast, passing the old Republican murals and the high Peace Walls which still separate Catholic and Protestant communities. I even felt OK when, after I rang the bell, two pit bulls next door leapt at the fence, barking fiercely. “They’re wee nippers,” their owner warned as he pulled the dogs away.Yet it’s hard to feel serene now. Each time Magee’s phone interrupts us, with its Who Let The Dogs Out? ringtone, I scan his beaten-up face, wondering if it’s a call to tell him a paramilitary gunman is on his way. I don’t feel too hopeful at the prospect of Magee, in his dressing gown, and I talking our way out of trouble.“Why the hell would you want to shoot me?” Magee asks. “I didn’t do anything wrong.”As a way of changing the subject I point to his beer. He has been drinking since he was nine and the book makes clear he is a high‑functioning alcoholic but does he ever wish he could kick the bottle?“I tried rehab,” he eventually says, pausing again with comic timing before breaking into the Amy Winehouse song. “And I said, ‘No, no, no!’”I can’t help laughing with him before Magee continues. “I really did go to rehab and the only thing that fucked me up was that you’re not allowed TV. Not having TV was worse than no drink. You’re better off doing six months in jail.”Beneath all his scars the internal wounds have not healed. Magee tells a chilling story of how, during internment raids in the 1970s, he and his three brothers would be turned out of the two beds they shared. British soldiers marched them downstairs and they had to kneel, hands behind their heads, while their photographs were taken for no apparent reason.“Oh fuck, where are we starting?” Magee says as he remembers the impact that internment, detention without trial, had on Catholic families in the Troubles. “My dad was a through‑and‑through Republican and had a proper understanding of what the war was about. It wasn’t about bothering Protestants. The war was against the British army in Ireland. But my dad was a smashing man. The Brits imprisoned him in Long Kesh and the Irish Republicans had a bus run because in them days people couldn’t afford anything else. So we would take the bus up to Long Kesh. I was a wee nuisance and carried in letters which we’d written on cigarette papers. I folded them and hid them under my tongue.”Magee opens his mouth to show me how he did it but, sitting in his dead father’s house, I’m upset by his memory of how, once his dad had fallen out with the IRA and been banished to England, he snuck back into Ardoyne and was hidden away in his attic. Magee, his mum, Isobel, and his brothers lived in fear of his dad being discovered. They hid him in the attic for 18 months – which contributed to Magee Sr’s acute depression and alcoholism.“I didn’t get over that,” Magee says. “My mum would have a wee drink and dad would sit in there all night. I’d go in and slip him a tin or a fag. Nobody ever knew he was there.”Later, when Magee had become one of the most accomplished amateur boxers in Ireland, his father saved his career. Magee had joined the IRA’s youth wing because he loved the mayhem of rioting but he also began taking and dealing drugs. An IRA punishment shooting usually entailed being shot in the kneecap or worse but his dad reminded the paramilitaries that Eamonn was fighting in the Irish championships.“If my dad hadn’t stepped in they were talking about me getting the six-pack – elbows, knees and ankle. But my father convinced them to only give me one bullet.”How did Magee feel waiting for the knock on the door before he took a bullet in his calf? He shrugs. “It had to be dealt with. I knew it was going to be a flesh wound so hurry the fuck up. When he took me down an alleyway I asked: ‘What it’s like getting shot?’ He said: ‘Like a hot poker going in your leg.’”Who Let The Dogs Out? thumps again on cue. Magee shuts down his phone and I say it’s incredible he still won the national title a few months later. “I won but there was blood streaming down my leg from the gunshot wound.”Magee is a hard and sometimes violent man but between the ropes he was a slick southpaw who boxed with artistry. “I never bullied anybody in my life, so you can rephrase that,” he says quietly when I mention his violent infamy. “I went to the gym because I’m the baby of four and my brothers all were boxers. After a couple of years I’d see wee openings. Bing, bang. Soon as I started learning how to hit him before he hits me it was a hell of a lot easier.”Magee’s best year in the ring was in 2002 when he knocked out Jon Thaxton, a very good pro, to secure a crack at Hatton’s WBU light-welterweight title. He still drank six beers every Saturday night while training. “It was a wee prize at the end of the week but I was well prepared for Thaxton. With the Hatton camp, life was a party.”He would drive around town late at night, visiting bars and clubs, with Magee v Hatton logos splashed across his Range Rover. Three senior IRA men paid him a visit. “I don’t know why they gave me another warning. I wasn’t doing anything wrong apart from drinking and driving – and that’s nothing to do with the IRA. They told me to concentrate on training and stop partying. The main guy shook my hand and said: ‘Best of luck when you fight Ricky.’”It clearly worked in the Hatton fight because, in round one, Magee knocked down his celebrated opponent. “It was the worst punch I ever threw because I landed it after 40 seconds. Bam! But he’s 10 years my junior so of course he’s getting up when still so fresh. I wish I’d landed that punch later.”Hatton sealed a close decision but Magee won the vacant WBU welterweight title by beating a journeyman in Jimmy Vincent in December 2003. He retained his world title until May 2006 but he only had two fights in that troubled time. Magee had fallen out with a respected figure in Republican circles and, in a gruesome attack in 2004, his left leg was clubbed to a pulp. He suffered a compound fracture of his tibia and fibia, a shattered knee, and a punctured lung. They called him the Miracle Man when he returned to the ring.Magee’s legs stick out of his dressing gown and the lumps and scars provide graphic proof of that terrible beating. “It still gives me pain,” he says, balancing a beer on his knee as he studies his left leg. “The doctor thought I’d never walk again but I was in the gym a year later.”I suggest we leave the house and go for a walk around Magee’s neighbourhood. Rather than waiting inside for a knock on the door, we will be less exposed to any stray visitors. Magee agrees but, first, we remember his son who was stabbed to death in May 2015 – by the jealous ex-husband of his girlfriend. Eamonn Jr was so different to him, studying engineering at university while also boxing, and the grief becomes too much. Magee starts to cry, a muffled ache falling from his mouth as tears roll down his face.I say how sorry I am and Magee squeezes my hand only to curse the pain in his broken finger, before wiping his eyes. We talk about his book and, of the title, he says: “The Lost Soul was beautiful. My mother called me a lost soul and she was right.”Magee goes upstairs to get dressed. When he returns, wearing a hat straight out of Peaky Blinders, he almost looks dapper. The old fighter sinks the dregs of his beer. We walk outside and Magee takes me on a tour of the murals. Afterwards he hugs me in the street, calling me a gentleman and a scholar, even if I can’t stay for a lunchtime drink. Magee lifts his broken hand in a stately wave as my taxi drives away. I check my recording in the back of the cab and Magee’s ghostly voice echoes again as we drive through Belfast: “I’ve seen things not many people have seen but if they hadn’t happened I wouldn’t be the man I am today. So I wouldn’t change a thing. I’m more than happy with my wee life.”The Lost Soul of Eamonn Magee by Paul Gibson is available at www.bookshop"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec2cfb7e007b11dd4bbe80818f2fde3da632bf78/0_98_3488_2094/master/3488.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a737bf61c99e9dbd710ffc9c8626b07","title":"the hundred ecb pca players approval","story":"• PCA holds meetings with governing body over new competition• Union remains ‘open-minded’ despite lack of clarity over rulesThe Professional Cricketers’ Association has warned that The Hundred will not go ahead without the players on board as concerns over its quirky format, the move away from Twenty20 and the impact on women’s cricket rumble on.Representatives from the players’ union met the England and Wales Cricket Board at Edgbaston on Tuesday to discuss the quickfire 100-ball format. It will start in 2020 and feature two-and-a-half-hour matches played by eight city teams at the height of summer.Daryl Mitchell, the PCA chairman, left the meeting with Tom Harrison, the ECB chief executive, and Sanjay Patel, the tournament’s managing director, assured that, despite some past secrecy, the views of the country’s 420 professional players will be central to its creation.Asked what it would take for the 100-ball format not to go ahead, Mitchell said: “Judging by the information about other stakeholders, probably the players saying they don’t want it. We have the power to do that but whether it does happen or not, I’m not sure.“There is no competition without any players, is there? As a union, we would have to feel very strongly to go completely against it.”Though Mitchell insisted the PCA would remain “open-minded”, he outlined issues regarding a lack of detail over the playing regulations – chiefly the 10-ball over – and disappointment that despite the continuation of the 18-county Blast, the new tournament will not be Twenty20.The ECB told the meeting the move to a 100-ball innings was not down to broadcast demands but market research that, despite not being shared on the day, shows the desired “new audience” want a shorter game that is more family-friendly.The PCA representatives, who included players from all 18 counties, plus Tammy Beaumont and Jonny Bairstow from the England women and men’s teams, told the ECB they do not want the County Championship to be played at the same time as the new tournament. Mitchell said the championship remains “the pinnacle” of the domestic game for the players.The women’s version of The Hundred will, unlike the men’s game, result in the Kia Super League being replaced and thus not mirror the international game. Mitchell said: “There’s no getting away from that, they need to be playing T20 cricket.”An ECB spokesperson said: “Players are the core of the game and we look forward to further discussions as we continue to develop the competition.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/893041489eefcfccf7d927339d5db05b58ba3647/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05387a7d622ae687592c7590c1c14a87","title":"harlem renaissance new york art food history","story":"The Harlem EatUp! food festival starts on 14 May – just one opportunity residents and enthusiastic newcomers have to celebrate and develop the culture of this historic New York districtIt was after midnight on a Wednesday and Paris Blues, Harlem’s oldest surviving jazz bar, was standing-room only. The e has remained, stubbornly, much the way it has since it opened in 1969. There’s neither a cover charge nor fancy cocktails and patrons can help themselves to barbecued chicken and other comfort food for free. In the corner, Samuel Hargress Jr, the 81-year-old owner who lives on the premises, was holding court in a fedora and tweed jacket.“I’m old-old-school. Things are real different now to when I came along,” he said. Since purchasing the bar for $35,000, Hargress has been a central figure in one of New York’s most historic – and rapidly changing – neighbourhoods. Though his establishment maintains a local following, these days it’s famous enough to attract international visitors. “You’ve got people from all over. Everybody here’s partying and dancing. They don’t know each other but it don’t matter.”Harlem’s history has long been marked by waves of new arrivals and change. Over the years, it has been home to everyone from George and Ira Gershwin to Duke Ellington. Before it became a haven for African-American intellectuals, poets and musicians during the Harlem Renaissance in the 1920s and 30s it was a stronghold of Jewish luminaries, many of whom were displaced by rapid development on the Lower East Side. After a period of decline in the 1970s and 80s, the neighbourhood is once again a hotbed of cultural activity.“It’s an evolving community. I’ve been here since 1980 and it didn’t just change overnight,” says John Reddick. A Harlem historian and preservationist, Reddick leads neighbourhood walking tours.“A lot of tourists have all this baggage and it takes a certain willingness to get beyond that. They think I’m just showing them the nicer side of Harlem, even though these buildings have been here for more than 100 years. I get this all the time: ‘Where in Harlem should you not go?’ There’s nowhere in Harlem I would not go.”Reddick urges visitors and newcomers to make a more meaningful connection with the existing community, whether by visiting a local church or enjoying the free art and live performances at Marcus Garvey park, St Nicholas park and Jackie Robinson recreation centre. Above all, he hopes that everyone who comes gains an appreciation for the neighbourhood’s near-mythic quality and what that has meant for different generations.“Look out of your window and it’s like this Fred Astaire-and-Ginger-Rogers view,” he says. “There’s this exhilaration of being in Harlem this sense that you’re part of this great metropolis. I feel it now, so you can imagine what it must have been like in the 1920s or 30s for somebody such as the poet Langston Hughes.”While there is much that Hughes would still recognise, it is impossible to ignore some of the changes. As with almost any neighbourhood in Manhattan, particularly one marked by handsome, turn-of-the-century brownstones and broad boulevards, Harlem’s property values have skyrocketed, causing residents to question what the future holds. A recent attempt by developers to rebrand the desirable area between 110th Street and 125th Street as SoHa resulted in a backlash by activists. Yet despite the Whole Foods on 125th Street and the queasy spectacle of a townhouse going for more than $4m, Harlem and its cultural institutions have managed to hold on to a distinct identity.“Harlem, throughout all the waves of gentrification and forced migration, has maintained a sense of itself,” says Nico Wheadon, director of public programmes and community engagement at the Studio Museum on 125th Street, which showcases work by African-American artists. “That’s because in its essence, it is an artistic, creative place. There is a history of struggle and protest to maintain that.” As with the National Black Theatre, another important Harlem institution, the Studio Museum turns 50 this year.Some of the efforts to maintain a sense of community have been quieter endeavours such as The Laundromat Project, which provides support for local artists and hosts programmes in laundromats and other public spaces. Another small startup is Hot Bread Kitchen, a non-profit project based in La Marqueta in East Harlem that provides female immigrants facing economic insecurity with a living wage, job training, and support.Meanwhile, the Studio Museum is in the process of redefining itself, moving beyond the walls and connecting with the broader public through art installations in parks and libraries, creative workshops talks, and even dance parties, such as its popular summer series, Uptown Fridays! Though the museum has shut its doors (there are plans to demolish the existing property and rebuild on the same site) it remains an active part of the community, including as its links with El Museo del Barrio, a Spanish Harlem art showcase.As with many Harlem residents, Wheadon finds the neighbourhood fulfils most of her social and entertainment needs. For an evening out, she heads to Vinatería, a stylish Mediterranean spot or 67 Orange Street for cocktails. She’s equally in love with the classics, from the amateur nights at the Apollo Theater to live music at Showman’s Jazz Club (375 West 125th Street), which she says feels “like the Harlem that I imagined before I moved here. It’s a time warp.”Change has, in part, been driven by Harlem’s thriving culinary scene. At its forefront is Marcus Samuelsson, the celebrity chef behind the Red Rooster restaurant, its subterranean sister venue, Ginny’s Supper Club and the Streetbird Rotisserie. Born in Ethiopia and raised in Sweden, Samuelsson spent eight years learning about the neighbourhood prior to opening Red Rooster, attending church events, eating at places such as Silvia’s – a soul-food staple opened in 1962 – and listening to residents.“When you think about the Studio Museum or the National Black Theatre, you’re thinking about this incredible depth of art, of music. We want this to be a destination for food as well,” Samuelsson says. “For me it was about working where you live and creating jobs to restore your community.”Samuelsson’s talk of community is more than lip-service. He works closely with the Careers through Culinary Arts Program, a programme that helps disadvantaged teens enter the restaurant industry and is an integral part of Harlem EatUp!, an annual food festival that highlights both established chefs and small-time food entrepreneurs. Samuelsson respects the older establishments, though he does not view the broader range of options as inherently negative.“You have ramen restaurants now, you have mixologist bars, you have craft coffee and I think that’s great. A community should be able to have both. You want it to be a place where people who live there don’t have to leave to go to a great place,” he says.Likewise, Wheadon feels optimistic that the neighbourhood will continue to hold onto that in the future.“Someone asked me the other day: ‘What is blackness to you?’ I said: ‘It’s celebration.’ I can’t walk to or from work without being swept up in somebody’s something,” she says. “There’s something beautiful about that and I think that Harlem will always have an element of that.”At Paris Blues the scene was certainly one of celebration. As the night wore on, musicians from nearby bars stopped by to jam with the band. Although Hargress is constantly approached with offers from developers, he has no intention of retiring or selling the joint.“I have fun with them. One guy offered me $6m,” he said, adding with unrestrained glee, “So I told him, you come up with $10m, then maybe you can call me back.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4785b02799235f69531249977ba6b8a00954f90/0_147_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76988f3b78ac7450d56858c5f7a5027d","title":"michael cohen russia stormy daniels lawyer claim","story":"Michael Avenatti makes extraordinary allegation that Cohen received cash from company affiliated with billionaire linked to Vladimir PutinDonald Trump’s attorney and legal fixer, Michael Cohen, was paid half a million dollars by a company affiliated with a Russian oligarch closely linked to Vladimir Putin, according to extraordinary allegations published on Tuesday.Cohen was said by Avenatti to have received $500,000 through a US affiliate of the Renova investment group owned by Viktor Vekselberg, a Russian billionaire closely associated with Putin who was placed under sanction by the US government last month. The payments were allegedly made between January and August 2017.An attorney for the Renova affiliate, Columbus Nova, said it hired Cohen as a business consultant and that Vekselberg had no involvement in the payments. Cohen, his attorney, and the Republican National Committee – for which Cohen is a deputy finance chairman – did not respond to requests for comment.Avenatti’s document said the money was paid to Essential Consultants, the same company Cohen used to pay a $130,000 settlement to buy Clifford’s silence in October 2016. The document said Essential also received funds from other major companies, some of which had business before the federal government. AT\u0026ampT, the telecoms corporation, confirmed it had made payments to Cohen’s firm during 2017 for “insights into understanding the new administration”. Novartis, a Swiss-based pharmaceuticals firm, did not dispute that it paid Cohen. Vekselberg has reportedly been interviewed by investigators working for Robert Mueller, the special counsel looking into alleged collusion between Russia and Trump’s team during the 2016 election campaign. Vekselberg has not been accused of any wrongdoing. CNN subsequently reported on Tuesday that he was specifically asked by Mueller’s investigators about the alleged payments to Cohen.The 61-year-old oligarch amassed a fortune through his Renova conglomerate, which s energy, heavy industry and finance, probably making him Russia’s ninth-richest person. He has remained in the Kremlin’s favour and was last year given a state honour by Putin.Vekselberg was also a guest at a now notorious December 2015 dinner in Moscow celebrating the RT television channel, which was attended by Putin and Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser.Columbus Nova is described on its website as “the US investment vehicle for the Renova Group”. The company’s chief executive, Andrew Intrater, contributed $250,000 to Trump’s presidential inauguration fund in January last year and a further $35,000 to Trump’s re-election fund in June last year.It was not clear from Avenatti’s document whether these contributions were connected to the new allegations. Intrater did not respond to an email asking whether the allegations were accurate.An attorney for Columbus Nova, Richard Owens, said in an email that the company was owned by Americans and that Vekselberg had no involvement in the payments to Cohen. “After the inauguration, the firm hired Michael Cohen as a business consultant regarding potential sources of capital and potential investments in real estate and other ventures,” said Owens. Avenatti asserted that Cohen also collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees from corporate clients. AT\u0026ampT was said to have paid Cohen’s firm $200,000 in four monthly installments from October 2017. Trump’s administration was at the time considering whether to allow an $85bn merger of AT\u0026ampT and Time Warner, which it has since rejected. In an emailed statement, AT\u0026ampT said: “Essential Consultants was one of several firms we engaged in early 2017 to provide insights into understanding the new administration. They did no legal or lobbying work for us, and the contract ended in December 2017.”Avenatti said that a subsidiary of Novartis paid Cohen’s company almost $400,000 “in late 2017 and early 2018”. Novartis’s incoming chief executive, Vas Narasimhan, was one of several businesspeople invited to dinner with Trump at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on 25 January.A spokesman for Novartis said in an email: “Any agreements with Essential Consultants were entered before our current CEO taking office in February of this year and have expired.”Avenatti has become one of the most publicly visible foes of Trump and Cohen since being recruited to represent Clifford in the fallout of the payoff and secrecy agreement arranged by Cohen being publicly revealed. Clifford has filed civil lawsuits against Trump and Cohen.Avenatti told the  last weekend, without offering any new evidence, that he believed Trump would have to resign from the presidency: “I firmly believe there is going to be too much evidence of wrongdoing by him and those around him for him to be able to survive the balance of his term.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d923a1b967a417403fea3166a84a4b4adfdbeac/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3baa62f4a694f58c753f9f72a9dfd80","title":"hawaiis kilauea volcano erupts in pictures","story":"The eruption of Kilauea volcano has sent lava flowing into residential areas on Hawaii’s Big Island, with residents ordered to abandon their homes.

Omar Shakir, the group’s Israel and Palestine Director, holds US citizenship. He has denied the accusation against him. Israel last year initially denied Shakir a work permit, in a move criticised by the US. It later granted him a one-year work visa. Israeli interior minister Aryeh Deri said he had acted on the recommendation of Gilad Erdan, the minister for strategic affairs, whose department said it gathered data that Shakir had for years supported a boycott of Israel. “It is inconceivable that a boycott activist can receive a permit to remain in Israel so that he can act in every possible way against the state. I will use all means to expel such people from the country,” Deri’s statement said. But Shakir said: “I have not called for any form of boycott of Israel during my time at Human Rights Watch and the interior ministry acknowledged this in its letter to me ... in which they informed me of their decision to deny an extension to my work visa.” HRW said it supported Shakir. “This is not about Shakir, but rather about muzzling Human Rights Watch and shutting down criticism of Israel’s rights record,” its program director, Iain Levine, said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ceff5a5c3fdcc68f63a67b220b2dac24d35a0a41/0_0_1617_970/master/1617.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=293705834da4be1f57148a6c37fc6fcb","title":"wednesday briefing may and corbyn put on notice over brexit","story":"Defeat for PM – and her Labour opponent – as Lords vote on Brexit bill … Donald Trump sabotages Iran nuclear agreement … and rats meet their matchDefeat for PM – and her Labour opponent – as Lords vote on Brexit bill … Donald Trump sabotages Iran nuclear agreement … and rats meet their matchHello – I’m Warren Murray with your breakfast news, the most important news of the day.Both Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have been handed a stunning defeat over Brexit after the Lords voted to keep membership of the single market on the table. Labour peers were whipped to abstain on the amendment concerning the European economic area. But 83 defied the whip, including a former party leader, many former ministers and a former chief whip. They were joined by 17 Conservatives.The amendment on remaining in the European economic area (EEA) will now have to be considered and voted on by MPs when the bill returns to the Commons, perhaps as soon as next week. The Tories are likely to try to brand Labour as the party of free movement, which is one of the obligations of EEA membership. But the Labour MP Chuka Umunna said: “The time for constructive ambiguity is over – our members and our voters will be delighted with this clear signal that we will not go along with this Tory Brexit.”There was some good news for Theresa May. Anna Soubry and Dominic Grieve, two key remainers, have signalled they might support the PM’s idea of a “customs partnership” with the EU. Soubry said: “If it delivers the huge benefit of our membership of the customs union and indeed the single market … then I don’t care what you call it.”‘Psychological war’ – World leaders have reacted with dismay after Donald Trump went through with his threat to break with the Iran nuclear agreement, also known as the JCPOA. The US will now reimpose sanctions on companies that do business with Tehran. Here’s how the deal works and why Trump has decided to sabotage it – in what Barack Obama, one of its authors, called a “misguided” act and a “serious mistake”. Iran said the accord is well rid of the “pesky being”, ie Trump, but Iran’s president has warned that the country’s atomic agency is preparing to restart uranium enrichment if the deal collapses completely. European leaders appear determined to salvage the agreement. “We urge the US to ensure that the structures of the JCPOA can remain intact, and to avoid taking action which obstructs its full implementation by all other parties to the deal,” said a statement from France, Germany and the UK. Trump’s action also imperils the prospects of freedom for American nationals held by Iran.Quick catch-up – Here’s where things stand in the middle part of the week.\u0026gt North Korea might be about to release three US nationals it imprisoned for alleged anti-government activities.

You tuned out a bit and started fiddling with your phone when he said “truly present” didn’t you?While the “yes” and “no” placards for the abortion referendum may be up, the people of Roscommon, the only Irish constituency that voted against same-sex marriage, are keeping their views close, writes Harriet Sherwood. Whether to amend the constitution and allow legal abortion remains isive in rural Ireland, as an issue cutting to the core of Catholic belief. But demographic change and the declining influence of the church also have a bearing.In Roscommon, canvassers for the “yes” campaign say they have found people fairly evenly ided between yes, no and undecided. Nationally, yes is expected to win – though, says one doorknocker, “there is a wide expectation that Roscommon will vote no”. On the other side, campaigners feel the prospect of abortion on demand up to 12 weeks will shock people into voting no: “Many ordinary people feel that an equal voice has not been given to those who want to retain the eighth amendment.” Voting takes place on 25 May.

Photograph: The The Government is planning to remove the “Baptism barrier” for entry to Catholic primary schools from September of next year.Under changes to be announced on Wednesday, all Catholic primary schools will be prohibited from giving enrolment priority to baptised children in cases where they are over-subscribed.The vast majority of primary schools – just over 90 per cent – are of a Catholic ethos.However, minority faiths, such as the Church of Ireland, will be allowed to prioritise members of their religion in order to protect their ethos in cases where they are over-subscribed.This exclusion has been introduced to help ensure children of minority faiths can still access a school of their own religion.The new rules will apply to over-subscribed schools (about 20 per cent) only. Schools that are not oversubscribed will be obliged to accept all applicants, regardless of religion.Minister for Education Richard Bruton said the “historic” move aimed to balance the rights of non-denominational, Catholic and minority faith families.“It is unfair that a local child of no religion is passed over in favour of a child of religion, living some distance away, for access to their local school,” Mr Bruton said. “Parents should not feel pressured to baptise their child to get access to their local school.”Mr Bruton said he planned to enacted the School Admissions Bill as quickly as possible, so it would apply to children entering school in the 20192020 school year.While Mr Bruton announced the plans last year, the planned amendment has been subject to extensive legal advice from the Attorney General’s office.The  reported earlier this year that Catholic bishops and trustee bodies for thousands of Catholic schools, along with management bodies and missionary groups, were preparing to fight the changes through legal challenges. They have argued that the planned changes are unfair and mean that some Catholic children may now be denied places in their local Catholic school.Government sources, however, say they are satisfied the planned changes are “legally robust”.Mr Bruton has argued that Catholic children will still be able to access Catholic primary schools given that the majority – 90 per cent – provide for religious instruction or education through the faith.Other significant changes to the legislation, which seeks to provide a fairer admissions policy, include:* A provision to allow all-Irish primary and secondary schools to give enrolment priority to Irish-speaking children. Under this approach, parents will be required to provide evidence that their child has an “age appropriate” level of fluency. Parents will have a choice to demonstrate this through an interview at the school or via a video.* New powers for the Minister for Education to require schools to open special classes for children with special needs where it is deemed necessary. At present, there are no powers to compel schools to establish special classes. However, research suggests some schools erect “soft barriers” to discourage children with additional needs from applying.Mr Bruton said the changes were aimed at introducing a more “parent-friendly, equitable and consistent” approach to how school admissions policies operate for the 4,000 State-recognised schools across the country."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3488369.1525804272!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"south dubliners brand apartment plans a monstrosity","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGeorgian-style apartments planned for Kilternan.Residents in south Dublin have objected to plans for a six-storey Georgian-style apartment scheme at the foot of the Dublin mountains in Kilternan on the grounds it would be “totally unsuitable” for the local rural area.Developer Greg Kavanagh’s Calerotech Ltd has sought planning permission from Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council for the complex of 97 apartments at the Golden Ball pub. If granted permission it would be the first apartment scheme in Kilternan.The design of the complex “seeks to delve into a portion of the nation’s richest historical architectural heritage” the application states, and is based on the Custom House and the “Georgian Squares of Dublin” according to the developers. It also represents a “back to basics” approach in terms of design, Calerotech said.Local resident Anne-Marie Leen described the scheme as a “monstrosity of a development” which is “totally unsuitable to the areas and is only at best suitable for a city centre location, and probably not suitable in Ireland at all”. The apartments would not be in keeping with the “countrysidevillage feel” of Kilternan, she said.Another local, Ciarán Moulton, said the scheme would “adversely effect the views to the Dublin mountains enjoyed by local residents”, would worsen local traffic, and affect visibility on the main road.The Balally Residents Association said the height and scale of the development was “more aligned to a city – not a rural suburb”. It would increase the already “massive traffic delays” and the pressure on the Luas Green line, it said.Several residents emphasised the low-rise nature of the area, which is dominated by bungalows and two-storey houses, and said the additional traffic would damage air quality and affect the health of existing residents.In relation to the scale, Calerotech said when Dublin’s Georgian squares were first planned they were considered “too urban” for their locations, and that 60 years ago “ Cabra, Crumlin, Ballymun etc” were mostly green fields.Local Fine Gael Cllr John Kennedy made a submission in favour of the scheme which he said appeared a more “family friendly” size than most apartment schemes in Dublin“The ornate design of the exterior is of a significantly higher standard than typical apartment scheme designs and would be reminiscent of well-regarded architecture seen in London and Paris,” he said.“I think it would be unlikely that a better designed scheme would ultimately materialise in future on these lands.”Mr Kavanagh, the self-described “Ronaldo of the property market” 18 months ago left New Generation Homes, the high profile development company he founded with Pat Crean. New Generation made headlines from 2011 onwards when it spent up to €300 million buying up development land at the bottom of the market.

No longer will the Rural Alliance be accused of number squatting. No longer will the cry of the Healy-Rae echo across the leather landscape before anybody else.The controversial bingo-card system has been abandoned. And the chamber is a quieter place for it. It was the first day of the new, old system where the Ceann Comhairle calls on deputies to speak on a first come, first catch his eye basis. Business was always conducted this way until TDs began complaining that some politicians were getting noticed and called more times than others. They are very sensitive about these things. In the end, when the put-upon Ceann Comhairle couldn’t stand the whinging anymore, it was decided to bring in a fairer, more transparent system. Seán Ó’Fhearghaíl couldn’t be expected to have eyes in the back of his head.So in came the bingo cards. TDs who wanted to ventilate a particular issue in the presence of the Taoiseach after Leaders’ Questions had to take a card and wait for their number to come up. But it didn’t stop there. While the person in possession of a card was the one entitled to ask a question, other TDs could get speaking time if addressing the same subject. So if, for example, a deputy were to ask a question relating to Kerry and another deputy (who might be sitting beside him) had an interest in the same topic, he too could stand and give it extra welly. Almost as soon as this system was put in place, members of the Rural Alliance became adept at the numbers game, consistently bagging the lowest numbers and best speaking slots.As a result, questions on the Order of Business became somewhat niche, while providing an excellent platform for the Healy-Raes and colleagues. It couldn’t go on. Numerous Business Committee meetings were held. Two options were considered: revert to the old way which caused so much bickering, or decide the running order by drawing names from a tombola in the chamber while the Dáil is in session. Unfortunately, in a missed opportunity, the tombola option was knocked on the head and a chance to inject some glamour and drama into the otherwise drab proceedings was lost.So Tuesday saw the Ceann Comhairle return to the traditional method. TDs were sent a notice to this effect. “Apart from leaders of groups in opposition, who will, if present in the chamber, be automatically selected, any member wishing to ask a question on promised legislation should indicate to the Ceann Comhairle by raising their hand to attract his attention. The Ceann Comhairle will take names from the start of Leaders’ Questions only, no earlier, and has asked me to say that he will not take names from written notes.”It was very civilised. Not a howl from a Healy-Rae until the closing minutes of the session, when few were listening and Michael came in to complain about Kerry nurses not being appointed to available jobs in the county and forced to work in Dublin. There was some minor waving at the Ceann Comhairle, but apart from that, nobody went overboard with attempts to attract Ó Fearghaíl’s attention. A variety of speakers from different parties contributed on a variety of issues.In due course, naturally, there will be tantrums. Meanwhile, the Government and body politic was in deep shock following the announcement that Seán Canney, Independent TD for Galway East, who left the Independent Alliance last week following a disagreement over the allocation of a junior ministerial post, was stepping down as Assistant Government Whip.Leinster House became a seething hotbed of indifference after this bombshell broke. On a sad note, warm tributes were paid to former Fine Gael TD, Monica Barnes, who died at the weekend. She was a mighty woman.Mary Lou McDonald was anxious the Taoiseach wouldn’t take her up the wrong way when she said of Monica: “She didn’t really come across as a Fine Gaeler – at least not to me.” The Sinn Féin leader stressed she meant this as a compliment. Leo Varadkar thanked her for her kind words and didn’t disagree. “Monica Barnes often did not come across as a typical Fine Gaeler, perhaps in the same way that Deputy McDonald doesn’t always come across as a typical Sinn Féiner.”“Ooooh!” went the TDs.“Is this an olive branch? A courtship? It’s nice.”-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3468658.1524242996!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"le big mac emmanuel macron s rise and rise","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWinning ways: Emmanuel Macron at his victory rally in Paris after being elected president, in May 2017. Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3488930.1525845159!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"iranian politicians torch us flag in parliament","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Iranian president Hassan Rouhani addresses the nation in a televised speech in Tehran, Iran. Photograph:  Iranian Presidency Office via APPoliticians in Iran have set a US flag ablaze in parliament and shouted “Death to America” after Donald Trump pulled out of the nuclear deal.Politicians held the impromptu demonstration the day after Mr Trump’s decision.As well as the paper flag, they also burned a piece of paper representing the nuclear deal.The chant “Death to America” long has been used in Iran since its 1979 Islamic Revolution. It also has been common to hear it within parliament.However, Wednesday’s demonstration reflected public anger in Iran after Mr Trump’s decision.Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal imposed restrictions on its nuclear programme in return for the lifting of most US and international sanctions.However, the deal came with time limits and did not address Iran’s ballistic missile programme or its regional policies in Syria and elsewhere.Mr Trump has repeatedly pointed to those omissions in referring to the accord as the “worst deal ever”.Proponents of the deal have said those time limits were meant to encourage more discussion with Iran in the future that could eventually address other concerns.Many Iranians are worried about what Mr Trump’s decision could mean for their country.The Iranian rial is already trading on the black market at 66,000 to the dollar, despite a government-set rate of 42,000 rials. Many say they have not seen any benefits from the nuclear deal.Iran’s poor economy and unemployment sparked nationwide protests in December and January that saw at least 25 people killed and, reportedly, nearly 5,000 arrested."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3488035.1525789254!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"british voters want things to change but largely stay the same","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Theresa May speaks to party supporters at Sedgley Conservative Club in Dudley last week ahead of local elections. Photograph: Anthony Devlin via ReutersFor anyone who grew up in the Age of Landslides that was fin de millénaire Britain, the spectacle of a close election has a freakish novelty. Yet this is the way of things now.Thirteen years, three general elections and a financial crash have passed since the public gave a prime minister a handsome majority in the House of Commons. Two of those elections returned no majority at all. To judge by last week’s votes in English local authorities, neither the Conservatives nor the Labour Party can count on forming a powerful government in the near future.While “ stalemate “ has emerged as the journalistic shorthand for this new dispensation, it is not quite right. Someone has to govern, and the Tories tend to scrape enough votes to do it. Stalemate also implies something of a passive electorate: two parties locked in mutual nullification like chess grandmasters while voters ooh and aah from the auditorium.More likely, what we are living through is not stalemate but weak government by popular design. The British public has improvised through its votes what the American founders hard-wired into their republic’s constitutional architecture: the extreme difficulty of doing all that much in office. One election result could be an accident. It is the consistency of the pattern over the past decade that is so telling. The mood of voters amounts to a kind of constructive indecision. The mystery is what to read into it.Over recent years the idea that Britain wants dramatic change – of a populist, eat-the-rich flavour – has hardened from a plausible theory into a given. As a result, it increasingly goes unscrutinised. If the vote for Brexit proved a wider national readiness for change, you would expect it to tally with electoral results before and since. To an extent that cannot be down to random error, it does not.For a country that demands rupture with a “failed” liberalism, Britain keeps returning parliaments that guarantee – at most – cautious, tinkering amendments to the status quo. Even the referendum was followed, a year later, by a general election that has more or less nixed the hardest version of Brexit as a legislative goer.As she tries to sell the idea of a “customs partnership” with the EU to more strident ministers, Theresa May’s most persuasive argument has nothing to do with the internal merits of her plan. Instead, the prime minister points her colleagues to the arithmetical realities of parliament. If denied a compromise, it might vote for full customs union membership.Excitable Leavers will have this down as sabotage of the people’s will. But the people had a wonderful chance to express themselves a year ago. They could have signed off on a Tory win that made a formality of hard exit. Instead, they returned MPs to take the edge off their own decision to Leave.If they regard this as betrayal, they show no signs of correcting it with a big majority for the Tories (or anyone else) any time soon. Their voting behaviour exposes a tentativeness about change that showed up as long ago as the 2010 general election, when the Tories’ tough fiscal plan spooked a nation that had seemed theirs for the taking.In short, the post-crash British are indeed ravenous for change – until they are forced to define it. As much as they want “something different”, they are not sold on any one version of it. The question is whether distaste for the options on offer eventually becomes grudging forbearance of the status quo.If weak government is the new default, it will not just moderate the terms of EU exit, but public policy beyond. On present form, no government will have the electoral numbers for either laissez-faire or a reassertion of the state in the private economy. Britain will have regained a substantial amount of sovereignty and chosen to do precious little with it. If so, the referendum may come to look less like proof of a coherent national revolt than an uncharacteristic gamble that voters almost immediately hedged against with their electoral choices.The elite’s failure to see Brexit coming has led to an over-correction. A view of the public has set in as nihilists bent on throwing the accumulated wisdoms of the past few decades up in the air and seeing where they land. But people, swing voters especially, still have jobs, mortgages and other tangibles to weigh against the abstract promise of change. Human risk-aversion was not enough to save Britain’s EU membership in 2016, but nor did it disappear. It is unclear what voters want these days, other than their rulers on the shortest of leashes. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2018"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3488532.1525814263!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"us withdrawal from iran deal branded a serious mistake","story":"US president Donald Trump has said his country will implement the highest level of economic sanction against Iran as he pulls out of the Iran nuclear deal. Video: The White House\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUS President Donald Trump signs a proclamation declaring his intention to withdraw from the JCPOA Iran nuclear agreement  at the White House on Tuesday. Photograph: Jonathan ErnstReuters US president Donald Trump defied international allies and announced America’s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement on Tuesday, unravelling years of international diplomacy and plunging the wider Middle East region into uncertainty.Speaking at the White House, Mr Trump announced that America would withdraw from the agreement, denouncing the nuclear deal struck by his predecessor Barack Obama and six other countries as “defective at its core”.While allies had hoped that Mr Trump might embrace some form of incremental withdrawal, he instead announced that America would begin reinstating sanctions that were waived under the 2015 deal and impose new economic sanctions on Iran.The US treasury department was on Tuesday night due to announce a “wind-down” period for companies affected by the current sanctions, ranging from 90 days to six months. But the impact of the US withdrawal was expected to be immediately felt on the global trading system as companies and oil markets absorb the news.“The fact is this was a horrible one-sided deal that should have never ever been made. It didn’t bring calm, it didn’t bring peace, and it never will,” Mr Trump said as he announced the US withdrawal from the agreement, which aimed to restrict Iran’s nuclear activities in exchange for the easing of sanctions on the Iranian economy.In a televised address following the announcement, Iran’s president Hassan Rouhani said he had directed his officials to continue to negotiate with Russia, China and the European signatories of the deal about remaining in the agreement.But he warned that Iran would “start enriching uranium more than before” and within a few weeks if the negotiations do not yield concrete results.The leaders of France, Germany and the United Kingdom issued a joint statement expressing their “regret and concern” over the decision.Noting that the JCPOA was unanimously endorsed by the United Nations Security Council, they said the resolution “remains the binding international legal framework for the resolution of the dispute about the Iranian nuclear programme”.Speaking in Brussels, EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said the EU was “determined to preserve” the agreement. “The nuclear deal is not a bilateral agreement,” she said. “And it’s not in the hands of any single country to terminate it unilaterally.”In a show of solidarity, European officials met with Iran’s deputy foreign minister for political affairs in Brussels in the hours before the announcement from Washington.In a rare public comment on a policy of his successor, former president Barack Obama issued a statement describing the decision as a “serious mistake”.“The JPCOA is working – that is a view shared by European allies, independent experts and the current US secretary of defence. The JCPOA is in America’s interests – it has significantly rolled back Iran’s nuclear programme.”Noting that it was a model for “what diplomacy can accomplish”, Mr Obama said that the agreement’s inspections and verification regime were “precisely what the United States should be working to put in place in North Korea”.As Mr Trump announced the US withdrawal from the agreement, he revealed that secretary of state Mike Pompeo was on his way to North Korea ahead of a planned summit between Mr Trump and Kim Jong-un.It is expected that Mr Pompeo may return with three American detainees who are being held in North Korea. Mr Trump’s legal counsel Rudy Giuliani said last Thursday on Fox News that the detainees would be released by the end of the day, but they have yet to be released."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/08/TELEMMGLPICT000162658475_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqGm4mM_3rfEPy9-FV1MpFOKy7jFMx5ZkRrK5762faYqM.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"family five year old boy struck cricket ball local school demand","story":"Five-year-old Harry Butt was struck in the face by a cricket ball from a nearby schoolLearning that your child has been injured whilst playing sport at school can often be a moment of dread and panic for many parents.But for one mother it was a complete shock seeing her son get hit in the face with a cricket ball, especially as he wasn’t even taking part. Five-year-old Harry Butt was stood on a driveway saying farewell to his loved ones before going on holiday when a cricket ball from the nearby school playing fields sailed over the fence and hit him in the face. Michelle Butt had taken her son and her 12-year-old twin daughters to visit friends before heading off on a holiday camping trip to Weymouth.They were on the driveway of the house in Dorset when the ball from Poole Grammar School whistled past Mrs Butt’s ear and struck Harry.Harry Butt was left with severe concussion, two black eyes and a swollen noseNow the five-year-old’s family are demanding safety improvements at the school claiming “the next victim might not be so lucky.”With the support of local residents Mrs Butt is demanding something is done before someone else is seriously injured.The 41-year-old claimed residents on Haslar Road have been complaining for years about cricket balls coming over the fence and hitting their cars, conservatories and ending up on their roofs.She said action should have been taken before a child was nearly killed.I just feel really upset that they\u0027ve been told about the balls going over and nothing has been done,” she said.I know that you can have netting around the pitches. It\u0027s also about the safety of the students at the school - obviously it\u0027s not big enough to play a game of cricket, because the balls keep coming over the fence.The ball reportedly flew through a fence of conifer trees at the school boundaryI just think the way it\u0027s been dealt with is not professional and it should have been done before.The accident left Harry with severe concussion, a swollen nose and a black eye.His family say he\u0027s been suffering from hearing and eyesight problems since the ball hit him after flying over the fence into Haslar Road.Mrs Butt added: It sounded like a bomb had gone off - my little boy was on the floor.We were all in shock and he was dazed. We took him to A\u0026ampE and we were admitted to hospital.He was violently sick, had really bad concussion and the consultant said if it had hit him anywhere else, he wouldn\u0027t be here.It hit him on the forehead, on the side.Andy Baker, the headteacher of Poole Grammar School, said the school regretted the incident.The school plans to move matches with senior pupils to an alternative locationHe told MailOnline: “It was a very unfortunate, one-off accident. We very much regret the injury to the little lad and the stress caused to his family.”He said the suggestion of safety netting being installed above the boundary fence had been looked into before but the school had been advised that the local authority wouldn\u0027t grant planning permission. He added: “I am also not sure how safe it would be with the wind we get here.“What we are going to do for senior matches where the boys and that much bigger and stronger, we will use another pitch that is further from the boundary. We can\u0027t risk this happening again.”Councillor Ray Tindle, who represents Canford Heath West, said he and fellow ward councillor, Sean Gabriel, would be looking to work with both local residents and the school to find a solution and prevent such an incident taking place again.He added: The school has got to face up to the fact that this is an issue and something has to be done.Princess Eugenie to marry Jack Brooksbank: Date, details and latest news about 2018\u0026#39s second Royal weddingWhat time is the Royal Wedding?

This can take as little as 20 minutes or as long as two to three days.It is understood that supermarkets have now put plans to introduce the charge on ice following consumer outrage and confusion. Tesco, Sainsbury\u0027s and Morrisons have not yet implemented the £99 charge but are reviewing the situation and plan to introduce it in the near future. It is already over nine months since Visa and Mastercard changed the rules last year.Previously rules stated a pre-authorisation charge of £1 should be taken at petrol pumps. A spokesman at Mastercard said: Last year a change in industry rules meant that petrol stations with automated fuel pumps were required to pre-authorise a value equivalent to a full tank of fuel, so that customers didn’t fill up with more fuel than they could afford.  This is designed to protect them, and the petrol station. If customers don’t have the required funds in their bank account, a further step is available to petrol stations which allows them to check what available funds a customer has, enabling a lower value of fuel to be dispensed. While some customers may see a request for a higher amount than the fuel they bought - perhaps on their mobile banking app -these funds are not taken from their account.

Unfortunately, without contacting the manufacturer, consumers may not know which has been used.Kellogg\u0026#39s new brand, WK KelloggThis presents issues for vegans, who make every effort to avoid animal products. We urge manufacturers to opt for vegan sources of vitamin D, and to label the ingredient clearly.  Consumers can also look out for products carrying the Vegan Trademark that indicate that the product meets The Vegan Society’s standards.  It comes as Kellogg\u0027s has launched a new range of vegan cereals under a new brand called W.K. Kellogg, marking a significant departure from its traditional red font logo. Its new range of healthy, low sugar and vegan granolas retail are designed to compete with upmarket cereal brands like Dorset Cereals and Lizi\u0027s Granola. They retail at around £3.75 per box, around twice the price of its regular cereals. A Kellogg’s spokesman, said: “Kellogg’s provides a choice of cereals, including the WK Kellogg range which is suitable for vegans. This is labelled on packs.“Our cereals that contain Vitamin D are clearly labelled and follow the EU and UK labelling laws.”Princess Eugenie to marry Jack Brooksbank: Date, details and latest news about 2018\u0026#39s second Royal weddingWhat time is the Royal Wedding?

I didn’t kill anybody, she told the Mirror. “None of it’s true. I’m on the edge. It makes me want to kill myself but I’d never do that.

They were banging on my cell door saying, ‘Come out here, you dirty nonce.’ Prison made me weaker. I don’t feel like the same person any more.

I was that 24-year-old once. I can\u0027t be upset about it, it\u0027s the way things are,” she told Glamour. On news that Maggie Gyllenhaal had been turned down for being ‘too old’, aged 37, to play a 55-year-old man’s partner: “It’s f***ing outrageous. It’s ridiculous. Honestly, it’s so annoying. And ’twas ever thus. We all watched James Bond as he got more and more geriatric, and his girlfriends got younger and younger. It’s so annoying.”Gyllenhaal revealed she was told by a Hollywood producer that she was too old, aged 37, to play the love interest of a 55-year-old man. “It was astonishing to me. It made me feel bad, and then it made feel angry, and then it made me laugh,” she said at the time. Meryl Streep has helped fund an all-female screenwriters group called The Writer’s Lab to encourage more women to pen Hollywood scripts. She previously told Vogue in 2011: “Once women pass childbearing age they could only be seen as grotesque on some level.” The actress said she thought Hollywood is “still completely s***” when it comes to treating women equally to men. ““When I was younger, I really did think we were on our way to a better world. And when I look at it now, it is in a worse state than I have known it, particularly for women, and I find that very disturbing and sad.”“I had never seen a 49-year-old, dark-skinned woman who is not a size 2 be a sexualised role in TV or film. I\u0027m a sexual woman, but nothing in my career has ever identified me as a sexualised woman. I was the prototype of the ‘mommified’ role,” she told The Hollywood Reporter. The actress famously called out sexism on the red carpet at the 2014 Screen Actors Guild Awards. When a camera operator scanned her up and down, she said: “Do you do this to the guys?” In her Oscar acceptance speech for Blue Jasmine, she reminded the film industry that movies with leading women can still be successful. \u0026#13Asked if she had ever encountered sexism in Hollywood, Page told : ‘Oh my God, yeah! It\u0027s constant! It\u0027s how you\u0027re treated, it\u0027s how you\u0027re looked at, how you\u0027re expected to look in a photoshoot, it\u0027s how you\u0027re expected to shut up and not have an opinion, it\u0027s how you... If you\u0027re a girl and you don\u0027t fit the very specific vision of what a girl should be, which is always from a man\u0027s perspective, then you\u0027re a little bit at a loss.”The actress says she refuses roles where she has to play the generic girlfriend, wife or sexy bombshell. It\u0027s very hard being a woman in a man\u0027s world, and I recognised it was a man\u0027s world even when I was a kid. It\u0027s an inequality and injustice that drove me crazy, and which I always spoke out against — and I\u0027ve always been outspoken,” she told Manhattan magazine. The actress spoke to ELLE about negotiating equal pay for the Snow White and the Huntsman sequel: This is a good time for us to bring this to a place of fairness, and girls need to know that being a feminist is a good thing. It doesn\u0027t mean that you hate men. It means equal rights. If you\u0027re doing the same job, you should be compensated and treated in the same way.You can see a full list below:Vin Diesel - The Fate of the furious (2017) $20mKevin Hart - Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (2017) $10m Jack Black - Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (2017) $5m or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The follicles quickly went into the active “anagen” phase of hair growth, and began sprouting hair.This is the hairstyle women find most attractive on menAfter two days, the measured rate of hair shaft production increased significantly in the treated follicles.The research, published in the journal PLOS, is “clinically very relevant” since most previous similar studies have relied on cell cultures, said Dr Hawkshaw.He added: “Interestingly, when the hair growth-promoting effects of CsA were previously studied in mice, a very different molecular mechanism of action was suggested. Had we relied on these mouse research concepts, we would have been barking up the wrong tree.”Additional reporting by PAor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They did so this year with added piquancy because it was the 50th anniversary of the famous “Mai 68” when, in the Latin Quarter of Paris, the Left Bank, the whole month was devoted to riotous assembly led by students. In contemplating these events, I recall Wordsworth’s often quoted phrase: “Bliss it was in that dawn to be alive” – unless, of course, you were struck by a cobblestone hurled by a student demonstrator or soaked and knocked off balance by a police water cannon.Presumably those who were demonstrating in Paris last Tuesday have now resumed their normal lives. The point about May 1968, however, is that they didn’t go back to college or to work the next day, they carried on, some of them for the whole month. Why was that? After all, economic growth had been unusually strong, the country was calm, both politically and socially, inflation was weak, living standards had been rising and there was little unemployment.Was it in a way a very 1960s thing? That question is prompted by a French historian of the period, Éric Alary, who observes that “May 68 is seen as a period when audacious moves seemed possible and during which society profoundly changed”. For that is an accurate description of the nature of the 1960s, whether in Western Europe or in North America.At the same time, there was a big rise in the sheer number of young people as a result of an increase in the birth rate in the closing stages of the Second World War and for some years afterwards. Thus, in France, the under-20 cohort rose from 30.7 per cent of the population in 1954 to 33.8 per cent in 1968. At the same time in France (1967), the school leaving age was raised from 14 to 16.  Two men take evasive action during a Paris street riot on 30 May (Getty)This required a massive expansion of teaching staff and building. As a result, students often found themselves being taught by hastily trained teachers in hastily built class rooms. In France, as in Britain, this was followed by a big expansion of the university sector. There was inevitably something ramshackle about it all, and students noticed. Yet the command structures of educational establishments remained unchanged. Nonetheless, universities are never just academic establishments full stop. For their campuses and their indoor and outdoor spaces lend themselves to meetings and debates and even to organising mini demonstrations. The intellectual gods of these 1960s students were Marx, Freud and Sartre, the French existentialist philosopher. In a famous passage, Sartre wrote that “God does not exist, and as a result man is forlorn, because neither within himself nor without does he find anything to cling to”. This struck home. For as Bob Dylan sang in 1965 – “How does it feelHow does it feelTo be on your ownWith no direction homeLike a complete unknownLike a rolling stone?”One had either to start things on one’s own without adult backing, or not at all. This was an unprecedented and intoxicating freedom. As the French student leader Dany Cohn-Bendit told the Paris demonstrators in May 1968: “There are no marshals and leaders today. Nobody is responsible for you. You are responsible for yourselves.”In fact, as is the way of things, Mai 68 began not in central Paris, but in Nanterre, a suburb seven miles to the northwest, and not in May but on 22 March. The construction of the university of Nanterre campus in a bleak shanty town had begun in 1962. In the spring of 1968 it was still not finished. The building were exceedingly functional and contained some 12,000 students. They were particularly shocked to find themselves living and doing their studies in what was in effect a building site. They demanded, too, the right to circulate freely between the residences of males and female students, still forbidden in what one might call pre-1960s style. There was a lot of justified discontent.Daniel Cohn-Bendit  was known as ‘Dany le Rouge’ because of his politics as well as the colour of his hair (Getty)Some 150 students, including far-left groups together with a small number of poets and musicians, occupied a building. The police surrounded it. After publication of the students’ wishes, they left the building without any trouble. But then they took their protest movement to the Sorbonne in the very middle of the Latin Quarter. That was how Mai 68 started.In a drastic action, the authorities shut down the University of Nanterre on 2 May. The students who had decamped to the Sorbonne were bound to think that this was a hostile act, an outbreak of war between the university authorities and the student body. It had been natural to head to the Sorbonne, France’s premier university, which had the prestige of its ancient foundation 700 years earlier. This meant nothing to the police, of course, who invaded the Sorbonne the next day.In response, on 6 May the national students’ union and the union of university teachers organised a protest march. It was one of the key events of the month. The head of the Paris police was obsessed by the need to protect the Sorbonne and its surroundings from a massive invasion by the students. He placed 1,500 officers in defence. But then came 6,000 protesters in waves. Overnight the confrontation was particularly violent. Thousands of cobblestones were ripped up and used as projectiles by the demonstrators. The police responded with teargas grenades. Dozens of gendarmes were taken to hospitals. Students were wrenched from the arms of the police by their colleagues.The next day, students, teachers and increasing numbers of young workers gathered at the Arc de Triomphe to demand that all criminal charges against arrested students be dropped, that the police leave the university and that the authorities reopen Nanterre and the Sorbonne. But negotiations broke down. When the students returned to their campuses to find that the police were still in occupation, a near revolutionary fervour began to grip them.The lyrics of Bob Dylan captured the sense of isolation and alienation felt by many young people (Redferns)The events were broadcast on radio as they occurred, and the aftermath was shown on television the following day. This demonstration of heavy handed police brutality brought on a wave of sympathy for the strikers. Moreover, in a highly significant move, the major union federations called a one-day strike and demonstration for Monday, 13 May. The workers were going to march with the students.They had their own grievances. There had been sporadic industrial trouble since the beginning of the year. More than half of them put in a 48-hour week. They feared that their standard of living had ceased to improve. Unemployment, albeit from a low base, was beginning to rise. As a result this was no longer a Paris event, for workers took to the streets throughout France. Their slogan was “Ten years! That’s enough!” referred to Charles de Gaulle’s long period as president.French politicians Michel Debre and Andre Malraux at the tomb of the unknown soldier, demonstrating their support for De Gaulle (Getty)The events the next day, 14 May, were as important. For workers began occupying factories, starting with a sit-down strike at the Sud Aviation plants near the city of Nantes. If students could occupy their universities, then workers could seize control of their factories. By 16 May, workers had occupied roughly 50 factories throughout France and 200,000 were on strike by 17 May. That figure snowballed to two million workers on strike the following day (18 May) and then ten million, or roughly two thirds of the French workforce on strike the following week (23 May).The unions assumed that the workers simply wanted more pay. So, when they were able to negotiate substantial pay increases with employers’ associations, they thought their job was done. But workers had also demanded the ousting of the De Gaulle government and in some cases demanded to run their own factories.The demonstrations and the strikes went on. Meanwhile on the morning of 29 May, De Gaulle suddenly boarded a helicopter and left the country. He went to the headquarters of the French military in Germany and called a meeting of Council of Ministers for 30 May back in Paris. On that same day, the unions led 400,000 to 500,000 protesters through Paris chanting “Adieu, De Gaulle”. The head of the Paris police carefully avoided the use of force.Sensibly De Gaulle responded by dissolving the National Assembly and calling a new election for 23 June. He ordered the workers to return to work immediately, threatening to institute a state of emergency if they did not. The Communist Party agreed to the holding of the election. Immediately revolutionary feelings began to fade away. The police retook the Sorbonne on 16 June. And the Gaullists won the greatest victory in French parliamentary history.The May days of 1968, it turned out, had been a convulsive moment, nothing more enduring than that.

You’re at a party. You know no one but the host and they’ve had to rush to the kitchen to rescue some smoking vol-au-vents from the oven. You spot a friendly looking fellow guest, also on their own, and sidle over to make their acquaintance by the buffet table. You swap names. You compare notes on your respective journeys to the venue. You talk about the weather. Hasn’t it been strange this year? So far so good. Now what?The host passes by with those vol-au-vents. You grab one and shove it in your mouth. And before you’ve entirely finished eating it you come out with the line, “So, what do you do?”If this were the 1970s, the needle would skitter across the vinyl on the record player, bringing the music to an abrupt and ugly end. As it is, the entire room falls silent as everyone turns to stare.The etiquette guide to Whatsapp group chatsIt’s not that your mouth is still full of vol-au-vent crumbs. Though that is pretty disgusting. It’s because they’re thinking: “You just asked what?”You just asked somebody what they do? Quelle horreur. You thought you were making small talk but you’ve accidentally outed yourself as being a bit of a prat.           I had no idea you weren’t supposed to ask people “what they do” until I was about 35 and I read an article by one of those etiquette gurus who if he had any real manners, wouldn’t spend so much time pronouncing on other people’s. It shouldn’t have bothered me, but it did. I was sure I had asked that question on many occasions. I’d certainly answered it. Did people think I was an ill-mannered oaf? The etiquette expert did not, alas, go into the reasons for his pronouncement and I was left none the wiser.I have in the past told people I’m an unemployed stunt rider to circumvent awkward conversationsSo why don’t people like being asked what they do?Maybe it’s because the rest of the question, which generally remains unspoken, is “for a living”. “What do you do for a living?” Already sounds a bit worse, doesn’t it? A bit too personal? Once you know what someone does to get by, it can immediately change your perception of that person. Maybe you were starting to fancy them, but now you know they’re an actuary? Too dull. Or a social worker? Too poor. Or a stay-at-home mum? Oh no. You’ll have to talk about nappies all night.Before you know it, you lazily start to project the cliched characteristics of the occupation onto your new friend and in doing so fail to give yourself a chance to get to know them in any real way. They’ve already been labelled and put in the appropriate box.  Likewise, there’s always the danger that when you tell someone what you do for a living, they’ll have further questions you should actually be charging to answer.Doctors have all experienced the horror of being whisked away from the table at a dinner party to take a quick look at someone’s rash. Lawyers are asked to comment on orce cases at wedding receptions. Plumbers are suddenly handed toilet plungers instead of another glass of champagne.   Everything you need to know about dating app etiquetteNovelists have it worst of all. It’s my experience that upon hearing I’m a novelist (having already worked out that I’m not JK Rowling or EL James), nine out of 10 people want to tell me about the book they’re writing. Could I show it to my publisher? Or they’ll tell me about a story they have that’s just bound to be a bestseller only they don’t have time to write it themselves. Perhaps I could write it for them and they’ll give me 10 per cent of the proceeds? Does that sound reasonable? Only once in my 20-year career has a complete stranger ever told me a story that made me want to reach for my pen.I have in the past told people I’m an unemployed stunt rider to circumvent those awkward conversations, so I do understand why “what do you do” can be a loaded question.But let’s be realistic. It’s not easy to make small talk with a stranger. I would never cut someone dead or judge their social standing just because they’d resorted to the easy questions on a first encounter. Sometimes you really don’t know what else to say. Modern conversation is a veritable minefield. It used to be that you should never talk about religion or politics but the list of subjects that are verboten seems to grow by the day. We can’t all talk about the weather until the end of time. Though having said that, hasn’t the weather been strange?If the question bothers you that much, then I would go with ‘I’m a water slide tester’.When I said I was going to be writing about the questions we just can’t ask each other, because they’re considered impolite or because they’re actually illegal (such as “how old are you” in certain contexts), a friend of mine agreed with the etiquette expert that asking “what do you do” was the very height of bad manners. My friend would admit to having asked the question only once so far as he could remember, saying that he’d deployed it in desperation at a fancy dinner party. His neighbour at the table was monosyllabic. The conversation was going absolutely nowhere so my friend dropped the “wdyd” bomb thinking that at least if he found out his neighbour was an accountant, they could talk about taper relief.“I’m a drummer,” said the man.“In your spare time?”Apparently the conversation didn’t pick up after that.So, what can you ask instead? A better question is perhaps, “What do you do in your free time?” Whereas people often have to work at jobs they hate just to pay the mortgage, what they do in their free time should, by definition, be something they simply enjoy. Maybe the actuary you’ve already dismissed as boring is passionate about the Argentine tango, imbuing every step with the spirit of the brave and unruly gaucho. They might have danced you into bed. So ask what someone loves to do before you ask them what they have to do. Whether the answer is “needlework, specifically cross-stitch” or “attending furring conventions in the New Forest dressed a hamster”, there’s got to be at least 10 minutes more conversation to be had.Eleven etiquette rules to remember next time you flyMan who studied rich people found 3 etiquette aspects they never shirkEtiquette coach prompts outrage by claiming Christmas tinsel is commonIf you say these 28 words, you\u0027re poshA pool etiquette guide for mothers braving a family holidayMeanwhile, the perfect response to “what do you do” has to be “what do I do about what?” If you’re feeling mean, that is. If the question bothers you that much, then I would go with “I’m a water slide tester”. It’s an actual job. You have to rate theme park water slides for exhilaration and splash factor. You just need to be able to swim. Imagine what’ll go through your new friends’ minds when they hear that’s what you get up to all day. Interestingly, despite the etiquette snob’s assertion that enquiring after someone’s occupation marks you out as not being from “the top drawer” as it were, I’ve heard that when they’re meeting people in those interminable line-ups, the Royals always ask “and what do you do?”I wonder if anyone has ever asked the same question in return?*Of course he wasn’t in U2.

However, animals were not the only threat. Kenya was at the time a British colony.During the Mau Mau uprising of the 1950s, white families were fair game to the rebels thanks in no small part to the brutal nature of colonial rule. (In 2011 William Hague expressed “sincere regret” for the thousands who had been detained and tortured.) When Sheldrick was nine months pregnant she survived an ambush by Mau Mau fighters.Chained and tortured: The horror inflicted on India’s elephantsSo when a wild elephant she had mistaken for one of her hand-reared orphans turned on her in 1994, she took it in her stride.“I opened my eyes. I could feel the elephant gently insert her tusks between my body and the rocks,” she wrote in her autobiography, Love, Life and Elephants: An African Love Story, in 2012.“Rather than a desire to kill, I realised that the elephant was actually trying to help me,” she added. “I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to Kenya.”Born Daphne Marjorie Jenkins, Sheldrick came from a family of settlers who left rural Scotland for Africa in the mid-1820s. Her great-uncle Will, a successful farmer in South Africa, began the family’s connection with Kenya after meeting governor Sir Charles Eliot. Eliot was offering free land to families prepared to move to his new colony. Among the families that subsequently boarded the boat to Mombasa were Daphne Sheldrick’s great-grandparents.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)The settlers arrived to an uncertain future in a country with none of the comforts of home. They could not move their livestock inland without first swathing them in cloth to foil the tsetse fly. The new railway was notorious for the number of workers eaten by lions during its construction. And the 5,000 acres of virgin bush gifted by the British government were in fact already home to the Masai. After an arduous four-month journey to get there, Sheldrick’s family had to move on again.I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to KenyaBy the time Sheldrick was born, third of Bryan and Marjorie Jenkin’s four children, the family was established on a farm in Gilgil in the Great Rift Valley. Marjorie Jenkins was determined to instil in her children a love for the natural world. Family walks included not just the farm dogs but an impala, a waterbuck and Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, a brown-furred dwarf mongoose. At the age of four, Sheldrick was given responsibility for the care of an orphaned infant bushbuck.It was an idyllic upbringing but it was hard to run a European farm among African predators such as lions and leopards. At the same time, the global picture was changing rapidly. With the Second World War reaching Ethiopia, the British government looked to Kenya to feed the troops. Bryan Jenkins was tasked with shooting thousands of wildebeest and zebra in the Southern Game Reserve. He set up a portable biltong factory, assisted by two Italian prisoners of war. It was while camping nearby that six-year-old Sheldrick was woken by lions. Attracted by the smell of meat, they stayed to lick salt from the tarpaulins.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)As soon as she was old enough, Sheldrick, who could speak Swahili, was sent to boarding school. She was a keen student, graduating eighth in her year and winning a university bursary. However, she was already in love with Bill Woodley, a student from her brother’s school, and chose instead to leave full-time education to be with him.Khurshid Drabu: Britain’s first Muslim judgeRemembering Avicii, Swedish superstar of electronic dance musicLeila Abashidze: Georgian actress who became a star of Soviet cinemaJanka Nabay: Musician who brought Sierra Leone’s bubu to the worldIsao Takahata: Japanese animation master who co-founded Studio GhibliAt around the same time, a state of emergency was declared in Kenya after Mau Mau guerrilla fighters, drawn from the Kikuyu, Meru, Embu, Kamba and Masai people, rose up against white colonial rule. The insurgency was put down with shocking brutality by British colonial officials and Kenyan “home guards”. Thousands of civilians were rounded up in mass detention camps and subjected to beatings, sexual assault and even castration, allegedly sanctioned at the highest level. (Finally, in 2013, after a long legal campaign, the British government apologised.)Mau Mau retaliation was equally bloody and Sheldrick’s family did not escape the violence. During a Mau Mau raid on her great-aunt’s farm, five people, including three children, were burned alive. Sheldrick’s grandparents were beaten and left for dead in an alleged Mau Mau robbery. Meanwhile, a worker on the Jenkins’ farm wasted away and died, convinced he was cursed after refusing to kill his employers at the Mau Mau’s behest.The David Sheldrick Trust has been reintroducing orphans back into the wild at Tsavo National Park since 1987 (Rex)In the midst of this unrest, Sheldrick married Woodley, visiting the United Kingdom for the first time on their honeymoon. After their marriage they moved to Tsavo National Park, where they worked as wardens. In January 1955, Bill took the now heavily pregnant Sheldrick back to visit her family in Gilgil. Returning in darkness, they were ambushed. “A terrifyingly loud sound erupted and in the arc of the headlamps we could see crazed, menacing figures, clad in skins, coming towards us in a great swirl of anger and noise. Some were wielding pangas, some were hurling enormous boulders and others were firing at us from point blank range.”Sheldrick continued working into later life (Rex)Bill Woodley saved his wife and unborn daughter, Jill, by driving straight through the Mau Mau attackers. A year later, the capture of Mau Mau leader Dedan Kimathi marked the official end of the “Emergency”, but the rebellion continued underground for almost a decade.The Woodleys survived the ambush but soon after their marriage foundered. Sheldrick, still Mrs Woodley as she then was, had fallen hopelessly in love with her husband’s boss with whom she had much in common. David Sheldrick was a keen naturalist dedicated to ending poaching. During his anti-poaching campaign, more than 25,700lbs of ivory was recovered and in 1959 and he was duly awarded an MBE. Meanwhile, Bill Woodley’s passion for hunting, so much at odds with his role as warden, was beginning to grate. Sheldrick left him for his high-minded superior.Sheldrick married David in 1960. Their family quickly expanded to encompass a variety of furry and feathered orphans, such as Gregory Peck, a buffalo weaver-bird, and Old Spice, a civet cat with a passion for the aftershave that bore his name. Soon after came a human daughter, Angela.We had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world warsDavid Sheldrick had already raised two orphaned elephants, Samson and Fatuma. His observations of the pair formed some of the first studies on elephant diet and migration. Daphne Sheldrick took charge of further orphans including one she named Aisha. In an interview, Sheldrick explained: “She came to us as one of the smallest elephants I had ever seen, with soft fuzz and ears as soft and pink as petals. When she arrived, my heart plummeted as we had never been able to save an elephant this young.”The Sheldricks had already discovered that elephants do not thrive on traditional baby formula and after a few days on glucose and watered down cow’s milk, Aisha was wasting away. As a last resort, Sheldrick tried coconut oil. It worked. Aisha began to thrive on Sheldrick’s recipe and the future of many more orphaned elephants was assured.Sheldrick leaves two daughters, four grandchildren, and a huge family of elephants, rhinos and many more (DSWT)By the early Sixties, the Mau Mau Uprising may have been over but the “winds of change”, as referenced in Harold Macmillan’s 1960 speech in South Africa, were blowing across the continent. When it came to Kenya, the British government decided that continuing colonial rule required more force than they were prepared to expend and Kenya was granted independence in 1963. The Duke of Edinburgh presided over the handover to Jomo Kenyatta.They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate thatThe change of rule caused much anguish for the white settler families, who, as Sheldrick described, “had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world wars. Britain began to turn its back on those people – even the daily BBC programme previously announced as ‘Home News from Britain’ became ‘News From Britain’, a subtle change that did not go unnoticed.”Sheldrick’s husband was among those who struggled to renew his British passport at the time. David Sheldrick put the situation succinctly: “There was no question about me not being British when the Second World War broke out and I was called up to fight for your bloody country.”In 2016 Sheldrick warned that if the ivory trade continued, the African forest elephant could be extinct by 2025 (Rex)The Sheldricks worried that the transition to independence would adversely affect Kenya’s national parks but it was their success in making the park a safe haven for elephants that caused the next problem. The elephant numbers at Tsavo had grown dramatically – from an estimated 5,000 to 15,000 – and the increased competition for food led to the devastation of much of the forest landscape. However, David Sheldrick firmly resisted the idea of an artificial cull and, in time, the more open grasslands created by the elephants’ indiscriminate browsing attracted new species, including antelope and buffalo. The Tsavo lions thrived.Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn tradeIn 1976, the parks were finally brought under government control, merging with the Government Game Department. Sheldrick explained that for the park’s “wild inhabitants, especially rhinos and elephants, who became instant targets, it was the death knell”. Shortly afterwards, David Sheldrick was offered a desk job in Nairobi and the family left Tsavo to an uncertain fate.David Sheldrick died that same year. After his death, devastated Sheldrick began to raise funds in his memory to continue the work that meant so much to him.‘Born to be Wild’, narrated by Morgan Freeman, shone a spotlight on the rehabilitation efforts in Kenya (Getty)The first official fundraiser was a film by former warden Simon Trevor. Somali gangs, armed with AK47s, had been gunning down entire Tsavo elephant herds, turning the park into a no-go zone. Trevor’s film on the crisis, Bloody Ivory, came to the attention of President Arap Moi, who agreed to attend the premiere. Alas, Moi was a no-show, but a few months later the Vatican proposed a papal visit to Kenya, during which the pope wished to bless an elephant and a rhino calf. Sheldrick obliged. The logistics were difficult but the publicity was priceless.Sheldrick was named one of the most significant conservationists ever (DSWT)In 1987, the David Sheldrick Memorial appeal became The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust (DSWT), with a mission statement declaring it “embraces all measures that compliment the conservation, preservation and protection of wildlife”. Over the next 30 years the trust expanded to three sites: the elephant nursery at Sheldrick’s home in Nairobi, and two centres in Tsavo where the orphans were reintroduced into the wild.There was no shortage of infant elephants to be reared. Though President Moi tried to signal an end to the ivory trade by publicly burning Kenya’s stockpile in 1989, the international appetite for ivory remained undiminished. Between 2003 and 2013, the DSWT saw a 500 per cent increase in the number of orphans rescued, driven by demand for ivory from China. In an interview in 2016, Sheldrick lamented that elephants were being killed at a rate of 50 a day, telling Bohotraveller: “Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn trade.”UK ivory trade ban a positive step but what next for Africa’s elephantConservationists warn its too early to celebrate elephants\u0027 safetyEurope must choose: elephants or ivoryYoung Kenyans care for nature but are detached from conservation Wildlife conservancy grows cattle feed to fend off droughtFamily of elephant conservation pioneer pledge her legacy will live onSheldrick spread the word about the crisis facing the elephants with numerous television appearances. She published four books, including her autobiography. Meanwhile, her work was recognised all over the world. In 1989, she was appointed MBE. She was awarded an honorary doctorate in veterinary medicine by Glasgow University. In 2001, the Kenyan government awarded her the Moran of the Burning Spear and in 2006 Sheldrick became a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, “for services to the conservation of wildlife, especially elephants, and to the local community in Kenya”. Her knighthood was the first to be awarded in Kenya since the country’s independence in 1963, something that Sheldrick said “left me dumbfounded but nevertheless extremely proud”. At the time of Sheldrick’s death in April 2018, the DSWT hand-reared more than 200 orphaned elephants, more than 100 of whom were successfully released into the wild. As the trust approached its 40th anniversary last year, Sheldrick told Eluxe magazine: “I have always turned to the elephants for inspiration in the face of adversity. They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate that.”As Sheldrick wrote in her autobiography: “Elephants are, indeed, just like us, and in many ways better.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The cost of paying privately for dialysis sessions in the EU is up to €1,000 (£880) a week depending on the circumstances and procedures used.”Jeremy Hunt supported Remain during the referendum (Getty)Charities echoed the MEPs’ comments, warning that long-term conditions would continue to “cross borders” whatever the political status of the UK.Fiona Loud, policy director at the charity Kidney Care UK, told The Independent: “Every day we hear from people who are anxious about the very real possibility that their freedom to travel could be curtailed due to changes in reciprocal healthcare rights. Whatever happens as we leave the EU, the needs of people with long-term conditions will continue to cross borders.“For the 29,000 people in the UK who have kidney failure and who need dialysis to stay alive, the EHIC system is essential to allow them to travel in Europe.

The lowest regional support is in the ConnaughtUlster statistical region, at 89 per cent – still an overwhelming figure.  Maybe the Irish should leave the EU87 per cent of those polled believed Ireland had on balance benefited from EU membership, with just 10 per cent disagreeing. Unemployed people were less likely to agree, however, at 70 per cent.Smaller majorities of people supported Ireland contributing more to the EU budget and joining in a future EU defence and security union.Noelle O’Connell, executive director of European Movement Ireland, which commissioned the poll, said: “People are very clear that leaving the EU would not be in Ireland’s interests. However, there is understandable uncertainty about what changes Brexit will bring to Ireland, the border and the Ireland-UK trade relationship in the long term.“Contrary to recent claims, at 92 per cent support for Ireland’s membership of the EU remains strong in fact it is at an all-time high since we first undertook this poll in 2013.”In August 2017 Nigel Farage urged Ireland to leave the EU. “Maybe the best thing for Ireland given that she’s stuck in the wrong currency, given that nearly all of her overseas business is denominated in dollars or sterling, maybe the Irish should leave the EU and then we could then work out our own terms between us,” he said. Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesBrexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesJohn Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

No, these are the views of Labour’s Big Beasts on the Marxist puppet who stole their party.Brighty - The SunThursday’s local elections suggest Brexit will be the battlefield for the next election, with Labour alienating millions who voted Leave.Alastair Campbell and David Blunkett led the attack on Jeremy Corbyn, blaming him for allowing Jew-baiting anarchists and union paymaster Len McCluskey to kill Labour’s dream of power.“If we cannot beat this shambles of a Tory party, we don’t deserve to be in the game,” warned Tony Blair’s old spin doctor.Campbell, a ferocious Remainer, tore into Corbyn for missing open goals over Brexit, Windrush deportees, the Grenfell inferno and the never- ending NHS ­crisis.But he is especially appalled by Labour’s “Militant-style nastiness . . . anti-Semitism . . . and the feeling that some in the leader- ship feel greater animus against Labour supporters than the Tories.”Blunkett’s attack is even more personal. “Jeremy’s ­leadership is going nowhere,” he warns.The ex-Home Secretary blamed Corbyn directly for the wave of anti-Semitism that cost Labour dearly in London and the reign of terror against anyone who dared to speak out.“He could have cauterised the loathsome views of a very small group of far-Left fanatics who joined the party only after he became leader,” fumed Blunkett. “He has fudged and prevaricated.“I’ve seen the personal vitriol activists endure from some Corbyn supporters. I’ve seen the threats of deselection from Len McCluskey.“I’ve seen good Labour MPs traduced and insulted.”Such vicious public attacks from Blairite heroes make nonsense of pundits’ claims that nothing has changed since last week. Labour is in meltdown.Tories bracing themselves for humiliation on Thursday night were let off the hook. Labour’s retreat across swathes of ­Britain prove JC will never be PM. Labour should be 20 points ahead, not level-pegging.They are lumbered with their useless leader. The legion of “Oh Jeremy Corbyn” fans adore him. And who would take over if he stepped aside?Not John McDonnell, for sure.This new blame game exposes the quiet but corrosive civil war tearing Labour apart since Jezza seized the crown.Last year, moderates had been secretly plotting a leadership coup on the assumption Labour would lose the General Election.That was before JC emerged startled but triumphant from Theresa May’s “strong and stable” fiasco.Now the knives are out. And Brexit is splitting Labour as much as it is the Tories.Ex-Europe minister Caroline Flint ripped into Corbyn for siding with Brexit wreckers and using the issue to bash the Tories. Intriguingly, she believes Britain would have voted OUT whenever the referendum was staged in the last ten years — even if Labour had been in power.Now she believes Remainers should accept the voters’ ­verdict and help deliver the best Brexit deal possible.The Doncaster MP aimed her remarks at Corbyn but she might as easily have been talking about Alastair Campbell, who is campaigning for a ­second referendum.“Two-thirds of Labour MPs represent Leave-voting areas,” says Ms Flint. “We are alienating many traditional Labour voters.”Even Corbyn’s own supporters want him to ditch his opportunistic sabotage tactics.Steve Howell, who helped run his 2017 election bid, ­predicted a voter backlash with Labour shut out of power for a decade.“Labour is seen as too Remain,” he said. “We ignore this at our peril. We would hand Leave-voting areas over to the Tories and be destroyed at the next General Election.”Thursday’s elections prove voters of all parties are sick of Westminster shenanigans and will punish the party they blame most for a bad Brexit.Right now, that looks like Labour.“I feel pity for the women and contempt for the men,” she writes. “The man walking in pride, showing us his caught prey.“The law of this country, the law of all countries, should change. Covering a face is literally killing an identity. I would love to see men covered with burkas, for a few hours, when it’s hot.“Let’s ask them, ‘How are you feeling?

They’re following the only possible logic of the Referendum result, the Prime Minister’s own speeches and the Tory manifesto – a document that those remoaning rebels seemed perfectly happy with when they were re-elected off the back of it last year.If a deal between the UK and Brussels stops Britain making independent trade agreements with the rest of the world, or leaves us subject to rules over which we have no say, then it would be a betrayal of the 17.4million people who wanted out of the EU.The Europhile backbenchers know that. If they win this battle, they’ll have succeeded in keeping us in Europe by the back door. They’ll mark it up as a victory, but this isn’t a political game.It would be an insult to democracy and hold our economy back.We must start work on building a truly Global Britain — now.THAT brickies and nurses are now having to scrimp and save for six-figure deposits is nothing short of a national scandal.No recent Government has been willing to grasp this particular nettle.Our housing crisis has been brewing for decades and sorting it will require real radicalism from the new Communities supremo James Brokenshire.He must fight the Nimbys head-on and demand Treasury cash to unleash a building programme.He must also tear up planning laws and look again at the Green Belt. The Tory leadership will be worried about their voters in the shires. But that’s nothing compared to the hit they’ll take for generations if they don’t face up to the challenge.MOTORISTS have been treated like cash cows for far too long.Plans for new “toxic taxes” rub salt in the wound, especially for diesel drivers.It wasn’t that long ago punters were told it was greener to buy diesels, so fining them years later in the name of environmentalism is especially unfair.It must be possible to “go green” without piling misery on hard-working Brits who rely on their motor to get to work, take the kids to school and visit the GP.Time for a u-turn on yet another fuel tax.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I know Sadiq wants its transport system to be the envy of the world and I am looking forward to playing my part in making that happen.Mr Khan said today he was delighted to welcome his ally to the team.Heidi knows this city inside-out, and her work both as shadow health secretary and campaigning over the best Brexit deal has demonstrated the terrific job she will do as part of my team standing up for London.But Tory Chairman Brandon Lewis blasted: After a dismal set of local election results in which Labour failed to make the gains they boasted about, this is more proof that Labour are too divided to deliver on their promises to working people.This also highlights a complete lack of faith in Jeremy Corbyn and his leadership.She joins a growing list of centrist Labour MPs who have quit their jobs under Jeremy Corbyns leadership.Last week Barnsley moderate Dan Jarvis was elected as metro mayor for Sheffield, but it is unclear if hell remain in his MP job too.Andy Burnham resigned from the Commons when he stood down to become the mayor of Greater Manchester in 2017.Tristram Hunt quit last year to become director of the V\u0026ampA Museum, and Corbyn critic Jamie Reed left to return to his old job in the nuclear industry.MPs piled in to pay tribute to the outgoing MP today.Gavin Shuker said: Parliaments loss is Londons gain.

They used to pre-authorise your card for £1 but now it is £99.“So that is money taken from your account that you can’t use until they release it back once the other payment has cleared.“My complaint to them was that they should have notices on the petrol pumps making customers aware of this as they have changed their policy, 5th of may we got fuel and were still waiting for our refund. Absolute joke.”An Asda spokesman said the fee was issued by Visa and Mastercard and is part of a trial at several stores.A Mastercard spokesman: Last year a change in industry rules meant that petrol stations with automated fuel pumps were required to pre-authorise a value equivalent to a full tank of fuel, so that customers didn’t fill up with more fuel than they could afford.This is designed to protect them, and the petrol station.If customers don’t have the required funds in their bank account, a further step is available to petrol stations which allows them to check what available funds a customer has, enabling a lower value of fuel to be dispensed.While some customers may see a request for a higher amount than the fuel they bought - perhaps on their mobile banking app - these funds are not taken from their account. Only the value of the petrol dispensed is withdrawn.A Visa spokesman said: “The way that pay-at-pump fuel payments are treated has been standardised across the industry to ensure security for individual cardholders, retailers and card issuers.“When an individual chooses to pay at a pay-at-pump fuel dispenser, an initial amount is held against their account while they dispense their fuel to ensure that they have sufficient funds to pay for the cost of their fuel. This initial amount should be adjusted immediately after fuel is dispensed to reflect the actual cost of the fuel.“Visa has been working closely with card issuing banks to ensure that consumers do not experience delays in the adjustment of the initially-held amount, however if consumers notice that initial amounts held against their accounts are not adjusted immediately, they should raise this with their card issuing bank in the first instance.”Other users expressed their anger at the charge.Charlotte Witcomb wrote: “What a joke.”Hope Sykes added: “It’s not like we have £99 for them to take in the first place.”Find the cheapest fuel prices.Use PetrolPrices. All you need to do is enter in your postcode and tell it how far you want to travel (up to 20 miles)Drive more efficiently. Some ways to do this, include:Prices at the pumps soared by almost 3p per litre last month, hitting millions of motorists.In February, we revealed how drivers face a postcode lottery with fuel costing £17 more if you live in the wrong town.The Sun Online recently revealed how soaring petrol and diesel prices mean Brits are paying an average of £60 more per year.Regardless of your vehicle, cutting down your fuel bill may be as simple as making a few adjustments to your vehicle and changing the way you drive.

In lab tests, the drug started promoting growth in hair follicles in just two days – that’s pretty quick.“We are looking at using it as a topical treatment, a gel or shampoo that could reach the follicle.”Dr Hawkshaw said there are no known side-effects of the bone drug.The study, published in the journal Public Library of Science Biology, involved hair follicles donated by more than 40 men struggling with baldness.The tissue all started sprouting hair within days of being treated with the drug.Male-pattern baldness is the most common type of hair loss, affecting around half of all men by 50 years of age.Currently only two drugs, minoxidil and finasteride, are available to treat the condition.But both have side-effects and do not always work.The only other option to balding blokes is hair transplantation.Scientists have also discovered a new drug that could cure baldness, especially in patients with alopecia.Researchers at Columbia University Medical Center found 75 per cent of patients with moderate to severe alopecia showed significant hair regrowth after taking the drug ruxolitinib.By the end of the treatment the average hair regrowth among patients was 92 per cent.Previous research has found that football players are more likely to go bald as repeated trauma to the hairline can cause chronic inflammation, which in turn can cause alopecia.Male pattern baldness is the most common type of hair loss in men.It is a genetic condition that follows a pattern of a receding hairline and hair thinning on the crown of the head.It is caused by a hormonal and genetic predisposition.Each strand of hair you have sits in a tiny hole in the skin called a follicle.Generally, baldness occurs when the hair follicle shrinks over time, resulting in shorter and finer hair until, eventually, the follicle does not grow new hair.There are several options available to men who suffer from hair loss.Hair transplants: Removing tiny plugs of hair from areas where the hair is continuing to grow and placing them in areas that are balding. The procedure usually requires multiple sessions and may be expensive.Minoxidil: A solution that is applied directly to the scalp to stimulate the hair follicles. It slows hair loss for many men, and some men grow new hair but hair loss will return when you stop using it.Propecia: A drug that interferes with the production of a highly active form of testosterone that is linked to baldness. It slows hair loss. It works slightly better than minoxidil but hair loss will still return when you stop using this medicineOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

before reporting it to Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000404344398.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"dad invents washing machine heru device heat home hot water food waste burn","story":"Nik Spencer, 48, from Worcestershire, came up with the Home Energy Resources Unit (HERU) while running a recycling plant.It cost Nik £12,000 to create the HERU and he claims a full load of 2.5kg rubbish can produce a tankful of hot water.He said: It is completely inefficient to collect recycling from a home to be taken to a site to be incinerated to generate heat to be used to fuel someones home.What I wanted to do was to effectively cut out the middle man and build something that could do the job of using these materials to generate heat on a smaller scale.Rubbish and food waste including plastic coffee cups, nappies and bottles are placed inside the cylinder which is the size of a washing machine drum.The chamber is heated to 100C (212F) which dries the moisture from the waste to create steam.This steam passes over heat exchangers which transfers it to heat the water supply.The temperature is then ramped up to 300C (572F) which triggers a process called pyrolysis which turns the rubbish into a charcoal-like substance.At this stage of the cycle oxygen is pumped back inside the chamber and is used to burn the pyrolised waste.The energy produced is then used to heat the water in a boiler.After a full cycle the waste is almost completely gone and users simply flush the remaining ash down the drain.There are currently HERUs being trialled in a home, a cafe and another business in Worcestershire.If successful, the firm hopes to roll out production as early as 2020 with an estimated price tag of £3,500."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000404379023.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"driver doing crossword busy motorway at 40mph","story":"The woman seems oblivious to the traffic all around her as she ponders the puzzle on the steering wheel in front of her.Mike Yorke, 39, was returning from a camping trip when he spotted the reckless woman filling in the clues on the busy M4.The cabinet maker from Penarth, South Wales, was in the passenger seat while his wife Jemma, 34, a bank manager, was driving.He said: “The traffic was busy and we were doing about 40mph.“My wife said ‘Is she reading the paper?’“I hate people doing what she was doing and not concentrating on the road.“I recorded her and she was doing a crossword, it was just unbelievable.It’s unreal that anyone thinks they should do that while driving on a motorway.”Mike was returning from camping with Jemma and their two children, two and five, in Newport Parrog, West Wales, when they spotted the woman behind the wheel of the red Renault Clio on Monday around 5.30pm.They were on a notoriously dangerous stretch of the M4 near Port Talbot where average speed cameras have been introduced to reduce crashes.The middle-aged woman, wearing a pink top and with a short bob and sunglasses, seemed completely unaware she was being filmed.During the 14-second clip she can even be seen filling in answer, with Mike commenting: “Oh she’s got that one.”He told The Sun last night: “It’s incredibly dangerous. The traffic was heavy and stopping and starting, all it needed was for her to lose concentration for a second and bang she would have hit someone.“It’s just irresponsible. Given the age of her you would have thought she would know better.”Inspector Rowan Moore, from South Wales Polices roads policing unit, said: Motorists have a responsibility to remain focused on their driving when they are behind the wheel, and anything which may detract from that – as has been reported in this case – is clearly dangerous.South Wales Police takes safety on our roads extremely seriously, and we will take positive action when appropriate in order to educate about, promote and enforce road safety.Through Operation Snap – which has been adopted by all four police forces in Wales – anyone who has dash cam footage of others driving dangerously can submit it online. This allows us to deal with those who compromise all our safety on our roads.A spokesman for Brake, the driving safety charity, said last night: Driving is a highly complex task, where even a momentary lack of focus can be fatal.Filling in a crossword whilst driving is extremely dangerous behaviour and this driver’s actions could have had potentially lethal consequences.Our roads are busy places, and we would urge drivers to keep their eyes on the road, hands on the wheel and place any distractions, such as mobile phones or crosswords, out of reach.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If our politicians genuinely respect democracy and the public interest they must defeat both.The amendment by Labour’s deputy leader Tom Watson to the Data Protection Bill is a jaw-droppingly blatant and probably illegal attempt to shut down newspapers he dislikes.It would compel every paper to submit to controversial State-backed ­regulator Impress, funded by his own millionaire benefactor Max Mosley. Every paper, that is, except the Labour-supporting .Incredibly, it is exempt.The free Press would reject such control — so new rules would force us to fund any legal claims against us even if we WON. Investigative journalism would be axed overnight as too risky. Hundreds of papers could be bankrupted and thousands of journalists dumped on the dole.The winners would be crooked politicians, tycoons and celebrities — placed in effect beyond scrutiny — and the Labour Party, having silenced its critics.Ed Miliband’s “Leveson 2” is just as bad: ANOTHER public inquiry, at vast cost, to rake yet again over the ashes of Press wrongdoing two decades ago.Even  opposes that.Maybe Miliband missed “Leveson 1” and all the (failed) trials of journalists.Maybe he hasn’t noticed that the Press is fighting for life in a totally new media landscape dominated by Facebook and Google, that it has changed its practices entirely and has a new regulator, IPSO, far more potent than any before it.The truth, though, is that neither Miliband nor Watson really care much about improving Press practices or securing justice for victims of intrusion. They seek revenge for The Sun abandoning Labour in 2009 and then exposing Miliband’s unsuitability to run Britain.They want a tame media “free” to churn out left-wing positions.If these amendments go ahead, the rest of the civilised world will regard Britain with horror.Dictators crush free speech . . . liberal democracies don’t.The Government, to its credit, opposes both proposals. Our free Press is not perfect, nor can it be.But Britain is better for its newspapers, and these toxic plans will damage our country immensely.They must be voted out.They have been unhappy about stories written about them in the past.I too bear the scars of having had tabloid press stories written about my private life.Some of these were inaccurate or purely salacious.That is the price of being in the public eye, although I also know the distress that such coverage can cause to others, particularly the families of those involved.However, the alternative of state controls on the Press is far more damaging and dangerous.The media play a vital role in a free society in exposing wrongdoing and holding governments to account.It is no accident that it is the world’s most authoritarian states which impose strict controls on their media.Britain is seen across the world as a bastion of liberty and human rights.It is essential that we reject these amendments and not put that reputation at risk.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I didn’t kill anybody.“Baby P’s mum and Maxine Carr don’t get the abuse that I do.“None of it’s true. I’m on the edge.

His successor Kate Emms was signed off with PTSD after working for Mr Bercow for less than a year. The Speaker continues to deny any of the bullying allegations against him.And in a damning verdict on the Speaker, Parliament’s ex-‘Black Rod’ David Leakey said that the bullying claims made by former aides “risks bringing Parliament into disrepute”.He told the PoliticsHome website that Mr Bercow was “unworthy of someone in public office” and described the Speaker as “genuinely intimidating”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Lawmakers in Tehran have insulted the US president over his decision to pull out of the pact, saying he isn\u0027t mentally fit for office. Politicians also burned a symbolic copy of the Iran deal at the first session of parliament since Trump announced the US would pull out of the nuclear agreement. Trump called the Obama-era deal decaying and rotten and an embarrassment, leaving the UK, France and Germany and other nations scrambling to save it amid fears the president\u0027s move could lead to a new war in the Middle East.  Ali Larijani, the speaker of Iran\u0027s parliament, insulted the US president and called the move a political show that threatens his country\u0027s peace and security. He said: Trump does not have the mental capacity to deal with issues. He also said the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran should be ready to resume all nuclear activities.  General Mohammad Baqeri, the chief of staff of Iran\u0027s military, has said Iran did not have to sign the deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).  He added: But that arrogant country (America) did not even stand by its signature. The head of Iran\u0027s Revolutionary Guard, Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari, hit out at the West, saying Europeans are tied to the US and cannot make an independent decision. Observers have said America\u0027s withdrawal threats to spark political turmoil within Tehran\u0027s power structure.  President Hassan Rouhani, meanwhile, has said Iran would remain committed to the pact, aimed at stopping Tehran from developing nuclear weapons, despite Trump\u0027s announcement. But he warned that Iran was prepared to resume its nuclear activities. He said in a televised speech: If we achieve the deal\u0027s goals in cooperation with other members of the deal, it will remain in place. By exiting the deal, America has officially undermined its commitment to an international treaty.  I have ordered the foreign ministry to negotiate with the European countries, China and Russia in coming weeks. If at the end of this short period we conclude that we can fully benefit from the JCPOA with the cooperation of all countries, the deal would remain. But he warned: If needed, we will resume our nuclear enrichment at the industrial level without any limit. From now on, everything depends on Iran\u0027s national interests. Iran\u0027s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, had said Iran would shred the agreement if the US withdrew. The pact was reached between Iran and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council - Britain, China, France, Russia and the US - and Germany in 2015.

They can uphold 350 years of press freedom or stop newspapers from holding the rich, the powerful and the corrupt to account. In Britain we believe in decency and fairness. We want those who rig the system, whether it is MPs fiddling their expenses or slum landlords ripping off tenants, to be held responsible. And the main champion of the underdog in our open and democratic society is the Press. Yet the freedoms the Press enjoy – and with it the ability to expose wrongdoing – are under threat.  In the latest World Press Freedom Index, the UK was ranked 40th in the world behind countries such as Jamaica and Chile. And if two Labour MPs have their way today, those freedoms could be further eroded. Tom Watson and Ed Miliband have hijacked the Data Protection Bill by tabling amendments which could have serious consequences for investigative journalism, the viability of local papers and the openness of our democracy. What will the Tom Watson amendment do? The Shadow Culture Secretary is trying to resurrect a modified form of Section 40 of the Crime and Courts Court Act. This proposes that unless papers sign up to the state-recognised regulator IMPRESS, they will have to pay the legal costs of both sides in data protection cases, even if they win. The amendment exempts not-for-profit publishers such as the  and the Observer and titles in specific regions with a turnover below \u0026pound100million. But it would still cover 85% of local papers as most are owned by media companies, such as the Mirror’s publisher Reach, with turnovers above that amount. Watson is a friend of former Formula One boss Sir Max Mosley, who has harboured a deep loathing for newspapers since the News of the World revealed he took part in an S\u0026ampM party with prostitutes. He bankrolls IMPRESS through an arms-length charity and also gave Watson a \u0026pound500,000 donation to fund office costs and staff – money Watson has declined to give back despite the revelation Mosley published a campaign leaflet in the 1960s which linked non-white immigrants to diseases such as VD and leprosy.  Why should it be resisted? Local newspaper editors and freedom of speech campaigners say the amendment will cause irreparable damage to journalism. Editors will not be able to risk running stories exposing corruption or wrongdoing if they know it will result in expensive legal action. Jodie Ginsberg of Index on Censorship said it could be used by people to avoid exposure, even in cases such as the Windrush scandal where exposure is in the public interest. The main beneficiaries of Watson’s amendment would be those who want to wipe their grubby reputations clean by removing stories from the internet. This could include paedophiles with historical convictions or shady businessmen who want to start up their next dodgy venture. These are the sort of people who would threaten us with a data protection claim, knowing we would have to pay all the costs of the case unless we removed the articles about them from our websites, preventing you from seeing the truth. Mosley recently threatened the Mirror with a Data Protection Act claim concerning revelations about him that were heard in open court and are still available online. We are defending it vigorously. However, if the Watson amendment goes through, Mosley would get all the costs of his claim even if he lost, unless we were to join IMPRESS, the regulator HE helped found and finances through a trust. Media lawyer Antony White says the Watson amendment could also be illegal.  Who regulates the press? In the wake of the phone hacking scandal, the British press has changed the way it operates. Following the recommendation of Sir Brian Leveson’s inquiry, the majority of the country’s papers set up an independent regulator called IPSO. More than 2,600 print and online titles are now covered by IPSO which has the power to impose fines of up to \u0026pound1million and demand front page apologies for serious breaches. An independent review of IPSO by Sir Joseph Pilling found it to be independent, effective and compliant with most of Leveson’s recommendations. What is wrong with IMPRESS? No title of any significance has signed up to IMPRESS – and there are not just concerns about the motives of Mosley. It is governed by a Royal Charter, which in turn is overseen by politicians on the Privy Council. Any organisation that accepts it as its regulator also agrees, by extension, to state control. While the present regime may not interfere through the Privy Council, a future regime could use it to exert control over the press.

Unfortunately for the Labour leader the House of Lords gave a timely reminder last night that it is not just the Tories who are riven on the issue.  More than 80 Labour peers defied the leadership to back a cross-party amendment to keep the UK in the European Economic Area.  While this will almost certainly be overturned in the Commons (but not without a mini rebellion by the most ardent Labour Europhiles) it points to wider problem for the Labour leadership. Even if you put aside Corbyn’s own ambivalence about the European project, the party is wrestling with how to placate a membership which is overwhelmingly pro-EU without alienating further leave voting supporters in Labour’s traditional heartlands.  Last week’s local elections were a stark reminder of the challenge facing Labour.   The party failed to make gains in places such as Nuneaton, Basildon, Walsall and Derby - all former or current Labour areas which voted to leave. At the same time it is benefiting from the anti-Brexit backlash among Tory voters in the metropolitan areas. The risk for Labour is its policy of ambiguity on Brexit has diminishing returns. Purist Remainers could turn to the Lib Dems or Greens, while Leave voters will feel betrayed if Labour fails to fulfil the result of the referendum. There are two votes in Parliament today which are too close to call.  One will see Labour try to force the government to reverse its decision to scrap student nurses’ grants .   The second will see MPs look to impose fresh regulations on the press .   Tom Watson has tabled an amendment to the Data Protection Bill which threatens the future of investigative journalism.  There is a good explainer by James Ball in the New Statesman here of the problems with Watson’s proposal .  If his amendment is carried then papers could be cowed from challenging those with the deepest pockets: the multinationals and the millionaires. Unless papers sign up to the state-recognise regulator they will, with a few exceptions, be forced to pay the legal costs of any action even if they subsequently win the case. For a national newspaper this is sufficiently chilling, for a local paper it is a form of censorship. There is no way a regional title already operating on limited resources would dare to challenge wrongdoing by a local bigwig or company if they face financial ruin. Bizarrely, Watson is exempting the  from this measure but not local papers such as the Liverpool Echo. This means the  and the Echo could publish the same story but only the former would be protected. There are many questions about the state of our media.  The lack of voices on the left, the influence of foreign-based press barons, the dominance of Facebook, the spread of fake news, the lack of accountability of the tech giants, the group think.  All of these are worthy subjects for discussion.  Refighting old wars seems a curious sense of priorities.

Theresa May has insisted Britain will also leave the European Union\u0027s single market and customs union after it quits the bloc next March. A total of 83 Labour peers voted for an amendment tabled by Lord Alli which would see the UK remain part of the European Economic Area - and effectively the single market. The government suffered two earlier losses, when peers backed plans to remove references to official Brexit date from the face of the bill as well as plans to keep the UK in EU agencies after Brexit. The vote to stay in the Single Market passed by 245 to 218, majority 27, in defiance of both the Government and Opposition frontbenches.  Labour\u0027s official stance was to abstain but 83 Labour peers rebelled against the frontbench while 17 Tories rebelled against the Government by supporting the amendment. The EEA allows for the free movement of persons, goods, services and capital within the European single market. Labour\u0027s Lord Alli said continued membership of the EEA was vital to ensure the future profitability of the UK\u0027s export business.  He said: It is the EEA that deals with services, services like retail, tourism, transport, communications, financial services and aerospace where we have a \u0026pound14 billion trade surplus in these services. The customs union only will benefit our European neighbours in their imports and without an EEA equivalent it will damage our profitable export business and therefore the jobs and livelihoods of many thousands of people. It\u0027s for that reason that we need to ensure that any continuation of the customs union must include a continuation in the EEA or its equivalent.  Tory former minister Baroness Verma spoke in favour of the amendment, telling peers that continued membership of the EEA offered businesses certainty. Labour former Cabinet minister and ex-European trade commissioner Lord Mandelson also spoke passionately in support of the amendment, warning peers not to be bullied and to do what was right for the country. Stressing the huge importance of services to the UK economy, Lord Mandelson warned the impact of quitting the single market without EEA access on cross-border delivery of services to Europe would be savage with a significant proportion of broadcast production, banking and insurance hit for six. Responding for the government, Brexit minister Lord Callanan warned remaining in the EEA would not deliver control of our borders or our laws.  He said: On borders it would mean that we would have to continue to accept all four freedoms of the single market, including freedom of movement.  On laws it would mean the UK having to implement new EU legislation over which in future we will have little influence and, of course, we will have no vote. This will not deliver on the British people\u0027s desire as expressed in the referendum to have more direct control over decisions that affect their daily lives. Labour rebels backing the amendment included former party leader Lord Kinnock, Lord Mandelson and ex-Cabinet minister Lord Hain. The Tory rebels included former Cabinet minister Lord Patten of Barnes and former deputy prime minister Lord Heseltine. Former Labour leader Neil Kinnock pointed out that MPs were whipped to vote in favour of an amendment in line with the one proposed by Lord Alli back in December. Commenting on tonight\u0027s defeat for the Government in the House of Lords on the Single Market, Liberal Democrat Leader in the Lords, Lord Newby said: “This victory sends a clear message to those sat round the Cabinet table that Parliament won’t just sit back while Theresa May leads us towards a hard Brexit.

Pompeo arrived in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, on Wednesday from Japan and headed to the city’s Koryo Hotel for meetings. Trump earlier broke the news of Pompeo’s second visit to North Korea in less than six weeks and said the two countries had agreed on a date and location for the summit, though he stopped short of providing details. An official at South Korea’s presidential Blue House said Pompeo was expected to finalise the date of the summit, and secure the release of three American detainees.  While Trump said it would be a “great thing” if the American detainees were freed, Pompeo, speaking to reporters en route to Pyongyang, said he had not received such a commitment but hoped North Korea would “do the right thing.” “We’ll talk about it again today,” he said. “I think it’d be a great gesture if they would choose to do so.” The three still being held are Korean-American missionary Kim Dong-chul Kim Sang-duk, also known as Tony Kim, who spent a month teaching at the foreign-funded Pyongyang University of Science and Technology (PUST) before he was arrested in 2017 and Kim Hak-song, who also taught at PUST.  Until now, the only American released by North Korea during Trump’s presidency has been Otto Warmbier, a 22—year-old university student who returned to the United States in a coma last summer after 17 months of captivity and died days later. Warmbier’s death escalated U.S.-North Korea tensions, already running high at the time over Pyongyang’s stepped-up missile tests. The groundwork for the potential release of the three remaining American detainees was laid two months ago when North Korea’s foreign minister travelled to Sweden and proposed the idea, CNN reported earlier, citing an unnamed source. Pompeo’s visit comes a day after Kim Jong Un made his second trip to China in less than two months, meeting President Xi Jinping and discussing the ongoing international talks over North Korea’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes.

Billionaire Viktor Vekselberg, who is believed to have ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, is reported to have paid Michael Cohen $500,000, according to CNN. The questions asked of the Russian suggest prosecutors have been examining some of Cohen\u0027s business relationships as part of the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.  Vekselberg is one of two Russian oligarchs the FBI stopped earlier this year after their private jets landed in New York-area airports as part of Mueller\u0027s investigation.  The huge sum of money was transferred to Cohen in the months after the 2016 election according to the attorney of porn star Stormy Daniels, who is suing the president. The adult actress’s lawyer Michael Avenatti claimed the alleged funding was from Vekselberg in a tweet on Tuesday.  He claims the money may have been used to reimburse the $130,000 Cohen paid to Daniels weeks before the election to ensure she never spoke of her supposed affair with Trump.   Last week, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani claimed the President had reimbursed Cohen the money himself. Cohen had earlier said that the non-disclosure payment came from his own funds, and Trump had told he was unaware it had been made. Yesterday Avenatti released a seven-page report with preliminary findings of the bank account he says Cohen used to make the payment to Daniels.  It states: “Mr Cohen inexplicably accepted these payments while he was the personal attorney to the President and holding himself out at times as employed by the Trump Organization (with few other clients). “This was occurring at the same time significant questions were being raised relating to (a) the involvement of Russia and Vladimir Putin in the 2016 Presidential Election and (b) the extent of the relationship between Mr Putin and Mr Trump.

Labour will force a binding vote that sources claim could force the Prime Minister “back to the drawing board”. Bursaries have already been axed last year. But Labour says its motion - if it passed - would effectively stop the system that replaces them becoming law. Labour sources claim this would send a “clear message from the Commons” that the grants should be brought back.  Shadow Health Secretary Jon Ashworth said axing bursaries “led to a huge fall in numbers applying for these courses and threatens to make the NHS staffing crisis even worse.” Shadow Education Secretary Angela Rayner added: “If Tory MPs want their constituents to believe they want to protect our NHS, then they will have to vote for it.”  Nursing students have been forced take loans for their living costs and fees of up to \u0026pound9,250 since bursaries were ditched in September 2017. Applications have already plummeted from 65,620 in 2016 to 53,010 in 2017. And an government impact assessment in February admitted the cut could put poor, female and older students off entering the profession. Mrs May - who has a tiny majority - faces the threat that her DUP allies may fail to back her in the vote.

Bungling Caroline Nokes was forced to correct herself minutes after telling MPs: “I don’t think I’ve had any cases of wrongful deportation brought to my attention.” Her claim was instantly contradicted by Labour MP Stephen Doughty, who unveiled a letter by Ms Nokes’ predecessor showing his constituent was wrongly deported to Somalia. Hugh Ind, Home Office Director-General of Immigration Enforcement, then confirmed there were “a handful” of wrongful deportations in six years - estimating around five. Asked why no one briefed her about the cases - which are not Windrush citizens - Ms Nokes said: “I don’t think I can answer that.”  The furious clash, at a three-hour hearing of the Commons Home Affairs Committee, sparked fresh questions about ministers’ competence in the wake of the Windrush scandal .   It came as reports emerged that the Home Office was repeatedly warned Windrush citizens were being wrongly classed as illegal immigrants as early as 2013. Ms Nokes confirmed the Home Office is combing through 8,000 records of Windrush-era citizens who “may have been removed incorrectly” since 2002. She stressed that did not mean 8,000 people were wrongly removed, and officials had still not found one wrongful Windrush removal, “but it’s very clear that people have been detained.” But Mr Doughty fumed: “Why should we have any confidence that when you’re doing the deep trawl of Windrush cases you’ll be able to find out what’s gone on?”  Labour MP Naz Shah said: “You got it wrong on Windrush. How much more do you want to get wrong?” Committee chairwoman Yvette Cooper warned there was a “culture of disbelief” in the Home Office and “pressure in the Home Office to get as many people as possible to leave”. She declared: “It does feel like, frankly, the system is in a real mess.”  It came as the government launched an urgent inquiry into events leading to Amber Rudd ’s resignation as Home Secretary.  Theresa May’s ethics tsar Sir Alex Allan will probe what advice officials gave before Ms Rudd wrongly claimed “we don’t have targets” for removing illegal migrants. Home Office chiefs confirmed there were targets to remove illegal migrants in 2015/16, 2016/17, and 2017/18. In 2017/18 it was set at 12,800 “enforced returns” and later lowered to 230 to 250 per week.  But MPs branded the Home Office’s most senior civil servant “slippery” after he described the figure as an “expectation” or “ambition”, not a “target”. Permanent secretary Sir Philip Rutnam also faced disbelief as he tried to rebuff questions by saying: “I’m not an expert on the immigration system”. MP John Woodcock branded Sir Philip “Sir Humphrey-tastic” and the lack of knowledge “embarrassing”, telling the top mandarin: “Do you understand how absurd this sounds to normal people?” Mr Woodcock also accused top Home Office civil servant Glyn Williams of “lying” about removal targets in an earlier hearing. Sir Philip said the claim was “a very serious accusation of dishonesty which I do not accept.” Committee chairwoman Yvette Cooper told Sir Philip: “This is basically like you’re playing games with us. It’s like if we don’t use the right word in the question it’s okay for you not to give us proper information. “It all feels really slippery.” Mr Doughty accused officials of “slippery tactics”. He added: “What on earth is going on in your department if we can’t get answers to the most basic questions that have been repeatedly raised with you?” The \u0027Windrush generation\u0027 are British residents who arrived from Commonwealth countries before New Year\u0027s Day 1973. They are named after the Empire Windrush, the ship which brought some of the first Caribbean migrants to Britain in 1948. Anyone who arrived in the UK from a Commonwealth country before 1973 has a legal right to stay, unless they left the UK for more than two years. But they faced being threatened with deportation under new immigration rules despite living and working here for decades. People were ordered to prove they have the right to be in the UK to rent property, work or access services and benefits. The government failed to keep detailed records of Windrush arrivals, and landing cards were destroyed in 2010. The Home Office set up a task force with the aim of sorting out cases within two weeks. Windrush immigrants are also being granted fee-free citizenship and a compensation scheme, the rules of which have not been set yet.

It came as enforcement chief Mr Ind admitted there was a “deep problem” with unlawful immigration detention - with \u0026pound3.3million paid out in compensation to victims last year. HM Chief Inspector of Prisons Peter Clarke told MPs he was still waiting for detention centres to draw up improvement plans as far back as 2016. One centre alone held 23 detainees for more than a year while deaths in detention, including self-inflicted deaths, “have risen very markedly”, MPs heard. In nine cases, detention continued despite officials acknowledging torture had taken place.

Nine months before her big day the mum-of-two, 26, decided it was now or never and started working to shift the pounds. She said: I felt self-conscious about my weight and was nicknamed \u0027Big C\u0027. Although I laughed along, it really hurt. I used to eat up to 15 biscuits a day – two or three with each cup of tea. I realised I didn\u0027t want to be a fat bride.  Charlotte, who lives in Rugby, joined her local Xercise4Less gym and completely changed her diet. She was 18st at her biggest and soon started the notice the weight falling off. When her wedding day finally arrived Charlotte was 8st lighter and five dress sizes smaller - and she looked stunning.  She said: I started off losing around two pounds a week, and people started to notice when I hit the 80kg mark. Everyone was really encouraging. I\u0027ve always been the same, outgoing-ness wise, but I no longer felt embarrassed to be myself around everyone, other than just close friends. Diet played a huge role in her transformation, and she\u0027s now shared a daily food plan to try and help others. An average day BEFORE the change  Breakfast - Cereal - usually granola with milk Lunch - Sandwich, meat and cheese with crisps and yogurt Dinner - Freezer tapas, chicken kievs and chips Snacks - Lots of biscuits  An average day AFTER the change  Breakfast - porridge with skimmed milk Lunch - Weetabix with skimmed milk and a banana Dinner - Something from the Hairy Bikers cookbook, normally about 600kcal Snacks - A small amount of chocolate  Charlotte is now approaching her first wedding anniversary and she\u0027s set herself a new fitness challenge - an obstacle race.

Supporters will gather to pay their respects, including in Springfield Park, next to the hospital where Alfie spent much of his life.  Nearly 5,000 people have so far said they will attend on Facebook , the Liverpool Echo reports .  The event is being organised by Danielle Hambleton, one of the leaders of the ‘Alfie’s Army’ Facebook campaign, who described the boy as a “beautiful soldier”.  Danielle wrote on the event’s Facebook page: “Join us at Springfield Park to brighten up the world for what would of been Alfie’s 2nd birthday. “Please bring your own candles, let show as much love as possible for our beautiful soldier. “Alfie James Evans we love you.”  Organisers are also expected to release balloons in Newcastle and London while others in Australia and USA have offered to stream their personal vigils on Twitter. Alfie, who suffered from an undiagnosed brain condition, was at the centre of a long-running legal battle between his parents and Alder Hey Children’s Hospital.  His parents Tom Evans, 21, and Kate James, 20, wanted to take him abroad to Italy for further treatment - but doctors said this was not possible. Alfie, who was in a deep coma, had been suffering from a rare condition that doctors said had irreversibly destroyed much of his brain.  Earlier this year, a court ruled in the hospital’s favour and said it was in Alfie’s best interests to turn off his ventilation and start end-of-life care. The fight to keep Alfie alive saw his parents take the case to the High Court, Supreme Court and eventually The European Court of Human Rights - who ruled their case inadmissible and upheld the previous ruling.  The couple then made a final plea to the Court of Appeal - their second attempt at appealing - on April 16, when lawyers for the family argued that denying Alfie the right to go to Rome would be an infringement on his human rights under the Habeas Corpus (unlawful detention) argument.  However, Lord Justices Moylan and Davis, and Lady Justice King ruled there was no basis for the argument and upheld the previous ruling for a second time. A further appeal to The Supreme Court was denied, and the European Court of Human Rights said they would not allow a further appeal.

Claire Upshall, now 28, went to work at an orphanage in 2009, where she fell in love with little orphan Alfie, then aged one. She travelled back to the UK when her seven weeks were up, but she couldn\u0027t get Alfie out of her mind and within weeks she quit her job and headed back to Africa. There she began to care for 200 orphaned or abandoned children. And over just a 13 month stretch she adopted Alfie and three more children from orphanages - Layla and Isabella, now both eight, and Jack, now five.  Single mum Claire is now amid a \u0026pound34,000 battle to get her family to the UK. Unable to find work in Tanzania she has just weeks of savings left, and is crowdfunding to pay for the flights, visas and paperwork to get back to the UK where she\u0027ll get work. Claire from Christchurch, Dorset, said: When I went out for that first trip it was a dream come true to live and work in the orphanage, constantly hearing the laughs and cries of the little ones. I developed a connection with Alfie very early on, but I didn\u0027t for a minute think I would become his mum - that was never the plan.  But I fell in love with the country, the people, the babies and more specifically, that one little boy. One by one our little family grew and I went from one to four in 13 months. It\u0027s not what I had in mind when I went out there aged 19, but it just fits and I couldn\u0027t imagine life any differently now. I always thought it would be important for my children to be in their own culture, and I still think their culture is incredibly important. But I need paid work, and can\u0027t find it, and there is a lot to be said about the importance of growing up around your extended family.  I made that decision in late 2014 - and I\u0027ve been working towards it ever since. Claire said when she was a little girl she\u0027d talk about her dream of looking after the babies in Africa. She was working as a nanny when she flew to Tanzania on New Year\u0027s Eve 2009 for seven weeks after Googling \u0027African baby home\u0027. \u0027New kid\u0027 Alfie, then 13-month-old was placed in her arms and she soon made it her personal mission to get the serious little toddler to smile I spent a lot of time caring for him and after a couple of weeks he started smiling at me - but only me, she said.  Now that serious little boy is my eldest son. She was in floods of tears when it was time to come home in February 2009, and within weeks she\u0027d quit her job to return for a further five weeks with Alfie and the kids. It helped her make up her mind to come home to the UK and work for a year to fund a longer stretch abroad. After a year as a live-in nanny, she moved back to Tanzania in May 2011, to manage the orphanage, in charge of 20 staff and up to 54 babies at a time. Little Alfie had been moved to another orphanage 15km away, and she visited hoping to sponsor his education - but ended up adopting him.  Within five months he was living with me as my son. Now he\u0027s nine. He didn\u0027t speak a word of English and she spoke no Swahili at the time, but they bonded by rolling bouncy balls down the corridors of their new home. I loved him and he loved me and we just fitted together as a team. Just a couple of months later, in December 2011, two-year-old Layla was welcomed into the family. \u0027Girly girl\u0027 Layla could no longer be cared for by her parents, and had met Claire during her first volunteering stint, when she was just five-months-old.  Claire would often short-term foster particularly vulnerable and malnourished children from the orphanage, to give them round the clock care. Just three months after her brood grew to two, she was called to pick up a tiny girl from a nearby village, who could no longer be cared for by her parents. Claire was told the 10lb \u0027baby\u0027 was five-months-old, but she turned out to be an extremely malnourished two-year-old. Caring Claire took her in full-time to give her the best chance of survival and four months on, in July 2012, Isabella, now eight, was officially handed over to Claire. She just instantly fit in and was part of the family, said Claire.  I sort of thought \u0027what\u0027s another one?\u0027, you know. Six months on Claire moved to Arusha, Tanzania, to set up a new baby orphanage in March 2012. She met 4lb abandoned baby Jack, then ten days old, eight months later when she picked him up from hospital. Jack was so small he needed to be woken up to feed, and needed constant warmth, so Claire carried him in a \u0027kangaroo\u0027 sling while she worked in the office. Waking up through the night to feed him cemented their bond, and she adopted him eight months later in August 2013. In 13 months I went from caring for one to caring for four, she said. Sometimes when I think about it, I realise it is a bit crazy, but it just fitted and felt right.  Ever since I was a young girl I wanted a big family. When I got Alfie I did think \u0027two and I\u0027ll stop\u0027, but it just happened and it worked, and my childhood wish came true. With four children to look after, she left the orphange to support her super-sized family and has been searching for paid work ever since. The four children are now thriving at school, and Claire is almost fluent in Swahili, but she has found it impossible to find work. She has relied on regular payments from her parents, Helen, 63, a catering worker, and Derek, 65, a retired carpenter, who passed away earlier this year. She has also returned home for short work stints when money was particularly tight, and has been helped by friends and family back in the UK.

Laura Jackson, 32, says becoming a single parent had a dramatic financial impact leaving her living on \u0026pound2,000 less every month. Instead of spending money on healthy meals for herself, she made sure her children ate good food and she would sit alone in the house and snack on pizza and chips, chocolate and 50p biscuit packs. Cooking a healthy meal for one is expensive and I wanted to save my money to make sure the children had enough, she told Mirror. I always fed them good quality food but biscuits, chips and pizza are so much cheaper than a chicken breast so that\u0027s what I would eat. And I\u0027ve always loved chocolate!  Laura would also make \u0027bad choices\u0027, eating too many takeaways and meals out in restaurants. I was going out loads and enjoying life too much, Laura said. I was a single mum and I gorged if I had a good day and I gorged if I had a bad day. I ate to console myself when things went wrong and to reward myself as a treat.  However, it wasn\u0027t long before Laura, then 28, piled on more than 6st and went from a size 14 to a size 22. One day while out shopping with friends she realised that she had gained so much weight that shops did not stock clothes big enough to fit her.  Determined to lose weight she started a meal replacement programme and a high protein diet but she still craved cake and found that many supermarkets did not stock any healthy alternatives to her liking. So Laura went home and started experimenting in the kitchen, baking healthy, protein-based snacks for her and her family and in doing so, she stumbled on a major gap in the market. Since starting The Protein Bakery in August last year, Laura has piled on the pounds again by building a multi-million pound business in just eight months creating \u0027healthy\u0027 guilt-free cakes. Her business has a projected turnover of almost \u0026pound3m for the first year and she has secured deals with two national supermarket chains. She counts Strictly Come Dancing and Emmerdale star Gemma Atkinson, a host of sporting professionals and The Real Housewives Of Cheshire among The Protein Bakery\u0027s celebrity fans.  Laura believes her determination was key to making it a success. People said \u0027you can\u0027t do it, you have no experience, you won\u0027t get retailers to listen to you.\u0027 But I was determined. I wanted a better life for my kids and I believed there was a gap in the market, she said. Her children, William, 10, Gabriella, 9, Elodie, 5, and Mila, 2, were her chief product testers and once they loved her cakes and could not tell that they were \u0027healthy\u0027, she knew she was onto a winner. I invested my own money in it. I Googled about business and recipes all night. I went into sales meetings and had to look up what business terminology meant on my phone to learn that language. I sent samples to celebrities like Gemma Atkinson, Christine McGuiness and Duncan from Blue with a handwritten note asking them to mention the product on their social media accounts if they liked them. Usually you have to pay for endorsement but I could not afford that. They were so kind and it really worked. After Gemma Atkinson shared my product on Instagram I got 700 new followers almost instantly. I think my story also inspires a lot of people. I was a single mum, struggling with my weight who became a business entrepreneur creating healthy snacks. I was scared at first to put myself out there but I realised that if you want people to buy your product they need to know who you are. Sharing my personal story really helped me build the business.  Her experience as a cash-strapped single mum also inspired her to keep the cost down. Her protein snacks will sell as three bars for \u0026pound2 as opposed to \u0026pound2.49 for one. I used to feel guilty as a single mum that I could not afford to buy healthier snacks for my kids. I want everyone to be able to afford these. I select my ingredients carefully and really think about how to produce them cost-effectively. I\u0027m also careful not to be greedy. I would rather work on lower profit margins so the products can be accessible to everyone. As a former dieter, she was inspired to create a high-protein product sold on the baked goods aisle instead of being hidden away on the healthy foods shelf - a first Laura claims for that product category. I want my products to be accessible to everyone so that someone like me can walk by and buy a guilt-free treat. A high-protein diet is beneficial to many people, not just body-builders or gym fanatics. They\u0027re made with healthy, everyday ingredients and you can make them at home so they belong on that aisle. Before her baking revolution she had a beautician business in her home town of Congleton, Cheshire, which employed three people but did not have enough to pay for extras like holidays. And in just eight months, what she hoped would be a \u0027pocket-money\u0027 business with an aim of turning over \u0026pound600 a month to save for a a family holiday, quickly became a booming business with a multi-million pound projected turnover.  She just signed a major deal with Asda which will stock her products in 350 stores nationwide from May 17 and in September she will launch with other major retailers. Laura said: I burst into tears when I was told about the deal. I had to really cut back on the kids to pay for packaging and ingredients for the business so to have that financial pressure lifted was incredible. It was like light suddenly dawning at the end of the tunnel. Suddenly I knew I could pay for simple things like my kids\u0027 school trips next month. Laura has an exclusive deal with a bakery to produce her recipes under her guidance and she will employ administrative staff this summer. I need to manage the business but keep time for my kids, I started it for them so if it takes my time away from them the whole thing loses its point, she added. A cookbook is also in the pipeline, followed by baking sets designed to make healthy baking affordable and easy and a cookware and utensils range. While she was on her weight loss journey, which began with meal replacement and a high-protein diet, she met her now husband Dylan in a bar in their local town. The couple welcomed their first child, Mila, into the world in January 2016 and married last year. Laura explained: I was a size 18 at the time and a single mum but he loved me for who I was. He helped me through the dark days when I just wanted to give up. He\u0027s been hugely supportive. Fake it \u0027till you make it: Have confidence in yourself. You can learn something really quickly if you put the effort in and it may surprise you just how much you can achieve. Networking is key: I had no contacts before I started using LinkedIn. Use networking events. By the end of the event you will have helped other people and found solutions for issues of your own. Use social media: LinkedIn was a vital tool for me to make contact with suppliers and retailers. Instagram was a great tool to promote my brand and the business. Goals: Identify what motivates you, focus on what you want to achieve and make small, achievable goals. Keep a clear budget: Costs can quickly spiral and cash-flow issues can arise quickly when you have to pay suppliers before payment comes from sales. Be realistic and very strict with your budget. Use Google and teach yourself: I used to spend all night researching the business online. Initially I did not understand what people said in meetings. Now I walk in and I understand it all. Have a story: Build your personal story and motivation into the identity of your business. A genuine personal story and sharing yourself with your audience helps them relate more to your product."},{"url":null,"title":"fizzy drinks uks biggest cinema","story":"NewsFizzy drinks at some of the UK\u0027s biggest cinema chains found to have \"unacceptable\" bacteria levelsA probe by BBC Watchdog Live revealed the shock findings, with dangerous salmonella discovered in two drinks on sale at multiplex giant Odeon\u0026nbspShareByDave Burke00:07, 9 MAY 2018Updated00:08, 9 MAY 2018NewsBosses at Odeon say they have opened an investigation into the BBC Watchdog findings\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFizzy drinks on sale at three of Britain’s biggest cinema chains contain up to 10,000 times more bacteria than is acceptable, an investigation has found. A probe by BBC Watchdog Live revealed the shock findings, with dangerous salmonella discovered in two drinks on sale at multiplex giant Odeon. The programme, due to be aired tonight, will report that swab tests carried out at 30 branches of Vue, Cineworld and Odeon found seven drinks contained worrying levels of bacteria. On top of this, nine of the cinemas were found offering ice with unacceptable amounts of bacteria. Tony Lewis, head of policy at the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health, said the results showed venues had been “cutting corners”, and told the programme: “I’m concerned we’ve got an indicator of hygiene failure and potential breakdown in terms of management of hygiene in those businesses.”  Chiefs at Odeon - where two high bacteria drinks were found, one containing 10,000 times more than it should - last night said they were investigating and said they took immediate steps to improve hygiene. At one Odeon branch, harmful bacteria listeria - which causes an illness called listeriosis - was found on a drinks holder. An Odeon spokesman told The Mirror: “We were therefore surprised and disappointed at the Watchdog findings and immediately launched our own thorough investigation. “We want to reassure our guests that we have taken immediate steps and have further strengthened procedures with our teams across the UK.” Vue - where one drink was found to have 100 times the accepted level of bacteria, and two ice samples revealed unacceptable bacteria levels - refuted the findings to the show. At Cineworld four drinks and four ice cube samples had unacceptable bacteria levels, with one drink containing 70 times more than is acceptable. Cineworld told the Mirror all the cinemas where tests were carried out had been awarded the maximum Food Hygiene Rating of 5 by their local authority.

Retired priest Philip Clements, 79, wed Florin Marin, then 24, at a low key ceremony in Ramsgate, Kent in April last year.  He said he was making a stance against Church of England rules barring clergymen from same-sex marriage .   But the pair split after just five months, which left Mr Clements penniless after he sold his \u0026pound214,000 home to buy his younger lover a flat in his native Romania, reports KentLive .  But despite a rocky start to married life, the pair have decided to embark on a make or break relationship - with Mr Clements declaring he will write his younger lover into his will if things go to plan. The 79-year-old explained: “I have got to be realistic. I am 80 in August and I want to see him secure.  “He is the only one I can leave things to. I don’t see much of my brothers, and they wouldn’t need it. “If it goes well, he will be in my will. After moving to Bucharest to settle down with his new husband, Mr Clements found himself miserable and lonely when his younger partner would go out clubbing with his friends. The 79-year-old then returned to England without a roof over his head after selling his home, and was forced to live in the annex of a friend\u0027s house. Shortly after they split, the heartbroken ex-priest then discovered Mr Marin to be dating a new boyfriend called Jesus after he appeared on a Romanian TV show. Speaking of Mr Marin\u0027s relationship, the ex-priest said: “Romanian TV has a habit of making things into mini soap operas where they make some sort of story around ordinary people.  “Due to the fact I had left him, they (the TV producers) arranged for him to meet this man. “The story was invented. He is not with him now, even if he was with him. “I’m pretty sure he wasn’t with him, and it was a made up thing.” Despite going their separate ways, the pair never divorced and Mr Clements has since admitted they remained in contact almost everyday. After celebrating their first wedding anniversary in Elche, Spain - where Mr Marin now lives - the pair have since made plans to test the relationship again.  Mr Clements said: We have learned. We have both had to adjust. There were rumours he was with somebody else, but he has denied that. We are planning to spend September and Christmas together, and hopefully it can go from there. But we don\u0027t want to jump too far just yet. He is young, and has plans ahead of him. But I don\u0027t think I\u0027m going to die just yet, there is a few years left in the old boy.

According to insiders workers repairing the roof of Apartment 1, Kensington Palace, were instructed to complete the job quickly, as Prince Harry made it clear him and Meghan plan to start a family soon. Royal courtiers were last year keen to let it be known that the couple would immediately be living at Nottingham Cottage - Harry’s batchelor pad in the grounds of the Kensington Palace - for the foreseeable future. But insiders have known for some time that it was always Harry\u0027s intention to move out of the cosy two-bed Nott Cott as soon as possible and into Apartment 1 - a stunning 21-room wing of the palace.  It was revealed yesterday that the Duke of Gloucester agreed to move out of Apartment 1 shortly after the engagement to allow Harry and Meghan to move in. The Daily Mail\u0027s Royal expert Richard Kay wrote: “Soon after their engagement, the Queen’s cousin Richard — the Duke of Gloucester, 73 — whose three children are now grown up, offered to vacate his splendid 21-room Apartment 1 at the palace so Harry and Meghan could have it — it is next door to William and Kate. The question was, where would the Gloucesters go? “Now the problem has been solved with the departure of the Queen’s private secretary, Sir Christopher Geidt. This has freed up his smaller but very comfortable apartment, seen as ideal for the unfussy Gloucesters, who still carry out many official duties.    The Queen has allowed father-of-two Sir Christopher, 56, to stay on for six months at the prestigious address until the end of the school year. “So when will Harry and Meghan move in? Well, it was more than a year after their wedding before William and Kate moved into Princess Margaret’s old home. “Right now Meghan and Harry are content with the intimate comforts of Nottingham Cottage, with its open fire and chintzy furnishings. Meghan’s influence is everywhere — cashmere throws, scented candles and vases of fresh flowers. “They are putting off as long as possible the dreaded time when they will have to have umpteen servants.  They borrow staff from Clarence House to help out when they really need them for dinner parties. Neither of them is a very good cook. “This extends to cleaning the cottage. Rather than have their own staff, they are using contract cleaners Mitie, the company that ‘does’ the royal palaces. “At the same time, they have been slipping away from the bustle of London to the relative peace of Windsor, where a bolthole at the castle has been made available for their occasional use as they prepare for what will be one of the most microscopically observed occasions of recent times.” Harry and Meghan certainly seem to be in rather a hurry to get a family started. The pace of their romance has been swift to say the least in Royal terms.  Harry spoke back in November of last year about the speed at which he fell for Meghan - it was love at first sight, he said. Lifting the lid on their whirlwind romance, he said \u0027the stars were aligned\u0027 when \u0027this beautiful woman fell into my life\u0027. Harry, 33, also promised he and the American actress, 36, will start a family \u0027in the near future\u0027. The compact cottage is no place for a young prince and his bride to plan for a family. And this might well explain the pace at which work has been rattling on at Apartment 1.  As news crew gathered on last November on the east side of Kensington Palace, it almost seemed as if workers on the roof on the west side of the building were trying to hurriedly remove the gleaming white plastic covering in double quick time so as not to draw attention to renovations. Beneath the sheets it was plain to see that renovations to the roof of Apartment 1 had been happening at lightening quick pace after only a few weeks with new mortar pointing over the chimney stacks clearly visible. Panoramic pictures of the Kensington Palace back then showed the world\u0027s media on the east side of the palace while work on Apartment 1 rattled along unnoticed on the west side of the building. Pictures taken in November showed the entire Apartment 1 still shrouded in white tarpaulins.  Apartment 1 adjoins the 20-room Apartment 1A which Harry’s brother Prince William and his growing family live in. William and Kate also lived at Nottingham Cottage before they started a family - it almost seems like a right of passage for the two Royal brothers. Work on apartment 1 is now almost completed - just in time for Harry\u0027s wedding to Meghan in less than two weeks’ time. The Gloucesters also have other properties they can happily spend time at. A source said: “The Gloucesters have two other properties: Barnwell Manor in Northamptonshire, which they rent out, and a weekend cottage in Gloucestershire, which they could retire to.”  Several years ago a royal spokesman said that Harry had set his sights on grander accommodation at Kensington Palace but refused to confirm which apartment it was, other than to say it was currently occupied. In 2014, another member of the family, Princess Michael, suggested in an interview with Tatler magazine that Apartment 1 would be perfect for Harry to move in to when he got older and wanted to start a family. Princess Michael said William and Kate have a “lovely big apartment, next to the Gloucesters, who I think will leave their enormous apartment because their children have gone.” She added: “They’re rattling around this huge space and I think Prince Harry might go there. Then they’d be next door to each other - very good move.”  It has been rumoured for some time that Harry had his eyes on another larger apartment in Kensington Palace for him and Meghan to move into. The rumoured new apartment was said to be much closer to the huge wing that has been home for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge since September, when they moved back to London from Anmer Hall on the Sandringham estate to coincide with Prince George starting school in Battersea. Indeed Apartment 1 and Apartment 1A are as close together as it is possible to be - they are linked by adjoining doors so Harry and Meghan can come and go to see Kate and William and also visit young Prince George and Princess Charlotte whenever they choose. ‘It\u0027s sweet that Harry and Meghan will be living next to William and Kate. When Harry and Meghan move in permanently, it will be like when William and Harry were kids when their mother was alive - living next door to one another at Kensington Palace.

But the 43-year-old has spoken out in a bid to convince the nation she is not evil and insist she knew nothing of the snatch plot that shocked the nation. Matthews even offered to take a lie detector test about what happened to her daughter when she vanished in February 2008 before being found at an accomplice’s flat tethered to a bed. And without any hint of remorse over the sick kidnap, she pointed to other vile criminals to justify her claim that she should not be branded evil.  Mum-of-seven Matthews said: “I’m not Britain’s worst mum. I didn’t kill anybody. “Baby P’s mum and Maxine Carr don’t get the abuse that I do. “None of it’s true. I’m on the edge. It makes me want to kill myself but I’d never do that. I’m scared I’ll die lonely and alone.” Despite being found guilty of snatching Shannon when the youngster was nine and serving four years of an eight year sentence, Matthews still refuses to accept she took any part in the plot to cash in on \u0026pound50,000 reward money. She said she was made a “scapegoat” and added: “From the start I didn’t know where she was. Others were involved. I didn’t have a clue. “You can’t kidnap your own child. I know the truth and I wasn’t involved in it. I still have nightmares thinking that it’s all going to happen again.  “I want to take a lie detector test to prove my innocence.” But she says she fears she won’t be forgiven.  Shannon was kidnapped from near her home in Dewsbury Moor, West Yorks. Her disappearance sparked a massive month-long police search. Matthews and her then boyfriend Craig Meehan joined the hunt and she made several public appeals for help to find her daughter. Shannon was found on March 14 at Michael Donovan’s flat in nearby Batley Carr. She had been drugged. Donovan was also found guilty of kidnap, sentenced to eight years and released after four. But he was recalled to prison in 2012 after a bust-up in Leeds. Born-again \u0026shyChristian Matthews spoke about her time behind bars. She said: “When I was first in jail I thought I was going to die. I panicked.  “They were banging on my cell door saying, ‘Come out here, you dirty nonce.’ Prison made me weaker. I don’t feel like the same person any more. I was beaten up inside because of who I was. “Once they threw a snowball with a rock in it at me and other times I was punched. I didn’t say anything, I was too scared.” But Matthews insisted she did make friends, including a transgender prisoner in Peterborough’s segregation unit. And she claimed she had admirers on the outside. She said: “Men used to write to me with semi-naked pictures and ask if I fancied meeting up because everyone makes mistakes.” Matthews also used our interview to deny claims she has a 72-year-old “sugar daddy”, Eric Anderson.  She said: “I have standards. I’m very lonely and I found a friend who I thought I could trust. A true friend. “He was just somebody to talk to because I’ve got nobody else. Somebody has blown our relationship out of context. He did give me money because he wanted to help me. “He got the money from some inheritance and said he wanted to help me out because I’m struggling. “He’s like a father figure to me, like an uncle. There’s no sex involved. I’ve known him for years. Eric takes me for coffee and KFC and tells me not to go with the nasty men I have met and not to be taken advantage of. I’ve sworn off men. I will never get married. I don’t trust them at all. “I’m trying to get my life back on track and everything that is being said is not true.”  Matthews also denied claims she was selling sandwiches to the \u0026shyhomeless that had been handed out free by Pret a Manger shops. She said: “I never sold them I gave them to the homeless. “This woman that’s a church person was handing them out. “It was getting dark earlier and I used to go to help pick them up and take them to the homeless around the station. Sometimes I’d take them to the \u0026shySalvation Army. It makes me sick what was said, that’s not me. I was doing it out of the goodness of my heart.”  Matthews was relocated to a town in the south of England for her own safety after being released from prison. She said she spends her days walking from charity shop to charity shop, trawling for bargains. But she also works as a volunteer in a \u0026shyChristian charity shop. She added: “I am really proud of getting a job. It makes me feel like I’ve achieved \u0026shysomething for myself. “I feel I’m not being judged when I’m there. I love my job and I love going in every time. They say I’m a good worker, one of their best and I could get a paid job in the future.”  But Matthews revealed she has now stopped going to church. She said: “People found out who I was and I was getting grief there, people saying, ‘Oh, do you know who that is?’ “I felt uncomfortable and there were kids there as well. I still believe in God, I just don’t go to church now.” Matthews lives in a one-bedroom basement flat with her budgie Bob. She said she is still “terribly lonely” and added: “I talk to Bob when I get home. I feed him from my hand. “I don’t want a man. I don’t trust them. It’s just me and the budgie now.” Because of her time behind bars Matthews said she is uncomfortable indoors. She added: “I hate being trapped. I have to get out.”  When she goes out she puts a head band on to cover up her roots as her natural ginger hair starts to appear. She isn’t very well – doctors said she has gallstones – and she is on pills to ease the pain as she awaits surgery. Matthews said: “It scared me. I’ve lost six stone since because it was down to fatty foods. I used to eat lots of sweets but now I try to eat better.” Last year the BBC screened a drama, The Moorside, about \u0026shyShannon’s kidnap. Gemma Whelan starred as Matthews, Sheridan Smith played her best pal Julie Bushby and Sian Brooke was neighbour Natalie Brown. In the past, Matthews has spoken to the Mirror about how the only thing she missed in jail was sex and \u0026shyshopping. In another interview she claimed she knew where Shannon was after she had been snatched – contradicting her own story. Karen Matthews has not been paid for this interview.

Leanne Bale and her teenage daughter Taylor formed a search party when Joe Cannon didn\u0027t return from a ride out on his new 125cc motorbike - bought so he could start another job. But they came across the scene of a tragic accident. Paramedics spent an hour battling to save the young dad after a heroic witness had tried to perform CPR. Leanna and Joe been inseparable since their first meeting in 2013 and became engaged on Christmas Day when the 30-year-old proposed in their living room. The tragedy unfolded in the village of Drybrook in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, just after midnight on Sunday.  Leanne has paid tribute to the “love of her life” who can never be replaced. “I loved him so, so much, my world will never be the same again,” she told Gloucestershire Live . As well as Leanne, Joe leaves behind their son Jai Jai, who will be two in July. His grieving fiancee said: “I’m not the only one, everybody loved Joe. He was an amazing dad and all the kids loved him because he was a big kid himself. “Everybody warmed to him because he was always helping people out and he made friends wherever he went. “He wasn’t one of those men who are too scared to show his feelings. When Joe loved you, you knew it. He was really soppy. “He loved us and he loved his family to bits. I still can’t believe he’s gone.” Joe had bought the motorbike online on Saturday because the general handyman and labourer was due to start a new job making glamping pods after the bank holiday weekend.  He was excited about the bike but was having problems starting it so took it for a late night test run around the village on Saturday night. When he didn’t come home, Leanne and teenage daughter Taylor went for a walk to see if he had broken down and came across the scene of the accident. As paramedics battled to save him for about an hour, a devastated local woman who had given Joe mouth to mouth until the 999 crews arrived spoke to Leanne, but she could not take in what was being said. “Never in your wildest dreams do you think something so awful could happen,” she said. “I could see the blue flashing lights and I was thinking broken bones and working out what to do because I thought I’d be sitting in A\u0026ampE for hours. “People were talking to me but nothing was going in. I just went numb and went back to wait. Then somebody from the police knocked on the door to say he had gone. Even now I can’t believe it.  “I like to think he was smiling. He hadn’t had a bike for years and was so excited to get one he could not stop smiling all day. “I didn’t want him to go out that night but he was so excited, he wanted to ride it.” Joe was born and brought up in a close-knit loving Mormon family to a school secretary mother. He also leaves a stepfather Jeff and siblings Beth, Nathan, Zac and Matt, who is currently working in New Zealand. The keen sportsman played rugby for the school and Gloucester All Blues RFC. “His mum says he was a cheeky little tyke at school and he grew up to be a cheeky, cheeky man, but he was our cheeky man,” she said. The couple met when Leanne saw an image on social media and commented that his son Tyler, who lives with his “lovely” mother in and stays with the couple weekends, and her daughter Taylor had the same blanket. After a week talking non-stop, nonsense to each other for hours at a time Leanne caught a bus to Gloucester to meet him. It was love at first sight for both of them and they have been together ever since.

A tribunal review today called a Restricted Parking Zone (RPZ) in Coventry city centre unenforceable and added that its signs were confusing. The Traffic Penalty Tribunal ruling upheld six cases but the decision could land the authority with a heavy bill if it impacts the tens of thousands of drivers fined since the zone was set up. Between October 2012 and August 2017 58,536 fines were dished out - equal to about 30 tickets a day.  If all of those drivers fined decide to appeal to the Traffic Penalty Tribunal, and have their appeal upheld the council could be looking at forking out millions of pounds to make things right. If all of the drivers had paid the higher rate of \u0026pound70, the council\u0027s bill could be upwards of four million (\u0026pound4,097,520). Coventry City Council strongly opposes the decision and said it is taking legal advice on a possible challenge. Chief Adjudicator Caroline Sheppard OBE said the information about parking could be easily missed as some of the gateway signs had been placed in unusual locations and also close to signs warning about a change of speed limit. She also said there hardly any repeater signs present during her visit to the city and none in some of the streets where fines had been complained about. She said it would be particularly confusing for visitors coming to the university and those attending tourist attractions in the city centre, she added.

Gary ran to her and tried three times to resuscitate her. He said: “We were walking back to the hotel room and Wendy was slightly behind me when she fell. “As there was no wall or railings, she plummeted onto the concrete below. “She was initially unconscious and I performed CPR before she was taken to La Palma Hospital and placed in an induced coma. “To see her in such a condition was just awful and I have still not come to terms with the whole incident.” "},{"url":null,"title":"party animal young mum left","story":"News\u0027Party animal\u0027 young mum left unable to cook, clean or wash by disease some doctors don\u0027t believe is realChantelle Parry, 31, was an adrenaline who used to love skydives - but now she has to rely on others to look after her daughter, cook for her, clean her house and even wash her hair\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByJames Rodger23:47, 8 MAY 2018NewsChantelle with her eight-year-old daughter Alice (Image: https://www.birminghammail/ WS)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA young mum who described herself as a party animal adrenaline junkie was left unable to cook, clean or wash herself by a disease that some doctors don\u0027t think is real. Chantelle Parry, 31, fell ill with glandular fever two years ago.  This set in motion a downward spiral that eventually led her to be diagnosed with myalgic encephalomyelitis, also known as ME or chronic fatigue syndrome.  The super-fit party animal loved to dance as much as she loved going out at weekends. Now the mum to eight-year-old Alice can only dream about dancing.  I was an adrenaline junkie who had done three skydives - now I can\u0027t work, spend weeks in bed and am unable to do anything,” she told Birmingham Live .   I have to rely on others to look after my daughter, cook for me, clean my house and even washing my hair. I feel like I have lost my independence and have nowhere to turn to. Chantelle later found out she had ME. She says even bright lights can put her back in bed and one of the most upsetting things about ME is being forced to justify her disability. She said: I almost feel like I spend my life trying to explain my illness to people. I always get the response \u0027oh that\u0027s where you are tired, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 But it\u0027s so much more than tiredness - it\u0027s fatigue with the worst pain imaginable - and I\u0027ve had a baby. The most important recognisable symptoms are are: exhaustion not relieved by rest, exercise-induced muscle fatigue, post-exertional malaise/symptom exacerbation, problems with short term memory, concentration, attention span, unrefreshing sleep, problems with pulse and blood pressure control leading to feeling faint and orthostatic intolerance.  On going flu-like symptoms including sore throats and enlarged glands can also occure.  Other common symptoms include: pain - which can involve muscle, joints and nerves, alcohol intolerance, problems with balance and temperature control, sensitivity to light and sound.  It\u0027s not known what causes ME, but there are a number of theories - for example, it may be triggered by an infection, or certain factors could make you more likely to develop the illness. Suggested causes or triggers for ME include viral infections, such as glandular fever bacterial infections, such as pneumonia problems with the immune system a hormone imbalance your genes - ME seems to be more common in some families.  ME is a fluctuating condition - meaning that the symptoms vary throughout the day and from day to day and week to week. ME is diagnosed on the typical clinical history and excluding other causes of an ME/CFS like illness. There are no blood or other diagnostic tests available. The most important aspect of treatment involves activity management - which involves striking the right balance between activity and rest. This is known as pacing. Drugs can be used to help with symptoms such as pain and sleep disturbance. There is no form of curative treatment at present - although several drugs are being assessed in clinical trials."},{"url":null,"title":"she came flying out like","story":"NewsWoman blinded in one eye after \u0027being repeatedly hit with HAMMER\u0027 by \u0027psycho\u0027 beautician while looking for boyfriendThe victim was struck \"right in the eyeball\" after Samantha Goldring came \u0027flying out of her house like a psycho,\u0027 a court was told\u0026nbspShareByAshleigh Mcdonald07:54, 9 MAY 2018Updated08:19, 9 MAY 2018NewsSamantha Goldring who went on trial yesterday afternoon at Belfast Crown Court (Image: Photopress Belfast)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA woman who has been left blind in one eye after an alleged hammer attack told a court it\u0027s ruined my life. The victim - who has not been named - was struck right in the eyeball after another woman came \u0027flying out of her house like a psycho,\u0027 a court heard yesterday. The jury was told how she became involved in a fight with Samantha Goldring after going round to her house to look for her boyfriend. The woman was giving evidence at Belfast Crown Court, where her alleged attacker is standing trial on three charges arising out of the incident which occurred in the Woodvale area of the city last April. Samantha Goldring, 36, from Newtownabbey, has denied the charges - which include causing the other woman grievous bodily harm with intent and possessing an offensive weapon with intent - and claims she was acting in self defence. The injured woman, who is from Belfast, was questioned about events on the evening of Saturday, April 8 last year which resulted in her losing all her sight in her left eye. The court heard this damaged eye is being replaced with an artificial one, Belfast Live reports. When asked how the incident had left her feeling, the injured woman said: Well, being a girl and it being on your face, especially with your woman (Goldring) supposed to be a beautician... just a girl doing that to another girl then having to go through all this after it this whole year, it\u0027s ruined my life over the head of it.

The injured woman claimed that after she smashed the window, Goldring came running out of the house and struck her several times in the face and head with a hammer.

Apart from London cab drivers no one had heard of - or cared about - this dark and damp tube of brick and tiles. All that changed on May Bank holiday weekend in 2008 when the graffiti artist Banksy showed up with an exhibition he called the Cans Festival (yes that\u0027s spray cans not Cannes in the South of France - get it?) A week beforehand the mysterious artist sent a message out to a select group of about 40 like minded \u0027street artists\u0027 from around the world - they needed to be in London to help Banksy and no one was going to turn down an invite from the biggest name in graffitti.  2008 was a big year for London and the world. The iPhone had just been launched - most people were still calling on fat Nokias or even using landlines. While Facebook and Twitter existed user numbers were tiny and Instagram was still two years away. Come September 2008 global stock markets would crash and banks would need billions of our money to bail them out.  As Banksy sent his call to arms Mercy by Duffy was number one in the charts. London had been suffering a knife crime epidemic, the Chinese government had been suppressing democracy protests in Tibet and and Prime Minister Gordon Brown had just seen his Labour Party hammered in the local elections by a Tory party run by David Cameron . His fellow Tory Boris Johnson was hatching a plan to become London Mayor. On 24 April Leake Street was boarded up with a sign warning people to keep out as it was \u0027closed for essential maintenance work\u0027. No one would have suspected the mega-star spray painter was behind the hoardings with a group of fellow artists creating soon-to-be famous, albeit temporary, works of art.  One of those on Banksy\u0027s invite list was Charles Uzzell-Edwards who paints under the name \u0027Pure Evil\u0027. He explained: No one knew what it was but it was coming from Banksy and it was going to be big. Then we got the call to meet at a hotel and everyone was brought into a conference room where we were shown plans of Leake Street and how they planned it would look - everyone was allocated a bit of wall to work on. I went back to my studio to pick up my paint and stencils and before I knew it I was painting with Banksy working a few yards behind me.  It was an extraordinary moment - many great artists from all over the world had come together, looking back I guess it was a seminal moment, whatever that means.  There were the guys from Massive Attack (Robert Del Naja), Blek le Rat, these were huge names and everyone worked through the night - the opening party was quite something.  As Uzzell-Edwards hints at this wasn\u0027t a bunch of kids showing up to make a mess of some walls - this was planned and with permission of the tunnel\u0027s owners, hotel rooms had been booked, security was in place and of course a few words were released to the press the day before it was opened to the public to tempt them in. Banksy said: Graffiti doesn\u0027t always spoil buildings, in fact it\u0027s the only way to improve a lot of them. In a few hours with a couple of hundred cans of paint, I\u0027m hoping we can transform a dark, dirty, neglected hell hole into an oasis of beautiful art.  I\u0027ve always felt anyone with a paint can should have as much say in how our cities look as architects and ad men.  So getting to cover an entire street with graffiti is a dream come true, or as some people might call it — a complete and utter nightmare.  As well as well established artists, Banksy picked a few unknowns to come along - among them was a young Portuguese artist called Alexandre Farto who paints under the tag Vhils. He was living in South London at the time and getting invited to the Cans was a big moment for him - not least he was given a bit of wall to work on right next to where Banksy was making his \u0027Cave Painting\u0027.  As Uzzell-Edwards explained: He pitched up with a jack hammer and a scary expression on his face and everyone was amazed by what he did - no one had seen him before.  A picture of Vhils \u0027Chisel Face\u0027 made the front Page of The Times on the Saturday of the Cans festival. Since then he\u0027s travelled the world carving faces in to walls and his latest collaboration was with the man behind the famous Obama \u0027Hope\u0027 election campaign poster Shepard Fairey.  Come 10am on the Saturday morning, with the festival well promoted in the press, thousands turned up with huge queues to get in.  It really did have a festival feel about it - there were bizarre moments too - Jason Donovan showed up on a moped to have a look around.  At the end of the tunnel an area of \u0027free wall\u0027 was left so anyone with a spray can and some stencils could make their mark. Within days the free wall was covered and most of the art works by the big names had been \u0027improved\u0027 by passers by - it\u0027s what Banksy wanted.  People always like to speculate on Banksy\u0027s identity - is he an individual or a group of people cleverly marketing a movement?

The Hollywood starlet, 36, best known for her role in hit series Suits, has wowed the world while accompanying husband-to-be Prince Harry at events across the globe. And since their engagement last November, excitement about the royal wedding has rocketed, with the world waiting for any hint of what their big day will hold. Meghan has already given up her acting career as she prepares to become an official royal, undertaking royal duties and charity work as a full-time job. But while her life has taken a dramatic aristocratic turn, the brunette-haired beauty has far more humble roots than Prince Harry.  The actress was born to Thomas Markle Snr and Doria Ragland in 1981, who divorced in 1987 - around 10 years after first meeting. Meghan has two half siblings, Samantha and Thomas Jnr, who are the children of Thomas Snr from his first marriage to Roslyn Loveless. While Meghan\u0027s parents will attend the wedding together and her father will walk her down the aisle, her frosty relationship with her half-siblings mean they will not feature in her big day. Here, we\u0027ve taken a closer look at who Meghan Markle\u0027s family are. Meghan\u0027s mum, age-defying yoga teacher Doria Ragland  Meghan has previously gushed about her \u0027free spirit\u0027 yoga instructor mum, Doria Ragland, who lives in Los Angeles and rocks dreadlocks and a nose ring. We first got a glimpse of Doria at the Invictus Games last October. After 17 months of keeping a low profile while dating, Harry and Meghan stepped out together for their first properly public display of affection - and she brought her mum along. Meghan\u0027s mum is in her early 60s, but her youthful complexion makes her look more like a sister than a mother to Markle. Born in 1956, Doria later became a social worker and yoga instructor in California, and the latter might give us a clue as to how she\u0027s stayed looking more like her daughter\u0027s sister. She gave birth to daughter Meghan in August 1981 and divorced her father Thomas Snr when Meghan was six. The 61-year-old will be playing an important part in the royal wedding, accompanying Meghan in the bridal car on her way to the ceremony at St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor Castle. Thomas Markle Snr, the reclusive dad who\u0027ll walk her down the aisle   For months the world eagerly awaited news of whether Meghan\u0027s father would walk her down the aisle. And two weeks ago, it was confirmed the 73-year-old former lighting director would be carrying out this traditional fatherly duty at his daughter\u0027s wedding. He met Meghan\u0027s mum in the late 1970s as a divorcee after separating from his first wife Roslyn Loveless. Thomas Snr already had two children with his first wife, Samantha and Thomas Jnr. Like his actress daughter, Thomas Markle Snr also worked in the world of film, winning awards for his lighting direction. He worked on iconic American shows including Married with Children and General Hospital. In 2011, he won a Daytime Emmy Award for his Outstanding Achievement in Lighting Direction for a Drama Series for his work on General Hospital.  After his career in Hollywood came to an end, he moved to Mexico where he reportedly lives a reclusive lifestyle near Rosarito Beach - according to neighbours. He moved to his new home from LA after declaring himself bankrupt in California with credit card debts of \u0026pound24,180. When Meghan was a child, her father won \u0026pound560,000 in the lottery enabling him to provide her with a great education, according to Thomas Jnr. Thomas Snr will meet the Queen in the days before the wedding, Kensington Palace confirmed. He will spend time with Her Majesty, as well as Prince Philip, Prince Charles, Camilla and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. This meeting of the Royals will also mark the first time he will have met his future son-in-law Harry. Meghan\u0027s bitter brother Thomas Markle Jnr  Thomas Markle Jnr shares his moniker with his father, Thomas Snr. He was 14 when Meghan was born after his father met Doria Ragland in the late 1970s. Thomas Jnr then grew up in the same household as his father, sister Samantha, step-mother Doria and half sister Meghan. Now living in Oregon, the window fitter is married to Darlene Blout and has two sons of his own. While the world will watch his father walk Meghan down the aisle on May 19, Thomas Jnr will not attend the Royal wedding. The 51-year-old has reportedly battled alcohol issues in the past and was arrested in 2017 for threatening his wife with a gun. Thomas exclusively spoke to the Daily Mirror about the frosty relationship with Meghan. He said he was left \u0027deeply hurt\u0027 by the royal wedding snub and that fame had changed the American actress. Thomas Jnr said: She’s clearly forgotten her roots. It’s torn my entire family apart. He added: Meg likes to portray herself as a humanitarian, a people’s person and a charitable person but she is none of those things to her family. She is giving the greatest \u0026shyperformance of her life. She is acting phoney. Once she got into Hollywood she turned into a different person.  Samantha Grant, 53, lives in Florida and has three children. During Meghan Markle\u0027s early years, she grew up in the same household, alongside their brother Thomas, father Thomas Snr and her step-mother Doria. Like her brother, Samantha also shares a rocky relationship with Meghan and will not feature in the much-anticipated royal wedding. Samantha has been vocal with her damning opinions of Meghan and her upcoming marriage to Prince Harry. In 2016, the writer and counselor said Meghan\u0027s behaviour was not befitting of a Royal family member after their romance became public. She has also shamelessly admitted her plans to write a reveal-all book about growing up with Meghan.  The book is expected to be called A Tale of Two Sisters, when it is published at a date yet to be revealed. In January, Samantha told the Mirror she had not spoken to Meghan in three years. Despite this, she was eager to receive a Royal wedding invitation, saying It\u0027d be very special to see our father walk Meghan down the aisle on this historic day. Harry, 33, and Meghan, 36, have invited 600 people to their wedding and a lunch hosted by the Queen in St George’s Hall, Windsor Castle. Some 200 will remain for a private evening party at Frogmore House in the castle grounds hosted by Prince Charles.

If you have a regular car licence you are restricted on what you can tow and an extra test is needed before you can get out on the road with a heavy trailer or caravan. The DVLA state that anyone issued with a regular Category B (car) licence after January 1, 1997 can tow a trailer that weighs up to 750kg, as long as their car has a maximum authorised mass of no more than 3,500kg, or a trailer over 750kg, where the combined weight of the trailer and towing vehicle is no more than 3,500kg. Maximum authorised mass means the total weight of a vehicle including its maximum load with the measurement found in the owner\u0027s manual for your car.  If you break these conditions you could face a \u0026pound1,000 fine and three penalty points. The average weight of a normal car is roughly 2,000kg, not including its loaded weight. This means motorists don\u0027t have much room to move up to anything larger than a loaded trailer. And while it doesn\u0027t rule out all caravans, larger ones would push the combined weight with the vehicle above 3,500kg, leaving the driver at risk of a fine. Drivers that wish to tow heavy trailers or caravans need to apply for an additional B+E condition on their licence, which involves taking another test. Those motorists who passed their test before 1997 already had this condition on their licence, which means they can usually drive a trailer and vehicle combination up to 8,250kg.  The RAC has a guide to help motorists work out their towing capacity .

The dog looks lifeless and it is not known if it survived the ordeal. Local media reported that the incident has been reported to police, who have started an investigation, after incensed locals gathered outside the town\u0027s police station. The video was taken by stunned occupants of a minibus driving along the same Route 81 near Ibarreta, northern Argentina.

The motorcyclist slows down and tells him the punishment is so he learns to return home.

Now, though, we will fancy our chances going back to Tannadice.”And Fraser believes the United playing surface will give them an added advantage in the second leg.“It was a typical play-off. There’s a lot of pressure on teams in these situations and you know winning or losing can come down to small margins, so it was all a bit frantic at times.“We were trying to get our game going on a pitch that wasn’t great, so that was difficult and it suited them to put the ball in behind and run.“Tannadice should suit us better because our surface there is good and we can pass the ball. We’ll water the pitch and that will suit us when we get the ball down and try to pass it out from the back.”He’s also in no doubt knowledge gained from previous play-offs also has to give them an edge.“We do have a few boys who were in the play-offs last year with us or have played in them for other teams in the past and that helps. We know what to expect and how to handle it.“Last year at this stage we went down to Morton and got a good result, then came back to Tannadice and won well and we’ll be looking to do the same again tonight.“We’ve also got a lot of experienced boys like Scott McDonald, Bilel Mohsni and Willo Flood and they’re all a big help.”After his long injury lay-off because of well-documented problems with a broken foot, starting two games in three days will be a challenge, but he reckons he’s back to 100% fitness.“I’ve been working hard on it over the past couple of weeks and I was happy with the way I got through the 90 minutes on Tuesday.“We had the wee break last week in terms of no midweek game for a change and that meant I was able to put in some good work in training.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish football pays tribute to legendary dundee football writer ron scott","story":"\t\t\t\t\tScottish football has paid tribute to a respected and popular Dundee sports writer  who has died after a short illness.Ron Scott, a former chief football writer at the Sunday Post passed away in Ninewells Hospital on Sunday.

But it’s also about building up trust with people who may not have anyone to help them.”The Fintry support cafe will start on May 16 and will be held at the Finmill Centre from noon-2pm.The other will take place at Kirkton Community Centre, starting on May 24, from 1-3pm.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5af182045d186-e1525792993972.jpg ","title":"tattoo artist to make her mark on tv show","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Dundee woman is set to become a permanent fixture on the box after inking a deal to become a tattoo artist on a hit TV show.Hue Nguyen, who owns Hue, Tattoo \u0026amp Art on South Tay Street, has been tattooing in the city for nearly 10 years, becoming one of the city’s best known artists.Now she is on course to become a household name around the country after being signed up as a resident tattooist on MTV’s Just Tattoo of Us.The reality TV programme puts relationships to the test by asking pairs of friends, family members and couples to design tattoos for each other.Filming has already taken place for the show — formerly hosted by Ex on the Beach’s Stephen Bear and Geordie Shore’s Charlotte Crosby — which is gearing up for its third season and will be presented by reality TV star Scotty T.Hue said: “It is surreal.“It is just a really amazing thing that has happened — I am so pleased and grateful to be given this opportunity.“The best thing about the show is it is all 100% — everything you see is what is going on.“Having watched a lot of other reality TV shows, in particular tattoo shows, I know a lot of them can be quite fake.“This one is totally genuine and I think people will appreciate that and be able to enjoy it more.“Everyone is amazing and just having a laugh and being genuine.“All the other artists are amazing — being around all these other really talented artists and just being part of everything has been the best experience.“It is a hard day when you are filming. You can be tattooing for 10 hours but it was an amazing experience.” Hue, who was previously a performance artist said she has appeared in pop videos and did some advertising — but the latest venture is something new.She added: “I have always wanted to be an artist — but it is quite hard to make a living as one.“I started tattooing in Dundee but it wasn’t the way I wanted to go in the industry.“So I just travelled around the world and learned from artists I respected and admired, getting tattooed from them.“Just learning from them — that is really how I got to where I am now.”Despite her recent successes, Hue is keeping her feet on the ground.She added: “I just want to tattoo for as long as I can and just keep on loving what I do.“If anything else comes along then that is great but tattooing is my main ambition.”Hue said she thinks locals will love the “crazy” show.She said: “You just wouldn’t believe some of the things that happened — it was such a crazy, funny time.“I don’t think people would even believe me if I told them but take my word for it — it is crazy”.Just Tattoo of Us series three premieres on May 21 at 10pm, on MTV.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/03/peRTH-AUCTIONEER-FIRE-2-4-846x564.jpg ","title":"tayside auctioneer rises from the ashes with temporary new home","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Tayside auctioneer is delighted to see his business rise “phoenix-like” from the ashes just eight weeks after it went up in flames.Iain M Smith Auctioneers has held its first auction at temporary premises at Perth Airport, following the blaze at Perth Aerodrome, Scone, on March 9.Emergency crews rushed to the scene around 12.20am and it took firefighters five hours to contain the blaze, which gutted the premises.Mr Smith said the first auction had more than 1,000 lots and about 150 buyers had registered.He said there had been “a lot of interest” in the event and the atmosphere at their temporary premises was “buzzing”.The 54-year-old is still coming to terms with the fact vandals deliberately set fire to his business hours before an auction was due to be held. Detectives have been scanning CCTV images in a bid to track down the criminals involved.A police spokesman said inquiries are continuing.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/ohara-collage-940x564.jpg ","title":"toothless mark ohara epitomises dundees spirit says boss mccann","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee manager Neil McCann praised midfielder Mark O’Hara after he went off at half-time in their 1-0 win over Hamilton missing his two front teeth.The 22-year-old felt the full force of an aerial collision with Accies’ Danny Redmond after 10 minutes but powered through to complete the first 45.He was replaced by Lewis Spence at the break after Kevin Holt had given the Dark Blues a 1-0 first-half lead with a powerful strike.Elliott Parish saved an 86th-minute Dougie Imrie penalty to secure the three points and all-but guarantee Premiership safety for another season.It was a collective effort which saw the Dee over the line but Neil took the time to single out O’Hara for his battling performance in the team display.“He was immense on Saturday but I have to compliment the whole team, they pulled together,” he said.“He’s not looking too bonnie and he’s not speaking too well either, he’s lost his two front teeth.“I think the groundsman found one of them, not sure if he’s got his second one yet but I thought it was a heroic performance to make it through 45 minutes because his face wasn’t great.“The big fella dug in because there were a few headers where I didn’t think he would fancy it but he did.“He was feeling a bit light-headed at half-time so we had to change him but I’m hoping that we can get him to a dentist and get him sorted out.“He’s a bit sore and was just one of the heroes on Saturday in what was a big performance.”Going into tomorrow’s contest with Ross County in Dingwall, Dundee cannot be automatically relegated as they sit eight points clear of their Highland rivals. However, they are not mathematically safe from falling into the play-off spot which Partick Thistle currently occupy.The Dee host Thistle in the last game of the season and are currently six ahead with a better goal difference – meaning they are practically safe. However, Neil is not taking anything for granted.He added: “Clearly we’re safe from the automatic spot but there’s still work to be done. We’ve put ourselves in a really good position.“You can’t be too complacent, you can’t take anything for granted.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"win like the new dundee shirt here is how you can get it for free","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee this week unveiled their sharp new home kit for 2018/19 – and the Tele has teamed up with the Dark Blues to give a free shirt away to one lucky winner.The hooped dark blue Puma kit was launched with the help of 50 young Dees at Dens Park on Thursday ahead of the strip going on sale on Friday.An adult shirt would cost £45 for an adult or £35 for children and £37 for a full infant kit.Answer the following question correctly, though, and you’ll get yours for free.So, thinking caps on, here it is:\t\t\t"}]
